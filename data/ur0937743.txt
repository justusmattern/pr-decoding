WHITEOUT (2009) * Kate Beckinsale, Gabriel Macht, Tom Skerritt, Columbus Short, Alex O' Loughlin. Laughably ludicrous and inept action thriller set at Antarctica where a killer is on the loose and it's up to US Marshal Beckinsale (arguably the dumbest federal agent ever committed to celluloid) to find out who it is before things get way out of hand. Based on a graphic novel by Greg Rucka and Steve Lieber, 4 scribes' lame attempt to transition to the big screen is a true disservice to fanboys and filmgoers alike. One of the most boring suspense films in recent memory and Dominic Sena's leaden direction (particularly in the titular climax) should have him hand in his DGA card.
THE FOUNTAIN (2006) *** Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz, Ellen Burstyn, Mark Margolis, Stephen McHattie, Fernando Hernandez, Cliff Curtis, Sean Patrick Thomas, Donna Murphy, Ethan Suplee. Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's labor of love finally comes to fruition in this trippy Kubrickian fable of timeless love between eternal lovers Jackman and Weisz (each portraying three versions of one character) linked in the theme of discovering a cure for death and the pursuit of the mythical Fountain of Youth/Tree of Life. Told with unrequited brio and consummate technical skill - kudos to long-time collaborative cinematographer Matthew Libatique's wonderful photography, Jay Rabinowitz's sharp editing , exquisite production design by James Chinlund and the ethereally haunting score by Clint Mansell - the loginess does mire in bits but it is the everlasting triumph of the human spirit that underscores the theme of desire, faith and again, love that really shines in this blend of romance, sci-fi, fantasy and drama.
SEEKING JUSTICE (2012) **1/2 Nicolas Cage, January Jones, Guy Pearce, Harold Perrinneau, Jennifer Carpenter, Xander Berkeley. When his beautiful wife is brutally attacked and raped, mild-mannered high school literature teacher Cage (in a surprisingly tic-free turn) finds himself unwittingly mixed up with a vigilante cabal spear-headed by mystery man Pearce (snakily good) and O.Henry/Shakespearean overtones be damned, attempts to gain some wiggle room by uncovering a larger conspiracy. Directed with lean precision by veteran Roger Donaldson and a decent enough screenplay by Todd Hickey & Robert Tannen the film careens from wrong-man-at-the-right-time potboiler to freefall action thriller (some nice set pieces including a busy freeway and a dilapidated shopping mall all in seam New Orleans for local flava) ultimately runs on vapors in its jerry-built third act, but Cage makes in engaging to say the least.
NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1990) *** Tony Todd, Patricia Tallman, Tom Towles, McKee Anderson, William Butler, Katie Finneran, Bill Moseley, Heather Mazur. Make-up wiz Tom Savini's big-screen directorial debut is a a doozy: a remake of the seminal zombie horror classic for a contemporary day audience doesn't disappoint with more than enough tension, terror and violence. Teaming up with frequent collaborator - and the original's creator/director - George A. Romero (who also does a better turn with the screenplay), the film echoes its counterpart nicely yet layers on the dread. While Todd does a comparatively equal (if not better and tougher) job as the Duane Jones hero, Tallman is a bit off for the most part (a bit stiff and then suddenly gung-ho makes an uneasy transition) while Towles is perfectly cast as the obnoxious loud- mouth whose negativity is only second to the slow-moving corpses taking a stranglehold on their holed-up farmhouse sanctuary. The original is the bellwether curve for modern-day horror and this well-produced homage is just as good.
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (1930) **** The first - and some say best - war film (and film about war - there is a difference) is still the gold standard for showing the perilous hell men face in war with this character-heavy look at the after-effects of a group of gung-ho students who are goaded into enlisting to fight for the fatherland - Germany - without question and tragically paying for it with literally their lives. Based on German writer Erich Maria Ramarque's novel - with six credited screenwriters including future filmmaker George Abbott - and an uncredited Lewis Milestone - the film's director - and winner of Best Director and Best Picture among its four including the aforementioned screenplay adaptation and the beautifully shot cinematography by Arthur Edeson. With a star-making performance of freshly scrubbed, boy- next-door charm and idealism-dashed chutzpah by Lew Ayres as the green recruit whose loss of innocence still stings while his mentor and world-weary mentor Louis Wolheim - terrific - in fact both should've been nominated for their acting - acts as the voice of reason (and doom). For the film vaults: the chilling battle amongst a decrepit graveyard and the penultimate image of beauty being literally destroyed as a shocking symbol of innocence truly crushed. One of the most important anti-war films ever; a must see for every serious film-goer.
SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012) **** Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, Chris Tucker, John Ortiz, Julia Stiles, Dash Mihok, Anupam Kher, Brea Bee. Cooper gives a superlative career high best turn as a recently released mental patient whose near-breakdown spurs him to come up with a 'game plan' to get his estranged, unfaithful wife (Bee) back and re-enforcing his family ties with his bettor father (De Niro, in a comeback return to form) and loving mother (wonderful Weaver) with one major new element to his tenacious life - the younger sister-in-law (an incredible Lawrence) of his supportive friend (Ortiz) , whose own unsteadiness remains to be balanced. Heartbreaking at times this best realized account of mental health pic cum life affirming dramedy is the best of its kind since ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST which doesn't coddle or push away its underpinnings for self-help and self-discovery. Thanks to impressively focused acting (Cooper should seriously get an Oscar nod as well as the aforementioned leads), a somewhat loosey-goosey direction by David O. Russell (who adapted loosely form Matthew Quick's novel) and emotional clarity that has been neglected for some time from the medium of film. The give- and-take friendship/relationship between the laser-beam intensity of Cooper and the wild- card desperation-bubbling-under-the-surface of scary/good Lawrence is truly worth the price of admission. One of the year's best films. Period.
THE HAUNTING OF MOLLY HARTLEY (2008) * Haley Bennett, Jake Weber, Chace Crawford, Shannon Marie Woodward, Shanna Collins, AnnaLynne McCord, Marin Hinkle, Nina Siemaszko. Laughable occult thriller with echoes of "Carrie" and "The Omen" about a teen girl (Bennett) who begins to realize she may be a satanic presence as she attempts to fit in her new high school. The young cast is pretty lame overall despite a relatively plucky Bennett as the titular character. Large gaping holes in the story are only the least of this film's troubles (the opening teaser for example is never explained and the 'boo' factor of having birds suddenly thrust into view is cheap) ; the other being largely not scary in the least! (Dir: John Travis)
FRANKENWEENIE (2012) *** (VOICES OF: Charlie Tahan, Catherine O'Hara, Martin Short, Martin Landau, Atticus Shaffer, Robert Capron, Conchata Ferrell, James Hiroyuki Liao, Tom Kenny) Tim Burton remakes his live-action short into an animated feature valentine to his beloved Universal monsters with young Victor Frankenstein (Tahan) resurrecting his recently deceased pet pooch Sparky and causing a ruckus in the midst of his middle-class neighborhood. Fantastically beautiful black and white cinematography by Peter Sorg and a lively score by long-time collaborator Danny Elfman keeps things in the spirit of the mood of the genre with equally keen stop-motion-animation ala Rankin-Bass. Spooky fun for the entire family.
THE KITE RUNNER (2007) ***1/2 Khalid Abdalla, Atossa Leoni, Homayoun Ershadi Zekeria Ebrahimi, Shaun Toub, Sayed Jafar Masihullah Gharibzada, Nabi Tanha. Absorbing and heartrending tale about two Afghani friends' lives and the affects of their painful secret continues to resonate years later after a lengthy separation brings a sort of homecoming with truly emotional weight. David Benioff tackles the novel by Khaled Hosseini and does an expert job in bringing the characters to life  especially Ershadi, my pick for one of cinema's finest fathers; his bold, proud and endearing Baba is truly a portrait in courage and displays all the virtues of what it means to be a man  and filmmaker Marc Forster bridges the cultural gap with giant strides.
LET ME IN (2010) **** Chloe Moretz, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Richard Jenkins, Cara Buono, Elias Koteas, Dylan Minnette. Eerie and excellent Hollywood remake to the Swedish import vampire film "Let The Right One In" scores on all points particularly the smart casting of Smit-McPhee and Moretz (both stars on the rise, justly so) as (respectively) a put-upon tween whose life changes in more ways than one when his new neighbor, a pale barefoot girl, moves in his apartment complex with her dubious guardian (Jenkins in fine low-key form), resulting in a sinister yet romantic kinship. Director Matt Reeves builds up enough suspense, tension and lets the blood flow copiously with élan in this, the finest vampire film since Kathryn Bigelow's "NEAR DARK". The poignant puppy-love story and dark underpinnings of the undead and the living attempting to bond is both heart breaking and fear inducing. One of the year's best films (NOTE: Although I didn't see the original foreign film I'm sure it's a worthy adaptation).
3:10 TO YUMA (2007) ***1/2 Russell Crowe, Christian Bale, Logan Lerman, Dallas Roberts, Ben Foster, Peter Fonda, Vinessa Shaw, Alan Tudyk, Gretchen Mol, Benjamin Petry, (cameo: Luke Wilson). Rip-roaring throwback oater remake of the 1957 western with Crowe perfectly cast as dastardly villain Ben Wade whose nefarious deeds have finally caught up with him when he's captured and a small group of men led by gimpy Civil War vet c um gentleman farmer Dan Evans (Bale giving a splendid performance) are determined to bring him to the titular train departure for his justifiable hanging. Filmmaker James Mangold does a bang up job keeping the action lively and somewhat unpredictable from such a familiar storyline (kudos to the smart screenplay by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas based on the original Elmore Leonard short story) and making his two leads an unlikely source of anti- heroism at its finest. Foster is memorable as the sociopathic right-hand man of Crowe's murderous band of bandits. One of the best American westerns since "Unforgiven."
BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP (2014) ** Nicole Kidman, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Anne-Marie Duff. Well-acted but very convoluted Hitchcockian thriller of sorts with amnesiac Kidman in a tug-of-war with her emotions between her supposed husband Firth and her mysterious psychotherapist Strong as she attempts to fill in the blanks of her missing life. The direction - and adaptation of SJ Watson's novel - by Rowan Joffe is steady-as-she-goes yet at times the unraveling of the mystery involved gets jangled in its pretzel logic and GROUNDHOG DAY same-as-it-ever-was time looping in spite of the strong trifecta of actors. Moody, shifty and not terrible but ultimately forgettable.
THE WOLVERINE (2013) *** Hugh Jackman,Tao Okamato, Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, Sveltana Khondchenkova, Famke Janssen, Brian Tee, Hal Yamanouchi. Better than anticipated (and frankly unnecessary mutant vehicle) of the always watchable Logan (Jackman still delivering the anti-hero goods) AKA The Wolverine whose reluctance to be a soldier of misfortune continues this time with a seeming debt to a WWII Japanese friend who seeks more than just a reunion: the key to eternity lies within the mutant but at what price to no longer be invincible to the struggles both physically and emotionally. While Mark Bomback and Scott Frank's screenplay tends to bulge at the seams (Japanese Yakuza; the ghost of Jean Grey (the always beguiling Janssen) as an avatar of destiny) director James Mangold anchors the film in reality while still managing some finely tuned action sequences (catching the bullet train is one of the high lights) within reason.
TANGLED (2010) ***1/2 (VOICES of: Mandy Moore, Zachary Levy, Donna Murphy, Ron Perlman, M.C. Gainey, Jeffrey Tambor, Brad Garrett, Paul F. Tompkins, Richard Kiel) Wonderful Disney Fractured Fairy Tale take on "Rapunzel" with the long-suffering unbeknownst-to-be princess tonsorially challenged heroine (pluckily voiced by Moore), whose imprisonment by her wicked stepmother (gleefully malevolent Murphy) soon comes to fruition in the unlikely form of a handsome thief/rapscallion (Levy, loose and having a field day) proving there is a whole-wide world of opportunity out there (and all sorts of platitudes carefully administered). Delightful animation and design with kinetic energy thanks to the directing team of Nathan Greno & Byron Howard with a witty, fast & footloose screenplay by Dan Fogelman). The bonus attraction of 3-D only enhances the vivid imagery and painterly skills of its ingenious animating crew.
MELANCHOLIA (2011) **1/2 Kirsten Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Kiefer Sutherland, Alexander Skarsgard, Stellen Skarsgard, John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling, Udo Kier. The beginning of a marriage the end of the world, could have been the pitch for this unique hybrid of drama and sci-fi from infant terrible filmmaker Lars von Trier equal parts grating, navel-gazing and soap opera melodrama with newlywed bride Dunst (in a decent performance considering the underpinnings surrounding her) facing the eponymous in a sudden-shock-to-the-system: her mental health in question after a neverending wedding ceremony and the titular fictitious planet heading on a collision course with Earth. While the haunting beauty of the last day of the planet is beautifully shot by cinematographer Manuel Alberto Claro the fact that most of the characters are deplorable by their priggish/piggish actions barely sustains interest for their plights.
THE COUNSELOR (2013) * Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt, Bruno Ganz, Rosie Perez, Ruben Blades, Goran Visnjic, Dean Norris, (uncredited: John Leguizamo) Disappointing neo-noir from Ridley Scott and Cormac McCarthy (his first - and should be his last - original screenplay) which makes not-a-lick-of-sense about titular Fassbender (surprisingly wooden) who finds himself in over his head in a drug deal gone awry involving mysterious cowboy middleman PItt (far-too-sedate here), an obnoxious nightclub owner (Bardem relying on wild-hair and rock star accouterments instead of 'acting), and a drug cartel out for bloody vengeance. The cardinal sin of this potboiler is the first leaden hour cannot compensate for its too-quick-to-kill final one and wasting Cruz completely. While Diaz is the film's saving grace as a femme fatale with a feline complex nothing else is worthy or remarkable except how much of a dud this truly is.
WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE (2009) *** Max Records, Catherine Keener, Mark Ruffalo (voices of: James Gandolfini, Catherine O'Hara, Forest Whitaker, Chris Cooper, Lauren Ambrose, Paul Dano, Michael Berry, Jr.) Filmmaker Spike Jonze' valentine to Maurice Sendak's beloved children's classic storybook gets the big-screen treatment big-time (consider the fact the story is literally only a few hundred words!) with co-scripter Dave Eggers, allows the imagination to run wild  or better yet, "Let's the royal rumpus begin!"  in this inventive look at childhood personified in the rambunctious ball of energy known as Max (Records nailing the character in all its giddy innocence) who finds himself in another world with monsters/creatures (brilliantly realized by the good folks at Jim Henson Prods.) ,representing the various stages of being a child (i.e. shyness, boldness, selfishness, etc.) however too much of a good thing eventually peters out by the final act.
NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) **** Seminal zombie film from maverick indie great George A. Romero that changed the face of American horror films with his bare-bones documentary influenced stagings, ghoulish cinematography and genuine sense of reality based terror set in his home state of Pennsylvania setting the stage for an unknown phenomena causing the dead to rise and vanquish their never-ending hunger (!) Scary to the marrow and its cast of unknowns add a singular presence of 'hey this actually could happen'- sensibility. The fact a black man (Duane Jones) is the film's hero is no accident in the underpinings of the era's racial climate in America nor is its societal ills unblemished in all its ugliness; the true horror if you will.
BLACK Christmas (2006) **1/2 Katie Cassidy, Michelle Trachtenberg, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Lacey Chabert, Kristen Cloke, Andrea Martin, Crystal Lowe, Oliver Hudson, Robert Mann, Karin Konoval, Dean Friss, Jessica Harmon, Leela Savasta, Kathleen Kole, Cainan Wiebe, Christina Crivici, Howard Siegel, Peter Wilds. Ho-Ho-Ho Horror Redux of a Cult ClassicNot many recall the original 1974 cult classic horror film "Black Christmas" directed by Bob Clark ("A Christmas Story", "Porky's"), which featured Margot Kidder and Olivia Hussey, but the simple fact is "Halloween" as the first of its genre eclipsed the film as a holiday slasher film a few years later. The original is actually very scary and disturbing and the remake for the 21st century has its moments and wisely a few homages to its predecessor.Set in a snow bound Christmas Eve sorority row house with several of its inhabitants remaining and unknowing that the previous resident, a certified homicidal killer named Billy  who killed his family 30 years ago  has just broken out of the asylum and is making tracks for a sort of homecoming, sets the mood for this bloody good but by no means great remake with reservations.Namely the decision to give Billy a backstory. In the original the killer is never really figured out in spite of his trademark sick phone calls pranked on the nubile young women who anger him to the point of some truly nasty and twisted murders. The schizophrenic nature of the character is fleshed out to include incest and a twist that is best left unsaid, but for me I figured it out in the first few minutes of the film.Director Glen Morgan (who helmed "Final Destination") does a rather decent job with the bloodletting and heebie-jeebies, notably the use of eye imagery (the original had some trademark sequences of close-ups of the fevered maniac's eyeball peeping out of several holes) and the equally grisly come-uppances of the co-eds (who quite frankly are almost difficult to tell whose who since the majority are nubile brunettes; not necessarily a criticisms more than an annoying observation).While the chills and thrills are uneven at best the shocks come quick and deadly which is the way any genre fan will be pleased to hear. For trivia buffs Martin  who appeared in the original as a victim  returns this time as the mother hen to the sorority under siege.
SNOW ANGELS (2008) ***1/2 Sam Rockwell, Kate Beckinsale, Michael Angarano, Olivia Thirlby, Amy Sedaris, Nicky Katt, Griffin Dunne, Jeanetta Arnette, Gracie Hudson, Tom Noonan.Heartbreaking yet consuming slice of American tragedy.Based on Stewart O'Nan's novel, indie filmmaker wunderkind David Gordon Green delivers his best effort yet in this examination of the American Dream and how two relationships dovetail with heartbreaking consumption.Set in an atypical American small town in all its wintry charm, Arthur (Angarano), is a high school student who is having a difficult time with his parents' recent separation after his instructor father Don (Dunne) simply decides to leave for no real good reason and his mother Louise (Arnette) seems to not be fighting it since she can only feel rejected. Ultimately this will cause to dig deep under the surface of Arthur's angst he has kept to himself in spite of a lovely, budding relationship with cute new schoolmate Lila (Thirlby) who also sees Arthur as a wonderful being altogether and frequent subject of her creativity, photography.Meanwhile Arthur's co-worker at the local Chinese restaurant, Annie (Beckinsale)  who used to baby-sit for Arthur (who harbors an unspoken crush on her still)  is trying to get by in the aftermath of her husband Glenn's (Rockwell) suicide attempt gone awry leading to their painful separation, and their young daughter Tara (Hudson) caught in the middle.What transpires is a terrible tragedy that unites the community yet causes further chasm-like distance between Glenn's futile attempts to keep a job and his sobriety while Annie's fleeting affair with her best friend Barb's (Sedaris) husband Nate only fuels the fire that will ultimately lead to a devastating act.Green sublimely creates a tense yet believable environment for his principals and his quiet yet penetrating mood gets under the surface once the film begins to quicken its pace to its climax. The gorgeous cinematography by Tim Orr underlines the natural beauty corroded by its characters' basic instincts.The ensemble is first rate. Relative newcomer Angarano is a true natural find and his chemistry with Thirlby (last seen as the snarky sexy second banana to Ellen Page in "JUNO" ) is one of the most excellently realized depictions of contemporary American teenagers I've ever seen committed to the screen and their fragile forming love is truly hopeful and palpable.Beckinsale gives her finest performance to date making a somewhat unlikable character empathetic while Rockwell continues his journeyman-like career as the truly flawed and desperate Glenn's failure-upon-failure to restore his marriage by becoming a Born Again Christian yet losing the battle of faith with the bottle ; it is a truly shattering and brilliant performance.The film overall is easily the best I've seen so far this year and it is a shame it will likely be looked over come Oscar time; it's that good.
DAN IN REAL LIFE (2007) *** Steve Carell, Juliette Binoche, Dane Cook, Alison Pill, Brittany Robertson, Marlene Lawston, Dianne Wiest, John Mahoney, Nobert Leo Butz, Amy Ryan, Jessica Hecht, Frank Wood, Emily Blunt. Surprisingly funny and heart-warming family oriented rom/com with Carell making the transition from second banana to leading man type that only few comic actors have treaded with any success (i.e. Robin Williams, Jim Carrey, Bill Murray), with skillful flair as a recently widowed self-help news columnist who meets cute Binoche at his sprawling family's yearly get-together, with the only problem getting in the way: she has just started seeing Cook, his kid brother. Director Peter Hedges  who co- wrote the smart screenplay with Pierce Gardner  wisely lets his star  and supporting actors  take center stage in what could've been a sticky, sickly affair of the heart.
I AM LEGEND (2007) *** Will Smith, Alice Braga, Charlie Tahan, Salli Richardson, Willow Smith, (Cameo: Emma Thompson) Decent adaptation of Richard Matheson's sci-fi classic parable about the last man on earth (Smith doing yeoman work with true finesse) who is the last possible survivor when a cure for cancer unleashes a pandemic plague leaving its few remaining inhabitants as bloodthirsty ghouls. The real stars are the visual effects that reduce Manhattan into a rabble encrusted no-man's land/ghost town with eerie preamble to a lethargic last act yet still remains a jaw-dropping "How'd-they-do-that"? ethos. (Dir: Francis Lawrence)
NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM: SECRET OF THE TOMB (2014) **1/2 Ben Stiller, Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, Ricky Gervais, Dan Stevens, Rebel Wilson, Skyler Gisondo, Rami Malek, Patrick Gallagher, Mizuo Peck, Ben Kingsley, Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, Bill Cobbs, Andrea Martin, Anjali Jay (Cameos, as themselves: Alice Eve & Hugh Jackman) Third chapter in the successful family friendly fantasy franchise with Stiller reprising his put-upon night guard Larry Daley en route with the exhibits to London's own museum of natural history to save his friends' existences when the magical tablet that enlivens them has been corrupted. All the familial regulars from the previous film return as well as new additions Stevens as Sir Lancelot, Kingsley as a pharaoh and Wilson as a slacking English security guard to enliven things up as well as returning director Shawn Levy but the script by five writers only prove that the return to the well may have been one too many. Swan song for Williams as Teddy Roosevelt and one of the last screen performances by Rooney in a cameo. As usual Crystal the Monkey steals the film as the scene-stealing Dexter.
THE GHOST WRITER (2010) **** Ewan McGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Kim Cattrall, Olivia Williams, Timothy Hutton, Jim Belushi, Tom Wilkinson, Eli Wallach. First rate suspense thriller/drama adaptation of Robert Harris' novel (who collaborated with master filmmaker Roman Polanski at the top of his game here) about a reluctant titular author (McGregor making a remarkable schnook!) coerced into a big-bucks deal with his publishers to take on former UK PM Brosnan (having a grand old day) whose previous tome's scribe was found drowned on his private Long Island beach-head. This sets into motion a paranoia-soaked conspiracy involving global politics, international agendas, murder and good ol' fashioned skullduggery. The witty, arch and darkly comic screenplay is full of juice squeezing every drop of dank nuance of film noir to its sharply etched spoiler-ready sudden conclusion. A dilly of a film that must be seen twice to soak up all the chicanery at hand.
PUNISHER: WAR ZONE (2008) ** Ray Stevenson, Dominic West, Doug Hutchison, Colin Salmon, Wayne Knight, Dash Mihok, Julie Benz. Punishingly brutally over-the-top violent adaptation of the cult Marvel Comics' anti-hero this time with brooding Brit bruiser Stevenson filling Frank Castle's boots as the vengeance seeking vigilante out to stop West's "Jigsaw" from his underworld plans of importing biochemical warfare within NYC. Director Lexi Alexander does his best to keep the bloodthirsty happy with some inventive killings, maimings and general debauchery but I must admit I preferred the Thomas Jane incarnation a few years back then this empty-headed crowd-pleaser.
MAMA (2013) *** Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier, Isabelle Nelisse, Daniel Kash, Jane Moffat, Javier Botet, Morgan McGarry, Maya & Seirra Dawe, David Fox, Julia Chantrey. Relatively spooky ghost tale ala Grimm's fairy tale from executive producer Guillermo del Toro: a young couple's vein attempt to relocate his missing young nieces get more than they bargained for when the feral youths are discovered in the backwoods and the unseen titular spirit has more in store than anyone can imagine. Very well produced and based on director Andres Muschietti's short film with a beautiful production design by Anastasia Masaro and gorgeous cinematography by Antonio Riestra is underscored with a baroque score by Fernando Velazquez. The cast is uniformly excellent with a barely recognizable Chastain as the goth girlfriend/musician who rises to the challenge in raising her beau's new family; Coaster-Waldau has double duty as the girl's doomed father and caring uncle attempting to find a balance but it's the two young charges, Charpentier and Nelisse as the sweet yet scary good girls - they are the heart and soul of a film that runs the gamut of thrills and chills until ultimately a so-so end.
THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY (2013) *** Ben Stiller, Kristen Wiig, Adam Scott, Kathryn Hahn, Shirley MacLaine, Sean Penn. Remake of the classic film based on James Thurber's short story about a nebbish (Stiller, who also directs) with an overactive imagination is, this time, a photographic editor for the on-the-wane LIFE Magazine, who's job is in jeopardy leads him on a globe-trotting adventure of a lifetime. Embued with humor and gravitas of an everyman's desire to break free from his doldrums Stiller gives one of his best performances with a top-notch supporting cast and impressive eye-popping cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh. While the screenplay adaptation by Steve Conrad is admirable the overwhelming use of visual effects tends to tamper down the themes a bit (i.e. the street-fighting grudge match between Stiller and jerk- off Scott feel like outtakes from the last Spider-Man flick).
KICK-ASS 2 (2013) ** Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Chloe Grace Moretz, Jim Carrey, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Morris Chestnut, John Leguizamo, Donald Faison, Robert Emms, Lindy Booth, Clark Duke, Augustus Prew, Garrett M. Brown, Lyndsy Fonseca, Yancy Butler. Disappointing sequel to the comic book adaptation following the aftermath of the titular hero's actions with dire consequences when his rival's villainous desires for payback comes with a dour price to pay for his good intentions. While most of the original's cast is back (particularly the two leads) the film is relatively less fun and more hellbent on depicting violence for violence's sake (yes we get it that real life violence is painful; move on) with the one-note screenplay by the director Jeff Wadlow. It also didn't help having Carrey crap all over the film prior to its release for feeling the 'message' was overwrought in the wake of current real-life violent events involving teenager (but I'm sure the check cleared right, Jim?) So much for a new franchise with something to say.
MY SISTER'S KEEPER (2009) *** Abigail Breslin, Cameron Diaz, Jason Patric, Sofia Vassilieva, Evan Ellingson, Alec Baldwin, Heather Wahlquist, Thomas Dekker, David Thornton, Emily Deschanel. Well-acted tearjerker about a teenager (Vassilieva, who gives a tremendous performance) whose life-threatening leukemia has her family at odds in keeping her healthy while her younger sister (Breslin, equally good), the only chance for her sibling's survival, seeks medical emancipation from her parents (Diaz and Patric, both excellent) thru a lawsuit (Baldwin is also fine and surprisingly low-key as the appointed attorney for the girl). What follows is a touch-and-go adaptation of Jodi Picoult's novel with Jeremy Leven & filmmaker Nick Cassavetes' screenplay that is serviceable but borderline "Lifetime Movie Of the Week". The across-the-board acting saves the film from being saccharine and instead is a treatise on just what a family is about: love and sacrifice.
THE CONSPIRATOR (2011) **1/2 James McAvoy, Robin Wright, Tom Wilkinson, Kevin Kline, Danny Huston, Evan Rachel Wood, Colm Meaney, Justin Long, Norman Reedus, Toby Kebbell, Jonathan Goff, Stephen Root, Johnny Simmons, James Badge Dale. Robert Redford's heavy-handed historical drama about the assassination of Lincoln and its aftermath namely putting swift justice to appease a grieving nation in spite of its costs  with McAvoy as the reluctant defense attorney, Frederick Aiken, attempting to save his main client, Mary Surratt (a stoic Wright) from the hoosegow is for the most part rather dull and repetitive (most courtroom dramas tend to spill into melodrama such as this one) however the production design overall  particularly Newton Thomas Sigal's evocative cinematography  is first-rate with fine acting ensemble (i.e. Kline as the headstrong Edwin Stanton) that rises above the slog that is James Solomon's adaptation of Gregory Bernstein's story.
GET HIM TO THE Greek (2010) *** Jonah Hill, Russell Brand, Elisabeth Moss, Sean "P.Diddy" Combs, Rose Byrne, Colm Meaney. Frequently hilarious follow up to "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" with Brand's burnt-out rocker Aldous Snow facing a reluctant attempt at a comeback thanks to the unlikely brainchild of music executive wannabe Hill who feels a special anniversary concert at the titular L.A. venue would be beneficial to both their means, with hilarity ensuing with its road trip machinations and odd coupling thanks to a lively and comically dense script by director Nicholas Stoller with that special Apatowian blend of vulgarity and heart.
AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY (2013) ** Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Chris Cooper, Ewan McGregor, Margo Martindale, Sam Shepard, Dermot Mulroney, Julianne Nicholson, Juliette Lewis, Abigail Breslin, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mity Upham. John Wells big-screen adaptation of the hit Broadway play by Tracy Letts leaves a lot to be desired for in this dramedy about a very dysfunctional Oklahoma family with estrangements, secrets and lies, and genuine discord when reunited for the suicide of the paterfamilias (Shepard) and his angry, pill-popping, cancer- riddled widow (Streep in Oscar-bait pandering that truly makes they eyes roll). While embed with a game, blue-chip cast including Roberts in a fierce turn as the favorite daughter the film suffers in the fact that there are very few characters to care for let alone like in one-up- gamesmanship of who can be more socially repugnant. While the centerpiece family dinner sequence is the most teeth-grindingly cringe worthy of recent memory, it is Cooper's small post-lash out that is the film's best. At best an acting showcase and at worst a revered play that has you wondering just how that went.
British filmmaker Shane Meadows  who made quite an impression on me with his 2004 venture "Dead Man's Shoes"  continues to be a worthy contemporary UK wunderkind the likes of his fellow country men like Neil Jordan, Stephen Frears and Mike Leigh  depicting the lower and lower middle-class of his homeland with such keen insight, observation and expert treatise on the socioeconomic hardships that endure having the breakdown of his characters with the weight of the world on their shoulders.This time on the slender back of 12 year old Shaun (extraordinary newcomer Thomas Turgoose), a ginger-haired, fair-skinned lad who has his crosses to bear  his sad home life (his beloved soldier father has been killed in the occurring Falkland Islands skirmish forcing Shaun and his mother Cynth {Jo Hartley}  to move to the north coastal hamlet of Grimsby {where much of the film was shot on location} ) forcing him to wear hand-me-downs and the scorn of his classmates that he winds up being 'adopted' by a gang of teenaged skinheads who treat him as a mascot, and eventually as an equal, even having the boy getting his head shaved and the 'uniform' of red braced suspenders, Doc Martens and button down conservative shirts.At first his mum is simply upset with his locks being shorn  oblivious to the real threat under her nose  but her tune changes when she thanks Woody (the affable Joe Gilgun), the defacto leader of the bunch. And then things truly take a turn for the worse when their real 'leader' Combo (Stephen Graham, in an excellent tour-de-force role), the more volatile, loose cannon type who has just been sprung from a short prison stint, making his way back into his fold with a force like a hurricane.What transpires is basically a coming of age story with echoes of "Romper Stomper", "American History X", "A Clockwork Orange", "Trainspotting" and most near kin to Jordan's "The Butcher Boy"  in the shattering of innocence by violence, fear and ultimately betrayal of one's comrades-in-arms. Meadows shoots in a documentarian, static style but it is never boring and his sharp eye for metaphorical and political commentary (from the beginning's archival clips of the era to a graffiti scrawled "Maggie's A Tw*t" on a broken down building in the urban blight of their township) is like a brace of ice water. While much of the film has a feeling of dread (especially when Combo is introduced), there is a care-free, even likable air to the group of young friends that border on the tender (the ritual-like haircutting sequence) to the absurdly comic (the cherubic, short Shaun wooing ages older "Smell"  a nickname for Michelle  (Rosamund Hanson)  a lanky, punk giantess in comparison with a colorful shock of hair and make-up too boot) yet there is a very truthful air to the film and respects its characters throughout; a rare thing these days.Meadows is a filmmaker to keep tabs with and continues to surprise and more importantly entertain while educate.
MONSTERS VS. ALIENS (2009) *** (VOICES OF: Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, Kiefer Sutherland, Rainn Wilson, Stephen Colbert, Paul Rudd, Julie White, Jeffrey Tambor, Amy Poehler, Ed Helms, Renee Zellweger, John Krasinski). Amusing animated valentine (in 3-D yet!) to the classic sci-fi/horror films of the '50s and '60s featuring a gaggle of monsters led by sudden giantess Susan Murphy (plucky Witherspoon making a fine action heroine) AKA "Ginormica" enlisted by the secret cabal of the US government/military ala Area 51, to stop an alien invasion instigated by megalomaniacal space case Gallaxhar (Wilson, having a field day at his most unctuousness). Referencing everything from "ATTACK OF THE 50 FT. WOMAN" (aforementioned Susan, the giantess, whose really 49' 11"!) to "THE FLY" (Laurie's maniacal yet practical Dr. Cockroach) to "CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON" (Arnett as The Missing Link), and to "THE BLOB" (Rogen's mindless, shapeless moving mass of ectoplasm steals the film every time he's on screen), with other nods to "GODZILLA", "INDEPENDENCE DAY" and even "DR. STRANGELOVE", the film has the right tone and pace of a send-up/homage to the genres and the out-of-this-world 3-D effects blend rather seamlessly to the point you kind of take it for granted. Fun for the whole family and hopes for a MVA 2: GINORMICA'S RETURN! (DIRS: Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon)
REVOLVER (2007) ** Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore, Andre Benjamin, Terence Maynard. Filmmaker Guy Ritchie's frustratingly contrived and a tad too precious offering about a recently released convict (long time collaborator Statham in ridiculous long hair ala Rasputin) is caught between retribution for the kingpin that put him away (Liotta who seriously needs a new agent and wildly overacting) and is instead taken in by two mysterioso enforcers of revenge (Pastore and Benjamin adding a little flavor to the testosterone tinged broth). However the decision to add chess-skill mentalities, philosophical quandaries and some serious mind-f***ing it all becomes a radical headache in the process.
CATCH AND RELEASE (2007) **1/2 Jennifer Garner, Timothy Olyphant, Juliette Lewis, Kevin Smith, Sam Jaeger, Fiona Shaw, Joshua Friesen. (Dir: Susannah Grant)Jennifer is a great "catch" and the film isn't half bad either.Jennifer Garner is the ideal girl next door, beautiful in that freshly-scrubbed all- American girl type, but with a twinge of knowing naughtiness and playful fecklessness which she imbued to the nth degree in her serious ass-kicking ABC series "Alias" as a bodacious agent with pouting bee-stung lips and a lethal double-round-house to the nether regions.Her more feminine wiles on display to the hilt in this surprisingly charming romantic dramedy with her character Gray Wheeler, a young woman facing a sudden tragedy, her fiancée is killed in a horrible sporting event accident crushing her upcoming nuptials in full blossom. Instead of a wedding she now has a funeral to deal with, and in the opening sequence her pain is immediate as well as the difficulty of making sense of what to do from this point on. However all is not lost in the sense she is alone. Quite the contrary; her betrothed's fun-loving childhood friends are there to see her through including Sam (filmmaker Smith who steals the film with his smartly delivered one-liners and the ongoing running gag of the stout fellow in various modes of unkempt solvent shoving something down his endless gullet to high comic effect), who offers pearls of wisdom from the designer tea he works for; Dennis (Jaeger), the more level-headed of the trio, who harbors a not-so-secret crush on the young widow; and more significantly Fritz (Olyphant, late of the stupendous "Deadwood" on HBO), a voracious ladies' man transplanted back to their Boulder, CO environs from La-La- land where his stint as a budding filmmaker is really more of a hobby than his photography taking. All three men are in love with Grey (and can you blame them!) but each has their own philosophy in how her grief should ultimately lead to a happier existence.Along the way sorting through her dearly departed's affairs she learns he has a $1M nest egg in a seemingly secret account and discovers something more personal: his doling out monies to a woman in LA, a masseuse named Maureen (the always good-naturedly daffy Lewis) who has a 4 year old son (!) Let the melodrama commence!Written and directed by Susannah Grant (who makes her directorial debut here) does an able job overall with the usual formulaic expectations: overheard conversations misleading the truth; real-love triumphing; friendship & relationships put to the tests, etc. etc. But the cast makes it a winning diversion and a lot of fun. Great interplay between Garner as 'one- of-the-guys' and the three dudes making a fine buffet to her nubile attractiveness. There is undeniable chemistry between Garner and Olyphant (who I swear to God if you close your eyes sounds like a rakish Robert Wagner!) who effortlessly provides the sex with aplomb, and tastefully so.The only problem is how the pieces all fall into place relatively with little effort or dismay considering how her fiancée was killed and all and how they come to accept the flaky 'other woman' with barely a ruffle of feathers. Maybe that's a bit refreshing or I'm a tad too cynical (or maybe I was just hoping for a cat fight). Grant does allow some refreshing touches, namely making her characters likable yet flawed and not jerks, which so easily could've been the case in many plot points (i.e. Garner's mother-in-law-to-be has the inklings of villainy but really deep down shows she is not the heartless wench she appears when things get a little dicey). There are also equal amounts of chemistry between the trio of male friends who are all looking out for the best interests of Garner's character (as well as their own well-meaning agendas overall without being creepy or downright chauvinistic). But it truly is Garner's showcase to depict her girl-next-door sexiness not unlike America's sweetheart Julia Roberts: a gal whose femininity and sexuality are not in disposable even if she is one of the guys. The film is worth a look at to see how one can find their happiness even if it comes with little burden.
BAD LIEUTENANT: PORT OF CALL (2009) *** Nicolas Cage, Eva Mendes, Val Kilmer, Jennifer Coolidge, Fairuza Balk, Brad Dourif, Michael Shannon, Shawn Hatosy, Denzel Whitaker, Shea Whigham, Irma P. Hall, Xzibit, Tom Bower, Vondie Curtis-Hall. Kissing cousin in name only to Abel Ferrara's "BAD LIEUTENANT" provides ample scenery-to-chew for Cage in a sort of return to form/gonzo freaky-deaky tour-de-force as a New Orleans cop whose back injury leads to a downward spiral of drug addiction and other forms of debauchery while being promoted to lead a task force into the investigation of a brutal slaying of Senegalese immigrants linked to a drug kingpin. Loosey-goosey filmmaker Werner Herzog stretches the bare-bones yet serviceable script by veteran TV scribe William M. Finkelstein and lets Cage get his ya-yas out (the sole reason to see and an extra * for good measure).
BOTTLE SHOCK (2008) **1/2 Alan Rickman, Bill Pullman, Chris Pine, Rachael Taylor, Freddy Rodriguez, Dennis Farina, Eliza Duskhu, Miguel Sandoval, Bradley Whitford, Joe Regalbuto. Fairly middling comedy/drama based on the true-life accounts of how a Napa Valley vinter upset a wine-tasting contest in France circa 1976, which led to the boom in California exporting of its fine wines to the rest of the world. Rickman is fine as Steven Spurrier, a Brit ex-pat in Paris whose snooty winery acts as the sponsor for the fateful taste-testing and Pullman as the owner of the aforementioned winemaking does his best with a somewhat uneven screenplay by Jody Savin, Randall Miller (who directed with equally clumsy skills) and Ross Schwartz but is diverting none-the-less for a too good to be true to be fiction underdog tale.
RED 2 (2013) ** Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Mary-Louise Parker, Helen Mirren, Anthony Hopkins, Byung-hun Lee, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Neal McDonough, David Thewlis, Brian Cox. By- the-numbers sequel to what could've been an engaging franchise has Willis and most of the first film's cast reunited (and cashing a paycheck since most are sleep-walking thru this lackluster action/comedy) to stop a lethal weapon of mass destruction from detonating (i.e. saving the world). Too dry for its own good (no thanks to the drab screenplay by Jon & Erich Hoeber and an uneven attempt by director Dean Parisot). I don't think the third time will be the charm.
American BEAUTY (1999) Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper,Mena Suvari, Allison Janney, Scott Bakula, Sam Robards.Winner of 5 Oscars including Best Picture, this devastatingly darkly comic drama scrutinizing the atypical American family focuses on beleaguered family man Spacey (Best Actor) whose life is going nowhere fast with his ambitious cheating realtor wannabe wife (Bening, Best Actress nominee) and angry, estranged daughter (Birch) and the influence of their new neighbor, spooky emo boy Bentley adding some spice to their lives and ultimately a downward spiral or is it. Filmmaker Sam Mendes (Best Director) and scribe Alan Ball (Best Original Screenplay) sublimely cuts at the underbelly of social strata in modern-day suburbia with canny precision. One of the decade's finest films.
ACCEPTED (2006) **1/2 Justin Long, Jonah Hill, Adam Herschman, Columbus Short, Maria Thayer, Lewis Black, Blake Lively, Mark Derwin, Ann Cusack, Hannah Marks, Anthony Heald, Travis Van Winkle. Frequently funny amalgam of "Old School" meets "Animal House" by way of "Revenge of the Nerds" comedy about a young man's attempt to get into higher education whose constant rejections lead him and his buddies to create their own faux school only to have an actual body of students wanting in leading them to many complications along the way. Long does a fine job as the ring-leader getting in touch with his inner Vince Vaughn/Bill Murray as the smart-aleck nerdling and his gang of misfits would've been funnier if they actually gave props to the miscreant enrollees instead of reducing them to just cartoons. Hill steals the show as Long's portly 'legacy' frat boy wannabe who has most of the film's choice, dry one-liners. (Dir: Steve Pink)
GRACE IS GONE (2007) *** John Cusack, Shelan O'Keefe, Gracie Bednarczyk, Alessandro Nivola, Marisa Tomei. Cusack, in one of his strongest performances, stars as a father of two young daughters who learns their mother, a soldier away in the Iraq war, has been killed, and his paralyzing fear of telling them the news leads to an unlikely road trip instead. Novice filmmaker James C. Strouse, who also penned the screenplay, displays remarkable restraint in what could easily have been a mawkish TV movie with skill and Cusack delivers the goods in a low-key yet heartbreaking turn. The political underpinnings are not belabored and the young actresses balance out the tragic plottings.
DEVIL (2010) **1/2 Chris Messina, Logan Marshall-Green, Jenny O'Hara, Bojana Novakovic, Bokeem Woodbine, Geoffrey Arend, Jacob Vargas, Matt Craven, Joshua Peace, Caroline Dhavernas. Based on a story by M.Night Shyamalan (already a star demerit), this nifty yet predictable supernatural thriller concocted by screenwriter Brian Nelson and newbie director John Erick Dowdle do their best to keep the spine-tingling with the old chestnut device ala "The Twilight Zone" of having five diverse and disparate (and desperate) characters holed up in a claustrophobic area for a limited amount of time (i.e. a Philadelphia skyscraper's elevator motionless between floors) and a decidedly canny turn-of-the-screw catch: one may actually be.Satan (!) With some fine editing and camera-work  by Elliott Greenberg & veteran Tak Fujimoto (respectively)  the film makes the most of the creaky devices interspersed (i.e. lights going out/things bump in the dark/gnarly dispachments of denizens) until the final reel where all hell breaks loose (ok, not really but by then you just wish those left standing had figured out what was what).
PEOPLE LIKE US (2012) *** Chris Pine, Elizabeth Banks, Michael Hall D'Addario, Michelle Pfeiffer, Olivia Wilde, Mark Duplass, Sara Mornell, Philip Baker Hall. Well-intentioned yet derivative dramedy about a slick-talking salesman facing a reality check when his estranged father dies and leaves him to face another fuel-to-the-fire hurdle: bequeathed to deliver a cache of $150 K to a step-sister he never knew and some secrets and lies he may not be able to recover from. Up-and-coming Pine has the weight of the film on his shoulder (and it shows) but acquits himself as best he can with the by-the-numbers script by filmmaker Alex Kurtzman (suggesting echoes of RAIN MAN as if directed by James L. Brooks) with Roberto Orci and Jody Lambert) while Banks has her hands full as his recovering alcoholic sibling.
THE CALL (2013) **1/2 Halle Berry, Abigail Breslin, Morris Chestnut, Michael Eklund, Michael Imperioli, Justina Machado, Jose Zuniga, Roma Maffia, Denise Dowse, Evie Thompson. Berry gives it her all as usual, as a 911 operator who finds herself knee-deep in a harrowing kidnapping involving a teenage girl (Breslin) thrown into a car's trunk and heading into danger rapidly. While the screenplay by Richard & Ncole D'Ovidio and Jon Bokenkamp is a bit pedestrian and relatively predictable, director Brad Anderson gets plenty of adrenalized jump from his leading ladies who go thru the proverbial wringer of emotions with depth and aplomb.
THE SAVAGES (2007) **** Laura Linney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Bosco, Peter Friedman, David Zayas, Gbenga Akinnagbe, Guy Boyd, Debra Monk. Perfect blend of comedy and tragedy with a showcase of excellent American acting at its finest with Linney and Hoffman as the titular siblings facing a rough hurdle : caring for there increasingly dementia plagued estranged father (Bosco equally in fine form). Filmmaker Tamara Jenkins' quasi- biographical screenplay is smart, funny, and shrewdly observant on the pitfalls of shortcomings and petty self-inspection while allowing her three protagonists some truly stellar moments to shine. One of the year's best films.
DELIVERY MAN (2013) *** Vince Vaughn, Chris Pratt, Cobie Smulders, Andrzej Blumenfeld, Simon Delaney, Bobby Moynihan. High-concept comedy tailor-made for Vaughn (based on the foreign comedy "Starbuck" by director Ken Scott - who adapts for the Americanization - and Martin Petit) as an incompetent Brooklyn meat delivery driver whose arrested development comes literally to fruition when he is made aware in a lawsuit that his sperm donations from back-in- the-day has sired some 533 dependents and roughly a third wanting to know who their daddy is. Vaughn acquits himself nicely and dials back on his motormouth mode as the amiable oaf who really wants to make a connection including his precarious relationship with his expecting girlfriend (Smulders). Pratt lends able comic support as Vaughn's best bud and legal counsel. Funny and surprisingly poignant.
HOT TUB TIME MACHINE (2010) *** John Cusack, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry, Clark Duck, Lyndsy Fonseca, Lizzy Caplan, Crispin Glover, Collette Wolfe, William Zabka. Ridiculously, raunchy, clever/stupid comedy about three forty-somethings (and one of their nephews) find themselves transported back in time (hint: eponymous title) to 1986 where they can either change history or in fact do a full reverse "Groundhog Day" and let history repeat itself. What shouldn't work does and for the most part is pretty funny overall what with Cusack wisely knowing how stupid the title was (hence his executive producing and having good bud Steve Pink in the director's chair)  and the fact he is a walking '80s icon/in-on-the-joke scoundrel makes the film run on full tilt with a game ensemble (deadly deadpans from Robinson and Duke as Cusack's nerdy neph and Corddry stealing the film as the obnoxious tool who really is a decent joe despite it all) and rat-a-tat-tat screenplay by Josh Heald, Sean Anders & John Morris mixing the debauchery with heart the result is a wicked combo of "Back to The Future" meets "The Hangover". (Bonus points for getting George McFly and the "Karate Kid" douche, I mean Glover & Zabka). Totally awesome, Dude!!!
THE MECHANIC (2011) *** Jason Statham, Ben Foster, Tony Goldwyn, Donald Sutherland. Decent action-packed reboot of the 1972 Charles Bronson cult-classic about a professional hit man (Statham at his stealthiest) reluctantly recruiting the son (Foster, all p*ss and vinegar) of his slain mentor (Sutherland) after his task assignment of killing him off, setting the plot into overdrive for vengeance and double crosses. Foster's unrelenting rage-fueled kill-off of a gigantic pedophile is one of the more memorable violent set pieces in the genre flick set to high speed velocity thanks to the lean and mean script by Richard Wenk and assured direction by veteran Simon West.
THE IMITATION GAME (2014) ***1/2 Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Charles Dance, Rory Kinnear, Allen Leech, Matthew Beard, James Northcote, Tom Goodman-Hill, Tuppence Middleton. Cumberbatch is excellent as Alan Turning the British mathematician who managed to crack the Nazi's Enigma code during WWII in spite of his personal demons (his homosexuality ultimately led to his tragic suicide shortly thereafter). Based on Andrew Hodges' book, Graham Moore's screenplay keeps things on track as if watching a mystery unspool while Morten Tyldum's sure and steady direction balances the story largely due to the strengths of its star and a strong supporting cast particularly Knightley as one of Turning's colleagues.
The Fab Four get their cinematic introduction in a bonkers, inspired lunacy, mixing Marx Brothers madcap farce and bonking the Stiff Upper Lip of British filmdom in this loosely parodic look at the band in their whirliwind salad days of revolutionary barnstorming the UK and driving all the young ladies absolutely wild. Fun, fun, fun and a whole lot more with George, Paul, John & Ringo getting their Ya-Yas out and inspiring the whole music video craze for future generations. An instant classic featuring the band's early hits too many to mention and to be remiss of their magical charm, with cheeky humor and crafty musicianship. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!!
DARK SKIES (2013) *** Keri Russell, Josh Hamilton, Dakota Goyo, Kadan Rockett, J.K. Simmons. Relatively spooky sci-fi suspense flick focusing on a nuclear family whose lives are endangered when strange occurrences begin in their household that suggestalien encounters. A tense mix of "Close Encounters" with a touch of the dread in "The X-Files" and domesticity terror of "Poltergeist" the drama is strung out as taut as possible with dedicated turns by Russell and Hamilton as the parents who are determined to protect their sons at any cost and a nicely low- key drained turn by character actor Simmons as an 'expert' on the 'grays'. Chilling in all the right places despite its familiarity genre trappings and a very unnerving musical score by Joseph Bishara works out the kinks in filmmaker Scott Stewart's storyline. Far out.
BROKEN CITY (2013) *** Mark Wahlberg, Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jeffrey Wright, Barry Pepper, Natalie Martinez, Michael Beach, Kyle Chandler, James Ransone, Griffin Dunne, Justin Chambers. Lumetian NYC corruption tale at full tilt with Wahlberg as as disgraced cop turned shamus who finds himself under the dubious employment of charismatic mayor Crowe who wants his wife Zeta-Jones under surveillance for infidelity. But as is the case there is always more than meets the eye in this potboiler with a game cast and fine direction from Allen Hughes (his first solo helmsmanship sans bro Albert) with a lean, tight screenplay by newbie scribe Brian Tucker that while familiar is none-the-less engaging largely thanks to the Cagneyesque Wahlberg's anti-hero.
HITCHCOCK (2012) **1/2 Anthony Hopkins, Helen Mirren,Scarlett Johansson, Danny Huston, Toni Collette, Michael Stuhlbarg, Michael Wincott, Jessica Biel, James D'Arcy, Richard Portnow, Kurtwood Smith, Ralph Macchio. Very loose and wooly biopic about acclaimed filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock (Hopkins in a fat suit doing his best Hitch imitation) facing a crossroads in his esteemed career at age 60 - fade into glory or attempt the impossible - PSYCHO? Very loosely based on Stephen Rebello's book "Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho" the screenplay by John J. McLaughlin teeters into burlesque (and not in a good way) suggesting the Master had delusional dialogue with Ed Gein, the mass murderer who Norman Bates was based upon, among other falsities director Sacha Gervasi indulges (um no Mrs. Hitchcock - although graciously played by Mirren - did NOT have any hands on activities with her husband's 'final cuts'). While it is a bit of a stretch the film overall is worth a peek if anything to see two fine thespians have a field day.
THOR (2011) *** Chris Helmsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, Clark Gregg, Idris Elba, Colm Feore, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano, Josh Dallas, Jaimie Alexander, Rene Russo (Cameos:Samuel L. Jackson, Jeremy Renner). Marvel Comics' superhero origin flick about Odin's callow son Thor (Helmsworth, quite decent in a Heath Ledger charming way), who is banished from their Nordic universe to Earth via wormhole  as a mortal to prove himself rightful heir to the throne via redemption in saving mankind from his diabolical half-brother Loki (Hiddleston). A game cast, impeccable production design by Bo Welch and decent set pieces directed by unlikely helmsman Kenneth Branagh (or is it? Shakespearean undertones throughout suggest not!) makes more for the somewhat talky screenplay by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, Don Payne & J. Michael Straczynski & Mark Protosevich (phew!) based on Stan Lee (yes there's a Lee cameo too!), Larry Lieber & the late great Jack Kirby's epic character leading to the inevitable AVENGERS film (next summer) with the ubiquitous Nick Fury cameo by Jackson and possible new Hawkeye Renner. One last note the 3D isn't too shabby either (watch that hammer throw!)
THE HOUSE OF THE DEVIL (2009) *** Jocelyn Donahue, Tom Noonan, Mary Woronov, Greta Gerwig, AJ Bowen, Dee Wallace, Heather Robb. Chillingly affective homage/valentine to cheapie indie horror films of the'80s, filmmaker Ti West evokes echoes of Carpenter, Raimi and Corman in this spooky haunted house tale about a pressed-for-money co-ed (plucky Everywoman Donahue who comes across as a gorgeous amalgam of Jessica Harper, Karen Allen & Brooke Adams) who answers an ad on campus for a babysitting gig that turns out to be more than what it actually is soliciting. West's shrewd, topsy-turvy, skewed camera angles (wonderfully concocted by cinematographer Eliot Rockett), sharp editing skills and a truly nerve-shredding scored by Jeff Grace keeps the scary atmosphere at full-throttle even by its predictable final act of bloody good genre jolts. A true find and flair for the game of showing less-is-more-journeyman film-making and also what you don't see is far-more unsettling than what is shown.
THE COMPANY MEN (2010) *** Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones, Chris Cooper, Rosemarie DeWitt, Maria Bello, Kevin Costner, Craig T. Nelson, Eamonn Walker. Well-acted drama about corporate America with a company downsizing's affect is on those suddenly without 'meaning' in their lives. Affleck, Jones & Cooper excel as respectively a junior account exec, a VP & a manager who face uncertain futures and the impact of socioeconomical existence (or lack thereof) in writer/director John Wells' (his feature film debut) well-constructed storyline. Equally impressive are DeWitt as Affleck's understanding but no BS wife and Costner as her working class brother who lends a leg up for his kin in a construction gig
THE BAY (2012) *** Excellent 'found footage' eco-chiller from filmmaker Barry Levinson about a told-in-flashback account of a biological outbreak on a small town in Maryland during a Fourth of July celebration whose inhabitants find themselves at the mercy of a nasty microbe from local infected waters which unleash a catastrophic chain of events in 'you-are-there' documentary style depictions with some clever touches and a few solid jolts of pure visceral horror (not for the squeamish). Tense, provocative and raw nerve jangling terror. A blend of JAWS meets THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT ; will make you think twice about having that glass of water.
LEGION (2010) **1/2 Paul Bettany, Dennis Quaid, Lucas Black, Tyrese Gibson, Adrianne Palicki, Charles S. Dutton, Kevin Durand, Jon Tenney, Willa Holland, Kate Walsh, Doug Jones. Quick moving yet decidedly predictable end-of-the-world supernatural actioner with Bettany as Michael, the angel of God, who is attempting to save mankind from a horde of battling angels sent forth to wipe out the Earth of its aforementioned inhabitants. His aide-de-camp? A rag-tag motley crew holed up in a no-man's land desert diner with one caveat: it housed a pregnant woman with her unborn child being the last hope for mankind (natch!) A fairly entertaining explosive-filled hybrid of THE TERMINATOR meets DOGMA if you will that only falters by its conclusion (in the sense there seems to be huge chunks of plot jettisoned for pyrotechniques and the usual CGI mayhem). (Dir: Scott Stewart)
HOLLYWOODLAND (2006) **1/2 Adrien Brody, Diane Lane, Ben Affleck, Bob Hoskins, Lois Smith, Robin Tunney, Jeffrey DeMunn, Molly Parker, Dash Mihok, Joe Spano. (Dir: Allen Coulter)The Lonely Death of The Man of SteelHollywood loves telling stories about Hollywood, specifically anything unseemly or sordid in its past history of glittering dreams that are attempted to come true thru the silver screen, only to wind up in the gutter with the dregs of society and a sad footnote to The Dream Machine eating up another lost soul and spitting them out.The latest is no stranger to lore of La-La land: the suicide of actor George Reeves, the star of '50s TV classic, "Adventures of Superman", shot himself and ruled a sad token to his attempt to have a career after the series' cancellation. Instead of being remembered for his charm and self-depreciative humor instilled in The Man of Steel he is now best recalled as the main link of "The Superman Curse" (which continued with the big screen's icon, Christopher Reeve's tragic paralyzing accident and subsequent premature death).In this cross between "Citizen Kane" and "Chinatown" the fictitious gumshoe Louis Simo (Brody, low-key and affective), an ambulance chaser and denounced former policeman attempting to struggle to get by to support his estranged family, finds himself immersed in the aftermath of the crime at hand and he begins to see a pattern of shoddy police work, inept forensics, some sordid characters - namely Reeves' mistresses, Toni Mannix (Lane giving solid work here), the wife of studio head, alleged mobster Eddie Mannix (Hoskins sublimely scary), and Leonore Lemmon (Tunney in one of her best performances), an opportunistic starlet wannabe - and finally Reeves' mother, Helen Bessolo (veteran Smith), who is determined to clear her late son's good name by any means necessary. Simo's investigation becomes a tangled web of deceit, greed and many a conspiracy theorist's wet dream with the ring of truth in sounding distance. Told with flashbacks to showcase Reeves in his up-and-down (mostly down) dubious acting career and to his overnite sensation as Superman is only a curse for Reeves (played with finesse and decency by Affleck, one of his strongest turns in recent memory) who desperately wants to shirk the cape and tights for one desperate attempt after another to prove he really is a talented actor. Sadly the pitfalls that occur only compensate the decision that Reeves' depressed state led him to pull the trigger himself, until Simo digs further upsetting the apple cart of show business to follow the trail of would-be suspects and possibly redemption for himself (and metaphorically for a dead super hero).Screenwriter Paul Bernbaum offers an interesting What If scenario with some solid direction by veteran TV director Coulter making his big screen debut and all-around aces acting by the principals. The production design by Leslie McDonald is stellar and polished as well as the exceptional camera work by Jonathan Freeman and a welcomely subdued yet omniscient score by Marcelo Zarvos. But it would have been even better if they had depicted more behind- the-scenes moments of the TV series - one sequence is so uncanny from the original it is almost mesmerizing right down to the trademark wink by Reeves as Clark Kent to the kiddies watching - and the pacing is a tad lugubrious.However the case still remains a mystery and Reeves a tragic asterisk in Hollywoodland.
DOUBT (2008) ***1/2 Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Viola Davis, Alice Drummond, Audrie J. Neenan, Susan Blommaert, Joseph Foster. Compelling adaptation of John Patrick Shanley's award-winning Broadway drama (the playwright penned the screenplay and double duties as director, both with finesse) about a scandalous chain of events at a Bronx Catholic school circa 1964 where the school's principal nun (a bloodless and excellent Streep) suspects up-start priest (Hoffman equally adept) of possible infractions with his young charges, specifically the school's one and only black pupil, and the consequences of the witch hunt occurs. Adams lends able support as the seemingly naïve young teacher Streep learns of the infraction. Well acted by all the principals at their peak and Davis is absolutely stunning in her minor yet amazingly crafted performance as the boy's mother. *Kudos to Greg Laporta's splendid musical contributions with Howard Shore's subtly subdued score.
LOOPER (2012) *** 1/2 Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Wilis, Emily Blunt, Paul Dano, Noah Segan, Piper Perabo, Jeff Daniels, Pierce Gagnon, Qing Xu, Tracie Thomas, Garrett Dillahunt, Nick Gomez. Trippy Philip K.Dickian sci-fi mind-f*#ck of a flick with the always appealing Gordon- Levitt as a combo bounty hunter/assassin of the future whose own fate seems locked in when his older self is sent back for his crimes to be terminated and the good ol' clock ticking before his cohorts get wise to off him themselves. With wit and a soupçon of restraint filmmaker Rian Johnson manages to tap into the time/space continuum with nary a shrug as to the backdrop of the proceedings at hand - a mix of gangster/code-of-the-old-West gunslinger flicks and the sub genre of time traveling sci-fi that is truly entertaining with a splendid cast including Willis as the world-weary shoot-first, ask-questions later archetype he can do in his sleep; Bljunt getting in touch with her inner Linda Hamilton; and a scruffy Daniiels as a future tapper running the whole bag of tricks. The only fatal flaw is attempting to make-up Gordon-Levitt to resemble Willis (it doesn't work; he looks like an automatronic plastique) not unlike Willis' crappy SURROGATES) and using his tough guy latter day Bogart whispery delivery. Otherwise a shot in the arm for identity in a grim future sci-fi action yarn that has a few surprises up its sleeve.
FOUR CHRISTMASES (2008) **1/2 Vince Vaughn, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Jon Voight, Mary Steenburgen, Kristen Chenoweth, Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw, Katy Mixon, Dwight Yoakam. Frequently amusing holiday themed comedy with couple Vaughn and Witherspoon faced with a forced road-trip to visit their 4 divorced parents and family with many personal pitfalls and secrets unearthed along the merry way. Motormouth Vaughn and feisty Witherspoon make for a cute couple and their chemistry drives the at-times unwieldy comedy but get some laughs along the way including a game Favreau and McGraw as Vaughn's wrestlin' bros. (Dir: Seth Gordon)
AVATAR (2009) **** Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, Giovanni Ribisi, Michelle Rodriguez, Laz Alonso, Wes Studi, CCH Pounder, Dileep Rao. Filmmaker James Cameron's truly phenomenal  ten years in the making  digital effects sci-fi extravaganza is one of the most tremendous feats in groundbreaking visuals and an instant sci-fi classic: set several hundred years in the future the Earth is relying on distant planet Pandora for a natural resource to provide energy and the only thing getting in the way is its populace  the Na'Vis  ten-foot tall, blue-skinned natives with feline features and a not-so-subtle mirror reflection to the Native Americans' plights : endangered species. While Cameron's script is a bit tin-eared for dialogue (and the parallels of "Dances With Wolves")he makes up for in oodles of marvelous, awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping scenes on the big screen with a virtual world on-to-itself and gung-ho paralyzed Marine Jake Scully (Worthington) sent in to infiltrate and assume the identity  hence the title- to learn more about its people (and more importantly gain their trust for the good ol' USA). The use of state-of-the-art motion capture suits worn by the actors allows the CGI to practically absorb their acting DNA onto their counterparts with amazing élan (Saldana truly is the stand-out with her emotional wrought turn as the Na'Vi princess/love interest Neytiri). Best to view in IMAX 3-D with eye-popping wonderment; the #1 box office champ of all time and guaranteed to take home an armful of f/x Oscars. One of the year's very best.
THE LOSERS (2010) *** Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Idris Elba, Columbus Short, Oscar Jaenada, Jason Patric, Holt McCallany. Better-than-anticipated popcorn crowd-pleaser big-screen actioner adaptation of the cult comic-book about a group of CIA black ops seeking some serious payback after a vicious setback involving a for-hire assassination leads their employer to have them offed in the process. A witty, funny and oddly compelling script by Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt keeps things bouncing along nicely with loads of shoot-em ups/blow-em ups and a cast having a field day (particularly Morgan as the defacto leader of the motley crew and sultry ass-kicking Saldana as a mystery woman who has her own stakes at risk, and Patric as the hissable villain having a lot of fun in the interim). Vibrantly filmed by Sylvain White breathing fresh air into a tired
THE CONJURING (2013) *** Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Tayor, Ron Livingston, Shanley Caswell, Hayley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy, Kyla Deaver, Shannon Kook, John Brotherton. Affectively serviceable ghost story based on true events with paranormal investigating married team The Warrens (Farmiga and Wilson with chemistry to spare) who are enlisted by The Perron Family for help in their current haunting of an evil presence plaguing their new dwelling. Director James Wan pulls out all the stops and incorporates every trick in the book (creaking doors, Don't-go-down-that-dark-cellar ethos) and rams it full throttle and oddly enough works like gangbusters pushing all the right buttons in an equally workmanlike script by Carey & Chad Hayes. While frankly someone like me who very rarely gets scared with horror films like this (and echoing every genre flick from THE CHANGELING to POLTERGEIST) the average film-goer will have their collective nerves shred.
HOW DO YOU KNOW (2010) **1/2 Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd, Owen Wilson, Jack Nicholson, Kathyrn Hahn, Mark Linn-Baker, Lenny Venito, Molly Price, Ron McLarty, Shelley Conn, John Tormey, Teyonah Parris, Tony Shalhoub, Dean Norris. Uneven romantic comedy from James L. Brooks (who seems to have a tin-ear lately for how people actually talk and react!) is buoyed by fine work by its leads Witherspoon as a recently sacked softball player who finds herself in the unlikely love triangle with currently-being-investigated businessman Rudd (at his Ruddiest!) and carefree (and careless) baseball star Wilson. While all three acquit themselves nothing feels organic overall and Nicholson as Rudd's shady-dealing father seems lost and ill-at-ease going a bit Pacino (i.e. louder than necessary). One standout is Hahn as Rudd's too-protective pregnant executive assistant and the scene with her boyfriend Venito is one for the archives.
CRANK (2006) * Jason Statham, Amy Smart, Jose Pablo Cantillo, Dwight Yoakam, Carlos Sanz, Efren Ramirez, Reno Wilson, Keone Young. (Dirs: Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor)"DOA" meets "Speed" = just D.O.A.Why are some action films so moronic? I realize that there is the suspension of belief is required in general for movies in general but seriously, isn't the genre getting a bit desperate for its 'high-octane, low-brow, high-concept, no-brainer' plotting? To wit: a professional hit-man with the unlikely moniker of Chev Chelios - (Chev? Seriously as in Chevy Chase? Would explain the pratfalls that unfurl at a rapid rate) - (Statham, attempting to be the British Bruce Willis in his bid for action bad-ass since his fairly successful foray with the "Transporter" series) - awakens from a dilly of a baseball-bat-to-the-head hangover and discovers via a DVD left for him to view that he has been given a lethal injection of a Chinese synthetic poison that will kill him within an hour, courtesy of his arch-nemesis/ rival punk Verona (Cantillo chewing up the scenery with a Frito-Bandito accent not the likes have been seen since "The Treasure of Sierra Madre"'s "we-don't- need-no-stinkin-batches!" Mexicans). Natch, Chev is hell-bent on living and living to kill Verona and his crew for killing him. In hot pursuit of the evil thug, Chev calls his doctor, Doc Miles (Yoakam having fun and seemingly to channel Dr. Hunter S. Thompson to boot!), for help as the good doctor is whoring it up in Vegas and making a return trip to LA, explaining to his patient that the only thing apparently sustaining him alive is adrenaline and Chev invests himself with some inventive and ugly methods including taking on a gang after snorting coke off a nasty bathroom floor; chugging Red Bull in an impromptu convenience store robbery; finding his girlfriend Eve (Smart who is truly dumb for taking this degradingly awfully stupid role) and proceeding to rape her in Chinatown among some several dozen gawking passersby (arguably the most ugly moment in recent silver-screen history); and stealing a motorcycle cops chopper after visiting the hospital for an electric- paddle re-charging (!)The moronic and hateful storyline was concocted by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor who co-direct as well, showing both having little insight into what makes a true action film tick: a compelling plot, a sympathetic protagonist, a feisty female lead and a trustworthy side-kick; a shrewdly evil villain; and some migraine-less editing would all be nice. Taking cues from The Tony Scott School of Overindulgence the tag-team simply throw everything but the kitchen sink into this icky brew withholding any decent attempts at entertainment what- so-ever.
PREMONITION (2007) * Sandra Bullock, Julian McMahon, Kate Nelligan, Nia Long, Peter Stormare, Amber Valletta, Shyann McClure, Courtney Taylor Burness, Jude Cicolella. Horrendous suspense drama about a woman (Bullock, whose game acting is the only thing worth mentioning), who suddenly finds herself in a time altering nightmare involving a terrible accident involving her husband (McMahon coming off very wooden) and her attempt to stop the event from occurring. The ridiculously awful screenplay by Bill Kelly pulls out all the stops in the conventional 'horror' dept. (i.e. foreboding weather, a nefarious crow etc.) that is so convoluted that the obviously tacked on ending is arguably one of the worst endings in cinematic history. Newbie director Mennan Yappo deserves a better vehicle to showcase his visual eye and a better grasp of what truly makes a suspense film work: a plot. One of the year's worst.
CHERNOBYL DIARIES (2012) ** 1/2 Jonatahan Sadowski, Devin Kelley, Jesse McCartney, Olivia Dudley, Ingrid Bolso Berdal, Nathan Phillips, Dimitri Diatchenko. Better-than-usual 'shaky cam' horror flick from quickly -becoming-one-trick-pony-a-la-M.Night Shyamalan executive producer Oren Peli (who co-scripted with Carey and Shane Van Dyke) about a group of clueless young Americans traveling thru Europe who decide to detour for an 'extreme tour' of the titular post-nuclear meltdown area of the Russian city of Pripyat, a virtual (and liberal) ghost town, that winds up a hellish nightmare when their journey becomes a fight for survival in the dreaded no- man's land. Directed with a few smartly executed moments in an otherwise barren wasteland (literally & cinematically) by rookie Bradley Parker.
A MOST VIOLENT YEAR (2014) *** Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo, Alessandro Nivola, Albert Brooks, Elyes Gabel, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Peter Gerety. Knee-deep in Lumet-ville: Filmmaker JC Chandor delivers a cut-and-dried tale of an ambitious legit businessman (Isaac channeling both De Niro and Pacino) circa 1981 in NY whose prosperous empire-to-be in oil/energy fuel finds himself in the cross-hairs of both sides of the law: mobsters muscling in on his territory and an equally driven district attorney (Oyelowo) out to nail him in any illegal activities hindering his latest venture into expansion. Chastain gives a memorable performance as Isaac's icy 'connected' better half with steely determination. Chandor gets the period piece details right with a fine production design by John P. Goldsmith and fine cinematography by Bradford Young echoing THE GODFATHER.
NEXT (2007) * Nicolas Cage, Julianne Moore, Jessica Biel, Thomas Kretschmann. Lame, boring and ridiculous adaptation of Philip K. Dicks' "The Golden Man" with Cage as a two-bit Vegas magician who has the ability to see into his future by two minutes and the feds enlisting him to stop a nuclear strike. Witless, junky dialogue, cheesy special effects and hard-to-sustain plotting are the main faults of this laborious thriller. The clunky screenplay by Gary Goldman, Jonathan Hensleigh, and Paul Bernbaum; one-note acting by its trio of other-wise talented leads; and leaden direction by Lee Tamahori should have Dick rolling over in his grave.
GAMORRAH (2009) ** Giancarlo Imparato , Toni Servillo, Salvatore Canalupo, Marco Macor, Ciro Petrone. Flat and at times hard to follow dramatization of Italy's modern-day crime families with a documentarian air about it by filmmaker Mateo Garrone based on Robert Saviano's book (so controversial the author is under 24/7 police protection in re: the real criminal threat out to silence him!) and executive produced by Martin Scorsese interweaves many plots including a fading don (Imparato), a middle-management type in the mob (Servillo) , an indemand textiles expert facing competition and retribution (Cantalupo) and two idiotic punks who think they live in a real-life SCARFACE world (Macor and Petrone). Arguably over-rated and by no means 'the greatest mafia movie ever' as it is being touted; a true disappointment.
THE GREEN LANTERN (2011) *** Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Peter Sarsgaard, Tim Robbins, Mark Strong, Angela Bassett, Tamuera Morrison (voices of: Geoffrey Rush, Michael Clarke Duncan and Clancy Brown) DC Comics' cult superhero's origin story is given the big-screen treatment with better-than-expected results with cocksure Reynolds nicely cast as hot-shot test pilot Hal Jordan who is reluctantly 'chosen' by an intergalactic police force known collectively as The Green Lanterns enlisting him to stop a soul-sucking, planet-devouring entity  Parallax (scarily voiced by Brown)  from destroying Earth. Director Martin Campbell gets out the big guns with the visual and special effects (and not too shabby in 3D either) for the popcorn crowd/fanboys while a game cast  including Strong as alien Sinestro (an uncanny resemblance to a Vulcanized John Waters!)  and particularly Reynolds doing the heavy lifting of going from callow fratboy to genuine underdog hero while Sarsgaard gets in touch with his inner John Malkovich as the villainous Hector Hammond  whose icky transformation from a close encounter has him looking like a combo of John Merrick (AKA "The Elephant Man") and John Carpenter (!) Echoes of Richard Donner's "SUPERMAN" (a nifty helicopter set piece)  with its blend of humor/heart  keeps the right direction for a blossoming franchise.
SAW III (2006) **1/2 Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Angus Macfadyen, Bahar Soomekh, Dina Meyer, Barry Flatman, Costas Mandylor, (cameos: Mark Wahlberg and Leigh Whanell) Third chapter - and most anemic - of the trilogy franchise into fear with the ever-crafty serial game player Jigsaw (Bell at his most phlegmatic), in the end stages of his debilitating cancer (end game anyone?), who has pitted two new victims against the clock with aiding and abetting protégée Amanda (nutty Smith) providing some truly nasty set-ups (and of course out comes). While the carnage runs rampant the originality is on fumes despite some efforts from original filmmakers James Wan and Whannell, its creators, letting director Darren Lynn Bousman - who helmed the second part - do all the heavy lifting for what should have been a sure thing of unholy terror, instead is a tepid retread of its origins.
SHREK THE THIRD (2007) **1/2 (VOICES OF : Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Justin Timberlake, Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett, Eric Idle, Larry King, John Krasinki, Ian McShane, Cheri Oteri, Regis Philbin, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Amy Sedaris, Seth Rogen.) Underwhelming addition to the animated franchise this time with the ogre Shrek facing impending parenthood with his beloved Princess Fiona and attempting to persuade cousin Artie to take the rightful place on the throne in spite of Prince Charming's nefarious plans to rule Far, Far Away. While the animation is splendidly gorgeous as usual there are too many characters given little to do and the main characters seeming to just be going through the motions. Overall not terrible but the weakest entry to date for the promising trilogy. (Dirs: Chris Miller and Raman Hui)
THE CROODS (2013) **** (Voices of: Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, Cloris Leachman, Clark Duke, Chris Sanders, Randy Thom) Wonderfully inventive animated fare about a family of prehistoric cave dwellers forced out of the safety of their home to the outer world while nature decides to make things problematic (i.e. earthquakes and lava). Wildly entertaining, some incredible animation (like the aforementioned natural disasters) and a stand out A-list vocal talents of Cage as the terribly overprotective paterfamilias; Reynolds as the Cro-Mag bo-hunk whose resourcefulness aids the clan of necessity; and in particular a very vivacious and fun-loving turn by Stone who steals the movie as the teenager who desperately wants to see more of the world at large. Appealing to children of all ages with comedic brilliance and artistic integrity. Directed with panache by Sanders and Kirk De Micco (who co- scripted the clever script too boot).
WRATH OF THE TITANS (2012) **1/2 Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Edgar Ramirez, Toby Kebbell, Rosamund Pike, Bill Nighy, Danny Huston, John Bell, Lily James, Alejandro Naranjo, Freddy Drabble, Kathryn Carpenter, Sinead Cusack. Middling sequel to the big-budget CGI remake of the sci-fi/fantasy cult classic again pitting half-human/half-god Perseus (Worthington reprising his hero) facing even more insurmountable odds with the gods involving the kidnapping/torture of his father Zeus (Neeson back as well) while venturing forth to stop the onslaught of the good people of ancient Greece. While there are a few more monstrosities including an island of Cyclops; a two-headed wolf-like creature and a mountainous cloud monster resembling the fire & brimstone creation in LORD OF THE RINGS & Disneys' "Midnight on Bald Mountain" demon the film is weighted down with very little 'thrills' nor any memorable dialogue or frivolity to add to the gloom and doom mix concocted by Dan Mazeau, David Johnson, Greg Berlanti and Dan Mazeau's screenplay and leaden direction by Jonathan Lliebesman outweighs the less-than-stellar (SIGH again!) 3-D employed (or rather lack of on screen!)
CARRIE (2013) ** Chloe Grace Moretz, Julianne Moore, Gabriella Wilde, Portia Doubleday, Judy Greer, Ansel Elgort, Alex Russell. Yet another example of not letting a classic alone with a needless remake : Stephen King's horror novel adapted (again) with anemic results with Moretz as the bullied high school teen whose sudden onset of telekinetic powers is unleashed when provoked for far too long on her tormentors. Nearly a beat-by-beat/sequence-by-sequence echo of the Brian DePalma classic original the retread here even employs that film's scribe (Lawrence D. Cohen who collaborated with Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa) barely adds anything worthy or new to the 21st century take on the thriller and filmmaker Kimberly Peirce seems to drag her heels in what seems like a quick paycheck with little effort (and no scares; criminal for the genre) and casting CW plastic rejects who barely register unlike Amy Irving and Nancy Allen as the good/bad girls in the titular heroine's class. Moore is no Piper Laurie in that she buoys her religious nut mother more on physical torture than psychological and while Moretz acquits herself, Sissy Spacek elicited far more sympathy. Rent (or better yet purchase) the original.
THE WORLD'S END (2013) *** Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan, Rosamund Pike, Pierce Brosnan. Epic laughs ensue in this funny and fast-paced comedy about five childhood friends reunited to relive their youth by another attempt at a pub crawl to end all pub crawls (literally) when they discover their sleepy old hometown is being taken over by supernatural beings. The comedy team of Pegg and Frost with their collaborator Edgar Wright continue their unofficial trilogy with great fun and spirits (of all types) in this frenetic mix of comedy and sci-fi. Belly up to the bar for belly laughs.
THE HANGOVER PART II (2011) ***1/2 Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, Ken Jeong, Paul Giamatti, Jamie Chung, Mason Lee, Jeffrey Tambor, Sasha Barrese, Gillian Vigman, Nick Cassavetes, Crystal The Monkey (cameo as himself: Mike Tyson) Hysterically funny follow-up to the out-of-nowhere blockbuster comedy keeps the 'Wolfpack' back for action along the same lines except instead of Las Vegas they head to Bangkok for more of the same in their fractured-memory evening of debauchery with groom-to-be, mild-mannered dentist Stu (Helms); Abbott & Costello (ah, Cooper and Galifianakis) and his future-brother-in-law (Lee, son of filmmaker Ang Lee) MIA; a very angry gangster (Giamatti having fun); a return visit from Mr. Chow (hilarious Jeong) and the scene-stealing, chain-smoking, drug-dealing monkey (Crystal) all attempting to fit the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of their lives. Director Todd Phillips  who co-wrote with Craig Mazin & Scot Armstrong  gets in touch with his inner Harold Ramis (a good thing!)  mixing the numbskull slapstick with some emotions and going decidedly darker (a severed finger; a trip to a he/she strip joint and the 'death' of a character) fuel the fires of familiarity yet on the whole it's still gut-bustingly FUNNY and rapid fire in sight gags/zingers and one-liners that requires several trips to get them all in !
FUNNY PEOPLE (2009) ** Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Leslie Mann, Eric Bana, Jonah Hill, Jason Schwartzman, Aubrey Plaza, Maude Apatow, Iris Apatow, RZA, Aziz Ansari, Torsten Voges. (Cameos as themselves: James Taylor, Eminem, Andy Dick, Charles Fleischer, Paul Reiser, George Wallace, Norm MacDonald, Dave Attell, Sarah Silverman, Ray Romano) Misfire dramedy with Sandler as a self-centered jerk comedian whose life-threatening illness comes into focus as he attempts to re-connect with an old flame (Mann) with the help of his new assistant and sudden best friend (Rogen), and up-and-coming comic wannabe falls flat on so many levels in both genres: drama and comedy; not really absorbing as the former and very seldom funny as the latter). While comedy king Judd Apatow attempts something different he misses the mark completely: entertaining. The film is neither and painfully again the comedy is mostly a mélange of dick jokes trying to fade out the 'heavy drama' at hand. Heavy-handed instead and the fact that a corral of big-time comedians are given senseless cameos providing them nothing to do except smile and nod.
MY BLOODY VALENTINE: 3-D (2009) *** Jensen Ackles, Jaime King, Kerr Smith, Betsy Rue, Edi Gathegi, Tom Atkins, Kevin Tighe, Megan Boone, Karen Baum, Joy de la Paz. Far better than imagined remake of the camp Canadian 1981 slasher about a pick-axe wielding maniac stalking a small Pennsylvanian coal-mining hamlet with vengeance on his mind a decade after the events of his previous slay-ride. Filmed in amazing 3-D the bloody crime-spree packs a visceral wallop and does not go light on the grisly sequences ; thank you gore hounds! Fun and tense just like the old school killer-on-the-loose genre from decades ago; a real crowd-pleaser (dig that flying jawbone!) (Dir: Patrick Lussier)
BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD (2012) ***1/2 Evocative tone poem quasi-documentary/semi- improvisatory style lyrical account of a sweet six year old named Hushpuppy (the wonderful Quvenzhane Wallis, giving the most natural child performance since Jodie Foster and Tatum O'Neal) living in the bayous of Louisiana with her quick tempered yet loving father (amateur Dwight Henry equally compelling) whose drinking only adds to his diminishing health all in the midst of the swellings of the 'bathtub' reservoir/levees as Hurricane Katrina fades into their ramshackle existence. Director Benh Zeitlin and scribe Lucy Alibar concoct a bittersweet coming-of-age-story that would be best described as a 21st century TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Evocative and at times surreal yet altogether universal in what types of love can overpower even the most dismal of situations. Remarkable.
SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS (2011) *** Robert Downey, Jr, Jude Law, Noomi Rapace, Jared Harris, Rachel McAdams, Stephen Fry, Kelly Reilly, Eddie Marsan. Highly entertaining installment of the popular franchise with keen observant/savant sleuth extraordinaire Sherlock Holmes (Downey fitting in as if an old pair of shoes) facing his mortal enemy and IQ superior Professor Moriarty (Harris, ideally cast-to-the-hilt) whose nefarious pas de deaux involving an international plot to begin a European war coincides with Holmes' prospects of losing his partner-in-wits-derring-do, Dr.Watson (the always game Law) to his impending nuptials. While filmmaker Guy Ritchie continues to employ the very quickly passé cinematic trick/fetish of slo-mo (the kissing cousin/kiss-of-death to 'bullet time') with up-close and personal edited within-an-inch of the-utmost-mechanics-of-modernized-weaponary-circa-19th century is SO 20th Century filmmaking :D In spite of the over-thrust of its director the lively screenplay by husband and wife team Kieran and Michelle Mulroney incorporates a lot of fun set pieces (i.e. a doozy of a train sequence with hair's-breadth skillfulness) yet wastes the large talents of McAdams and the priceless Marsan. Fry is a hoot as 'Shirl' 's bro (and one of the least likely on screen siblings the likes of real-life brothers Dennis & Randy Quaid are come to think of it!) who loves to be out and a-buff. Elementary, my dear film-goer, Elementary indeed!
SOURCE CODE (2011) *** ½ Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright. Frenetic and engrossing sci-fi thriller mash-up of a "GROUNDHOG DAY" meets "THE TWILIGHT ZONE" via "SPEED": stoic soldier Gyllenhaal (a career high giving a complex turn) finds himself hurtling back in time to an 8 minute pocket in a governmental/military experiment to unravel a terrorist plot marking Chicago for nuclear annihilation via a commuter train bombing set upon its path and the time ticking away. Novice screenwriter Ben Ripley delivers the sweat-inducing, edge-of-your-seat attention to detail with his pretzel-twisty mind f*cking (ala "INCEPTION"  what is real? What isn't?) and director Duncan Jones keeps things even keeled as all hell breaks loose largely in shrewdly making his performers 'talk' and not "SHOUT" their precise and important dialogue making the audience listen and think (Thank you!) with his stars doing the heavy lifting with aplomb (Monaghan is a nice touch as the sexy girl-next-door type that Gyllenhaal eventually falls for in the process to save her and perhaps himself). One of the craftiest and satisfying thrillers in years by leaps and bounds!
THE ROAD (2009) **** Viggo Mortensen, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall, Guy Pearce, Garret Dillahunt. Grimly realized adaptation of the award-winning best-seller by Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic morality tale set in a barren, bleak wasteland in the near- future after some form of unspoken, cataclysmic event that focuses on an unnamed father and son (Mortensen in one of his best performances and stunning new comer Smit-McPhee) on the ultimate journey into fear: survival of the fittest indeed. Filmmaker John Hillcoat  who adapted the screenplay with Joe Penhall  successfully translates the despair yet unbridled spirit of humanity abetted by expert cinematography by Javier Aguiresarobe (all grey palette); Chris Kennedy's amazing production design and Gershon Ginsburg's art direction. Oscar-worthy Mortensen  barely recognizable as a wizened, dirt-caked, emaciated 'thing' more than 'man'; his haunted eyes the only glimmer of hope/life beneath all that horror  buoys the bleak storyline with his natural chemistry of his charge Smit-McPhee one of the most amazing debuts of a young actor to date- is the real deal. One of the year's best.
SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED (2012) ***1/2 Aubrey Plaza, Mark Duplass, Jake Johnson, Karan Doni, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Jeff Garlin, Kristen Bell. Whimsical sci-fi dramedy with a fantastic turn by deadpan hottie Plaza as a misanthropic intern for a Seattle based magazine who is recruited by her writer boss jerk Johnson to investigate a possible crack-pot ad from an apparently troubled young man (Duplass) who claims he's time travelled and is going to once more but with a partner. Based loosely on a true story (well the ad was a goof but true) with a smartly written screenplay by Derek Connolly and directed with a nice pace by newcomer Colin Trevorrow. Well-cast with Johnson rising above his could've been a one-note character but gives his louche/douche a heart of gold and surprisingly poignant tone throughout buoyed by the dead- on chemistry between sexy-as-hell Plaza and sad-sack Duplass. An indie sleeper gem you should seek or go back to the future for.
THE BANK JOB (2008) **1/2 Jason Statham, Saffron Burrows, Stephen Campbell Moore, Daniel Mays, James Faulkner, Alki David, Michael Jibson, Georgia Taylor, Richard Lintern, Peter Bowles, Alistair Petrie, Hattie Morahan, David Suchet, Peter De Jersey. Decent yet predictable caper flick based on the real-life UK heist circa 1971 where a small group of associates knock off more than they can chew involving a Royal Scandal in the making. Director Roger Donaldson is back in form with the deliberately paced yet entertaining genre flick that actually gains momentum in its third act and Statham proves to be the British Bruce Willis with his street-smart charms while Burrows sizzles.
MIRRORS (2008) *1/2 Kiefer Sutherland, Paula Patton, Cameron Boyce, Erica Gluck, Amy Smart, Mary Beth Peil, John Shrapnel, Jason Flemyng, Tim Ahern, Julian Glover, Josh Cole, Ezra Buzzington. Pretty crummy 'J horror' adaptation by filmmaker Alexandre Aja  who co-wrote with Gregory Levasseur based on Sung-ho Kim's film "Into the Mirror") about a disgraced NYC cop (guess who) who takes on a night-shift security guard position in a haunted burned ruin of a department store that's titular reflective surfaces are harboring some pretty angry spirits. Laughable execution for the most part and forgettable; the film only merits a ½ star more for the nasty (literally) jaw-dropping sequence involving Smart.
THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (2012) **** Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Anne Hathaway, Marion Cotillard, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Matthew Modine, Alon Aboutboul Ben Mendelsohn, Burn Gorman, Daniel Sunjata, Nestor Carbonell, Brett Cullen, Juno Temple, Tom Conti (SPOILER - Cameos: Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy) The grand finale in maestro filmmaker Christopher Nolan's gargantuan thrill-machine with the comic-book franchise reboot of The Caped Crusader making a comeback to Gotham in a self- imposed eight-year exile after the death of DA Harvey Dent that resulted in a peaceful crime- depleted sabbatical until. cue entrance of impenetrable, powerful brute and ex-mercenary spawn from hell, Bane (Hardy in a face-hugging Darth Vaderean life/death mask), a formidable foe for arthritic, ailing secluded billionaire Bruce Wayne (Bale validating his place in the cinematic pantheon for a well-executed recreation of the mythos of Batman and his alter ego), facing entrepreneurial and financial woes. Adding fuel to the fire is master cat burglar come fly-or cat- in the ointment silky Selina Kyle (Hathaway vamping and having a field day kicking ass and kissing off any pretense of what makes her sexy!) with plans of her own. The heavy-laden screenplay by Nolan with his brother Jonathan and collaborator of the series David S. Goyer manage to touchstone on practically everything in its kitchen sink timely-socio/politico themes including the entitled '1 %" getting a comeuppance from the masses; identity crises; facing the real truths (looking within can only be obtained with help from outside); and basically overcoming fears and obstacles in being what is true to you: good will triumph over evil. always! Some radical and pulse-pounding action sequences to the hilt including the opening mid-(h)airy plane jacking and a few improvements on the Batmobile while introducing the beastly aero vehicle of mayhem, "The Bat". Waycool as always with fantastic cinematography by Wally Pfister, (and a must see in IMAX format that always envelops instead of smothers!), epic production design by Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh (ably supported by having Manhattan (FINALLY displayed as Gotham's rightful geographic Doplleganger - as well as such diverse cities as LA and Newark, NJ !) with omnisciently awesome orchestrals by the one and only Hans Zimmer. The returning ace ensemble of Oldman as the on-the-mend commissioner JIm Gordon; Caine as the avuncular manservant Alfred; smooth operator Foreman as Lucius Fox, the procurer of bad-ass toys and weaponry of Wayne Enterprises; with newcomers Gordon-Levitt as a rookie cop cut of the same cloth of Gordon and Wayne and cosmopolitan Cotillard as Bruce's love-interest with more at stake in a clean fuel invention of some pointed interest. One of the year's best and arguably one of the best trilogies of all time.
THERE WILL BE BLOOD (2007) ***1/2 Daniel Day-Lewis, Paul Dano, Dillon Freasier, Ciaran Hinds, Kevin J. O'Connor, Sydney McCallister, David Willis, Christine Olejniczak, Kellie Hill, Russell Harvard, Hans Howes. Paul Thomas Anderson's monumental leap to the forefront of American directors ranks him high with the likes of Kubrick, Altman and Welles in this epic look at Daniel Plainview, an oil-baron in the making (a ferociously memorable performance by Day-Lewis channeling John Huston's crusty voice) at the turn of the 20th century, and the implications for his power thirst hindering his only bond with humanity: his young son, H.W. (spookily mute Freasier), and the price he pays for it all. Dano is also noteworthy as a fire- and-brimstone revival day preacher who is the thorn in Plainview's side. Anderson's reach may exceed his grasp but he is helped splendidly by the rich cinematography of Robert Elswit, a pitch-perfect production design by Jack Fisk, and an unnerving, haunting chamber- music like score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood.
LIFE OF PI (2012) **** Suraj Sharma, Irrfan Khan, Adil Hussain, Tabu, Rafe Spall, Gerard Depardieu, Sames Saito, Jun Naito. Ang Lee's masterful adaptation of the best selling novel by Yann Martel about a young man's survival of an ocean liner sinking castaway with only its other sole survivor, his family's zoo's Bengal tiger. Told in flashback with a few digressions about faith, religion, the human spirit and ultimately the meaning of life, this journey into one's soul is remarkably captured with impressive CGI (Richard Parker, the aforementioned fierce companion), gorgeously stunning cinematography by Claudio Miranda and a stripped down screenplay by David Magee propels the story with some amazing set pieces of nature unleashed as well as the inner voice we all share: what is my life REALLY about? Poignant, funny and ultimately life- affirming; a must see and the 3D is truly amazingly captured at full force.
SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN (2012) *** 1/2 Kristen Stewart, Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Sam Claflin, Sam Spruell, Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, Eddie Marsan, Toby Jones, Johnny Harris, Brian Gleeson, Vincent Regan, Noah Huntley, Liberty Ross, Christopher Obi, Lily Cole. Excellent revisionistic take on the childhood classic about the virtuous princess Snow White remained as a warrior-in-the-making with Stewart as the imperiled royal whose evil stepmother queen Theron (in a hiss worthy turn of pure blackhearted nefarity) wants her purity to remain eternally young at any means necessary including the enlisting of noble Hemsworth as the mournful huntsman to procure her heart! Grimm story indeed! A great looking piece of filmmaking by relative newcomer Rupert Sanders who deftly allows the fairy tale to become a Tolkein infused revenge/quest action set call to arms notably in the band of dwarfs (a gaggle of Britain's best digitally added to the bodies of smaller stand- ins ala LORD OF THE RINGS). Handsomely shot by Greig Fraser and a truly gorgeous production design by Dominc Watkins truly puts you in another realm (the jaw-dropping Enchanted Forest is a masterpiece of filmmaking altogether).
BAD GRANDPA (2013) *** Johnny Knoxville, Jackson Nicoll, Catherine Keener. Frequently hilarious offshoot of "Jackass" with Knoxville (under all that latex make-up) reprising his dirty old man Irving Zisman, an 86 year old reprobate, who finds himself saddled with an estranged grandson (roly poly Nicoll, a Mini-Me of the octogenarian) shortly after the death of his wife (yes that's Keener in a cameo). A road-trip plot is besides the point in this strung along sketch by sketch gross-out gag after another with unsuspecting stooges (i.e. real people) being pranked to the hilt. Somewhere Allan Funt is rolling over in his grave with this latter day crass 'Candid Camera' ; everyone else you're on your own for good clean filthy fun. (Dir: Jeff Tremaine)
MARLEY & ME (2008) *** Owen Wilson, Jennifer Aniston, Eric Dane, Kathleen Turner, Alan Arkin, Nathan Gamble, Finley Jacobsen, Lucy Merriam. Heart-warming adaptation of John Grogan's best seller about a recently married couple (Wilson and Aniston) who adopt a cute Labrador puppy that becomes a rambunctious force of nature in the long run. Funny, sweet and at times poignant look at how pets can become very much a part of our lives and the lifelong affects throughout that special relationship. Wilson and Aniston have fine chemistry but it's the 22 supporting dogs that steal the show as Marley. (Dir : David Frankel)
THE SIMPSONS MOVIE (2007) ***1/2 (VOICES OF: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria, Marcia Wallace, Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor, Karl Widergott, Maggie Roswell, Philiip Rosenthal, Albert Brooks, Joe Mantegna, CAMEOS AS THEMSELVES : Green Day , Tom Hanks) Finally, 18 years in the making, the greatest  and longest running  TV animated comedy hits the silver screen retaining all its iconoclastic brio, sharp-witted comic dialogue, slapstick, running social commentary, and most importantly  heart, yet feeling frankly like a 'special episode' of three shows strung together with Springfield's yellow-skinned family on the outs after paterfamilias doofus Homer (the genius Castellaneta) pollutes the town's water source forcing them to be fugitives and an EPA edict run by a nefarious agent (Brooks in a ferociously funny turn) bio-doming their populace. Breakneck jokes at a rat-a-tat-tat pace, knowing asides to superfans, extended cameos of fringe characters (i.e. Comic Book Guy who might best surmise: "Best. Episode. Ever."), and two-words: "Spider-Pig". 11 of the series' top writers collaborated on Matt Groening's pop culture phenom with antagonistic glee and veteran show director David Silverman does not skimp on the funny. Woo-Hoo!!!
HANNA (2011) ***1/2 Saorise Ronan, Eric Bana, Cate Blanchett, Olivia Williams, Jason Flemyng, Jessica Barden, Aldo Maland. Adrenalized action thriller with Ronan surprisingly well cast as a feral girl 'programmed' to be an assassin with uncanny skills and a rabid Fed (ice-in-her-veins Blanchett) hot on her tail not unlike "The Fugitive" meets "La Femme Nikita". Director Joe Wright pumps the action sequences at full-throttle with nimble cinematography by Alwin H. Kuchler and kinetic editing by Paul Tothill with some dark shadings and humor thanks to a lively energized screenplay by Seth Lochhead and David Farr making for an enjoyable race.
THE TREE OF LIFE (2011) ***1/2 Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Sean Penn, Hunter McCracken, Laramie Eppler, Tye Sheridan, Fiona Shaw. Filmmaker Terence Malick's return to form navel-gazing and decidedly meta focus on an American family during the 1950s is recalled in flashback by Penn, whose love/hate relationship with his contradictive, stern, and complex paterfamilias (deftly played with subliminal grace by Pitt). Fresh-faced newcomer McCracken (as Penn's childhood alter ego) uncannily resembles and expresses the innate sadness of his counterpart. While there are some artistic touches of whispered narration (which I normally HATE but it is lyrically well used here), Malich's tone poem of What Is It All About actually encompasses cosmic depths and prehistoric flashbacks (literally!) but the impressive visuals and gorgeous camera-work by Emmanuel Lubezki and the ethereal soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat transcends no matter the odds.
THE RAILWAY MAN (2014) *** Colin Firth, Nicole Kidman, Stellan Skarsgard, Jeremy Irvine, Tanroh Ishida, Sam Reid, Hiroyuki Sanada. Firth gives an excellent performance in this true-life account of former British Army officer Eric Lomax who was a WWII POW brutally tortured by his Japanese captors whose actions long dormant awakens anew when his marriage to Kidman faces shattering. Faced with the past, Lomax must decide in taking vengeance when his fellow survivor and best friend Skarsgard discovers his chief tormentor to be alive and well. Well directed by Jonathan Teplitzky and a bare bones to the point adaptation based on Lomax' memoir by Frank Cottrell Boyce and Andy Paterson only falters in the Kidman's character basically left in the wind. Equally good is Irvine as the young Lomax in the harrowing flashbacks with stiff-upper lip bravado.
SOUND CITY (2013) **** Rock star Dave Grohl's epic valentine rockumentary to the SoCal titular recording studio whose history of engineering some of rock's epic albums runs the gamut from its early days in the mid-'60s thru it's golden age of the '70s as well as the ups and downs of the later eras reads like a Who's Who of Contemporary Music with heartfelt confessionals, clear-eyed testimonials and epiphanies for those in the know of what it truly means to Create Art. The nitty-gritty of show business in the record industry and the potboiler approach to its talking heads has a genuine warmth and Love for their crafts. Fun, entertaining and a must see for anyone who's ever been imbued with the power of music (rock in particular). One of the year's best documentaries and best films bar none.
THE SOLOIST (2009) **1/2 Jamie Foxx, Robert Downey, Jr., Catherine Keener, Nelsan Ellis, Lisa Gay Hamilton. Well-acted yet middling drama based on fact about LA Times columnist Steve Lopez (Downey) who comes across a homeless man named Nathaniel Ayers (Foxx) who he learns was a one-time gifted musical prodigy whose bout with schizophrenia has caused his ongoing downward spiral. In spite some exemplary acting by the two leads in this Oscar-bait type of storytelling, ultimately the plot line's familiarity becomes a hindrance (based on Lopez' book and adapted tellingly by Susannah Grant's telling screenplay adaptation), and the results maddening, to say the least. (Dir: Joe Wright)
LOVE HAPPENS (2009) ** Aaron Eckhart, Jennifer Aniston, Dan Fogler, John Carroll Lynch, Martin Sheen, Judy Greer, Frances Conroy. Dead-in-the-water romantic dramedy about a grieving self-help speaker (Eckhart, seemingly ill-at-ease and decidedly miscast as a mild-mannered type)_whose seminar lands him in Seattle to promote and winds up falling for an earthy florist (Aniston coasting on her charms) with predictability and pathos. Blame the connect-the-dots-screenplay by novice director Brandon (Son of Joe) Camp and Mike Thompson that teeters into maudlin awfulness. Carroll Lynch saves the film from being a complete disaster as one of Eckhart's attendees who has lost his young son; he steals the film.
GRINDHOUSE (2007) **** Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Jeff Fahey, Michael Biehn, Naveen Andrews, Stacy Ferguson, Nicky Katt, Tom Savini, Carlos Gallardo, Electra Isabel Avellan, Elise Avellan, Michael Parks, Bruce Willis, Kurt Russell, Rosario Dawson, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Zoe Bell, Michael Bacall, Eli Roth, Monica stags, Tim Murphy, Marta Mendoza, Kelley Robins, Danny Trejo, Nicolas Cage, Sybill Danning, Marcy Harriell, Udo Kier, Sheri Moon Zombie, Bill Moseley, Tom Towles. Slam-bang retro valentine to exploitation flicks spooled on the titular type of movie palaces during the '60s & '70s features two-for- the-price-of-one offering from maverick filmmakers Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino with gleeful, giddy, gore-galore gusto. First up: "Planet Terror", Rodriguez Gran Guignol ode to John Carpenter, focusing on a sleepy Texas town suddenly thriving with a plague of zombies and the rag-tag motley crew assembled to save the world including go-go dancer McGowan as Cherry Darling, who is essentially sex as a weapon: when she loses her right leg to the ravenous horde after a car accident she's fused to a machine gun from her lover, anti-hero Rodriguez (that would be Freddy, not the director)  making for a truly iconic character for the 21st century. Buckets of blood by the gallon, with some inventive make-up by vets KNB EFX  and a nifty homage to guru Savini as a hapless town deputy too boot; a killer score and sharp trademark editing by Rodriguez (now you can say Robert!) and a tongue-thru-cheek send-up of all the genre flicks hitting all its marks perfectly. Next up, the closer: "Death Proof" from QT (who appears in both films in cameo roles), getting in touch with his inner Roger Corman, is homage to the slasher film with a twist: instead of a knife, the killer uses a souped-up muscle car stalking young, nubile women. Russell, as Stuntman Mike, is perfectly cast as the scarred and scary sociopath who comes upon two sets of a quartet of babes in his line of sight. The women in peril are all equally cool, sexy and do their best with QT's foot fetish in full bloom, and, admittedly chatty sequences which actually slows things down to a taut razor-line of menace but succeeds with the breathless car chases and the one crash has the gut-wrenching, squeamish tone of a snuff film; 'nuff said. Kudos to QT for using Jack Nitzsche's "The Last Race" theme from '60s sci-fi teenager junk "Village of The Giants" and inserting the love theme from "Blow Out" as well! Now if they only could get the sticky, tacky feel of the floors of yore, you'd swear it was 1979 again! Oh and the faux trailers inserted throughout by Rob Zombie, Eli Roth, Edgar Wright and Rodriguez - (respectively, "Werewolf Women of the S.S.", "Thanksgiving", "Don't Scream" and "Machete  are worth the price of admission alone; pricelessly subversive.
BIUTIFUL (2010) *** Javier Bardem gives a powerful tour-de-force turn in his latest collaboration with Spanish filmmaker Alejnadro Gonzalez Inarritu, as Uxbal, a Barcelona scrounger attempting to get his affairs  foreign & domestic  in order before succumbing to the death sentence of cancer. A well-meaning father who loves his children (Hanaa Bouchaib and Guillermo Estrella) yet lives less than a presentable life and has his work cut out with their estranged mother (Maricel Alvarez), an addict and a hooker whose occasionally annoying presence threatens to take over the storyline (which frankly is overloaded with two other linear tales including illegal immigration and a sweatshop). One of the film's most breathtaking visuals: heaven imagined as a pristine snow blanketed burnt out forest.
THE LAST MIMZY (2007) **1/2 Chris O"Neil, Rhiannon Leigh Wryn, Joely Richardson, Timothy Hutton, Rainn Wilson, Kathryn Hahn, Michael Clarke Duncan. So-so adaptation of the short story by CL Moore & Henry Kuttner about a young brother and sister (newcomers O'Neil and Wryn) who discover a magical box with equally supernatural gifts including a 'taking' stuffed bunny who instructs the kids to help an alien race with only calling the US Homeland Security to intervene in the end run. The screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin, Toby Emmerich, James V. Hart & Carol Skilken attempts to spin the yarn into a 21st century "E.T." but only manages to leave many large plot holes and some convoluted histrionics in the process. However the two young charges are charming enough, surrounded by a sound ensemble particularly Wilson as their Neo-Hippie science teacher who shares their connection. Nice whimsical musical score by Howard Shore (and an uncredited Greg LaPorta). (Dir: Robert Shaye)
HAPPY- GO - LUCKY (2008) *** Sally Hawkins, Eddie Marsan, Alexis Zegerman, Samuel Roukin, Karina Fernandez, Kate O'Flynn, Sylvestra Le Touzel, Caroline Martin, Oliver Maltman, Sarah Niles. Hawkins gives an Oscar worthy performance as the titular "Poppy" Cross, an indefatigably jocular Brit school teacher, who positively embues the word, good-hearted, whose joyful nature gets the best of her as she takes on all her social pitfalls and daily set-backs with a smile on her face and a joke to break the heartache deep under-the-surface. Acclaimed English filmmaker Mike Leigh allows his talent to showcase her genuine achievement in making Poppy a flesh-and-blood character and Hawkins' tightrope balance from splendid to borderline annoying is a dizzying accomplishment. Equally good is Marsan as Poppy's complete antithesis, a rage-aholic driving instructor whose seething anger cannot betray his true emotions (or can they)? A small gem of a film.
INTO THE WOODS (2014) ** Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, James Corden, Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, Johnny Depp, Daniel Huttlestone, Christine Baranksi, Tammy Blanchard, Lucy Punch, Tracey Ullman, Lila Crawford, Mackenzie Mauzy, Billy Magnussen, Frances de la Tour. Middling adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim/James Lapine Broadway smash with a star-studded cast in a re-imagining of Grimm's Fairy Tales as an amalgam of familiar characters with decidedly darker (and far more mean-spirited) tones that frankly is a chore and a bore of a musical no thanks to the uninspired direction of Rob Marshall and some truly WTF moments (i.e. Depp's 'costume/make-up' as a lupine pimp come pedophile!) Biggest gripe (pun intended) is the grotesque giantess in the final climax (if you're going to 're-imagine' how about making her a hottie and not some old hag that looks like Maggie Smith out of rehab?!) Oy!
MANDELA: LONG WALK TO FREEDOM (2013) *** Idris Elba, Naomi Harris. Biopic about the life and times of South Africa's most vocal opponent of apartheid Nelson Mandela (embodied fully by Elba in a low-key yet powerful turn) whose arduous trek to freedom suffers many pitfalls including his lengthy prison sentence, loss of family members and the perilous marriage to his equally stoic proponent of protest Winnie (Harris acquits herself nicely). Based on Mandela's own autobiography screenwriter William Nicholson seems to skim a bit over the decades yet Justin Chadwick's surefooted and subtle moments of direction show its subject in repose.
THE GOOD SHEPHERD (2006) ** Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Alec Baldwin, Tammy Blanchard, Billy Crudup, Robert De Niro, Keir Dullea, Michael Gambon, Martina Gedeck, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, Gabriel Macht, Lee Pace, Joe Pesci, Eddie Redmayne, John Sessions, John Turturro. Listless, bloodless epic account of the beginning of the CIA seen through the ambitious eyes of new recruit Damon (who does an able bodied job altogether), whose personal life suffers in the pursuit for Truth, Justice and the American way in this logily paced pet project directed by De Niro (who has a small role as a mentor to Damon). The blunt yet unaffecting screenplay by Eric Roth hinders the lengthy ping-ponging back and forth of timeline (i.e "it's 1946, no it's 1961, no it's 1952"!) and a bloated cast (Jolie is utterly wasted in a thankless role) round out just a few of the problems in this misguided attempt to look at a truly intriguing subject matter. Noteworthy is Blanchard as a deaf girlfriend, who steals the film.
PRISONERS (2013) ***1/2 Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, Paul Dano, Dylan Minnette, Zoe Borde, Erin Gerasimovich, Kyla Drew Simmons, Wayne Duvall, Len Cariou, David Dastmalchian. Gripping crime drama centered on a dual child abduction with both the law and family flummoxed to the point of extremes in finding the truth and justice (and the blind spots along the way) as the clock ticks to an inevitable climax of the point of no return. Excellent cast and a pinpricking screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski galvanized what could've been a run-of-the-mill vengeance melodrama thanks largely to shrewd and unnerving direction by Denis Villeneuve who generously takes his time in allowing enough rope for his audience to either hang onto (or hang themselves) from the utmost horror - the unknown. Jackman and Gyllenhaal give career performances as one of the aggrieved fathers and the insularly dogged police detective who share the common bond: the truth.
CHANGELING (2008) *** Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich, Jeffrey Donovan, Colm Feore, Amy Ryan, Denis O'Hare, Jason Butler Harner, Devon Conti, Gattlin Griffith. Jolie gives one of her strongest performances to date in this true life account of a missing child case in LA circa 1928, that shed light onto the corruption of the police department in their cover-up in 'solving' the crime, forcing the child's mother to continue to pursue the fact the child 'found' was not hers. Directed with sure steady skill by Clint Eastwood, the film is engrossing and nearly unbearable in the gradual tension as new pieces to the puzzle begin to fit, and the particularly chilling darker final act will haunt you forever.
28 WEEKS LATER (2007) ***1/2 Robert Carlyle, Catherine McCormack, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Imogen Poots, Mackintosh Muggleton, Harold Perrineau., Idris Elba.. Excellent sequel to "28 DAYS LATER" about a 'rage virus' pandemic that unleashes zombie-like symptoms upon the recovering British populace with a family attempting to outrun the plague with the assist of some sympathetic American soldiers embedded for the apocalyptic showdown. Infused with adrenaline pumping action sequences and more scary the terrifying silences created by newcomer director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo inheriting the mantle from executive producing filmmaker Danny Boyle, aided and abetted by the maddeningly herky- jerky yet affective cinematography by Enrique Chediak and the jarringly bombastic score by John Murphy sends a shock to the system and unnerves the gooseflesh from the core dread of the unexpected ready to pounce. Bloody good ongoing chapter in the ensuing franchise.
BREACH (2007) *** Chris Cooper , Ryan Phillippe, Laura Linney, Caroline Dhavernas, Gary Cole, Dennis Haysbert, Kathleen Quinlan, Bruce Davison. Absorbing adaptation of the true- life account of FBI's taking down of one of their own, Robert Hanssen (Cooper in a stellar performance), who sold out his country to the Russians for 25 years until his arrest in 2001, thanks to a young, hungry agent Eric O'Neill (Phillippe, ditto), who was put into place by a covert operation causing a rift in O'Neill's situation: being mentored by a manipulative, charismatic rat. Well scripted by Adam Mazer, William Rotko, & director Billy Ray who weaves a taut, sharp & clever storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat even though the outcome is already infamously realized.
THE NAMESAKE (2007) **** Irfan Khan, Tabu, Kal Penn, Sahira Nair, Zuleikha Robinson, Glenne Headly, Daniel Gerroll, Jacinda Barrett, Brooke Smith. Excellent adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri's novel about two generations of an Indian family  an immigrant couple named Ashoke and Ahima Ganguli (Khan and the beatific Tabu, both terrific and Oscar worthy), and their offspring Gogol and Sonia (Penn in his best role to date and Nair)  who acclimate to their new environs of New York City with much heartache, pride and ultimately unrequited love they share in the years of living abroad from their homeland. Director Mira Nair depicts the harsh realities, small miracles and daily affirmations with deft skill showcasing her actors with ample room to emote and her visual eye offers lyrical majestic strokes. The screenplay by Sooni Taraporevala gets to the heart of the matter: how generations so close can drift so far apart and it is never too late to realize just how much one person can lover another, even if it means sacrificing for those who cannot recognize it. One of the year's best films.
CYRUS (2010) *** John C. Reilly, Jonah Hill, Marisa Tomei, Catherine Keener, Matt Walsh. Winningly awkward comedy/drama about sad sack divorcée Reilly (never more schlumpier as our latter-day Walter Matthau, nor better!) whose attempt to get back into the swing of things (with some meaningful pushing from his way-too-supportive ex Keener) meets an unlikely looker (Tomei shining her wares too) who strike up a fast relationship much to the chagrin of her young adult son (Hill as the titular foil in funny/creepy mode to a T) where this odd triangle comes to a head with hilarious results. Written & directed by 'mumblecore' indie gods The Duplass brothers, Mark & Jay, with their trademark clumsy poignancy.
ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE (2014) *** Tilda Swinton, Tom Hiddleston, Mia Waskiowska, Anton Yelchin, John Hurt, Jeffrey Wright. Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch's dourly droll look at modern-day vampirism finds its way into the uniquely hip relationship in the undead coupling of Adam and Eve (Hiddleston and Swinton perfectly matched in angst and anomie) who find themselves facing mortality (and the lack of inspiration) as a rock musician and his muse. Wonderfully off-beat and clever new turns of the mythology (referring to the living as 'zombies' too wit). Hurt is a hoot as Christopher Marlowe (!) One of the year's gems.
KILLER JOE (2012) **** Matthew McConaughey, Emile Hirsch, Juno Temple, Thomas Haden Church, Gina Gershon. A nasty piece of pulp fiction neo noir at full boil with spectacular performances by the entire cast makes it all the more interesting to watch this slo-mo-train- wreck of a film (this is a compliment!) in you cannot take your eyes off the screen for one minute! White trash loser Hirsch (in a nice turn of his true talent and versatility) owing thousands (and probably his life) to a local mobster, decides to off his miserable mother for the insurance money promised to his sister, by hiring corrupt Texas detective cum hit man Killer Joe (McConaughey in a an Oscar-worthy turn in a career high turning point) whose clear-eyed sociopathic tendencies tend to get in the way of his desire to have a domestic life of some sort; to wit: in exchange for payment on his services he gets a piece of flesh in the form of Hirsch's baby-doll-shrewder-than-she-appears virgin sister (Temple in a knockout turn of a character one minute you want to strangle, the next you want to hug - no mean feat) - and even far deadlier consequences for his highly dysfunctional family. Veteran filmmaker William Friedkin pulls no punches in the unflinching violence and subject matter (arguably one of the best NC-17 films ever) nor does the tightening-of-the-screws-sadistic screenplay by Tracy Letts (who both collaborated on BUG) with a sadistic grace. Haden as the truly morale-less patriarch and dumb as dirt hick is great comic relief and Gershon, a truly underrated actress, hits an inside-the-park-home run in her nervy turn as his slattern wife and has the unfortunate job of easily the most cringe-worthy moment in the film (let's just say you'll never be able to look at a piece of Kentucky Fried Chicken the same way again) and deserves an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress. Again McConaughey's charismatic creep is the real deal as a villain you can't take your sights off and echoes Robert Mitchum's monster in NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. Southern Gothic Finger Lickin' Good; One of The Year's Best.
CHILDREN OF MEN (2006) ***1/2 Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Charlie Hunnam, Danny Huston, Claire-Hope Ashitey, Peter Mullan, Pam Ferris. Well-crafted sci-fi parable mix of "Blade Runner" meets "12 Monkeys" about the near-future with bleak outlook: the world is no longer a population explosion thanks to an unnamed reason for women to no longer give birth amidst the ongoing conflicts that have destroyed all of western civilization with Great Britain the last great hope going under. Owen gives a complex and excellent turn as a man faced with the impossible task of protecting a young woman whose miracle pregnancy may prove a ticket to his own salvation. Directed with panache by Alfonso Cuaron (who collaborated with 4 other screenwriters based on PD James' novel), the gritty you-are-there documentary style cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki makes it a too-close-for-comfort war-torn elegy.
PAUL BLART: MALL COP (2009) ** Kevin James, Keir O'Donnell, Jayma Mays, Raini Rodriguez, Shirley Knight, Stephen Rannazzisi, Peter Gerety, Bobby Cannavale, Adam Ferrarra, Jamal Nixud, Adhir Kaylan. Predictable and occasionally humorous mix of comedy and action - a "DIE HARD @ THE MALL" if you will  with lovable loser James as the titular hero facing the odds when a gang of thieves take over his territory on Black Friday (the day after Thanksgiving) by absconding with the vendors' credit card information. Slapstick silliness nearly thwarts the amiable James (who co-wrote the pedestrian script with fellow comic Nick Bakay) who acquits himself as a rather nimble physical comedian the likes of his portly predecessors John Belushi (for his Ninja-like moves), Chris Farley (for his good-natured idiotic moments) and closer fit to John Candy (an EveryFatman with a heart of gold). (Dir: Steve Carr)
LITTLE FOCKERS (2010) ** Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo, Owen Wilson, Jessica Alba, Laura Dern, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Harvey Keitel, Daisy Tahan, Colin Baiocchi, ,Thomas McCarthy. Lackluster sequel in the franchise with the ever challenged Greg Focker (Stiller) at odds with his domineering in-law Jack Byrnes (De Niro), who this time is attempting to find a godfather to his lineage should he pass and finding Focker to be the only candidate visits only to cause more harm than good while his son-in-law is trying to earn more for the clan thanks to an opportunity from an unlikely oversexed pharmaceutical rep (Alba sorely miscast as usual) (!) The proceedings at hand are a mixed bag with little mirth and its principal cast looking bored and tired. Blame Paul Weitz substituting Jay Roach as director for failing to provide some belly laughs to this inert comedy.
UNDERWORLD : AWAKENING (2012) **1/2 Kate Beckinsale, Stephen Rea, Michael Ealey, India Eisley, Charles Dance, Theo James, Sandrine Holt, Kris Holden-Ried. Pedestrian chapter for the most in the vampires vs. werewolves franchise with vampire Selene (Beckinsale still hot kicking ass in a catsuit) awakens from a 12 year induced hibernation to discover her kind  and her arch nemeses, the Lycans  are now facing extermination by the humans  and the key to both their survival lies in the fate of a bio-engineered hybrid in the form of a young girl (ethereal Eisley). While the team of Swede directors Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein keep things at a lively clip  with the graphic bloodshed at full speed ahead  the film is a tad anemic in its structure and feels a new transfusion is necessary to keep the series thriving (again Beckinsale is worth the price of admission alone) even with the limited 3-D Imax experience (i.e. 'in-your-face' dioramas at best).
BOLT (2008) *** (Voices of: John Travolta, Miley Cyrus, Susie Essman, Mark Walton, Malcolm McDowell, James Lipton, Greg Germann, Diedrich Bader, Nick Swardson) Winning Disney animated family fare with Travolta gamely voicing the titular pooch, a TV star, who winds up becoming a fish-out-of-water, when he sets out on the loose from his studio confines into the world to protect his owner Penny (Cyrus), with some help in the unlikely forms of a sarcastic street-smart alley cat (Essman) and a totally game for adventure at any cost hamster (Walton, who steals the film whole-heartedly). Fast-paced and footloose, the comedy and heart is equally balanced in this winning comedy of errors. (Directors:Byron Howard & Chris Williams)
HENRY POOLE IS HERE (2008) **** Luke Wilson, Radha Mitchell, Adriana Barraza, Morgan Lily, George Lopez, Cheryl Hines, Richard Benjamin, Rachel Seiferth, Beth Grant. Truly extraordinary dramedy about a sad and angry young man (Wilson in arguably his best work to date) who upon learning he is dying, buys a home in his old childhood memory and finds himself at the center of attraction when a mysterious stain appears on his house prompting a relentless next-door- neighbor (the wonderful Barraza) to claim it as a possibly miracle : since the stain looks like Jesus Christ. Added to the mix are Wilson's other next-door-neighbor (ethereally comely Mitchell, also giving a fabulous performance) and her silent daughter (newcomer Lily, a truly adorable and remarkably gifted young actress) whose equally somber lives intermingle with the reluctant new homeowner. Director Mark Pellington does an excellent job avoiding the mawkish and predictable with a splendid script by novice Albert Torres that is one of the best inspirational films I've seen in some time and how the need to make a connection/bond with another human being is overwhelmingly emotionally fulfilling. Truly one of the year's best and a small gem of a movie that had me in tears and smiles throughout.
THE RAVEN (2012) *** John Cusack, Luke Evans, Alice Eve, Brendan Gleeson, Kevin McNally, Oliver Jackson-Cohen. Revisionist fictional account in the What-IF scenario of What IF A Serial Killer Was Committing Grisly Crimes ala Edgar Allen Poe's Works? That's pretty much it in a nutshell with a very game Cusack (mixing bluff braggadocio ego and painful poignancy) as the besotted author days prior to his mysterious death in which he is enlisted by Baltimore's Finest to help solve a cache of horrendous murders all bearing the earmark of his famous works. To add salt to the self-inflicted wounds, his beloved Eve is on the murderer's list as the tock ticks.Filmmaker James McTeigue has staged a handsome 19th century period piece with great production design and a somewhat dizzying screenplay by Ben Livingston & Hannah Shakespeare keep things lively to a certain extent as the knotty plottings unfurl.
WALL*E (2008) **** (Vocal/s/f/x provided by Ben Burtt; voices of: Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin, John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy Sigourney Weaver; featuring Fred Willard) Pixar scores another instant classic and a bona fide animated masterpiece in this engagingly entertaining feat showcasing a lonely, fastidious refuse robot, Wall*E (sound editor Burtt providing the whimsical whirrs and woops) who comes across a sign of life in the future for Earth and the remote droid EVE (Knight) sent on an intergalactic mission back to the no-longer inhabitable planet to ascertain the data. Visually amazing and magical with many nods to sci-fi predecessors as varied as "E.T.", "AI". "2001", and "Alien" (nice nod with Weaver as the voice of the ship's computer!) Heartwarming, funny and with a unique 'green message'  save the planet! One of the year's very best films. (Dir: Andrew Stanton, who collaborated on the screenplay with Jim Capobianco)
INSIDIOUS (2011) **1/2 Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey, Leigh Whannell, Angus Sampson. "Paranormal Activity" meets "Poltergeist" is the best way to describe this derivative (particularly of the latter flick) about a family plagued by ghostly beings despite the attempt to move only to find the specters following themand deign to possess their comatose young son. One genuine shock (spoiled by the trailer!! Thank you Trailer!!) in seeing the nasty black & red demon  a bastard of Darth Maul/Freddy Kruger and the Bogeyman  is the only thing keeping this underwhelming scare fest alive with its B-movie tropes (i.e. creaking doors; shock 'jumps', & the telegraphic score!). Director James (the original "Saw") teams up again with scripting bud Whannell (who has a small role as a comic relief ghostbuster) but there is little magic (or horror) in the making.
PASSION (2013) * Rachel McAdams, Noomi Rapace, Karoline Herfurth, Paul Anderson. "All About Eve" meets "Dangerous Liaisons" could've been the pitch for this incredibly tedious and laughable corporate thriller from Brian De Palma (who you wouldn't know was responsible for such hackwork but for maybe one touch - his split-screen sequence which provides nothing but yawns) with ice queen McAdams as a cut-throat advertising manager whose nasty work ethics (or lack of) take its limits for long-suffering wannabe assistant Rapace while embroiled in a kinky lovers' triangle with Anderson (in full bounder mode at best) - resulting in murder, drugs, Sapphic desire and blackmail. The whole imbroglio simmers as a potboiler with the cook sadly offering flavorless broth. While based on a European film "Love Crimes" (which I never saw or even heard of); one of the year's absolute worsts.
JACK RYAN : SHADOW RECRUIT (2014) ** Chris Pine, Keira Knightley, Kevin Costner, Kenneth Branagh, Lenn Kurjawizki, Alec Utgoff, Peter Andersson, Elena Velikanova, Nonso Anozie, Seth Ayott, Colm Feore, Gemma Chan, (Uncredited: Mikhail Baryshnivkov) Pedestrian reboot of the Tom Clancy spy thrillers with a fairly wooden Pine as green CIA analyst Jack Ryan recruited by cagy straight-forward Cosnter to aid in abetting a Soviet plot to cause the US economy to come to a halt via terrorism on American soil. While screenwriters Adam Cozand and David Koepp attempt to rejuvenate a Cold-War anti-hero the stale dialogue and yawn-worthy tech savvy (i.e. watching another download while the clocks ticks away; really?!) hooey has one pining for Harrison Ford. Branagh's villainous Russkie with a borscht-thick accent barely acquits his acting while serving double duty directing this vehicle on cruise control barely sustains a quickening of the pulse and instead a frequent roll-of-the-eye.
GEORGIA RULE (2007) **1/2 Jane Fonda, Lindsay Lohan, Felicity Huffman, Dermot Mulroney, Cary Elwes, Garrett Hedlund, Hector Elizondo, Dylan McLaughlin, Zachary Gordon, Laurie Metcalf., Paul Williams. Uneven mix of comedy and drama about three generations of an estranged family with troubled troublemaking Lohan, the daughter of problem drinker Huffman, is dumped off with her propreitous grandmother Fonda for the summer. Director Garry Marshall has his hands full with some unwieldy themes (i.e. incest) that ultimately outweighs the comic premise overall making it an awkward juxtaposition in spite of some fine acting, notably Lohan's best to date.
THE BABADOOK (2014) ***1/2 Essie Davis, Noah Wiseman, Daniel Henshall, Hayley McElhinney, Barbara West. Unsettling and spooky horror film from newbie Australian filmmaker Jennifer Kent that touchstones on Grimm' fairy tales and Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. To wit: Davis (in a remarkable performance) stars as a woman in a downward spiral still grieving the death of her husband in a car accident en route to deliver their son (Wiseman, a real find) who is growing to be a troubled young boy with a vivid imagination as the two find themselves under a curse from a mysterious book featuring the titular monster hellbent on possessing them both. Skillfully shot by Radek Ladczuk with a palette of black, greys and desaturated blue/greens giving the film a funereal, gaunt look with unsettling framing of 'something' just lurking within and a nerve jangling sound design by Frank Lipson. Moments of dread seep in with dank élan. A truly disturbing work of art and one of the best horror films in quite some time.
DEAD SILENCE (2007) * Ryan Kwanten, Amber Valletta, Donnie Wahlberg, Michael Fairman, Joan Heney, Bob Gunton, Laura Regan. Very disappointing horror tale concocted by original "Saw" tag-team James Wan and Leigh Whannell about a young man (bland Kwanten) investigating the inexplicably horrific murder of his wife that leads to his hometown harboring a secret involving the ghost of a vengeful female ventriloquist (!) The over-the-top production design attempts to do the 'boo factor' to the nth degree in its paper-thin premise and instead of offering homicidal dummies instead lapses into a ridiculous slasher film with one of the dumbest endings in recent memory. You'd be a dummy to go.
CEDAR RAPIDS (2011) **** Ed Helms, John C. Reilly, Anne Heche, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Stephen Root, Kurtwood Smith, Alia Shawkat, Rob Corddry, Mike O' Malley, Mike Birbiglia, Sigourney Weaver. Helms gives a masterful (and seriously for my money an Oscar-worthy) comical performance as a man-child Midwestern insurance agent named Tim Lippe who is sent to a convention in the titular city to save his company and in the process learns some life lessons, how to get wild and cut loose & making lifetime friends with his fellow colleagues including the rock-steady Whitlock, hellcat Heche and wild-card vulgarian Reilly (who truly steals the show as a hard-drinking, fun-loving troublemaker with a heart of gold, whose lout helps Helms break out of his shell and in the process saves him form a life of mediocrity.) The genius screenplay by relative newcomer Phil Johnston shrewdly has his hip-to-be-squares be well-rounded individuals with enough flavor not to be living cartoons and director Michael Arteta gives an even flow to his comedic set pieces building up into a surprisingly emotional and heartfelt comedy. Again Helms manages the difficult balance of parody and affection with aplomb. One of the funniest, laugh-out-loud  and endearing - comedies in years!
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014) **** Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, F. Murray Abraham, Mathieu Amalric, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Larry Pine, Lea Seydoux,Giselda Volodi, Florian Lukas, Bob Balaban, Fisher Stevens, Wallace Wolodarsky, Waris Ahluwalia. Wunderkind filmmaker Wes Anderson continues to outdo himself in all matters of whimsy in this mirth-filled mischievous romp set in a fictional European country in flashback 1932 with bisexual bon vivant Fiennes (having a field day) as the concierge of the eponymous posh establishment taking a new 'lobby boy' (newcomer Revolori) under his wing as mentor/protégé and embroiled in an inheritance battle of wits involving a priceless painting, thuggish vulgarians and a dash of sharp-witted observations thrown in for good measure. Resplendent production design by Adam Stockhausen, Robert D. Yeoman's picture perfect cinematography and a cheeky screenplay by Anderson and Hugo Guinness inspired by Stefan Zweig's canon the film is a well-oiled machinery enmeshed with a crazy quilt more-than-a-cameo filled cast of Who's Who all relishing their moments however brief of irreverency and tact(less) behavior. Fun, funny and surprisingly poignant with a hint of historical nostalgia of what could've/should've been. Finally the first Must See Film of 2014!
THE MIST (2007) *** Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden, Andre Braugher, Toby Jones, William Sadler, Jefferey DeMunn, Frances Sternhagen, Alexa Davalos, Nathan Gamble, Chris Owen, Sam Witwer. Decent Stephen King adaptation by filmmaker  and accomplished King adaptor  Frank Darabont, about the mysterious titular weather occurrence that envelops a small Maine town forcing customers of a supermarket to seek refuge from a doomsday supernatural event. A pastiche of "THE THING", "THE BIRDS", and "THE TWILIGHT ZONE"'S 'The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street" incorporating end-of-the-world paranoia, mob mentality, and creepy crawly '50s B-movie monsters with spooky results and a truly controversial ending that may leave one with a bad aftertaste for such a grisly good time otherwise.
THE INVASION (2007) ** Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Jeremy Northam, Jackson Bond, Jeffrey Wright, Veronica Cartwright, Josef Sommer, Celia Weston, Roger Rees. Lackluster remake of the sci-fi chiller "The Invasion of The Body Snatchers" with an alien parasitic organism that hitches a ride on the Space Shuttle which crashes releasing it to an unsuspecting Washington, DC populace including psychiatrist Kidman who suddenly sees odd behavior in her patients and the slowly adding of 2 and 2 to the threat at hand. In spite of some state-of-the-art visuals which vary from cool to boring, the film suffers by not focusing more on the social strata than the geopolitical climate which its forbearers had the good insight to do just that. Kudos to having some insight to have Cartwright (from the vastly superior first remake in 1978) on board as one of Kidman's troubled patients; and yes it's true the Wachowski Brothers were hired to pump up the climactic chase sequence. (Dir: Oliver Hirschbiegel)
THE LAST WINTER (2007) *** Ron Perlman, James LeGros, Connie Britton, Kevin Corrigan, Jamie Harrold, Pato Hoffmann, Zach Gilford, Joanne Shenandoah, Halfdan Theodorsson. "An Inonvenient Truth" meets "The Shining"Set in the bleak, no-man's land of endless ice and snow at the Arctic Circle an American oil research team is about to unleash something unknowingly with deep repercussions. So is the simple plotting for such a well-structured, taut thriller from filmmaker Larry Fessenden, an indie who may have found his calling (in spite of his previous lame horror flick "Wendigo" in 2001.Led by macho hooligan Ed Pollock (veteran character actor Perlman's formidable presence enhances the scale of the icy terrain that engulfs his party), a dedicated company man for the monolithic North Corporation that has a dog in the fight for locating energy resources, namely oil, in the Alaskan frontier. Spearheading the developmental project months in the making is researcher James Hoffman (LeGros, nicely underplaying here); fellow scientist Abby Sellers (Britton), who shares his bed much to the disgruntlement of Pollock who had an affair with Abby previously (this leads to the underneath the surface tension as a metaphor for the unstable tundra too boot); mechanic/engineer Motor (Corrigan ably lending some color to the territory ahead); Hoffman's aide-de-camp and computer geek Elliot Jenkins (nicely played by Harrold); Native Americans Lee Means (Hoffmann), a guide, and Dawn Russell (Shenandoah) the camp's cook and soothsayer; and lastly newcomer Maxwell McKinder (ably played by Gilford), one of the company's head honcho's wet-behind-the-ears son and family friend of Pollock's, who proves to be a key to the unlocked mystery of their environs.What comes across as an atypical ghost story/Indian folklore (Fessenden again brings up the aforementioned 'wendigo' a spectral being of nefarious means) mixed with "Twilight Zone" trappings of the familiar small band of isolated people faced with fending of their fears and a possible life-and-death scenario: something is in the fiercely howling winds and it's getting closer under the skin for its inhabitants.Palpable tension earmarked by Fessenden is tightly strewn across the storyline of the theme of mankind again unsettling nature (the film's dour title is a foreshadowing factor for the team) with a fluid camera throughout (lensed with precision by Magni Agustsson, an Icelander like most of the crew since the country fills in for the cold Alaska tundra), sharp editing by Fessenden and unnerving sound design by Tom Efinger and Abigail Savage making some truly spooky moments. The fine ensemble makes the most for the seemingly predictable plot with Perlman's lantern-jawed brute a fine contrast for the slender, athletic LeGros' quiet thinking and again, McKinder's unraveling like a tense coil provides a good middle act only to be thrown by the final somewhat let-down cop-out ending. In all fairness at the sneak preview I attended Fessenden was there for a quick Q&A and I was able to ask him how he was able to film a truly viscerally hairy airplane crash (trivia note: Fessenden pulls a Hitchcock as the doomed co-pilot of the small craft) and he explained that it was mostly practical and very little CGI  it truly is the one remarkable moment of underscoring the horror that has begun to envelop the encampment.A combination of John Carpenter's "The Thing"'s paranoia and a mixture of 'An Inconvenient Truth"'s message of global warming by way of the supernatural unspooling of "The Shining" and the combination of the former and latter's isolation/cabin fever/stir crazy fueled tension makes a fine cocktail of modern-day terror.
KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE (2014) *** Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Strong, Sofia Boutella, Michael Caine, Sophie Cookson, Mark Hamill. Substantial spy actioner based on the comic book "The Secret Service" about England's elite squad to serve queen and country with Firth as a veteran gentleman soldier who recruits young Egerton (in a decent big screen debut) in an open slot of the squad out to stop meglamoniacal genius Jackson (lisping his way into yet another obnoxious over-the-top performance; really needs to dial it down a bit) hellbent on destroying humanity via technology (that old Bond chestnut). While it plays like an ode to the aforementioned 007 (and even nods to America's Jason Bourne with some clever fight sequences adrenalized with '70s soundtrack hits) it does enliven the genre with some nifty nips and tucks (i.e. an Odd-Jobian Asian henchman with a sex change and Ginsu-sharp artificial legs played by the sly, lithe Boutella and to see dapper, mild-mannered Firth kick some serious ass) it does become predictable and old hat in its grande finale of carnage (not a dig but OK, we get it) no thanks to the shoot 'em up screenplay adaptation by young turk filmmaker Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman). Veddy good ol' bean!
BABEL (2006) *** Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Gael Garcia Bernal, Adriana Barraza, Rinko Kikuchi, Koji Yakusho, Ali Hamadi, Bouber Ait El Caid, Said Trachani, Elle Fanning, Nathan Gamble, Clifton Collins Jr., Michael Pena, Yuko Murata, Mohamed Akhzam, Satoshi Nikaido, Kazunori Tozawa, Mustapha Rachidi. Absorbing intertwined tale of fate linking several international characters to an accidental shooting involving an American couple traveling abroad, the implicit act by Moroccan brothers, a grieving Japanese teenage girl and the difficult relationship with her father and the Mexican housekeeper for the Americans all add to an interesting tapestry woven by gifted storytellers Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and Guillermo Arriaga in this their unofficial third chapter of a non-linear trilogy of morality, universal truths and basic human frailty told with aplomb.
RUNNER RUNNER (2013) ** Ben Affleck, Justin Timberlake, Gemma Arterton, Anthony Mackie. Fair-to-middling high-stakes challenge involving a Princeton student going head-to-head with the online gambling magnate who swindled him out of his life's savings, finds himself up to his neck in more crimes and misdemeanors with an ambitious Fed out to take down the slippery entrepreneur by any means possible in sunny Costa Rica. While the leads do the best in an otherwise predictably rote script by Brian Koppleman and David Levien very little thrills are elicited and Arterton is completely wasted as nothing more than arm candy to the over-reaching Affleck. (DIR: Brad Furman)
CHARLOTTE'S WEB (2006) **** (Voices of : Julia Roberts, Steve Buscemi, John Cleese, Oprah Winfrey, Cedric the Enterainer, Kathy Bates, Reba McEntire, Robert Redford, Thomas Haden Church, Andre Benjamin, Dominic Scott Kay, Sam Shepard (narrator), Abraham Benrubi), Dakota Fanning, Kevin Anderson, Essie Davis, Louis Corbert, Julian O'Donnell, Siobhan Fallon, Gary Basaraba, Nate Mooney, Beau Bridges. Fantastic adaptation of the E.B. White children's classic about a runt pig (Kay) named Wilbur, who finds a barnyard of animal friends, especially the mother figure of Charlotte the Spider (splendidly voiced by Roberts), who helps her new charge avoid his eventual fate: the smokehouse. A star-studded cavalcade lends their voices with wonderful aplomb (particularly Cleese as the pusillanimous Samuel the Sheep and Buscemi perfectly cast as Templeton the snarky rat who steals the show) and incredibly detailed CGI enhanced mixed with live animals skillfully balanced by director Gary Winick (and a pitch-perfect screenplay by Susannah Grant and Karey Kirkpatrick & Earl Hamner Jr.). An instant classic that will have you laughing and crying and truly saying, "Some Pig" indeed!
ZOMBIELAND (2009) *** Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin, Amber Heard, Mike White (**SPOILER** Cameo: as himself: Bill Murray) Giddy zom-com about a plague of zombies terrorizing the USA and survivors Eisenberg (all geeky neurotic nobility in a hoodie); tag-team sisters Stone (yummy) and Breslin (feisty); and bonafide redneck warrior Harrelson (having a field day chewing up the scenery) form an unlikely foursome en route to a California amusement park supposedly zombie-free (a yeah, right!). More comedy than horror (a small quibble but the few sequences of gore satisfies those-in-the-know) with middling yet overly entertaining results, with a comic highlight of a close encounter withyup Bill Murray himself (dead-panned  pun intended  to perfection). Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick's chummy screenplay delivers for the most part and Ruben Fleischer employs some neat set pieces (i.e. Eisenberg's Rules To Survive on prominent display) with homage to Romero and "Shaun of the Dead" to boot.
BIRDMAN OR (THE UNEXPECTED VIRTUE OF IGNORANCE) (2014) **** Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Amy Ryan, Andrea Riseborough, Lindsay Duncan. Keaton delivers the goods in an Oscar worthy triumph as a washed-up former star of the titular superhero that gave him fame and fortune as he attempts a comeback and shot at redemption in bankrolling a vanity piece on Broadway adapting Raymond Carver's "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love" that has its share of problems namely a troubled production, egotistical Norton out to train wreck the show, family struggles with his ex, Ryan and recently rehabbed daughter Stone and a thisclose to a nervous breakdown taking root with his inner voice (and demons) deadly to implode (or explode) at any given moment. Filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarrito (who co-wrote the inventive screenplay with Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinerlaris & Armando Bo) uses broad, yet carefully maintained, strokes between fantasy and reality with a lot of meta going on (pokes at inner jokes among its cast in-real-life having played Batman, Gwen Stacy and The Hulk) succeeds in incorporating its seemingly continuous one-take look (credit ace cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and sharp editing by Douglas Crise & Stephen Mirrione) keeps his cast on its toes. The percussive score by Antonio Sanchez is a jazzy Greek chorus of sorts that keeps the beat relentless and steady-as-she goes. But once again it is Keaton's bravura turn mixing heartbreak and black comedy with shades of Shakespearean tragic drama. One of the year's best.
KNOCKED UP (2007) **** Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Martin Starr, Charlyne Yi, Iris Apatow, Maude Apatow, Joanna Kerns, Harold Ramis, Alan Tudyk, Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Ken Jeong, Craig Robinson, Tim Bagley, Loudon Wainwright III, Adam Scott, Mo Collins, BJ Novak. (Cameo: Steve Carell as himself) Uproariously hysterical comedy about a one-night stand between a stoner slacker(Rogen in a career-making highpoint performance) and hottie newly appointed E! channel telejournalist (Heigl, ditto) that results in the titular situation causing the two unlikely parents commingling and coming to terms with doing the right thing, the love/hate relationship between the sexes and ultimately falling in love  not necessarily in that order. Filmmaker Judd Apatow mixes the right amount of hilarity with heart, sweetness with raunch  a formula he perfected with '05's smash hit comic blockbuster THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN  and proves to be the smart, go-to-guy for high-concept comedies in Hollywood. Kudos to the fine supporting ensemble including the always dependable, adroit comic genius of Rudd and Mann  real-life Mrs. Apatow  also brilliant as Heigl's brother-in-law and older sister who serve as the template for her situation and the Greek chorus quartet of Rogen's roomie buds Segel, Baruchel, Hill and Starr providing so many off-shooting one-liner guffaws, repeated viewings are a must. The funniest comedy of the year.
SUNSHINE (2007) *** Cillian Murphy, Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh, Chris Evans, Cliff Curtis, Hiroyuki Sanada, Benedict Wong, Troy Garity, Mark Strong, (voice of Chipo Chung). Sci-fi amalgam of "2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY", "SOLARIS", "EVENT HORIZON", "ALIEN" and any other genre flick from the past 20 years could best describe this derivative yet fascinatingly entertaining film about an international team of astronauts and scientists hurtled into space to complete a mission impossible: drop off a megaton bomb into the sun, which sorely needs a reboot or else all life in the universe will be extinct. Heady, trippy and occasionally awe- inspiring visuals thanks to cinematographer Alwin H. Kuchler's Oscar-worthy skills and Mark Tildesley's excellent production design make up for the stilted dialogue provided by Alex Garland's screenplay. Filmmaker Danny Boyle provides the overall aesthetic superbly in spite of its all-too-familiar trappings, which get bogged down in the film's last reel.
SPIDER-MAN 3 (2007) **1/2 Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Hayden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, Roesemary Harris, J.K. Simmons, James Cromwell, Theresa Russell, Dylan Baker, Bill Nunn, Bruce Campbell, Elizabeth Banks, Ted Raimi, (cameos: Cliff Robertson, Stan Lee) Somewhat disappointing and lugubrious chapter of the vastly popular blockbuster franchise this time with Spidey/Peter Parker (Maguire) juggling quite a bit including three villains, The Sandman (AKA Flint Marko) (Hayden Church); Venom (AKA Eddie Brock) (Grace); and New Goblin (aka former best bud Harry Osborn) (Franco back for the third time as well); his on-the-rocks relationship with gal pal Mary Jane Watson (Dunst ditto) and possible new flame Gwen Stacy (Howard); and an alien life force's parasitic nature unleashing Spidey's 'dark' side proving to be more than what the webslinging super hero can possibly handle in one big, bloated escapade. Despite a few decent special effects- laden fight sequences and the strong cast, the film falters due to the very chatty and uneven screenplay by filmmaker Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan & Alvin Sargent., including some unfortunate choices: musical numbers?! Really?!!
BLACK DYNAMITE (2009) **1/2 Michael Jai White, Salli Richardson-Whitfield, John Salley, Arsenio Hall, Tommy Davidson, Mykelti Williamson, Bokeem Woodbine, Cedric Yarbrough, Kevin Chapman, Nicole Sullivan, Richard Edson, Buddy Lewis, Brian McKnight, James McManus, Phil Morris, Mike Starr, Roger Yuan. Middling send-up of the '70s 'blaxploitation flix' with a very game White (who co-wrote with Byron Minns & director Scott Sanders) as the titular ass-kicker out for vengeance when his little brother is killed and a heroin ring to be infiltrated before it's too late. While it aims to do what "Naked Gun" comedies did for police procedurals this hit-and-miss parody makes up for it in its excellent production design by Denise Pizzini, Ruth E. Carter's on-target costumes and well-conceived cinematography by Shawn Maurer in recreating the era's kitsch and cool bravado.
THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012) ***1/2 Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor, Tom Holland, Samuel Joslin, Oaklee Pendergrast, Mara Etura, Sonke Mohring, Geraldine Chaplin, Ploy Jindachote, Johan Sundberg. Harrowing, uplifting and powerfully humane true-life dramatization of the devastation caused by the Taiwan tsunami focusing on the aftermath involving a separated family who survive by their wits and determination of reuniting in spite of tremendous odds. Watts and McGregor give memorably heartbreaking turns and career bests as the parents but it is young Holland as their eldest child who truly is the heart and soul of the film as he struggles to keep tabs with his ailing mother and helping his fellow man. Inspiring and remarkable with epic visual effects that have a truly visceral effect. Director Juan Antonio Bayona buoys the traumatic with the miraculous with a smart, lean script by Sergio G. Sanchez based on Maria Belon's story.
MAX PAYNE (2008) ** Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, Beau Bridges, Ludicrous, Chris O'Donnell, Donal Logue, Amaury Nolasco, Kate Burton, Olga Kurylenko. Impenetrable adaptation of the popular video game (confession: haven't played video games since Space Invaders so go figure!) in this murky, noir-ish actioner with Wahlberg as the stony/stoic titular police detective out to revenge the murders of his family at any cost. Hard-to-follow and woodenly acted (Kunis is particularly laughable and woefully miscast as an assassin!) the film's true merits are the impressive cinematography by Jonathan Sela; otherwise forgettable. (Dir: John Moore)
ROLE MODELS (2008) *** Paul Rudd, Seann William Scott, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Bobb'e J. Thompson, Elizabeth Banks, Jane Lynch, Ken Jeong, Ken Marino. Hilarious high-concept comedy about two co-workers (Rudd -who co-scripted the screenplay with director David Wain - and Scott) who wind up having to commit to community service in mentoring a pair of kids (Mintz-Plasse and Thompson, each a riot in their own way) in a Big Brother-like program and realize they themselves have a lot of growing up to do. Immature and hysterically funny, this arrested development comedy is crude and surprisingly sweet and Rudd serves his usual dry snarky wit with verve (his bit in a coffee house about the word 'venti' is worth the price of admission) while Scott acquits himself nicely. Thompson, a mini-Eddie Murphy, steals the show as the foul-mouthed charge and the always reliable Lynch is a hoot as a former 12-stepper who runs the outfit the duo find themselves in. One of the year's funniest films.
RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR (2007) *** Mary McCormack, Rory Cochrane, Tony Perez, Scotty Noyd, Jr. Absorbingly intense What If? For a Post 9/11 world: What If dirty bombs were launched in a large metropolitan city and you were faced with letting a loved one who may be contaminated back into your home? That's the thorny social issue/sci-fi thriller question posed by novice filmmaker Chris Gorak (his debut as a director/screenwriter) who has his young married couple (McCormack and Cochrane giving finely nuanced powerhouse turns here) facing the ultimate odds of give-and-take, trust and love. Like an intense "Twilight Zone" with an O.Henry plot twist that many will see coming ahead but still chilling none-the-less. A cautionary fable for these trying times.
EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS (2014) *** Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton, John Turturro, Aaron Paul, Ben Mendelsohn, Maria Valverde, Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, Hiam Abbass, Isaac Andrews, Ewen Brmne, Indira Varma, Tara Fitzgerald. Ridley Scott's epic take on the Biblical tale of Moses gets the origin story as an Egyptian general (Bale making the best of it) who discovers he is in fact a Hebrew, the race of slaves, and a 'chosen one' of God to lead his people out from their plight and his stepbrother Ramses (Edgerton, ditto in guy liner). The struggle to remain devoted is palpable thanks largely to the reasonable script cobbled by Adam Cooper, Bill Collage, Jeffrey Caine and Steven Zaillian. Scott wisely keeps the CGI on a broad stroke level and going full tilt in the 'seven plagues upon Egypt' act wisely. While the film tends to meander in spots and kind of ends rather abruptly on the whole it is a decent tale of the prophets come full force.
CASSANDRA'S DREAM (2008) **1/2 Ewan McGregor, Colin Farrell, Hayley Atwell, Ashley Madekwe, Tom Wilkinson, John Benfield, Clare Higgins, Philip Davis. Woody Allen's continuing arc of murderous films set in London continues with this fairly decent offering about two brothers (McGregor and Farrell, both equally fine here) who both want more out of life but find their gambling ways and family loyalties are quite the hindrance until their beloved uncle (Wilkinson) enters the picture offering them their chance to make it with one condition: kill off an associate who is determined to ruin their relative and possibly send him to jail for the rest of his life. Allen makes good use of the English locales and his ensemble is game but even the sure thing twist of fate is a tad predictable in another wise game effort.
THE BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. Truly disappointing adaptation of genre legend Richard Matheson's sci-fi chiller "Button, Button" by on the wane wunderkind filmmaker Richard Kelly who truly stretches a small, well-crafted piece into a grab-bag 'WTF'-a-thon! Mysterious (and ridiculously maimed!) man, Langella, posits a million dollar offer to 'struggling' couple Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla bland to the hilt!): a box with a red-button, that when pushed, will kill some stranger in the world (!) Sure strings are attached but does that really matter here? What does is why in the name of God does Kelly trowel on so much oddness (i.e. nose-bleeds; watery transport systems  that's right  Watery.Transport.Systems) when the tension should be strung as tautly as possible (oh the possibilities). If this sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode you are half right (the '80s TV re-boot actually did a decent small-screen adaptation; in fact rent that instead!) One of the year's worst films.
PHILOMENA (2013) ***1/2 Judi Dench, Steve Coogan, Sophie Kennedy Clark, Mare Winningham, Barbara Jefford, Sean Mahon, Peter Hermann. Above average 'true life' account drama about a disgraced, misanthropic political journalist Martin Sixsmith (Coogan who co-scripted with Jeff Pope the adaptation of Sixsmith's book) who finds redemption in a 'human interest' story about an Irish Catholic woman named Philomena (Dench in one of her best performances) whose son was taken away by the nuns who ran the shelter she was forced to attend finds herself 50 years later regretting not finding him and enlists the world-weary Sixsmith to locate him while researching the material for a possible story for a promising publisher. Heavy-hearted yet deservingly so thanks largely to the grand acting by Dench and equally thrust and parry turn by Coogan and steadfast direction by veteran filmmaker Stephen Frears. Touching without being maudlin and shockingly perhaps rewarding without being vindictively judgmental.
PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END (2007) **1/2 Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Bill Nighy, Chow Yun-Fat, Jonathan Pryce, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Kevin McNally, David Bailie, Stellan Skarsgard, Tom Hollander, Naomie Harris, Martin Klebba, (Cameo: Keith Richards) Bloated continuing and  presumably  final chapter in the ginormous global cinematic franchise with Captain Jack Sparrow re-vived and released from Davy Jones' Locker  to aid his pirate chums in an unlikely alliance using the Flying Dutchman to defeat the British in their unholy alliance with their nemeses in the control of the shipping lanes that is rather convoluted to follow  and just plain too much talk  while the characters' interchanging double, triple & quadruple crosses gets badly handled in this disappointing offering despite its game cast and the final exciting third with some truly imaginative visual effects (i.e. Calypso's Hell-Hath-No-Fury- Like-A-(Giant)-Woman's-Scorn and yup  Richards as Depp's poopdeck pappy (Dir: Gore Verbinski)
THE LAST KING OF Scotland (2006) ***1/2 Forest Whitaker, James McAvoy, Kerry Washington, Gillian Anderson, Simon McBurney. Inside a Monster: Whitaker gives a galvanizing Oscar caliber performance.Idi Amin was a larger than life thug, whose decade long reign of terror in his nation of Uganda during the 1970s may have been given an asterisk in history books for his genocidal tendencies that would make most despots blanch (his involvement of 300,000 fellow countrymen is notorious) and he may pale in comparison to latter-day villainous leaders like Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden. However history has a way of repeating itself and on cinema, history lasts forever.Amin's rise to power is seen from the unblinking, naïve eyes of a young (fictitious) Scotsman named Nicholas Garrigan (McAvoy in a strong difficult role), a recent medical student grad who on a whim decides to leave his homeland for the first place his finger lands on his spinning globe (well, really second, after the primo decision of Canada apparently held no sway of adventure) to make a break from his unmoored existence.Once there the good doctor is ensconced in the tumultuous African nation under a military coup de tat by Amin that eventually lands Garrigan an audience with the imposing, garrulous man himself (Whitaker, in a towering career best and a front-runner on the short- list for the Academy Awards this year), when after attending a crowd-pleasing speech with his fellow doctor Sarah Merritt (Anderson in an underused role), they encounter a road delay on their journey back to their camp. It is here that Amin's entourage has struck a farmer's ox and Amin has sustained a hand injury. Garrigan is hustled over to the stricken leader who shows his scary side, barking orders to his men, while the dying animal bleats in the scorching sun. Like an Aesop fable of the lion and the mouse, Garrigan fixes the wound and then when he can no longer bear it, takes Amin's pistol and kills the animal ending its misery. Angered and shocked at this impromptu command of power Amin hovers over the smaller man and then does something equally surprising: offers the young Scot a permanent position as his personal physician. When Amin learns Garrigan is indeed from Scotland  Amin a renowned lover of all things Scottish  offers the medic his ribbon-festooned shirt in exchange for the soccer t-shirt Garrigan is wearing. The deal with the devil has been made.What follows is the idealistic yet amazingly blind-sided by power doctor is suddenly thrust into the corridors of the Amin regime unknowingly to the ongoing slaughtering of the Ugandans and his administration suddenly 'missing'. As Garrigan becomes deeper and deeper into a de facto friendship with the charming yet paranoid chieftain it suddenly dawns on him that Amin is indeed a ruthless dictator and the desire to return home is only further diminished. To add fuel to the fire Garrigan is enamored of Amin's youngest wife Kay (ethereal Washington), the third spouse of Amin's, who is pretty much neglected by her husband and when Garrigan gets too close to the fire, the source only begins to heat up the inevitable downfall.Written by Jeremy Brock, Peter Morgan and Joe Penhall, adapting the novel by Giles Foden, the screenplay focuses more on the gullible doctor than the rule of Amin until its climax but it is a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a monster and how the curdled charisma of this horrific ruler managed to fool much of the Western world. Whitaker's top drawer turn as Amin is amazing, with his imposing bulk, crocodile smile and on-a-dime turn from laughter to unbridled anger is a goose-bump inducing performance counterbalanced by the ballsy and ultimately sympathetic performance by McAvoy; the chemistry between the two actors is hypnotic in the same way as watching a train wreck in slo-motion.Director Kevin Macdonald keeps the pace going at a ready clip and wisely allows his actors breathing room from one set-up to the next and gives it a you-are-there vibe to the proceedings at hand.But once again it Forest Whitaker who richly deserves all accolades come awards season for making a monster into a human being and back again in the blink of an eye; no easy feat by any means.
ST. VINCENT (2014) *** Bill Murray, Melissa McCarthy, Naomi Watts, Chris O' Dowd, Terrence Howard, Jaeden Liebrher, Kimberly Quinn, Lenny Venito, Nat Corddry. Murray shines as a misanthropic mope whose run of bad luck continues until he meets his new neighbors McCarthy and her young son (talented newcomer Liebrher) who reluctantly lets him take care of which leads to mischief, life lessons and ultimately giving the ol' lug a reason to believe again (in himself and in life). While novice filmmaker Theodore Melfi (who also penned the connect-the-dots screenplay) allows some nice interaction with his game cast it is clearly a showcase for elder statesman comedian non-parallel Murray to balance comedy and somber drama with ease (and hopefully another Oscar nod) as the ramshackle mess of a man. Funny and warm yet somewhat predictable but c'mon it's Bill Freaking Murray!
THE FAMILY (2013) **1/2 Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Diana Agron, John D'Leo, Tommy Lee Jones, Jimmy Palumbo, Vincent Pastore. Better-than-anticipated but generally laugh-free comedy mashup with the mob films featuring, well De Niro, here as a mob hit-man whose revolving door of the witness protection program has his family moved to a small provincial French village where the ugly Americans get their ya-yas out while they are being tracked by vengeful 'famiglia' executioners out for blood. Based upon a book by Tonino Banacquista the screenplay by director Luc Besson and Michael Caleo gets its tinder hooks on the violence but a tin ear for the comedic possibilities that are sitcom at best (i.e. a film screening of 'Goodfellas' is barely siphoned for a chuckle).
THE BLACK DAHLIA (2006) * Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Mia Kirshner, Mike Starr, Fiona Shaw. De Palma and Ellroy: Match made in Heaven? No, more like Hell!You would think that the paring up of controversial '70s auteur Brian De Palma and edgy crime novelist James Ellroy would be a perfect match of their sordid sensibilities right? A match made in Heaven, yes? No. More like a match made in Hell.The novelization of the infamous "Black Dahlia" murder mystery - which actually happened and still to this day remains unsolved - is fictionalized into the pulp noir of Ellroy's story of two up-and-coming cops, Officer Dwight "Bucky" (Mr. Ice) (Hartnett) and Sgt. Leland "Lee" (Mr. Fire) (Eckhart), who become buddies and partners after an unlikely set-up involving a charity boxing match where Lee knocks out Bucky's front teeth, and then invites him post-bout to his home that he shares with the comely Kay Lake. Eventually the couple ask their new friend to move into their designer friendly digs and set up a cozy game of playing house: Kay cooks for the duo as they solve their crimes.Then the pair are hip-deep suddenly in investigating the brutal slaying of one Elizabeth Short (Kirshner), a wanna-be actress, whose corpse is discovered to be cut cleanly in half, disemboweled and disgraced with a horrid slash from ear- to-ear in a nasty, rictus smile. Needless to say their superiors want a swift resolution to this heinous crime and the boys knuckle down to do just that.Well so far so good right? Wrong. It begins to come clear to Bucky that the late Ms. Short was involved with some apparently lurid after-hours soirees among the chichi hoi-polloi and a lesbian who became involved with a rich-bitch bisexual named Madeleine Linscott (Swank, attempting to channel a Katherine Hepburnian accent of blue-blood aristocracy) who is more than she appears to be. Meanwhile Lee is obsessed with Smart as well trying to come to grips with the blue material he has been given to sort through, reflecting poorly with his work habits and domestic standings with Kay (who are both harboring a secret they attempt to exclude Bucky from).The plottings that intertwine by the screenplay by Josh Friedman's adaptation are ludicrously boring and serve no purpose especially since the juicy Jack-the- Ripperian crime is pretty much an after-thought and the odd triangle of the main characters is the fulcrum when it shouldn't even be in the foreground. I know that Ellroy is a very dense and hard to follow writer (I know because after LA CONFIDENTIAL came out I actually attempted to read his novel and realized the film nixed several going-no-where plot points for the service of time restraint) but the more and more ridiculous the scenes become are do to the fact the cast is not up to the task at hand. Hartnett is always a puzzling piece of plastic and his Bucky is the narrator to boot (not a strong point with his monotonous monotone trying to ape the affectation of the pot-boilers of the '30s and '40s); Johansson is miscast as a Lana Turner blonde who looks unbelievable like a girl trying to dress up as an adult; Eckhart is wasted (literally) for his talents and Swank's kitschy-koo turn is a dismaying bore but she does have a sexy presence that heretofore was never depicted on screen. Kirshener is the only one - in audition film reel flashbacks - who acquits herself as the slaughtered lamb/conscience with an air of utter sadness and believability of a victim to her own dreams.De Palma has not had a decent mainstream hit since the first "MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE" film over a decade ago and his trademark serpentine camera moves are all but practically defanged here (there is a swooping crane shot at the discovery of the Short corpse and a dilly of an attempted strangling ending in the offing of one of the film's protagonists which is ballsy but altogether in the long run comes across as an off-shoulder shrugging). The pacing is lugubriously labored, the main storyline is truncated and the 'love triangle' is boring! There's no chemistry between any of the characters (sexually or simply just being in a regular sequence together) and the last act is a howler invoking a truly over-the-top banshee screeching turn by Shaw as the alcoholic mother of Swank's character that has no business being in the film overall.Ellroy - whose own mother was murdered when he was a young child and her crime never resolved - has said in interviews he was skeptical at first with the adaptation but embraced what eventually was produced; it is hard to fathom since this is truly one of the worst films of the year.
CROSSING OVER (2009) **1/2 Harrison Ford, Ray Liotta, Ashley Judd, Jim Sturgess, Cliff Curtis, Summer Bishil, Alice Braga , Alice Eve. A mix of "Babel" and "Crash" in the culture clash study of immigration in the US with a decent ensemble with some nice work by Ford as an aging fed who tries to find the humanity in his soul-crushing work; Curtis as his partner who has a memorable speech in a convenience store hold-up; and especially Bishil as an opinionated student whose speech at school land her in hot water. Filmmaker Wayne Kramer walks an uneven balance of the political and social upheavals in this well-acted drama in this post-9/11 treatise on the melting pot of America.
FANTASTIC MR. FOX (2009) **** (VOICES OF: George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Wallace Wolodarsky, Eric Chase Anderson, Michael Gambon, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, Jarvis Cocker, Karen Duffy, Brian Cox, Adrien Brody) Truly  well, fantastic  animated adaptation of Roald Dahl's children's lit classic as envisioned by filmmaker Wes Anderson (who co-wrote with Noah Baumbach and actually provides a voice talent too) about sly, wry Mr. Fox (equally wry and sly Clooney, his voice as welcome as a blanket on a snowy winter's night) whose days of chicken rousting are numbered when he backpedals from his domestic bliss with wife & teen son (Streep & Schwartzman equally cozy tones) to abscond with poultry from three community farmers (read: villains) and the consequences unleashed upon his animal community with impunity. Fast, fun and sharply etched with fine comedic bravado throughout (thank you again Bill Murray for your insouciant vocals) and a truly amazing tour-de-force for the stop-motion animators and production design by Nelson Lowry (seriously should be considered for an Oscar) with its autumnal palette and homemade puppetry look (waycool how everything bristles to life!) One of my faves of the year and one of the best family films of the year too boot; hell one of the year's best!
SPLINTER (2008) ** Paolo Costanzo, Jill Wagner, Shea Whigham, Rachel Kerbs, Laurel Whitsett, Charles Baker. So-so horror flick with echoes of B-movies past  a pastiche of "Tremors" meets "Feast" by way of"Night of the Living Dead"  concerns a group of stangers holed up in a gasoline convenience store by a nasty, voracious parasitic porcupine-like monster that has moments of originality but ultimately is betrayed by its editing (too many quick cuts so you never get a good look at the creature is damn well frustrating). Plenty of gore and decent acting buoy the otherwise familiar storyline with a few moments of dread. (Dir: Toby Wilkins)
SKYFALL (2012) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Berenice Marlohe, Albert Finney, Ben Whishaw, Rory Kinnear. Craig in fine form in his third (and arguably best) outing as James Bond, finds 007 resurrected from a near fatal mission resulting in former op-turned-baddie Bardem (hamming it up in a cross between Raul Julia and Christopher Walken's Max Zorin look in A VIEW TO A KILL!) on a revenge fueled vendetta to off M (Dench) and possibly every MI agent to boot. Replete with the usual Bond touchstones (including a nice nod to the Aston Martin) this runs on all cylinders in its stealth storytelling by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade & John Logan and swift movements thanks to Sam Mendes' smooth direction peppered with just enough breakneck action (the pre-credit train chase is a hoot) and Bond babes Harris as Craig's colleague and Marlohe as the breathtaking seductress. With a touch of CITIZEN KANE alluding to the title and a dash of origin story, Bond is back with a vengeance.
PHANTASM (1979) *** Filmmaker Don Coscarelli concocts a devious blend of the supernatural, terror and sci-fi in this cult-classic from back in the day where a small town is suddenly inundated with mysterious goings on at the local cemetery/funeral parlor no thank to the equally nefarious TALL MAN (Angus Scrimm making somnambulism hip before Robert Englund's "Freddy Krueger") and his jawa-like minions (!) Low-budget in every department (wooden acting, cheap f/x, dense script etc.) but totally scores in originality on the 'old dark house' spookshow. Perfect rental for a midnite Halloween party ...or preferably all by your loneseome!
BOBBY (2006) **1/2 Harry Belafonte, Joy Bryant, Nick Cannon, Emilio Estevez, Laurence Fishburne, Brian Geraghty, Heather Graham, Anthony Hopkins, Helen Hunt, Joshua Jackson, Ashton Kutcher, Shia LaBeouf, Lindsay Lohan, William H. Macy, Svetlana Metkina, Demi Moore, Freddy Rodriguez, Martin Sheen, Christian Slater, Sharon Stone, Jacob Vargas, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Elijah Wood, David Krumholtz. Sprawling and uneven yet somewhat compelling fictitious look at the day in the life of several characters on the fated evening of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination provides a glimmer of what the era was like and some fine ensemble acting (particularly Rodriguez and Stone) make up for filmmaker Estevez' shortcomings and long stretches of credibility (to wit, weakest link Kutcher as a drug-dealing hippie). However credit the actor for smartly weaving Kennedy's powerful speeches into the film solidifying the gravitas of a true leader whose idealism proves just how we as a nation are treading in similar times (i.e. an unjust war and a middling government with civil rights).
VANTAGE POINT (2008) ** Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox, Forest Whitaker, Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Edgar Ramirez, Sid Taghmaoui, Ayelet Zurer, Zoe Saldana, Bruce McGill, Eduardo Noriega, Richard T. Jones, James LeGros. Political drama/thriller about the assassination attempt on the President of The United States while in Spain, ironically regarding terrorism, is ham-strung by its constant gimmick of re-winding to get several characters' viewpoints ala "Rashomon" but with frustrating endeavors and eye-rolling histrionics hinder an otherwise routine flick; Quaid's climactic car-chase makes up for the hooey. (Dir: Pete Travis)
YOU'RE NEXT (2013) *** Sharni Vinson, Nicholas Tucci, Wendy Glenn, AJ Bowen, Joe Swanberg, Margaret Laney, Amy Seimetz, Ti West, Rob Moran, Barbara Crampton, L.C. Holt, Simon Barrett, Lane Hughes, Kate Lyn Sheil, Larry Fessenden. Good ol' fashioned tweaking of the horror film sub genre, slasher/home invasion flick whereupon a well-to-do family's weekend get-together is upended when they find themselves being stalked/hunted by masked killers in an isolated woodland remote hell. What the intruders don't count on is namely an ace-in-the-hole of a non-family guest whose smarts and ingenuity turns-the-tables with ensuing carnage and other nefarious results. Bloodletting a go but with skill, imagination and sometimes too-cool-for- school attitude borderline obnoxiousness from filmmakers Adam Wingard (who pulls out all the stops directing Simon Barrett's quirky sharp screenplay). Kudos to Vinson as the oddly-at-ease dispatching violence at a moment's notice.
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL (2011) *** ½ Tom Cruise, Paula Patton, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Michael Nyquist, Vladmir Mashkov, Anil Kapoor, Lea Seyoux, Josh Holloway, (CAMEOS: Tom Wilkinson, Ving Rhames, Bridget Moynahan) Totally awesome and breathtaking shot of adrenaline to the superspy franchise with Cruise in control (what else is new? ) as Ethan Hunt whose mission he's chosen to take is to clear his partners' names in a terrorist attack on the Kremlin which begins a globe-trotting-trek to stop Russian madman (Mashkov, the weakest link for the otherwise sharp actioner)hellbent on unleashing global thermal nuclear war (!) Kudos to animator genius director Brad Bird making a skillful translation to live-action format (and then some in this Herculean undertaking!) particularly the heart-stopping, hair-raising, gooseflesh inducing set piece with Cruise atop Dubai's tallest skyscraper in the world with little else but his cool-as-a-cucumber demeanor (a MUST SEE IN IMAX for the vertigo crowd too!) Mission: Accomplished! BONUS IMAX KUDOS to an 80 foot Paula Patton's lovely décolletage! :D
SEVEN POUNDS (2008) *1/2 Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, Woody Harrelson, Michael Ealy, Barry Pepper, Elpidia Carrillo, Bill Smitrovich. Nearly incomprehensible melodramatic vehicle with Smith as a do-gooding IRS agent whose unspeakable goals make the process maddening to the point of complete frustration in trying to figure out the character's intenions, and when the reason is finally given, makes it only more exhausting for its over-acted, underwhelming misplaced heart warming attempts. Dawson's chronically ill love interest undermines the six other strangers Smith forces himself upon is the least of this film's problems; to wit: a jellyfish! 'Nuff said. (Dir: Gabriele Muccino)
THE INTERNATIONAL (2009) ** Clive Owen, Naomi Watts, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Ulrich Thomsen, Brian F. O'Byrne, Felix Solis, Jack McGee, Nilaja Sun. Seemingly lackluster global conspiracy thriller with a glowering Owen cast as an Interpol agent trying to expose a worldwide powerful bank that is covertly securing illegal activities involving assassinations, money laundering and arms trading with a take-no-prisoners vehemence. While there are shades of '70s thrillers helmed by Pakula, Pollock and Lumet, director Tom Tykwer is saddled with a top-heavy somnolent screenplay by Eric Singer and zilch chemistry between aforementioned Owen and Manhattan ADA Watts in spite of a wicked shoot-out sequence choreographed graphically brilliant at NYC's Guggenheim Museum; all for naught.
GET SMART (2008) **1/2 Steve Carell, Anne Hathaway, Dwayne Johnson, Alan Arkin, Terence Stamp, Terry Crews, David Koechner, James Caan, Bill Murray, Masi Oka, Nate Torrence, Ken Daviatan, David S. Lee, Patrick Warburton (cameo: Bernie Kopell) Hit-and-miss big-screen adaptation of the classic '60s TV spy-spoofing comedy with Carell brilliantly cast as Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 of CONTROL, a secret US spy organization , this time with Smart as an analyst-spy-in-training with the seasoned Agent 99 (the luscious Hathaway stepping silkily into Barbara Feldon's stilettos) leading him to stop KAOS kook Siegfried (spooky Stamp) from setting of an atomic bomb in Los Angeles. While the two leads have dynamite chemistry and do fine turns by their iconic predecessors with ease and finesse the script by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember attempts to incorporate a "Bourne Identity" vibe that feels a bit off-putting for the bumbling Smart and director Peter Segal lets the pyrotechniques get a little out of hand; however I'd hope if there was a sequel they'd give more for equally inspiring Warburton as Hymie the Robot (a nice nod to the series' Dick Gautier) and Murray as Agent 13 (a glorified cameo at best), the colleague who shows up in the tightest of spots undercover, and speaking of cameos nice to see Kopell (the original Siegfried) but where was Feldon?! Missed her by that much!!
Australia (2008) *** Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Brandon Walters, David Wenham, Bryan Brown, Jack Thompson, David Gulpilil. Filmmaker Baz Luhrmann's broad and at times logy yet entertaining epic set in the land Down Under circa pre WWII with English rose Kidman out of her element in her attempts to attest to her late husband's affairs with a cattle ranch and Jackman as the hunky 'Drover' who is more than able in helping her against the odds, including the attachment of an Aboriginal boy (newcomer Walters displaying some truly amazing acting chops for his first film!) and the power struggles with baddies Wenham and Brown. Sprawling to a fault but for the most part endearing -a sort of update of "Gone With The Wind" meets "The African Queen". Dig that cattle stampede sequence.
THE SKELETON TWINS (2014) *** Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Luke Wilson, Ty Burrell, Boyd Holbrook, Joanna Gleason, Kathleen Rose Perkins. Dynamic duo SNL vets Wiig and Hader reunite as dysfunctional siblings who find their middling lives depressing and unfulfilled after one's suicide attempt force them to make an attempt at bettering them with questionable choices and obvious results. While the undeniable chemistry of the comedians is the true charm of the film the screenplay by director Craig Johnson and Mark Heyman gives them many scenes to shine together and apart with solid support by Wilson as Wiig's too-good-to-be-true chipper hubby. The pas de deus lip synch of Starship's "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" is worth the price of admission let alone a spot in cinema's vault of inspired teamwork.
INTO THE WILD (2007) **** Emile Hirsch, Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt, Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker. Sean Penn puts his heart and soul into this ambitious adaptation of Jon Krakauer's best seller based on the true life account of 22 year old Christopher McCandless (Hirsch in the performance of his career), who decides to shirk society and his family's troubled worlds by heading out into the American heartland with a determination to live off the grid en route to his goal: Alaska. Along the journey he will find some unlikely supporters including a fun-loving employer (Vaughn); a couple of hippies (Keener and Dierker); a possible soul mate (the beguiling Stewart) and a father-figure (Holbrook in an Oscar worthy memorable supporting performance that is a textbook example of fine acting)  all providing insight for the trip ahead. Penn wisely employs the picturesque sights with Eric Gautier's lush cinematography and the dead-on songbook of Eddie Vedder underscoring the beautifully rendered performance by Hirsch making an indelible impression to a heart strong young man whose unique trek in life proved to be his fate.
THE FIGHTER (2010) *** Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, Jack McGee, Mickey O'Keefe (as Himself). Biographical drama about Boston boxer Micky Ward (an affective, low-keyWahlberg at his career best) attempting for a redemption shot at a title bout but the long shadow cast by his one-time contender/junkie brother Dicky (Bale, scary good and Oscar bait for Best Supporting Actor) and his overbearing managing mother (Leo equally affective) may mar his chances. Director David O. Russell wisely allows the working class 'burbs of Boston work its magic and his talented cast including a spunky Adams as Wahlberg's flame  room to do their best in this predictable yet well-told pugilistic warhorse tale.
LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS (2010) **1/2 Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, Oliver Platt, Hank Azaria, Josh Gad, Gabriel Macht, Judy Greer, George Segal, Jill Clayburgh. Well-acted yet disjointed romantic dramedy with cocksure pharmaceutical salesman Gyllenhaal facing his biggest challenge: free-spirited and equally callow artist Hathaway  and ultimately falling in love with some consequences (she has first-stage Parkinson's Disease). While Edward Zwick keeps the pace snappy as director his screenplay with Charles Randolph and longtime partner Marshall Herskovitz  based on Jamie Reidy's book "Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman)  has its work cut out for it in attempting to be a breezy sex comedy and a disease of the week TV movie that ultimately is cancelled out by the dynamic chemistry of its handsome leads (and hot sex scenes) yet it is more than a LOVE STORY meets JERRY MAGUIRE pitch; it's what one will sacrifice to be a better person; lesson learned indeed. Trivia note: sadly this is Clayburgh's last film performance, which is more so since it's practically a glorified cameo as Gyllenhaal's WASPy mother.
NORBIT (2007) ** Eddie Murphy, Thandie Newton, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Terry Crews, Clifton Powell, Mighty Rasta, Eddie Griffin, Kat Williams, Marlon Wayans. Hit-and-miss, vulgar, rude and somewhat hateful comedy showcasing Murphy in three roles thanks to the brilliant re-collaboration with make-up maestro Rick Baker (they worked together previously on "Coming to America" and "The Nutty Professor"), as the titular nerd whose life is a living hell married to the rapacious, obese grotesque Rasputia (Murphy again) and his adoptive Chinese guardian Mr. Wong (ditto) offering little advice in the sudden re-emergence of his childhood sweetheart (Newton). While the make-up is seamless, the screenplay by Murphy, his brother Charlie and Jay Scherick & David Ronn only make the ugliness overshadow the attempt at heart in this misfire of a star vehicle that one wonders if Murphy can ever truly allow his genius to excise the cosmetically enhanced comic possibilities. (Dir: Brian Robbins)
THE EX (2007) **1/2 Zach Braff, Amanda Peet, Jason Bateman, Charles Grodin, Mia Farrow, Lucian Maisel, Donal Logue, Amy Poehler, Fred Armisen, Josh Charles, Marin Hinkle, Amy Adams, Yul Vazquez, Paul Rudd, Robert John Burke, Michael Cumpsty, John Benjamin Hickey. (Dir: Jesse Peretz) Farrelly Brothers lite : Bateman and Grodin steal the show.In the latest attempt to make a Farrelly Brothers lite knock-off of "There's Something About Mary", Braff stars in the Ben Stiller role of Tom Reilly , a New York City cook whose wife Sofia (the sexy Peet in the Cameron Diaz role) is expecting the couples first baby when he is summarily fired from his job after anticipating a promotion that only leads to a confrontation with his jerk boss (Rudd in a funny cameo). With no other choice Tom decides to take up his father-in-law Bob 's (Grodin returning to the silver screen in over a decade, and a much welcome back!) long-standing job offer to work with him at his advertising job in Sofia's home state of Ohio. Packing up the family and all their worldly belongings they arrive with an open welcome and a place to stay until Tom gets his footing. To add insult to injury, Bob is assigned to work under Chip Sanders (Bateman, stealing every scene he's in and hilarious to boot0, a former close friend of Sofias's (who has still a mad crush on her). Not only is Chip a vain, pompous undermining passive/aggressive creep but he's in a wheelchair which makes for only more uncomfortable moments for the awkward Tom to hurdle over in the never-ending series of unfortunate social blunders and professional pitfalls Chip tosses like so many hand grenades.While Tom is attempting to get back on track for his family's sake he becomes obsessed in getting back at the nefarious Chip no matter what and ultimately suffers for it in the long run.While newcomer director Peretz (a music video helmsman making his big-screen debut) manages the best he can with the hit-and-miss screenplay by David Guion and Michael Handelman, novice scribes themselves, the film lacks the fundamentals of being a satire say like "Flirting With Disaster" or again the absurd political incorrectness of the aforementioned Farrelllys. Instead the hodgepodge comedy comes undone in spite of some really funny moments its game cast dishes out with full brio (slapstick by Braff, Bateman's comic timing, Grodin's dry grouchy humor and the sprinkling of the underused SNLers Poehler and Armisen.It's no secret that Tom's desire to expose the dark secret of Chip is revealed but with no real shocking payoff  I don't want to ruin it either  but it could've been a revenge best served coldly and not lukewarmly.
THE MASTER (2012) *** Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Jesse Plemons, Kevin J. O'Connor. Filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson's (a)morality tale of sorts with Phoenix (in a phenomenal performance) as an unrepentant alcoholic WWII Naval vet whose inner turmoil cannot come to an agreement with his new found existence in civilian life that leads to an unlikely friendship/prodigy/master relationship with Hoffman (equally impressive), a charlatan whose braggadocios new philosophical religion of sorts has them both in a stranglehold for their collective souls. While the acting is top-notch (except for the too-prim and very odd turn by the usually reliable Adams) the film is receptive in theme and actions (watch Phoenix get drunk and unload - rinse/lather/repeat) and ponderous to a fault.
OCULUS (2014) 1/2* Karen Gillan, Brenton Thwaites, Katee Sackhoff, Rory Cochrane, Annalise Basso, Garrett Ryan, James Lafferty, Miguel Sandoval. Terrible supernatural thriller about a reunited brother and sister who attempt to prove that a cursed antique mirror drove their parents to madness and murder. Lacks in thrills, logic or suspense. Not in the least bit scary, entertaining or interesting. Awful on all accounts - horrendous acting, inept direction and full- of-holes screenplay by Mike Flanagan and Jeff Howard; so far the worst film I've seen this year. You've been warned.
HER (2013) ** Joaquin Phoenix, (voice of Scarlett Johansson), Amy Adams, Chris Pratt, Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde,(voice of Kristen Wiig) Filmmaker Spike Jonze's ambitious yet ultimately creepy sci-fi romantic fantasy/dramedy set in the 'near future' (which I pray never happens!) about a sad-sack writer of letters who finds himself falling in love with his 'female' artificial intelligence computer system (voiced with panache by the smoky-hued Johansson) who begins to develop more than feelings beyond his comprehension. While it is meant to be a valentine of sorts to his usual collaborator Charlie Kaufman, Jonze is all thumbs in the script (feels like a rough draft knock-off at best) with some cringe-worthy dialogue and a ripping-the-rug out from the viewer final act that cheats its own intentions meant to convey connections (and technically, grammatically it really should be titled "She"). A major disappointment in spite of a nuanced acting job by Phoenix.
NEBRASKA (2013) **** Bruce Dern, Will Forte, June Squibb, Bob Odenkirk, Stacey Keach, Mary Louise Wilson, Rance Howard. Filmmaker Alexander Payne continues his streak of making films about people struggling with terms of self-worth and supposedly impossible dreams with his latest about a Montana codger (Dern, low-key perfection) whose dogged determined trek to the titular state to claim his wins in a seemingly bogus million dollar jackpot that his beleaguered son (Forte, equally winning) agrees to help him make the odyssey. Along the way of pitfalls including a nasty wife (Squibb, whose constipated pug-like countenance is the perfect foil), duplicitous family and so-called-friends (an oily Keach) only empowers the frail old coot in his desire to gain what is his. While this is not Payne's best work it is ambitious with its bleak yet beautiful black and white cinematography by gifted Phedon Papamichael and a stream-lined script by Bob Nelson.
THE HOBBIT : THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES (2014) ***1/2 Ian McKellen, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Orlando Bloom, Evangeline Lilly, Lee Pace, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Ken Stott, Graham McTavish, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Stephen Hunter, Dean O'Gorman, Aidan Turner, John Callen, Peter Hambleton, Jed Brophy, Mark Hadlow, Adam Brown, Luke Evans, Stephen Fry, Ryan Gage, John Bell, Manu Bennett, John Tui, Billy Connolly, Ian Holm, (Voice of : Benedict Cumberbatch). Epic and fitting grand finale to the second trilogy of the franchise of JRR Tolkien's grand tale of good vs. evil - picking up from the last film (literally) the dwarf band of brothers - and Bilbo Baggins (Freeman) - face off with the army of elves in combating the enormous army of evil - the dreaded, monstrous Orcs. Filmmaker Peter Jackson's Herculean efforts - two colossal trilogies - does everything anyone could hope for - give closure for an ongoing cataclysm of enormous entertainment with booming battles, inventive set pieces (dig the Orc one on one final acts of Bloom's Legolas and Armitage's Thorin) and truly jaw-dropping state-of-the-art CGI with Harryhausen echoes.
DÉJÀ VU (2006) ** Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer, Paula Patton, James Caviezel, Adam Goldberg, Elden Henson, Erika Alexander, Bruce Greenwood, Matt Craven. Convoluted high concept thriller with the ultimate What If scenario - to wit: What If you could go back in time to save someone you loved from a horrible fate would you? That's the ultimate decision for an ATF agent (Washington) to make in his investigation of a terrorist bombing of a ferryboat in New Orleans as he discovers a top secret scientific team who are capable of time traveling in a 4 _ day window that asks more question than it answers, namely the scenario at hand's difficult chore set up by a hard-to-swallow script by Bill Marsilii & Terry Russio and the hyperkinetic direction by Tony Scott just makes things implausibly laughable in spite of the Jerry Bruckheimer machine chomping at the bit with its over-the-top pyrotechniques and flashy visuals. A morally bankrupt attempt at actually an interesting premise marred in its tenacity.
THE RUINS (2008) ** Jonathan Tucker, Jena Malone, Laura Ramsey, Shawn Ashmore, Joe Anderson. Lackluster big-screen take of Scott Smith's bestseller about four young Americans on holiday in Mexico who get talked into checking out a remote tourist attraction by a fellow traveler , wind up being sacrificial fare for an ancient strain of man-eating vine the locals are only too happy to oblige. While the material by Scott (who actually did the adaptation) is original and tense the horror is handled with muddled direction by newbie Carter Smith, and the end results are tersely frustrating. Even though it is ably acted by its principals the characters are seemingly homogenized cut-outs for the genre at hand.
THE DROP (2014) *** Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, James Gandolfini, Matthias Schoenaerts, John Ortiz, Elizabeth Rodriguez, Michael Aronov, Ann Dowd. Meat and potatoes crime drama from Dennis Lehane (adapting his short story "Animal Rescue") about a Brooklyn bar that houses a 'drop' for mob money for betting and other crimes run by its former owner Gandolfini (in a solid swan song; his final performance) and his cousin Hardy, the bartender with a murky past who finds himself between family and honor. Rapace is a damaged goods local girl who meets cute with Hardy bonding over a battered pit bull puppy. Fine ensemble including Ortiz as a local police detective investigating several crimes encompassing the pub and Schoenaerts as a spooky thug that gets Hardy simmering a low boil when he's not busy doing a dese/dem/dose accent and echoes of Brando in ON THE WATERFRONT as a dim-bulb whose shrewd persona he wears like a mask. Director Michael R. Roskum channels Sidney Lumet via early Martin Scorsese in his Noo Yawk production of requiems for lightweights.
THE MUPPETS (2011) *** Jason Segel, Amy Adams, Chris Cooper, Rashida Jones, (Cameos: Alan Arkin, Mickey Rooney, Selena Gomez, Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, Emily Blunt, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, Kristin Schaal, Sarah Silverman, Donald Glover, Jim Parsons, Neil Patrick Harris, Jim Krasinski, Rico Rodriguez, Dave Grohl, Feist, James Carville, Judd Hirsch) (Voices of: Steve Whitmire, Eric Jacobson, David Goelz, Bill Barretta, David Rudman, Matt Vogel, Peter Peter Linz) A return to form for the iconic puppets! Ardent Muppet fan (and fellow Muppet to boot!), Walter, enlists his human brother Gary (don't ask) (Segel, who spear-headed the resurrection with co-scripter bud Nicholas Stoller) and Gary's chaste girlfriend Mary (ebullient Adams) to embark on a trip to LA to persuade Kermit the Frog to reunite all his friends to save their old theater from an oil-hungry SOB, Tex Richman (Cooper having a field day in pure ham mode), by putting on a telethon and continue their sharing of entertainment with the greatest (umthird greatest!) gift laughter! The latter ensues with its corny trademark 4th wall breaking and general burlesque dusted off humor with an infusing of meta-in-the-know mixed with '80s pop tunes on the soundtrack and fun, new original songs by Flight of the Conchords' Bret McKenzie and his show's director, James Bobin, letting his half-pint felt performers to get their comfort zone on (i.e. an anger management patient Animal desperately trying to reign in his emotions whenever the word 'drum' is spoken!) Sprinkled with generous generational celebrity cameos as diverse as Mickey Rooney (!) to Selena Gomez (!) for children of all ages. Laugh yourself silly & welcome back old friends!
NOAH (2014) **1/2 Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, Douglas Booth (voices of Nick Nolte & Frank Langella) Epic and grand undertaking by filmmaker Darren Aronofsky (who collaborated on the adaptation with Ari Handel taking many liberties with its source) depicting the final days of Earth before the biblical 'great flood' laying waste to mankind except for chosen titular peaceful farmer (Crowe very good and somewhat low-key humble) and his family to build an ark and rescue only the planet's animals for a new world to populate. While the CGI f/x are clearly the stars of the production Aronofsky manages to pay credence to the short passage of Genesis yet imbibing in some fool-hardy Hollywood big-guns (i.e. giants ala THOR's ice giants meets Tolkein's Ents and pyrotechniques and fireballs) to appease the masses. Fine camera work by longtime colleague Matthew Libatique and a few amazing sequences edited by Andrew Weisblum keep things in perspective: man truly is an island unto himself.
MORNING GLORY (2010) *** Rachel McAdams, Harrison Ford, Diane Keaton, Patrick Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, John Pankow, Patti D'Arbanville, Ty Burrell, Matt Malloy. McAdams gives a winning performance as a plucky young television producer who falls into a position at a down-in-the-ratings NYC morning television show whose primadonna co-host (Keaton) is only one of the major stumbling blocks to keep the program afloat. The other is respected ex-anchorman Ford (having fun for a change) as a gruff, heavy drinking nuisance when McAdams decides to use a loophole in his contract to have him added to the broadcast. While director Roger Michell and scribe Aline Brosh McKenna make a fine couple the BROADCAST NEWS wannabe tries a little too hard (i.e. McAdams is a tad too resilient and often seems grimacing instead of smiling) but Ford's comic bluster is the film's gusto (he really should do more comedies since the last to my recollection was WORKING GIRL where he was top-notch) is a revelation.
THIS IS 40 (2012) ***1/2 Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, Maude Apatow, Iris Apatow, Jason Segel, Annie Mumolo, Robert Smigel, Megan Fox, Charlyne Yi, Chris O'Dowd, Michael Ian Black, Lena Dunham, Albert Brooks, John Lithgow, Lisa Darr, Melissa McCarthy, (As Themselves: Graham Parker, Billie Joe Armstrong, Ryan Adams). Judd Apatow's continued success of mirth and crass mixes a high comedy cocktail in looking at domestic bliss in this quasi follow up to KNOCKED UP focusing on Rudd and Mann's squabbling but loving couple facing The Big 4-0 together with their equally combative daughters (Apatow & real-life wife Mann's kids) facing economic ruin, mid-life crises of all sorts and namely self-denial. Epically funny and at times dead-on depiction of suburban nightmares and other emotional train wrecks fostered either by inner turmoil or societal ills.nah just a yuk fest with a scarily talented roster of supporting comedians and character actors (Lithgow and Brooks as polar opposite dads are a stitch). Funny and heart-warming, the Reeses' Peanut Butter Cup of familial comedies.
PIRANHA 3D (2010) **1/2 Elisabeth Shue, Adam Scott, Jerry O'Connell, Ving Rhames, Kelly Brook, Steven R. McQueen, Christopher Lloyd, Jessica Szohr, Riley Steele, Ricardo Chavira, Dina Meyer, Paul Scheer, Brooklynn Proulx, Sage Ryan (Cameo: Richard Dreyfuss) Middling yet satisfying horror comedy that echoes its '80s forebearers "Piranha" & '70s classics like "JAWS" - a picturesque lake community hosting Spring Break faces its biggest challenge when an underwater tremor unearths a school of prehistoric, ravenous man-eating piranhas and its up to unlikely yet plucky sheriff (my girl Shue!) to take on the lethal task in stopping the onslaught. This killing fish frenzy chiller delivers the goods for its visceral effects (and the 3-D effects are pretty decent too) when the carnage finally begins (kudos to make-up wizards Gregory Nicotero & Howard Berger; visual effects by Derek Wentworth and the truly frightening creature designs by Neville Page arguably make up for the rote screenplay by Peter Goldfinger & Josh Stolbert) which are enlivened by the fast and furious pacing by director Alexandre Aja giving the gore and giggles (oh yeah and lots of T&A; thank you!) in full measure with a game cast including O'Donnell as a jerk-off "Girls Gone Wild" sleazy video producer; Lloyd channeling his Dr. Emmett Brown as the town's marine biologist and a tongue-thru-cheek with fishing hook-in-it opening sequence with a very funny cameo by Dreyfuss lampooning his Matt Hooper character from JAWS).
1408 (2007) *** John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, Mary McCormack, Tony Shalhoub, Jasmine Jessica Anthony, Alexandra Silber. Cusack gives a strong performance  and the best on screen case of the jitters/nervous breakdown since John Lithgow in TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE  as a failed author - with a tragic past - whose claim to fame is a debunker of 'haunted' houses who gets his day with the devil when he is invited to the posh Dolphin Hotel in NYC daring him not to stay a nite in the titular suite where no one has lasted more than an hour staying alive (!) Based on the short story by horror meister Stephen King, the screenplay by Matt Greenberg and Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski, while economical, delivers the good ol' fashioned ghost story genre some fresh blood with a finely tuned twist on the chestnut. Jackson has a fun cameo role as the hotel's manager who has a pas de deux with Cusack that deserves serious recognition to budding actors in the craft. Better than expected King creepfest.(Dir: Mikael Hafstrom)
FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER (2007) **1/2 Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, Julian McMahon, Kerry Washington, Andre Braugher, Doug Jones, (voice of: Laurence Fishburne) Still not-so-fantastic but far better than its predecessor, big screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics' iconic quartet 'family' of superheroes facing a new threat in the sleek, silvery form of the intergalactic titular anti-hero who is the responsibility for a global threat of annihilation, and the quad set out to stop it by all means necessary. While the special effects are more eye-popping than the first film, the storyline is still hindered by really laughable dialogue by Don Payne, Mark Frost and John Turman's screenplay yet the cast seems to be more animated this go around. It's also a cool CGI bonus of the Silver Surfer getting his silver screen debut even if it is second banana status. (Dir: Tim Story)
SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE (2010) ** Jay Baruchel, Alice Eve, TJ Miller, Mike Vogel, Nate Torrence, Lindsay Sloane, Kyle Bornheimer, Jessica St. Clair, Krysten Ritter, Debra Jo Rupp, Adam LeFevre, Kim Shaw, Jaskia Nicole, Geoff Stults. Beauty and the geek rom-com with scrawny airport security guard Baruchel (doing his best to avoid swimming in his own juices) as the painfully awkward type who winds up (inexplicably) having a 'hard 10' babe (Reese Witherspoon manqué Eve) fall for him despite all odds (i.e. his obnoxious family and friends overwhelmed by this obvious freak of nature occurrence). While it attempts to mingle with Apatow/Crowe/Hughes trinity of young adults' fare, the results are hampered by bodily fluids jokes (one upping "There's Something About Mary" in the hair gel department) and immaturity abounding in the inept screenplay by Sean Anders and John Morris with pedestrian direction by newbie Jim Field Smith (and it shows).
SAVAGES (2012) ***1/2 Blake Lively, Taylor Kitsch, Aaron Johnson, Benicio Del Toro, Slama Hayek, John Travolta, Demian Bichir, Emile Hirsch. Oliver Stone's slash-and-burn return to form in this pulp fiction adaptation of Don Winslow's novel (they collaborated on the killer screenplay) is a lover's triangle of a poor little rich girl and her pot-growing entrepreneurs buds (grunt Kitsch and peacenik Johnson, the yin and yang) who find themselves submitted to the wrath of a Mexican drug cartel ruled with ruthless abandon by Hayek (never been better or sexier and having a ball) when they refuse to partner up resulting in a kidnapping and a trail of blood- soaked revenge and double-crossing (enter corrupt DEA fed Travolta in a lip-smacking supporting role). Del Toro is truly memorable as the brutal enforcer of Hayek's with no remorse for his evil and devours every scene he's in with palpable menace. Energized, action-packed and cooler than a Tarantino buzz.
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH (2006) *** Dane Cook, Jessica Simpson, Dax Shepard, Andy Dick, Harland Williams, Tim Bagley, Brian George, Efren Ramirez, Marcello Thedford, Danny Woodburn, Sean Whalen, Barbara Dodd. Frequently hilarious comedy about rival co-workers (Cook tapping into his inner Bill Murray and Shepard making a fine jerk-off) who compete for the titular honor at a super-store warehouse, each hoping to score with the new hottie cashier (Simpson who acquits herself surprisingly well). Laugh out-loud funny with slapstick aplenty and a fine comic supporting cast particularly Ramirez as Shepard's suck-up toady and Dick, who steals the show, as a myopic in-house optician. Woolly and a tad-too-'heart-warming" final act by scribes Don Calame and Chris Conroy - who collaborated with novice director Greg Coolidge - keep things moving with fine sight gags and snappy one-liners.
JOE (2014) ***1/2 Nicolas Cage, Tye Sheridan, Gary Poulter, Ronnie Gene Blevins, Adriene Mishler, Sue Rock. Cage is back in a return to form performance as a troubled ex-con attempting to remain straight and narrow who befriends a teenager (Sheridan, a natural) whose home life is precarious at best no thanks to his alcoholic drifter father (a very convincing Poulter, a non-professional native cast by director David Gordon Green, who sadly was found dead several months after filming) abusing him. Based on a novel by Larry Brown, Gary Hawkins' adaptation and Green give fully-formed character studies of varying degrees of stability to their protagonists and local flavor by employing its citizenry too boot. But it is Cage's modulated acting is the true marvel in a varying degree of a successful film career (Thank Christ!) He succeeds in embodying a good man who lives on his own merits while still struggling with demons determined to screw things up for him. Also of note is Blevins as a nasty, scarred low- life making things increasingly difficult for Cage and company. One of the best films I've seen this year and a must see.
THE PURGE: ANARCHY (2014) **1/2 Frank Grillo, Carmen Ejogo, Zach Gilford, Kiele Sanchez, Zoe Soul, Justina Machado, Michael K. Williams, John Beasley. Filmmaker James DeMonaco returns in this unnecessary sequel to the widely popular thriller about a new form order of the USA in the not-too-distant future whereupon a sanctioned 12 hour day per year is a license to kill without persecution. More-or-less more of the same except now expanded exteriorly than interiorly as in the previous chapter with Grillo (in fine form) as man sent on vengeance who winds up helping a mother and daughter (Ejogo and Soul) and a young couple (Gilford and Sanchez) who are being pursued by purgers hellbent on killing them all. More taut and energized yet somewhat predictable than the original the film's strengths are in its fast direction and better-than-anticipated ensemble of little-known-actors. While there is violence it is as usual highly stylized and surprisingly not too graphic yet all the same one purge too many.
LET'S GO TO PRISON (2006) ** Dax Shepard, Will Arnett, Chi McBride, David Koechner, Dylan Baker, Michael Shannon. So-so comedy about a petty criminal loser (Shepard) whose grudge against the judge who has sentenced him leads him into a revenge fueled plan enabling the judge's pompous ass son (Arnett) by getting him sent to jail and then getting himself imprisoned to make his life a living hell. High concept comedy hits most of its marks but the sub-situation comedy dialogue doesn't gel with director Bob Odenkirk (a well-respected comic actor in his big screen debut and co-stars his own self) and his skewed look of things that his comedy team more or less hits their marks given what they have to work with, which isn't much.
THE DEER HUNTER (1978) **** Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep, John Savage, John Cazale, George Dzundza, Chuck Aspegren, Rutanya Alda. One of the best films ever about The Vietnam War, or any war for that matter, about three close-knit steel workers from Pennsylvania who lose their care-free lifestyle/innocence when they go to war and sustain unspeakable horrors that ultimately seal their fates upon their return home. Absorbing, profoundly human and excellently acted by all  Walken deservedly won Best Supporting Actor  and steadfastly directed by Michael Cimino who garnered a Best Director statuette too (the film won 5 of 9 nods including Best Picture). The Russian Roulette sequence is now a dark chapter of pop culture short-hand for the Vietnam War as an apt metaphor. Grippingly elegiac; beautiful.
A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES (2014) *** Liam Neeson, Dan Stevens, David Harbour, Adam David Thompson, Brian 'Astro' Bradley, Laura Birn, Razane Jammal. Brooding neo pulp fiction based on novelist Lawrence Block's best-seller about an alcoholic ex-cop turned private investigator (Neeson in stolid form) hired by a drug dealer (close-to-the-vest poker faced Stevens) whose wife's kidnappers are still at large with torture and murder on their minds in Brooklyn circa 1999. Filmmaker Scott Frank ably adapts the nasty piece of business with aplomb and clear-eyed nihilism (largely thanks to uber-creepy Harbour and Thompson as the pervy perps). Mihai Malaimare Jr.'s bruised cinematographic palette only makes the doom and gloom all that more palpable.
SMART PEOPLE (2008) *** ½ Dennis Quaid, Sarah Jessica Parker, Thomas Haden Church, Ellen Page, Ashton Holmes, Christine Lahti, Camille Mana. Biting comedy drama about a burnt out, widowed academic (Quaid in one of his strongest efforts of late) who is facing a mid-life crisis when he finds himself having an affair with one of his former students (Parker equally impressive) and his ne'er-do-well adopted brother (Church a real hoot) drops in unexpectedly to help around the house. Adding to the mix is his smart but uppity daughter (Page cornering the market of smart young women roles lately) and his somewhat estranged collegiate son (Holmes). Funny in a misanthropic way thanks to the smart script by newcomer Mark Poirer and directed with surprising depth and skill by novice Noam Murro in this unexpected indie gem. Kudos to the gentle guitar score by Nuno Bettencourt underscoring the humanity lurking underneath the films' rancorous protagonists.
NOTES ONA SCANDAL (2006) *** Judi Dench, Cate Blanchett, Bill Nighy, Andrew Simmons, Juno Temple, Max Lewis. Well-acted, cunning melodrama potboiler about a spinster-ish high school teacher (Dench) who deigns for new art teacher Blanchett with a few surprises involving a clandestine affair with a student and how relationships intertwine into a web of deceit, and the consequences thereof. A mix of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" meets "Fatal Attraction", the film is a bit predictable if not for the fantastic acting tête-à-tête between Dench & Blanchett, and ably supported by Nighy as Blanchett's cuckolded husband. (Dir: Richard Eyre)
GEORGE A. ROMERO'S DIARY OF THE DEAD (2008) ** Michelle Morgan, Joshua Close, Shawn Roberts, Amy Ciupak Lalonde, Joe Dinicol, Scott Wentworth, Philip Riccio, Chris Violette, Tatiana Maslany. Fifth and by far , weakest chapter in the zombie "Dead" franchise this time with filmmaker Romero taking the social poke at the media and the way-too-accessible video/Internet generation with another inexplicable plague of zombies causing quite the scene in America and focusing on a small band of PA college students shooting a horror film when all hell breaks loose. Quite frankly the violence is kept at arm's length and there is way too much chatter going on and far too likable characters to get involved with in this listless gore flick.
EASY A (2010) *** Emma Stone, Penn Badgley, Amanda Bynes, Dan Byrd, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Stanley Tucci, Cam Gigandet, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm McDowell, Alyson Michalka, Fred Armisen. Stone shines as a teenager facing a scandalous rumor  of being a harlot  that only snowballs when she cannot control and instead embraces the innuendo to largely comic affect echoing some John Hughes and of course "The Scarlett Letter". Director Will Glick ably gets a lot of mileage from virginity jokes and the like from the fairly smart and funny script by Bert V. Royal but gets more mileage from his even brighter supporting cast particularly the always welcome Clarkson & Tucci as the acridly humorous (and highly, capably understanding) parents. Stone's star is on the rise and she also rises above what would have been another ordinary teen farce but her trademark pluck and smoky voice add panache to what could have been a lackluster role. A nice surprise for a change in a genre that needs fresh blood!
THE FAULT IN OUR STARS (2014) **1/2 Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Nat Wolff, Laura Dern, Sam Trammell, Willem Dafoe, Lotte Verbeek, Mike Birbiglia. Woodley and Elgort star as teenagers with cancer who meet in a support group, make friends fast and fall in love in this somewhat predictable and flat-footed adaptation based on the best-selling novel by John Green (surprising since the writing team of Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber has usually yielded far-better results in past productions) and clumsily directed by Josh Boone. Admittedly I have not read the source material yet having said that this film in no way makes me eager to seek it out as a 'must read sensation' no thanks to some pretentious, teeth-grinding dialogue and Elgort's way-too-look-on-the-brightside-smug/jerky Romeo to the otherwise well-portrayed Woodley's Juliet. A dry-eyed tear jerker for this viewer; nary a tear was shed and that truly is sad.
LAKEVIEW TERRACE (2008) ** Samuel L. Jackson, Patrick Wilson, Kerry Washington, Regine Nehy, Jaishon Fisher, Ron Glass, Jay Hernandez, Justin Chambers, Robert Pine, Vanessa Bell Calloway, Eva La Rue, Michael Landes. Overheated rehash of "Unlawful Entry" by way of "Pacific Heights" and all those "Fill-in-the-blank From Hell" films of the late '80s and early '90s; in this case, "The Cop-From-Hell" has Jackson as an LAPD policeman whose attempts to rile and race-bait his new next door neighbors, an interracial couple (Wilson and Washington) to no end. This potboiler barely raises enough steam to get the pulse going or the interest sustained to its ultimately predictable final act no thanks to a pedestrian script by David Loughery and Howard Korder and surprisingly lame direction by button-pusher Neil La Bute.
MACHETE KILLS (2013) **1/2 Danny Trejo, Mel Gibson, Demian Bichir, Amber Heard, Michelle Rodriguez, Sofia Vergara, Charlie Sheen, Lady Gaga, Antonio Banderas, Walton Goggins, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Vanessa Hudgens, Alexa Vega, Tom Savini, William Sadler, Julio Oscar Mechoso, (Cameo: Jessica Alba). Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez' gone-loco-in-la-cabeza gonzo sequel to the grind house off-shoot shoot 'em up vengeance auctioneer has granite-faced Trejo's titular Federale on a mission from The President of the United States (um, Sheen) to thwart madman arms dealer (um, Gibson natch!) for his plans to infiltrate outer space (!!!) While the carnage is aplenty and the babes are a popping' (hello, Ms. Vergara!) the screenplay by the director and his bro Marcel (with Kyle Ward) has gone over the deep end to the point of a Looney Tunes gone amok. Perhaps next time (sigh, yes, in space!) less will be more.
THE REAPING (2007) * Hilary Swank, David Morrissey, Idris Elba, Anna Sophia Robb, Stephen Rea, William Ragsdale. Woefully pedestrian occult thriller that touchstones on "THE OMEN", "THE EXORCIST", "THE WICKER MAN", and "ROSEMARY'S BABY" in this hodgepodge horrorfest about a former Christian missionary (Swank) who lost her faith and is now a professional religious phenom debunker who has her hands full in a small town named Haven (!) that is going through the 10 biblical plagues with a spooky young girl (Robb). Despite an intriguing premise and decent visual effects the outcome is a rather laborious process (yes we get all 10 plagues!) and a lame 'twist' ending that only offers another horrendous plague-to-be: a sequel! (Dir: Stephen Hopkins)
300 (2007) *** ½ Gerard Butler, Lena Headey, Dominic West, David Wenham, Vincent Regan, Michael Fassbender, Tom Wisdom, Andrew Pleavin, Andrew Tiernan, Rodrigo Santoro, Kelly Craig. Remarkable and groundbreaking adaptation of Frank Miller's cult classic graphic novel depiction of the historic account of the Spartans vs. Persians battle royale of Thermopylae circa 480 B.C. offers a large amount of flexibility and imagination with its ferocious, hyper-stylized violence replete with "Matrix"-like video game speed changes in the action in its largely CGI digital world amazingly realized by filmmaker Zach Snyder (who co-scripted with Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon) with a breakneck gonzo anything goes style that will have fanboys (and non-fanboys) rejoice. Butler stands out as the stoic, stalwart King Leonidas with a hint of Sean Connery gravitas setting the tone for the epic adventure. Truly mesmerizing.
DESPICABLE ME (2010) *** (Voices of : Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Russell Brand, Julie Andrews, Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Elsie Fisher, Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud, Jemaine Clement, Jack McBrayer, Danny McBride, Mindy Kaling, Rob Huebel, Ken Jeong) Amusing and inventive animated fare with Carell voicing Gru, a villain with a lot of ambition but not always delivering on the execution who finds himself the unlikely foster parent to a trio of orphans who eventually melt his heart despite his ongoing feud with fellow villain Vector (Segel) who makes Dr. Evil look like a piker. Reminiscent in its design echoing the hey day of Rass-Bankin the overall look is fresh and very Charles Addams-ey (hell Gru looks like a dead-ringer for Uncle Fester) and the blend of humor and heart-tugging is pulled off nicely by its directors Coffin & Renaud (who also voice the circus peanut shaped 'minions' in Gru's arsenal of nefarity. **Spring for the extra surcharge in 3-D; the roller-coaster sequence is fairly queasy)
BROOKLYN'S FINEST (2010) *** Richard Gere, Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawke, Wesley Snipes, Brian F.O'Byrne, Will Patton, Lili Taylor, Shannon Kane, Ellen Barkin, Vincent D'Donofrio. Familiar yet well-acted police drama about three dispirate/desperate cops  on-the-brink-of-retirement/burn-out beat cop Gere (low-key excellent); deep undercover-to-the-point-of-no-return Cheadle (ditto); and vice squad member-close-to-being-dirty Hawke (intensely excellent)  whose daily trials and tribulations intertwine into a heady witches' brew of corruption, morality and ultimately redemption. Filmmaker Antoine Fuqua  no stranger to the genre ("Training Day" reunited w/Hawke)  delivers the potboiler/pressure cooker goods including the seemingly clumsy yet exciting final act thanks to a steadfast yet cliché-ridden script by newbie Michael C.Martin (an ex-MTA worker turned scribe). Barkin has a fun cameo as a butch ball-bustin' agent op.
BRAVE (2012) **** (VOICES: Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd, Craig Ferguson). Vibrant and fun animated tale from the geniuses at Pixar focusing on a heroine for a change as the protagonist - Merida (feistily voiced by Macdonald) - a Scottish princess whose desire to be independent only faces more and more adversity when her royal family decides its time for her courtship to commence despite her fervent wish to be her own person. Gorgeously animated and directed with skill by Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman and Steve Purcell - who collaborated on the spry screenplay with Irene Mecchi - the universal tale of a love between a mother and daughter are wonderfully presented with fierce clear-eyed clarity and genuine warmth for a family picture. *the 3D also adds to the storybook appeal with fantastic vistas* *And Pixar you may want to consider a live-action version after checking out Tara Cardinal - a dead ringer for Merida - in the forthcoming Legend of the Red Reaper :D
SINISTER (2012) ***1/2 Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Dalton Thompson, James Ransone, Michael Hall D'Addario, Clare Foley, Vicent D'Onofrio, Nicholas King. Eerie chiller about a has- been hot shot crime novelist (effective Hawke) whose infatuation with his latest subject - an apparent serial killer of families - comes too-close-to-the-truth for comfort and discovers thru a mysterious cache collection of home movies the supernatural connection therein. With some moments of nerve-shredding tension and the occasional jolt the thriller moves on all cylinders largely thanks to its lead anti-hero and a truly disturbing soundtrack thanks largely to sound designers Marc Aramian and Dane A. Davis and score by Christopher Young. Director Scott Derrickson - who collaborated on the twisty-turny screenplay with C. Robert Cargill - pulls out all the stops and his ingenious use of video stocks make it very timeless and its creature, "Mr. Boogie" is downright scary; the stuff of nightmares indeed!
F*CK (2006) **1/2 (Appearing: Steven Bochco, Pat Boone, Benjamin Bradlee, Drew Carey, George Carlin, Billy Connolly, Chuck D., Sam Donaldson, Janeane Garofalo, Ice-T, Timothy Jay, Ron Jeremy, Alan Keyes, Sandra Tsing Loh, Bill Maher, David Milch, Alanis Morissette, Tera Patrick, Evan Seinfeld, Kevin Smith, Hunter S. Thompson, Miss Manners) (Dir: Steve Anderson)THE word, the big one, the queen-mother of dirty words, the "F-dash-dash-dash" word! The "F-word" is still perhaps the biggest shock-value in the vernacular and its audacious vulgarity is on full display in this cheeky and somewhat informative talking-heads documentary incorporating pop culture, politics, religion, social manners and practically everything under the sun.Director Steve Anderson gains some insightful moments of the word's origins, myths such as acronyms - i.e. (For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge), how it is employed in language and grammatically so (anger; as a noun or verb, etc.), the way it is depicted in film (with a selection of some memorable on screen moments from its first film, "M*A*S*H" in 1970 on up to and including "Scarface" (some 180 odd times, "Pulp Fiction" to "Terms of Endearment" to my fave, "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" where Steve Martin says it 18 times in one hilarious sequence; interesting side-bar : no Martin Scorsese films or Robert De Niro letting his favorite expletive fly!), the notorious "7 Dirty Words" comic routine from stand-up comedian George Carlin and the initial rulings and finings from the FCC and even Vice President Cheney eating crow for his invective on the Senate floor.While the debate of how horrifying it still maintains its ugliness and the way it is colorfully used by the late, great stand-up comic Lenny Bruce remains to be a controversial state of affairs from the prudes who can't tolerate it (Boone and Miss Manners offering ridiculous rejoinders) to those who relish it (Milch whose "Deadwood" series on HBO averaged some 90 uses per episode in its rookie season), the explosive expletive still maintains a running board taboo in the right-wing conservative forum as well as the Christian collective in America (the film keeps the discussion almost exclusively to American dialogue) and how we use language in many shapes and forms, often with miscommunication as the end result.While the documentary has some entertaining bits, including the welcome animation from Bill Plympton, (for those who don't mind all the cussing) the film still spins its wheels more-or-less shrugging its collective shoulders as to no muss, no fuss with its no-frills demeanor. So if you don't have an interest you can say f**k it! Otherwise not too f*****g bad.
STEP BROTHERS (2008) *** Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Mary Steenburgen, Richard Jenkins, Adam Scott, Kathryn Hahn, Rob Riggle, Seth Rogen, Horatio Sanz, Andrea Savage, Gillian Vigman. Hysterically funny and incredibly stupid high concept comedy with Ferrell and Reilly making a fine comic duo as two 40 something men in arrested development who quickly find themselves new step brothers when their single parents get married leaving them to fight and eventually bond with one another. Collaborating on the asinine screenplay with director Adam McKay, Ferrell and Reilly are a stitch together again (their first teaming was on TALLADEGA NIGHTS) and create some pricelessly funny moments including a sleepwalking bit that is pure inspired lunacy.
THE BUCKET LIST (2007) *** Jack Nicholson, Morgan Freeman, Sean Hayes, Beverly Todd, Rob Morrow, Alfonso Freeman, Rowena King. Well executed but predictable dramedy about two strangers who become friends after discovering their one thing in common: both are dying from cancer. Nicholson and Freeman make for a fine cinematic duo as the unlikely partners in crime who are out to share in life's rewards before they 'kick the bucket'  hence the list of things to do prior. Filmmaker Rob Reiner gets both the drama and comedy balanced nicely and novice screenwriter Justin Zackham avoids the truly mawkish and instead finds the one theme: life is worth living with love in it.
UNKNOWN (2011) *** Liam Neeson, Diane Kruger, January Jones, Aidan Quinn, Bruno Ganz, Frank Langella, Sebastian Koch. Decent conspiracy thriller/action flick with Neeson (in pure Hitchcock-wrong-man-in-the-right-place/right-man-in-the-wrong-place mode) as, Martin Harris, an American botanist abroad in Berlin for a world conference who suffers amnesia after his taxi crashes into a waterway finding himself embroiled in atypical international thriller tropes  with plucky cabbie Kruger (platonically) abetting. Filmmaker Jaume Collet Serra's swift direction includes some great chase sequences (best bit: SUV vs. trolley car) and also caters to some humor (Quinn's 'faux' Harris and Neeson BOTH saying the same dialogue in each other's vein attempt to prove THEY are the REAL Harris borderlines "GET SMART" wackiness!) in this "BOURNE" hybrid with Neeson's other action hit "TAKEN"; hop on for the ride!
THE TOURIST (2010) ** Johnny Depp, Angelina Jolie, Paul Bettany, Timothy Dalton, Steven Berkoff, Rufus Sewell. Middling espionage romantic drama with Depp attempting to channel Cary Grant as an American abroad who winds up being seduced by Jolie a mystery woman involving them in an elaborate espionage tale that flounders thanks to the inert script by the usually reliable Christopher McQuarrie and Julian Fellowes, while director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's leaden direction falls flat-footed in an attempt to be Hitcockian, despite his leads natural charms and physical attributes in the romantic Venice environs.
HOME (2015) *** (Voice of: Jim Parsons, Rihanna, Steve Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Matt Jones) Sci-fi animated fare about a race of cowardly aliens that take over Earth but find immediate jeopardy when their most well-meaning but socially awkward members Oh (high octane Parsons) gives the enemy their new location. Hoping to rectify his wrong he befriends a human tween, Tip (a surprisingly energized Rihanna) who needs him to help her relocate her displaced mother inevitably leading to an odd couple bonding into BFF scenario. Colorful, funny and indeed warm-heartedly uplifting with its universal message (love yourself and your family even if family is your friends) for all ages to enjoy. (Dir: Tim Johnson)
FAST FOOD NATION (2006) ** ½ Greg Kinnear, Wilmer Valderrama, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Bobby Cannavale, Luis Guzman, Ana Claudio Talancon, Paul Dano, Patricia Arquette, Esai Morales, Ethan Hawke, Kris Kristofferson, Bruce Willis, Avril Lavigne. Absorbing and scathing  yet undercooked  fictional adaptation of Eric Schlosser's (who co-scripted with filmmaker Richard Linklater) best-selling indictment of the fast food industry in the United States aims at the economical, social and consequential elements of what goes on behind the scenes of a franchise under investigation for its less than wholesome demeanor and the scrutiny of its health conscious concerns. However despite its well-meaning attempts the ungainly pacing and clumsily staged interweaving of several story lines don't hold in the long run but still the acting is excellent (arguably Kinnear's best work and Willis' juicy, unsavory cameo is served with impeccable relish) and the theme, although told in straight-forward, no-screwing around methods seems a tad heavy-handed particularly in the climactic ending for those who feel it may be preaching to the choir to begin with.
9 (2009) *** (Voices of: Elijah Wood, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, John C. Reilly, Martin Landau, Crispin Glover) Awesome animated tale set in an post-Apocalyptic world (ok, Earth, even though it is never stated as so) where the future of humanity rests on the recently energized rag-dolls including the titular novice-would-be-leader (Wood) who wanders through out the wasteland and unites with his fellow denizens to ward off the powerful machinery that has risen up to destroy any living creature once and for all. Visionary in scope by promising newbie Shane Acker (and helped along by executive producer Tim Burton among others)  whose Oscar-nominated short is blown up to full-scale/feature length story  may lack in originality in the sci-fi genre but sets new standards in animation (the tactility of it all is truly amazing) none-the-less. Entertaining and a tad-too-dark for young audiences but just right for adults.
BOYHOOD (2014) ***1/2 Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, Lorelei Linklater. Filmmaker Richard Linklater's boldest and this-close to a masterpiece film depicting a boy's youth brought before your eyes with a genuine gimmick: filming in linear real-time over the course of 13 years of one clear-eyed yet amiable boy named Mason (newcomer Coltrane supporting the weight of the world on his tender shoulders with élan and effortless grace) whose life being bounced around the great state of Texas with his well-meaning yet struggling mother (Arquette in her finest role to date) and loving yet feckless father (Hawke, equally acquitting himself nice and low-key here) as well as dealing with all the pitfalls and opportunities youth entails. With warmth, humor, dead-on accurate dialogue and unique joie de vivre the film unspools in a non-rushed near three hours running time with effortless ease and carefree bliss - which also seems to arguably be its problem: there's very little drama or crisis involved in what is a remarkable lifespan of adolescence. The strengths are in its acting, directing and storytelling for the most part (Coltrane as he gets older feels like a natural actor) yet there is the nagging part of is this all that there is? Maybe that's the point. Whatever the case may be it is a tale worth telling and seeing. And living. And yes that is Linklater's real-life daughter as the older sister.
THE DIVIDE (2011) ***1/2 Lauren Graham, Michael Biehn, Milo Ventimiglia, Rosanna Arquette, Courtney B. Vance, Michael Eklund, Ivan Gonzalez, Abbey Thickson, Ashton Holmes, Jennifer Blanc. Excellent post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller about a small cache of survivors in a NYC subterranean fall-out shelter attempting to outlive the radiationand each other. Screenwriters Karl Mueller & Eron Sheean plumb the depths of human depravity in The Ultimate Game of What IF? With echoes of "The Twilight Zone"'s "The Monsters are Due On Maple Street" and 'torture porn' but way-shrewder with the stakes anted up to the hilt. True it is hard to be entertained with all the mental anguish and physical abuse reckoned on its talented cast particularly a Milla Jovovich-ized Graham; a haggard Biehn as the tough, racist building superintendent/host of the panic room; Arquette as a downward spiraling rapidly mother and hats off to Ventimiglia and Eklund as two jacked-up buddies who go into overhaul when the end of the world is literally at their doorstop. Director Xavier Gens doesn't pull the punches but sharply gets at the underpinnings of its post-9/11 trappings with aplomb; a must see for genre fans.
J.EDGAR (2011) *** Leonardo Di Caprio, Judi Dench, Armie Hammer, Naomi Watts, Josh Lucas, Durmot Mulroney, Jeffrey Donovan, Stephen Root, Ken Howard, Gerald McRaney, Geoff Pierson, Josh Hamilton, Jessica Hecht, Zach Grenier, Lea Thompson, Denis O'Hare. The life and times of J. Edgar Hoover, the commandant of the FBI (DiCaprio in another strong performance) , are depicted with his meteoric rise as the leader of the governmental unit of law enforcement and his personal demons bubbling just below the surface. DiCaprio's tenacity and strong support by Hammer as his thinly-veiled possible homosexual paramour (tightrope executed by the canny screenplay by Dustin Lance Black) and right-hand man Clyde Tolson are both award worthy. Director Clint Eastwood allows some sympathy for the devil but gets the details right in the process although the uneven make-up is a tad distracting.
WANTED (2008) ***1/2 James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman, Terence Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Common,Kristen Hager, Marc Warren, David O'Hara, Konstantin Khabensky, Dato Bakhtadze, Chris Pratt, Lorna Scott. Over-the-top and fantastically violent adaptation of Mark Millar & J.G. Jones' graphic novels about a guild of assassins who recruit an office drone (McAvoy in his breakthrough main-stream film certain to make him a household name and a Hollywood player) whose dead-end life gets a swift kick in the pants and a new lease on his true purpose: to be an ice-blood-in-his-veins killing machine. Truly jaw-dropping amazing visual effects not seen since "The Matrix" have made audiences sit-up in their seats (and on the edge of their seats), punishingly bloody violence permeating throughout with some dazzling set-pieces and the rail-thin embodiment of cinematic sexiness in Jolie as the heavily tattooed star of the organization providing some real sizzle. Packs a whallop. Directed with gusto by Timur Bekmambetov.
THE AIR I BREATHE (2008) ** Kevin Bacon, Julie Delpy, Brendan Fraser, Andy Garcia, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Emile Hirsch, Forest Whitaker, Clark Gregg, Kelly Hu, Taylor Nichols, John Ho. Odd yet somewhat engaging interlinking character by fate set of four vignettes involving Happiness, Pleasure, Sorrow and Love in Los Angeles has echoes of "Crash" and "Twenty Bucks". Whitaker is an accountant who runs afoul of a violent thug after a gambling bet goes awry; Fraser is a pre-cog hit-man for the violent thug (Garcia hamming it up), who has a Faustian deal with an up-and-comer pop singer (Gellar in one of her more memorable big screen turns); and Bacon is a doctor determined to save the woman he loves (Delpy) from a dangerous snake bite. The talented ensemble cast has a field day and novice filmmaker Jieho Lee  who co-scripted with Bob DeRosa  has an eye for the visual but not the compelling overall. Nice try anyway.
ATONEMENT (2007) *** Keira Knightley, James McAvoy, Saoirse Ronan, Brenda Blethyn, Harriet Walter, Ramola Garai, Vanessa Redgrave. Excellent adaptation of Ian McEwan's best- selling novel about an unlikely love triangle set in WWII Europe involving mistaken feelings, unspoken secrets, and the titular curse for its main characters. Newcomer Ronan is an amazing find as the young girl who turns things topsy-turvy for her older sister (Knightley in her best role to date) and lover (McAvoy equally good ), the well-to-do family's handyman when a communication breakdown sends the three into a decades long whirlwind with heartbreaking end results. Filmmaker Joe Wright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton make the familiar storyline something bright and new (and surprisingly humorous and expectedly haunting) but the length is a tad padded particularly the battle sequences at Dunkirk. But overall a well produced sad love story.
YOU KILL ME (2007) *** Ben Kingsley, Tea Leoni, Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Philip Baker Hall, Scott Heindl, Bill Pullman. Quirky black comedy about an alcoholic hit man (Kingsley having a field day) who is forced into rehab after failing to kill a mark, and finds himself with the help of his gay AA sponsor (Wilson), a shady real estate agent assigned as his 'babysitter' (Pullman echoing eerily a comic version of Michael Douglas' D-Fense look in FALLING DOWN), and a world-weary love interest (Leoni in her best work to date, who also co-produced) offering him a chance at a sober happiness, even if it kills him. Darkly funny screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely and deadpan direction with aplomb by John Dahl makes this neo-noir fest a surprising delight.
YOUNG ADULT (2011) *** Charlize Theron, Patrick Wilson, Patton Oswalt, Elizabeth Reaser, Collette Wolfe, Richard Bekins, Mary Beth Hurt. Theron shines in her best role since MONSTER as a 'monster' of another sort : a disillusioned, clueless, alcoholic former high school queenie makes a sort of homecoming to her Podunk town after learning her former beau (Wilson) has had his first child, and in a hare-brained scheme hatched vows to win him back while in the midst befriending fellow misfit classmate (Oscar-worthy Oswalt) in the process. Directed with comic elan by Jason Reitman and re-teaming with JUNO scribe Diablo Cody the film is a winning look at ' losers' and how often they grow up but never grow wiser. Best line from Oswalt re: his love for Theron: "Guys like me are born to love women like you."
LET'S BE COPS (2014) **1/2 Jake Johnson, Damon Wayans, Jr., Rob Riggle, Nina Dobrev, James D'Arcy, Keegan-Michael Key, Andy Garcia, Natasha Leggero. Better-than-anticipated (barely) high concept, low-brow comedy about two losers buddies (NEW GIRL's co-stars Johnson and Wayans) who decide to pep up their crummy lives as policemen after a costume party snafu results in them getting respect and a new-found self-respect. While the laughs are frequent (which is astounding since I can barely tolerate the normally shrill Wayans and the disappointed to learn Key was in the film; he acquits himself as a hybrid Rasta/Hispanic informant) the film needs easily twenty-minutes shaved off as the premise goes on far too long no thanks to a predictable script by hack filmmaker Luke Greenfield and his collaborator in crime Nicholas Thomas. The duo's chemistry makes up for the dumb and dumber histrionics and some genuine bellylaughs no matter the cost of dignity. Bonus: jar-head Riggle does a great job as a real cop and stand-up vet Leggero gets her ya-yas out as an oversexed aide-de-camp.
ELYSIUM (2013) **1/2 Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, Sharlto Copley, Alice Braga, Diego Luna, Wagner Moura, William Fichtner, Brandon Auret, Josh Blacker, Emma Tremblay. Hodgepodge sci-fi dystopia from filmmaker Neill Blomkamp with Damon as an ex-con living in hell-on-Earth in a wasteland that is LA in 2154 where the well-to-do live in a cosmic gated community space station that is about to get its just desserts when he unwittingly gains access to info about its NSA officer Foster (channeling Dick Cheney in Hillary Clinton's pant suits yet!) who's plans for a coup will endanger all of the world's struggling populace. While there are some inventive special effects and a good turn by Damon, the film feels cobbled together from '2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY'; take your pick of any Philip K. Dick mind-f#@k flick; any TWILIGHT ZONE and pretty much every sci-fi flick in the past 30 years; what's old is new again for the most part - the future sucks.
CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013) **** Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali, Michael Chernus, Catherine Keener, David Warshofsky, Corey Johnson, Chris Mulkey, Yul Vazquez, Max Martini. Absorbing and compelling true-life account of the 2009 Somali pirate hijacking of the American container ship Maersk Alabama with Hanks (in top Oscar worthy form) as the titular skipper, Rich Phillips, who uses his wits and stamina against all odds in a fight for survival at any costs. Directed with white-knuckle taut tension by veteran helmsman Paul Greengrass who knows how to balance the action and drama deftly with skill and élan. The keenly observant screenplay by Billy Ray (based on Phillips' book) keeps one riveted in spite of the outcome already known (not too shabby a trick to pull off). Novice actor Abdi (a Somalian cum American) as the head of the quartet of attackers is equally of note come awards season that has a verisimilitude not seen since Dr. Hang S. Ngor's Oscar-winning work in THE KILLING FIELDS. One of the year's best films.
Need for Speed is a great movie with a very enjoyable storyline and a very talented cast.The story is certainly nothing new or original,and the trailers don't make it seem like its going to be any different to the Fast and Furious movies but it is very enjoyable and dosen't feel like a carbon copy of previous car related films.What made this movie for me was its extremely confident cast,I am a huge fan of Aaron Paul,because of Breaking Bad of course,and I didn't think he would be able to deliver the same level of great acting as he does in Breaking Bad,but,while Tobey Marshall is certainly not Jesse Pinkman,he still delivers an outstanding performance,he clearly has a great movie career ahead of him and this is his first film since Breaking Bad finished,and there's no doubt he has more great performances ahead of him.I also really enjoyed Imogen Potts and Dominic Copper's performance,these are two actors I've heard of,but haven't seen in anything previously,but after seeing them in this I look forward to seeing them in more films.After he is let out of prison,Tobey Marshall sets out to seek revenge against the man who framed him for the death of his friend.
THE LAST EXORCISM (2010) ** Patrick Fabian, Ashely Bell, Iris Bahr, Louis Herthum, Caleb Landry Jones, Tony Bentley. Fairly creepy supernatural suspense 'mockumentary' in the same vein as "THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" with echoes of "THE WICKER MAN" in this indie produced by horror maven Eli Roth about a charlatan man of the cloth (Fabian affectively amiable and pitiable) who faces an ultimate challenge in the form of young Bell (very good in her on-the-dime changes in behavior/moods), a backwoods farm girl who may in fact be harboring a demon (or two) or is she? Rookie filmmaker Daniel Stamm employs the serviceable but rather predictable screenplay by Huck Botko & Andrew Kurland and milk it for all its worth with every genre trick in the book (spooky mood music; shadows; sudden jerks of the camera etc.) that offers a big set up with a somewhat unsatisfactory final reel (but it's a doozy). Fine for a Halloween rental for those who like 'reality' based terrors.
THE EXPENDABLES 2 (2012) *** Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Liam Hemsworth, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, Jet Li, Nan Yu, Scott Adkins, Charisma Carpenter. More machismo with even more '80s action relics added to the grab-bag check your IQ @ the door (and egos for the film's stars) continuation of Sly's (who co-scripted with Richard Wenk, Ken Kaufman & David Agosto) rag-tag mix of THE DIRTY DOZEN for the 21st century, this time with the motley mercenaries out for revenge/payback when a seemingly simple routine retrieval mission results in one of the team's death. Nice to have Bruce and Arnie get a bit more screen time this time (and spoiler alert: Li with lesser) but its kudos to scoring Norris as a lone wolf commando for hire bud and Van Damme (sea otter slick) as the preening villain (or Villain!) *nice* Cartoony, over-the-top with a high body count (cheesy good digital gore) and some winning/knowing asides to trademark one-liners (altogether "I'm BACK!") makes up for the dumb-as-they-come camaraderie. Guilty pleasure for the rock 'em-sock'em set and just when you think there' way-too-much testosterone on screen, Yu adds enough feminine wiles (and smarter-than-her-cohorts chops!) Directed by veteran action helmsman Simon West with just enough bonhomie brio; can't' wait for 3! :D
American GANGSTER (2007) ***1/2 Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Lymari Nadal, Ted Levine, Roger Guenveur Smith, John Hawkes, RZA, Yul Vazquez, Malcolm Goodwin, Ruby Dee, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Carla Gugino, John Ortiz, Cuba Gooding Jr., Armand Assante, Joe Morton, Ritchie Coaster, Jon Polito, Roger Bart. Commanding performances by Washington as '70s Harlem drug dealing gangster Frank Lucas and Crowe as relentless NJ special task force cop Richie Roberts propel this based on a true story account of the drug scene in NYC and how one man's rise to fame as the most notoriously wanted criminal, and the other's determination to bring him down is a shrewd portrait of the obsession for The American Dream. Veteran director Ridley Scott does a decent job in the at-times unwieldy but never boring screenplay by Steven Zaillian and captures the gritty time period with the usual style and panache.
THE HILLS HAVE EYES 2 (2007) ** Michael McMillian, Jessica Stroup, Daniella Alonso, Jacob Vargas, Lee Thompson Young, Ben Crowley, Eric Edelstein, Flex Alexander, Reshad Strik, Michael Bailey Smith, David Reynolds, Derek Mears, Tyrell Kemlo, Jason Oettle, Gaspar Szabo, Jeff Kober, Jay Acovone, Archie Kao. Relentlessly disturbing sequel to the remake of the Wes Craven cult classic (who serves as producer and co-screenwriter with son Jonathan), this time with a green platoon of National Guard recruits (and arguably some of the dumbest ones depicted on screen ever) being picked off one by one in the cruel New Mexico desert by its radiation-scarred mutant cannibal/rapists (both depicted in grotesque forms beyond the call of duty here in some stomach churning episodes of cruel debauchery). Only kudos can go to the make-up geniuses again of KNB EFX. (Dir: Martin Weisz)
INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL (2008) *** ½ Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett, Karen Allen, Shia LaBeouf, Ray Winstone, John Hurt, Jim Broadbent, Igor Jijikine. Fast, fun frenetic fourth "Indy" flick  a long time coming  in this 19 year later addition to the formidable action/adventure franchise with intrepid archaeologist Dr. Henry "Indiana" Jones, Jr. (Ford in remarkable shape and back into his iconic role fitting him like a glove after all these years), circa 1957, facing Russian baddie Irina Spalko (Blanchett in a Clara Bow wig and sporting a Natasha accent with a dominatrix vibe to the hilt having a field day), whose intent to use the titular 'maguffin' for nefarious reasons leads Indy to globetrot to stop her with the help from scrappy greaser Mutt Williams (LaBeof lending able comic support with a nod to Brando's "The Wild One" ) who may-or-not-be his son with former flame Marion Ravenwood (Allen a wholeheartedly welcome back reprise) amongst the midst of the trek into non-stop cliffhanging perils and crowd-pleasing scrapes. Filmmakers Steven Spielberg and George Lucas deliver the goods for the most part of this shaggy-dog story (Lucas co-scripted with Jeff Nathanson and David Koepp) that involves Roswell, New Mexico's fabled "Area 51" and the mystical myth of the lost city of El Dorado among other things added to the murky mix. Rip-roaring popcorn fare and for those naysayers remember "It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage" !
THE BOOK OF ELI (2010) *** Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis, Ray Stevenson, Jennifer Beals, Frances de la Tour, Michael Gambon, Tom Waits, Malcolm McDowell. Part "MAD MAX" part "THE ROAD" and practically every post-apocalyptic dystopian sci-fi/actioner in the past thirty years, this time with mysterious prophetic survivor or a nuclear wasteland/traveler Eli (Washington having a field day and kicking some serious ass) whose sole possession (read: a very special book  hint, hint, very suitable for the environs at present) is the source of a struggling humanity particularly nasty saloon-owner cum sadist Oldman (at his most reptilian) seeks to exploit the 'good word' for his own nefarious deeds. While Gary Whitta's screenplay is rote by design the tag-team sibling filmmakers, Albert & Allen Hughes, return to form in mixing comic-book stylistic action/gore and enabled by a truly epic production design by Gae S. Buckley makes up for its familiarity. Surprisingly profound in the final act yet undeniable popcorn crowd pleaser.
Friday THE 13TH (2009) **1/2 Jared Padalecki, Danielle Panabaker, Amanda Righetti, Travis Van Winkle, Derek Mears, Aaron Yoo, Jonathan Sadowski, Julianna Guill, Ben Freldman, Arlen Escarpeta, Ryan Hansen, Willa Ford, Nick Mennell, America Olivo, Kyle Davis, Richard Burgi, Chris Coppola, Rosemary Knower, Bob King, Nana Visitor. HA-HA-HA, CH-CH-CH-CH!! Fairly decent and decently violent reboot to the vastly popular horror franchise as the origin story of legendary Jason Vorhees (Mears), the hulking, hockey-masked, psychotic mama's boy/non- stop-killing machine, is re-imagined with Padalecki trying to find his missing sister (Righetti) at Crystal Lake where she was last known to be. Executive produced by Michael Bay and directed with breakneck gusto by Marcus Nispel (the duo teamed up to redo THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE as well) the film proves to rely on old fashioned jolts and gratuitous nudity (all not necessarily a bad thing, mind you ☺) Going back to the cinematic well has never been so giddily a guilty pleasure.
MUD (2013) **** Matthew McConaughey, Tye Sheridan, Jacob Lofland, Reese Witherspoon, Sarah Paulson, Ray McKinnon, Sam Shepard, Michael Shannon, Paul Sparks, Joe Don Baker, Bonnie Sturdivant. Filmmaker Jeff Nichols' superlative Southern-fried neo-noir character study and coming of age flick a la Mark Twain is a unique, bonafide keeper: affable drifter McConaughey (a career best award-worthy turn) is the titular anti-hero who is discovered by a pair of Arkansas backwater adolescents (Sheridan - a real, natural find - and Lofland) who are enlisted for his help with reuniting with his troubled lover (very low-key Witherspoon) after a criminal offense. To say more would ruin the experience of a fable unfolding while the noose begins to tighten. One of the year's best.
INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS (2013) *** Oscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, Ethan Phillips, Robin Bartlett, Max Casella, Jerry Grayson, Jeanine Serralles, Adam Driver, Stark Sands, John Goodman, Garrett Hedlund, F. Murray Abraham. The Coen Brothers' ode to the early '60s folkie scene in NYC focuses on misanthropic singer Davis (Isaac in a fine turn) whose knack for pissing off those he encounters runs neck-and-neck with his musical talents while keeping stardom (and any kind of hope for relationships) at arm's length. Great production design by Jess Gonchor and Bruno Delbonnel's bruised cinematography perfectly capture the essence of Greenwich Village in its hey-day.
CLASH OF THE TITANS (2010) **1/2 Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Flemyng, Gemma Arterton, Alexa Daalos, Tine Stapelfeldt, Mads Mikklesen, Izabella Miko, Polly Walker, Pete Postlethwaite, Elizabeth McGovern, Danny Huston, Natalia Vodianova. Remake of the '80s cheesefest sword & sorcery sci-fi fantasy extravaganza this time with Worthington(callow and all furrowed brow a la Crowe; including a buzz-cut!) as Perseus the half-human/half-god offspring of mighty Zeus (Neeson looking like a roadie for AC/DC) whose sibling rivalry with bro Hades (Fiennes resembling the contents of your sink's hair-trap) whose had it with the mortals and decides they need to pay more heed. Three words: "Release The Krakken!"  indeed! While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants (and odes to Ray Harryhausen's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale) the script by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand. Also: don't be fooled; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all!
WIND CHILL (2007) *** Emily Blunt, Ashton Holmes, Martin Donovan, Ned Bellamy, Chelan Simmons. (Dir: Gregory Jacobs)"The Sure Thing" meets "The Twilight Zone"Everyone loves a good ghost story and the latest installment on screen is a well-crafted suspenser that feels like "The Sure Thing" meets "The Twilight Zone" if written by Stephen King.Set in the frost-bitten winter of a small Pennsylvania college campus days before the Christmas break, a young coed (THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA's gloriously bitchy Blunt) is attempting to get back home to Delaware when her plans fall flat forcing her to chose a ride from the bulletin board to share expenses on her trek for the holidays.Her driver is a fellow student (A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE's Holmes) whose compact sedan is overflowing with all his worldly possessions (he claims he is in between living spaces), and harboring a secret crush on the pretty yet cranky passenger.En route the two do not hit it off at all and bicker back and forth making the tedious drive insufferable. While getting gas Holmes decides to take a detour on a snow-covered back road, claiming it'll be picture post-card perfect viewing to break up the monotony. Blunt becomes increasingly angry and demands they get back on the main highway and as they argue an oncoming car force them off the narrow path into a snow bank. With a crack in the gas tank, no food and no cell phone signal (natch) the pair suddenly discovers the bleak, quiet snow drifting countryside has a sinister presence that they will soon encounter.A surprisingly well-written screenplay by Steven Katz (SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE) and newbie Joe Gangemi, the dialogue rings true of the formulaic supernatural yet offers an intriguing premise interpolating Nietzchian thought (eternal recurrence)  the two were students in a philosophy class  and some fine moments of paranoia fueled anxiety for Blunt's heroine (is she in danger with this person or not), and although the 'ghost story' section feels a little rushed it works with the backdrop of the winter storm encroaching. Director Jacobs (who helmed the "NINE QUEENS" remake "CRIMINAL" for his long-time associates Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney's Section Eight production company (the high powered filmmakers serve as exec producers here) does a very good job of creating enough tension, sprinkled with dry humor mixed with dread employing tight editing by Lee Percy and a cool-to-the-touch cinematography by Dan Laustsen. The better-than-average film is buoyed by excellent acting by its stars, with Brit Blunt employing an impeccable American accent and making her bitchy 'girl' (as she is only referred to at the credits' close) redeemably likable and Holmes' 'guy' switched back and forth from mensch to menace. What is truly surprising is why the film has been neglected in marketing by Sony Pictures  its distributor  and why it wasn't released more appropriately in the dead of winter instead of the beginning of spring is beyond me. But if you want a decent ghost story on a secluded evening check this out.
REPO MEN (2010) **1/2 Jude Law, Forrest Whitaker, Alice Braga, Liev Schrieber, Clarice von Houten, Chandler Canterbury. Distjointed, violent sci-fi suspenser set in the near future (natch) about a system of repossession men who do just that to those who've missed payments on their new organs/health related surgeries (i.e. they surgically remove whatever has not been paid off yet!) Paging Philip K. Dick in this scattershot hybrid of "Total Recall"/"Blade Runner" & "Minority Report" with Law even echoing his android from "AI" (!) as the repo man who literally has a change of heart when he finds himself the hapless recipient of a techno-ticker. Bloody to a fault is one thing but the convoluted plottings by Eric Garcia (based on his novel "The Repossession Mambo") and Garrett Lerner runs on fumes by the final act and Miguel Sapochink's muddled direction doesn't help (but kudos to recognizing Monty Python's "Meaning of Life" segment featuring "We're hear for your liver" segment  even if it's just on a TV screen the main characters are enjoying).
HARSH TIMES (2006) ** Christian Bale, Freddy Rodriguez, Eva Longoria, Terry Crews, JK Simmons, Tammy Trull. Ugly and rapacious crime drama about a Gulf War vet (Bale at his most mesmerizing/over-the-top/compelling) whose sociopathic tendencies make it impossible for him to re-adjust into society in LA and shares his downward nihilistic spiral with his best friend (Rodriguez), a fellow loser who cannot grow up in spite of his loving career oriented girlfriend (Longoria), leading to an ultimate showdown of the consequences foreshadowing in thick black headings. Written by - and making his directorial debut - scribe David Ayer, the film is relentlessly repugnant and violent with a dread in one's stomach for the fated finale the stage has set for Bale's remorseless hedonist. Think a low-rent "Bad Lieutenant" and you get the idea.
TUSK (2014) *1/2 Justin Long, Michael Parks, Genesis Rodriguez, Haley Joel Osment, Johnny Depp. Filmmaker Kevin Smith's continuing threat to ending his career just may have hit its nadir (or is the joke on us?) To wit: douchy podcaster Long (replete with porn'stache and redonkulous girlfriend) treks to The Great White North to follow up on a story but when it falls thru finds himself in a surreal nightmare when he encounters mad-as-a-shithouse-rat storyteller Parks off the beaten path in the middle of nowhere whose dream to recreate a past experience (i.e. turning a man into a walrus!!!) comes scarily a reality. The utter ridiculously vulgar premise has its hiccoughs and moments of black humor and dread (largely thanks to the grotesque make-up concocted by Krisz Drouillard and Robert Kurtzman) can't make up for the WTF extended (unbilled) cameo by Depp as a wall-eyed Canadian homicide dick that borderlines Peter Sellers' Jacques Clouseau cartoonville and easily some editing to the long-winded dialogue that has one eye-rolling than eye-hiding hideousness. Just. Wow.
DREAM HOUSE (2011) ** Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, Naomi Watts, Elias Koteas, Martin Csokas, Taylor Geare, Claire Geare, Rachel G. Fox, Jane Alexander, Brian Murray. Ghost story about an upscale editor (Craig in a low-key decent performance) whose family's move into a new home in the secluded country discovers some dark secrets about the abode (i.e. it's haunted) and whether or not if he may or may not have killed off his family (!!) faces a moment of clarity when he learns of his reality not being as he truly perceives. Shades of "The Twilight Zone" and "JACOB'S LADDER" and yet scribe David Loucka keeps you guessing until the dismal third act which feels completely pre-fabricated by committee hence veteran helmsman Jim Sheridan's 11th hour attempt to remove his name from the credits (!!!)
BIG EYES (2014) **Amy Adams, Christoph Waltz, Krysten Ritter, Jason Schwartzman, Danny Huston, Terence Stamp, Jon Polito, Delaney Raye, Madeleine Arthur. Odd true-life account of artists Walter and Margaret Keane whose 'big eyes' portraits of waifs became a pop culture sensation in fact is a total fraud as the real works were done solely by Margaret (Adams giving quiet dignity to a beaten down woman) shrouded in secrecy by the charming yet odious Walter (Waltz over-the-top and not in a good way) until the lie could no longer mask the truth. Bizarre to say the least is the way the film comes across as an alleged 'comedy' (there's very little frivolity or even as a dark comedy falls flat) with the likes of master filmmaker Tim Burton reunited with his screen writing team of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (ED WOOD) that makes its protagonists into one-note cartoons (Margaret a sad, put-upon tragedy mask and Walter a melodramatic hambone hack with nothing but dollar signs in his eyes). Well-stocked with vintage character actors giving very little to do (i.e. Schwartzman's scold of a gallery owner and Ritter as a boho Betty gal pal of Margaret) only mars what-could-have-been fun and frenzy.
21 JUMP STREET (2012) *** Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Ice Cube, Brie Larson, Dave Franco, Rob Riggle,Chris Parnell, Ellie Kemper, Nick Offerman, Caroline Aaron, Joe Chrest. (Cameos: Holly Robinson Peete, Peter DeLuise, Johnny Depp) . Big-screen adaptation of the cult classic '80s TV series gets the comic overload reboot with Hill & Tatum as former high school nemeses who find themselves in the police and faced with undercover duty back to school to infiltrate a new drug pusher whose wares are causing some alarm. Better-than-anticipated yet still stupidly funny the film is far more entertaining than it should be thanks largely to the comic duo's chemistry and shrewdly incorporating the stars of the series in fun cameos. Hill, who co-scripted with Michael Bacall, executive produced with Tatum as well and Phil Lord & Chris Miller's forays from animation clearly evidence for the live-action shenanigans suggesting a Looney Tunes short at times. Nice chase scene with non-exploding vehicles as a tongue-thru-cheek attitude prevailed throughout makes a loser into a winner.
THE LAST KISS (2006) **1/2 Zach Braff, Jacinda Barrett, Casey Affleck, Rachel Bilson, Michael Weston, Blythe Danner, Tom Wilkinson, Eric Christian Olsen, Harold Ramis. "Diner" meets "Kicking & Screaming" by way of "The Graduate" could have been the pitch for this middling dramedy about a group of four twentysomething buddies facing the Big Choices in Life including Braff's dalliance with a hottie young college co-ed (Bilson) despite having a pregnant girlfriend (Barrett) in the mix; Affleck facing a marriage that is not working; lovesick Weston making a knee-jerk reaction to take a long-distance road trip; and perpetually horny Olson looking for the next quick lay. Immature? Sure. Grow up. Most definitely. However the ensemble makes the most of their underscored atypical roles thanks to a list-less script by Paul Haggis (loosely based on an Italian film, "L'ultimo bacio") and sturdy direction by actor Tony Goldwyn.
WAITRESS (2007) ***1/2 Keri Russell, Nathan Fillion, Cheryl Hines, Jeremy Sisto, Andy Griffith, Adrienne Shelly, Eddie Jemison, Lew Temple, Darby Stanchfield. Bittersweet romantic dramedy about the titular young woman (Russell in an affectively tart and tangy performance) whose unwanted pregnancy fuels her desire to leave her miserable marriage to a n abusive lout (Sisto) - whose only solace is her penchant for baking creatively inspired pies showcased at her diner - and winds up falling in love with her new ob-gyn Fillion (amiably sexy nice guy). Energized with a spry and witty ensemble including Hines as her best friend and fellow waitress providing some much needed sass and sensibility; artful codger Griffith as the small town impresario and owner of the restaurant she works in; and Shelley, who wrote and directed this wonderful slice of life smartly executed and poignantly underscored in no short measure to the tragic real-life undercurrent (Shelly was murdered several months prior to the film's release); this is a divine final chapter to her indie legacy and she should be honored for delivering a heartfelt labor of love; one last bit of trivia : that's Shelly's real-life toddler daughter in the coda. One of the year's best films.
THE BURNING PLAIN (2009)** Charlize Theron, Kim Basinger, Jennifer Lawerence, Jose Maria Yazpik, Joaquim de Almeida, Tessa la, Diego J. Torres, JD Pardo, Danny Pino, John Corbett, Brett Cullen, Rachel Ticotin, Robin Tunney. Non-linear sluggishly paced melodrama about two families torn apart by infidelities over the years that lead to some secrets & lies brought forth with repercussions lurking beneath the surface of this at-times frustrating film that wants to have its cake and eat it too. Written and directed (his debut) by Gullermo Arriaga the film tilts and turns with some fine ensemble acting but ultimately the viewer tires of the back-and-forth (literally).
42 (2013) *** Chadwick Boseman, Harrison Ford, Nicole Beharie, Christopher Meloni, Ryan Merriman, Lucas Black, Andre Holland, Alan Tudyk, Hamish Linklater, T.R. Knight, John C. McGinley, Toby Huss, Max Gail, James Pickens Jr., Brett Cullen, Jesse Luken. Ambitious yet straight-forward biopic about Jackie Robinson, the first black athlete to break the color- barrier in Major League Baseball, whose introduction to the Brooklyn Dodgers becomes more a journey of identity than skill and a study of racism in America in spite of them. Boseman is uncanny as Robinson who manages to balance grace and dignity with unchanneled anger while making the ranks of history with divine intervention from the team owner Branch Rickey (Ford in his best performance in years, while a tad hammy and chomping at the bit, generally appreciated for being the film's unspoken father figure) and the love of his life (beguiling Beharie). Filmmaker Brian Helgeland - who also penned the script - acquits himself by covering all the bases (particularly how even Robinson's own teammates' reluctance and ignorance speaks volumes) yet ham-strings in what could have been a bigger film (the movie only recounts his rookie year; important yes but so much more could've been explored). Still an inside-the-park home run for a true blue American hero.
THE WICKER MAN (2006) ** Nicolas Cage, Ellen Burstyn, Kate Beahan, Frances Conroy, Molly Parker, Leelee Sobieski, Diane Delano, Michael Wiseman, Erika-Shaye Gair (Cameos: Aaron Eckhart, James Franco, Jason Ritter) (Dir: Neil LaBute)Miscalculated remake of a horror classicWhy can't Hollywood ever leave well enough alone when it comes to remaking classics or in this case a cult classic? The latest sacrilege is the sluggish rehashing of the 1973 occult cult classic directed by Robin Hardy and written by playwright Anthony Shaffer about a mysterious island of pagans investigated by a pious, self-righteous and virginal Scottish constable played by Edward Woodward facing his destiny with the cult leader played by horror icon Christopher Lee (who claimed this was his favorite film and his best role!) The original film was maligned by its own studio and eventually developed its cult audience years later when a campaign began to re-release its original director's cut after the British studio, British Lion, relinquished a cut-and-paste hack job that was to be released originally stateside by maverick film producing legend Roger Corman (who owned a print luckily since the studio destroyed its original supposedly as land fill for a British highway!)I must admit I hadn't seen the original until just recently after speaking with a lovely young British babe at a friend's birthday dinner who had informed me she was a huge horror film fan and we were discussing our favorites when I mentioned the forthcoming re-make of this film! She suggested I see the original first  and after a lengthy search found a copy (the Americanized cut too) to rent and was surprised at how good it actually was. So when I went to see this new version I admit I was expecting something of it  something to hope would do justice to its original.Needless to say it did what I would've normally expected had I not seen the original: tank.The film takes place now in Puget Sound in Washington, where California cop Edward Malus (Cage) is beckoned by his ex-fiancée Willow Woodward (Beahan late of "FlightPlan"), who is living in a commune known for its honey exporting, to help her find her recently missing young daughter. Malus is also recovering from a horrible auto accident that has psychically scarred him so he figures to head to the woodsy isle  Summer's Isle to be exact  to get away from his demons and to possibly find out why Willow left him after all these years.When Malus arrives after negotiating a pick-up ride with the sea-plane pilot who brings the denizens their daily supplies, he discovers that the locales aren't exactly the welcome committee and have nothing but disdain for this man regardless of his being of the law (he's told his law doesn't matter there which fuels his anger/need to find out what became of Rowan, the little girl, even more). When he reunites with Willow she is skittish and full of paranoia suggesting something horrible has happened to Rowan. Malus continues to investigate and winds up deeper and deeper into this odd island's customs which seem to be a pagan cult eschewing any Christianity or morality much to Malus' increasing chagrin. What follows is a daisy-chain of unexplained red herrings and a wild goose chase to his fateful summation. To say more would ruin the original film's shocking close but here it is something of a relief for its trodding and ill-kept pacing.What is largely absent is the religious overtones that caused the struggle of the main character in the original piece whereby the post-feminism and misogyny LaBute ("In The Company Of Men") is best known for and makes a few significant changes including the aforementioned piety as well as a matriarch (Burstyn as Sister Summerisle) and a predominately female hierarchy that is only touched upon its most basic of principles. While Cage makes the most of his character it would have been real interesting to have someone like Edward Norton or Johnny Depp adding their own shadings to a possibly interesting protagonist, but to have Malus resorting to an old chestnut (spoiler: the girl is actually his daughter too) to have motivation only takes away from the mystery at hand. Is God really dead?LaBute is better known for his dense dialogue than camera-work and although a few nice moments of Cage getting his ya-yas out it doesn't quite gel and feels half-hearted in the long run. Supposedly both LaBute and Cage (whose production company Saturn Films is responsible for the remake) love the original and it's surprising how in such capable hands a remake was ill-advised.
BEGINNERS (2011) **** Ewan McGregor, Christopher Plummer, Melanie Laurent, Goran Visnjic, Keegan Boos, Mary Page Keller, China Shavers, Kai Lennox. Filmmaker Mike Mills' quasi autobiographical dramedy about a relationship skittish graphic artist (a never better career high point/Oscar worthy McGregor) attempts to maintain a potential new romance with a sexy French actress (luminescent Laurent) while coming terms to the recent cancer related death of his gay father (Plummer, a deserving choice as a nominee for Best Supporting Actor  long overdue!) after their recent bonding opens up new corridors of truth, acceptance and uncertainty of the future. The film is a pure testament to the power of love and its stranglehold whether it is platonic, mutually inseparable, familial or even between a human and a dog  to wit, Arthur the beloved and adorable Jack Russell Terrier (played with stoic charm by Cosmo). A true gem of a movie that will make you laugh through your tears and embrace life again; easily the best film of the year (or any year) I have seen in recent memory ; I Urge You To See This Immediately; Yes! It Is That Good!
THE HEARTBREAK KID (2007)* Ben Stiller, Michelle Monaghan, Jerry Stiller, Malin Akerman, Carlos Mencia, Rob Corddry, Lauren Bowles. Abysmally unfunny remake of the Neil Simon classic by the Farrelly Brothers who apparently are losing their gift of mixing heart and fart humor in this lame re-teaming with Stiller as a hapless schmuck (by the way, Ben, you need to move on with this pigeonholed cottage industry soon; getting a bit long in the tooth) who winds up with a hottie he marries (Cameron Diaz manqué Akerman, apparently attempting to remind viewers of the aforementioned's hit "There's Something About Mary"), who turns out to not be the dream woman he assumed she was, and winds up falling for other hottie Monaghan while on his honeymoon. Truly lacking in laughs and the fact that the awful Mencia is in this really takes the air out of the room. A huge disappointment.
THE ORPHANAGE (2007) *** Belen Rueda, Fernando Cayo, Roger Princep, Mabel Rivera, Montserrat Carulla, Andres Gertrudix Oscar Casas, Edgar Vivar, Geraldine Chaplin. Decent enough ghost story thriller from Spanish novice filmmaker Juan Antonio Bayona with a good amount of fear, suspense and overall well-developed production involving a mother (the ethereal Rueda) trying to come to grips and maintain her sanity when her young son disappears shortly after purchasing her titular upbringing edifice, and his 'invisible friends' proving to be more than imaginary. Presented and co-produced by fellow countryman filmmaker wunderkind Guillermo del Toro.
THE SWEENEY (2013) *** Ray Winstone, Ben Drew, Hayley Atwell, Steven Mackintosh, Paul Anderson, Alan Ford, Damian Lewis, Caroline Chikezie, Allen Leech, Ronnie Fox, Michael Wildman, Steven Waddington, Kevin Michaels, Kara Tointon. Big screen adaptation of the '70s British TV series (which I was not aware of previously existed) about an elite police force led by the Brit James Gandolfini, Winstone, whose bulldog-in-a-china-shop technique is at odds with a dangerous crew of jewel thieves and a bureaucracy hamstringing him in the process. Rookie filmmaker Nick Love seems the heir apparent to Guy Ritchie's fast paced action direction and the gritty, lean screenplay he collaborated with John Hodge - based on Ian Kennedy Martin's original source material - makes the familiar exciting again.
SEX DRIVE (2008) ** Josh Zuckerman, Amanda Crew, Clark Duke, James Marsden, Seth Green, Alice Grezyn, Katrina Bowden, Charlie McDermott, Mark L. Young, David Koechner. Hit-and- miss update of the teen sex comedy that steals liberally from '80s 'classics' like "The Sure Thing" and any John Hughes comedy, with Zuckerman (gratingly annoying to the film's detriment) seeking to lose his virginity by taking a road trip down south after his internet 'hottie' invites him to visit. Along for the trip are his best bud, Duke (making the most of the hilarity as an unikely stud) and platonic gal pal (Crew who equally is amiable/sexy) and some outrageous encounters (namely a well-versed Amish auto mechanic played drolly by Green) and Zuckerman's angry, jerk-off older bro Madsen (who displays some impressive comic chops in an homage to Bill Paxton's Chet from "Weird Science"). Ultimately forgettable but a digressive comedy none-the-less. (Dir: Sean Anders)
HUGO (2011) ***1/2 Asa Butterfield, Ben Kingsley, Chloe Grace Moretz, Sacha Baron Cohen, Emily Mortimer, Ray Winstone, Christopher Lee, Helen McCrory, Michael Sthuhlberg, Frances de la Tour, Richard Griffiths, Jude Law. Filmmaking genius Martin Scorsese takes on 3-D with aplomb in this highly visually entertaining adaptation of Brian Selznick's book about the titularly orphaned young lad (newcomer Butterfield) who discovers a whole new world from his introverted tragic one  cinema!  after investigating the source of an intriguing automaton left as his father's legacy upon his terrible death  and the world of the Parisian train station he inhabits. Scorsese pulls out every movie-making trick in the book with a fond valentine to silent screen mastermind Georges Melies (played by Kingsley with just the right air of sad elegance) and his incredibly creative films. The gorgeous production design by longtime collaborative Dante Ferretti, winsome score by Howard Shore and brilliant cinematography by ace cameraman Robert Richardson truly transports the viewer into a microcosm of wonder. For children of all ages and a cinemaphile's dream come true.
UNTRACEABLE (2008) ** Diane Lane, Billy Burke, Colin Hanks, Joseph Cross, Mary Beth Hurt, Peter Lewis, Perla Haney-Jardine. Listlessly routine serial killer thriller with Lane getting in touch with her inner Ashley Judd as an FBI special agent on the trail of an elusive cyberspace lunatic whose website runs on fear with literally every hit it gets causes his victims to die quicker and more painfully on a live simulcast. A crazy quilt of "Silence of the Lambs", "Se7en", "Saw" and any other serial killer thriller of the past decade. Director Gregory Hoblit does the best he can with the pedestrian script by Robert Fyvolent & mark Brinkier and Allison Burnett and the rather vanilla turn by Cross as the villain.
BLUE JASMINE (2013) ***1/2 Cate Blanchett, Alec Baldwin, Sally Hawkins, Andrew Dice Clay, Bobby Cannavale, Louis C.K., Peter Sarsgaard, Max Casella,Tammy Blanchard, Michael Stuhlbarg, Ali Fedotowsky. Woody Allen's "A Streetcar Named Desire" could've been the working title of the dramedy with echoes of Tennessee Williams' classic play. Blanchett (superb) is a well-heeled NYC socialite who finds her life in downward spiral in the aftermath of her lecherous financial genius husband's scheming and bilking his clientele of their monies, including her sister (wonderful Hawkins), who she seeks solace in San Francisco. To add insult to injury the Ghosts of Kowalskis Past, Present and Future (respectively Clay, Cannavale and C.K.) are harbingers of collective guilt and misdeeds all associated with her and her duplicitous husband (Baldwin at his oiliest) in ping-pong flashbacks of better times. While Allen's grand larceny in stealing the themes and plot lines from the playwright he instills his own neuroses and his Xanax popping, martini swilling Blanche(tte) makes her own bed to sleep in the process. Well executed with fine ensemble (a remarkable Clay as the spurned brother-in-law who will not let sleeping dogs lie) and daft comic timings with razor-sharp cuts to the soul.
IN BRUGES (2008) ***1/2 Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes, Clemence Poesy, Jordan Prentice, Eric Godon, Zlejko Ivanek, Anna Madeley, Elizabeth Berrington, Thekla Reuten, Peter Dinklage, Ciaran Hinds. Entertaining comedy/drama about two British hit men (Farrell and Gleeson, both at the top of their games in career high turns), sent abroad to Bruges, Belgium by their ruthless boss (Fiennes having a nasty field day and a kissing cousin to Ben Kingsley's vulgarian of "SexyBeast") after a botched killing with Farrell's outspoken, plain-minded shooter hating every moment in the picaresque town. Gleefully funny, un-PC and surprisingly violent in the third act, novice filmmaker martin McDonagh makes an extraordinary debut in one of the year's best sleeper.
THE HAPPENING (2008) *1/2 Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, John Leguizamo, Ashlyn Sanchez, Betty Buckley, Alan Ruck. M.Night Shymalan's shameless attempt to conjur the ghosts of Rod Serling by way of Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds" only proves that the once promising filmmaker is running on vapors in this ridiculous sci-fi What-IF Doomsday Thriller when an inexplicable event occurs causing people to kill themselves for no unknown reason and incorporating the usual conspiracy theories and outlandish scientific 'reasonings' that simply wind up as a lead balloon of a movie that is truly disappointing on all counts: wooden acting, stilted dialogue (the likes of which had me rolling my eyes it was so poorly done!) and some truly unintentional laugh-out loud moments of WTF?! I'm done with MNS; you'd be wise to do the same.
MILK (2008) **** Sean Penn, Emile Hirsch, Josh Brolin, Diego Luna, James Franco, Alison Pill, Victor Garber, Denis O'Hare, Joseph Cross, Stephen Spinella, Lucas Grabeel, Brandon Boyce, Howard Rosenman, Kelvin Yu. Penn gives a career high performance as Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official of San Francisco, during the historical '70s paving the way for gay rights and activism to the nth degree in pursuing a political career while maintaining his dignity, integrity and free spirit until his slaying by fellow supervisor Dan White (Brolin walking the fine wire of brilliance in making a possible caricature into a full-blooded human being; warts and all) in 1978. Filmmaker Gus Van Sant's dedication and talent trailblazed the biopic (after nearly 20 years) and the straight-forward (no pun intended) screenplay by Dustin Lance Black gives a fine etching of the man and the myth. But it is buoyed by the total immersion of Penn who gives an Oscar worthy (and the film as a whole as well) performance; one of the year's very best and an inspiration to the human spirit at its greatest.
American HUSTLE (2013) **** Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner, Louis CK, Jack Huston, Michael Pena, Shea Whigham, Alessandro Nivola, Elisabeth Rohm, Robert De Niro.David O. Russell's blackly funny satire of sorts about a pair of grifters (Bale, with a combover from Hell and paunch to boast of gleeful deglam, and Adams proffering a come-and-go Brit accent) who find themselves in a bind when ambitious Fed (Cooper in a homemade perm and ego to boost) is out to make a name for himself by concocting Abscam (more-or-less) in the process. The best Martin Scorsese film Martin Scorsese never directed could best sum up this miasma of horrid clothing choices and questionable hygiene replete with a stellar soundtrack of pop AM nuggets and a root-for-the cons to win heart line. Crackerjack cast scores with hilarity including Renner as a well-meaning NJ mayor in the midst (and apparently Joe Pesci's wig rejects) and especially Lawrence as trashy but foxy smart wife of Bale's and funny man CK as Cooper's by-the-book schlump superior. Cleverly concocted script by Russell and Eric Singer has dialogue that sings and just enough gumption to make more for less.
UP (2009) **** (VOICES OF: Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, Delroy Lindo, Jerome Ranft, John Ratzenberger) Pixar continues their streak of instant classic animated fare outdoing themselves in arguably one of their very best: widowed codger Carl Fredricksen (voiced with gruff yet lovable zeal by Asner) finds himself being forced to vacate his life-long home and instead decides to (finally) go on a promised adventure to Venezuela by tying literally thousands of balloons to his home and aloft from its mooring sail away to Paradise Falls. Along for the ride is stowaway Russell (Nagai in an affective vocal turn for a youth), a 9-year old Wilderness Scout wanting to assist the elderly for his final badge of honor, much to Carl's chagrin. Written and directed with flair, style, humor and most importantlyheart, by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson (who provides hysterical voice work as Dug, a 'speaking' dog the duo encounter, who steals the movie), the film transcends all ages and truly inspires magical moments that will have you feeling like a kid again while crying through your laughter (the early montage of Carl and his wife-to-be Ellie is for the film vault that ranks up there with any Chaplin flick; silence is golden). My pick (so far) for Best Film of the Year and hand's down Best Animated Picture come Oscar time; one of the year's very best films and one you should see immediately!
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY (2012) ***1/2 Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Ken Stott, Graham McTavish, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Stephen Hunter, Dean O'Gorman, Aidan Turner, John Callen, Peter Hambleton, Jed Brophy, Mark Hadlow, Adam Brown, , Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Andy Serkis, Sylvester McCoy, Barry Humphries, Jeffrey Thomas, Michael Mizrahi, Lee Pace, Bret McKenzie. Peter Jackson returns to the fold in this epic prologue to THE LORD OF THE RINGS, with the first tale of THE HOBBIT, pitting a formidable dwarf platoon led by grand wizard Gandalf (McKellen returning too boot) and reluctant Bilbo Baggins, the titular anti-hero, all out to stop the dwelling evil within the confines of Middle Earth and the surrounding fauna as well as the evil incarnate of dragon Smaug. While treading familiar territory for fan boys including some incredible set pieces (plenty of Orc battles YES!) the film is not an instant classic as its fore bearers largely due to the too many characters (a baker's dozen of regrettably forgettable dwarfs - sorry it's true) and very little darkness that permeated the previous trilogy. Still for epic filmmaking Jackson is in a class by himself reunited with Philppa Boyens and Fran Walsh (co-scripting with once-attached-to-helm Guillermo del Toro) and state-of-the-art CGI still non-paraleil (*I did see this in IMAX 3D however not in the new format where the FPS have been tinkered with).
MONSTERS UNIVERSITY (2013) (Voices of : Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Helen Mirren, Peter Sohn, Joel Murray, Sean Hayes, Dave Foley, Charlie Day, Alfred Molina, Tyler Labine, Nathan Fillion, Aubrey Plaza, Bobby Moynihan, Noah Johnston, Julia Sweeney, Bonnie Hunt, John Krasinski, Bill Hader, Beth Behrs, Bob Peterson, John Ratzenberger, Frank Oz) Superb prequel to the Pixar/Disney classic with the origin story of how dynamic duo Mike Wazowski and James P. "Sulley" Sullivan (Crystal and Goodman reunited; feels so good) met in college as competitive rival students aspiring to be 'scarers' and eventually BFFs with a ragtag motley crew of co-eds and frat rats to boot. Funny, frenetic and wonderfully animated thanks to the warm-hearted and loose-limbed direction by Dan Scanlon who collaborated on the well- constructed screenplay by Robert L. Baird and Daniel Gerson. Newcomer Sweeney as the overly sweet mom of one of the duo's classmates steals the show but the true star is the eye candy colored universe of the merry monsters. One of the year's best.
THE GREEN ZONE (2010) *** Matt Damon, Greg Kinnear, Brendan Glesson, Amy Ryan, Jason Isaacs, Khalid Abdalla. Damon and filmmaker Paul Greengrass team up again in this kissing cousin to their "BOURNE" films, this time setting the action in Iraq circa 2003 with the relentless pursuit of 'weapons of mass destruction' ends up in the bupkus bin until Damon gets wind of a real lead by a civilian (Abdalla) and begins to put the pieces of deceit together with conspiracy thriller written all over thanks largely to Brian Helgeland's rat-a-tat-tat screenplay adaptation of Rajiv Chandrasekaran's book "Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone") and the ratchet tension created by the director (although I could've done with the been-there-done-that 'shaky-cam' he consistently decides on using).
DUE DATE (2010) ***1/2 Robert Downey, Jr., Zach Galifianakis, Michelle Monaghan, Jamie Foxx, Juliette Lewis, Danny McBride, RZA, Matt Walsh. Hysterically funny road trip to hell comedy from filmmaker Todd Phillips (who co-scripted with Alan R. Cohen, Alan Freedland & Adam Sztykiel) with Downey as an uptight architect whose beautiful wife (Monaghan) is due with their first child, and his unbelievable misfortune in running into bad penny actor-wannabe Galifiankis (a riot!) forcing him off his airplane and into a living nightmare of one ridiculous moment after another in his trek to his impending family with the comedy of errors escalating. Loaded with belly-laughs of epic proportion, the odd couple is a stitch as the increasingly violent prone Downey frustratingly attempts to make sense of the completely moronic yet sweet Galifianakis to the point of sheer madness. Truly satisfying blend of vulgarity and sentimentality.
THE MESSENGER (2009) *** Woody Harrelson, Ben Foster, Samantha Morton, Jena Malone, Eamonn Walker, Steve Buscemi. Excellently acted character study set during the current Gulf War crises with Harrelson & Foster as a pair of soldiers given the heady task to bring the bad news to families of fallen officers. Delicately balanced by newcomer director Oren Moverman (who collaborated with the straight-forward, adult screenplay with Oren Moverman), the film echoes Hal Ashby's COMING HOME in its tone and succeeds in bringing a cinematic face to our troubled times. All the leads give career highs in their talent, which is a true example of seeing such craft skillfully accomplished.
GEORGE A. ROMERO'S SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD (2010) ** Alan Van Sprang, Kenneth Welsh, Kathleen Munroe, Devon Bostick, Richard Fitzpatrick, Athena Karkanis, Stefano DiMatteo, Joris Jarsky, Eric Woolfe. Sixth and stiffest entry of horror-meister Romero's treatise on the zombies genre with a continuing storyline from "Diary of the Dead" following rag-tag military leader Van Sprang trying to find solace on an island off the coast of Delaware and instead discovers the undead have competition in the unlikely form of a Hatfields/McCoys feuding families involving two Irish patriarchs O'Flynn (wily Welsh) and Muldoon (martinet Fitzpatrick) in dealing with the dearly departed. Wildly uneven with plenty of plot holes and weak screenplay dialogue (Romero seriously needs a collaborator on the next venture; it's getting as stale as one of his lumbering ghouls). Only fresh-faced sexy Munroe adds some spice as twins and some decent make-up effects make it worth the trip.
THE LOVELY BONES (2009) *** Sairose Ronan, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, Stanley Tucci, Susan Sarandon, Jake Abel, Rose McIver, Nikki SooHoo, Reece Ritchie, Amanda Micahalka, Michael Imperioli. Peter Jackson's visually overloaded yet heartfelt adaptation of the vastly popular novel by Alice Sebold about the brutal murder of a 14 year old girl during the 1970s (Ronan in a remarkable performance) whose soul lingers in the afterlife trying to communicate with her loved ones to bring her killer (a truly creepazoid performance by Tucci) to justice. Strongly knit acting, impressive production designs and shrewd sprinkling of music (best sequence set to Tim Buckley's "Song To The Siren" by This Mortal Coil" affectively hauntingly ethereal and pitch-perfect!) makes the story come alive even if its candy colored fantasia gets away with itself from the heart-breaking storyline crafted.
GODZILLA (2014) *** Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, Juliette Binoche, Richard T. Jones, Victor Rasuk, Carson Bolde, CJ Adams. The 20th Century King of The Monsters gets a 21st Century reboot with the gigantic lizard reawakened along with some other surprises in filmmaker Gareth Edwards frequently rewarding, but long-winded reimagining. While its blue-chip cast is largely wasted (sorry Cranston, Hawkins and Binoche), and in spite of its far-too-long-in-expository chatty screenplay by Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham, Edwards manages the monster mash in the final act to be relatively worthy of its ticket price in IMAX 3-D (the only way to see it). The CGI holds up even if there are echoes of CLOVERFIELD's creature design and Edwards' reliance in playing peek-a-boo like he did in his fairly deceptive MONSTERS. While it eschews the ethos of a man-in-a-rubber suit demolishing a miniature set it still echoes the classic film's strong Atomic age messing with Mother Nature underpinnings.
THE LINCOLN LAWYER (2011) *** Matthew McConaughey, Ryan Phillippe, Marisa Tomei, William H.Macy, Josh Lucas, Frances Fisher, John Leguizamo, Michael Pena, Byran Cranston, Michaela Conlin, Michael Pare, Bob Gunton, Trace Adkins, Pell James, Shea Whigham. McConaughey makes a fine comeback in this tailor-made role mixing his charm and smarts equally as Mick Haller, a crafty defense attorney  who negotiates from his Lincoln Continental (hence the title from Michael Connelly's best seller), who may have met his match in his newest client Phillippe, a bad boy rich kid accused of a brutal rape  with several twists and turns en route. Crackerjack B-movie with an A-list supporting cast and a pretzel twisty, humor laced adaptation by John Romano gets shrewd direction from Brad Furman in a strong debut. **SPOILER** A stand-out scene is the pressure cooker courtroom showdown where a convict 'witness' (Whigham, hysterically low-key and steals the movie; charge him with grand larceny!) give a side-splitting testimony. Better than it has every right to be and then some; a genuine surprise overall.
LAND OF THE LOST (2009) **1/2 Will Ferrell, Anna Friel, Danny McBride, Jorma Taccone, John Boylan,(Voice of : Leonard Nimoy) (Cameo as himself: Matt Lauer) Hodgepodge hybrid adaptation of the cult classic '70s Saturday Morning sci-fi TV series tailored to Ferrell's comic sensibilities with the bumbling comic cast as Dr. Rick Marshall, a scientist whose wacky prognostications of time travel leads himself and a plucky student (the winsome Friel) to attempt using his new invention to propel them into prehistoric times with impressively surrealistic results. Along for the ride are redneck carny owner McBride (don't ask) and their encounter with Missing Link, Cha-Ka (Taccone) as well as the dinosaur kingdom and the nefarious lizard/aliens, the Sleestaks. While it is a gung-ho, gonzo interpretation it is needless to say something of a disappointment for those fans of the original in that it is surprisingly vulgar and even for a Ferrell comic vehicle, dopey (by the way where the hell is Dopey the brontosaurus?!) A few yuks here and there and some chancy f/x make for a middling Jurassic Lark. (Dir: Brad Silberling)
30 DAYS OF NIGHT (2007) *** Josh Hartnett, Melissa George, Danny Huston, Ben Foster, Mark Boone Junior, Mark Rendall, Amber Sainsbury, Manu Bennett, Megan Franich. Gruesome adaptation of the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith about a remote Alaskan hamlet besieged by a plague of vampires at the dawn of their month-long descent into darkness. While the premise is intriguing the execution is a tad tedious but the violence and action surpass the limits of director David Slade's lurching helmsing. Kudos to the make-up artists squad for some truly inventive effects and nasty creatures of the night in their befanged glory.
DON JON (2013) **1/2 Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore, Tony Danza, Glenne Headly, Brie Larson, Rob Brown, Jeremy Luke, (voice of Paul Ben-Victor). Gordon-Levitt makes his big-screen filmmaking debut as writer/director in an ambitious yet very flawed dramedy about a New Jersey guido (um, one full star subtraction Just For That Crime Against Humanity; Thanks JGL!) whose online porn addiction threatens a possible new relationship with superficial Johansson. While the ensemble cast makes up for the stereotypical caricatures they embody, Gordon-Levitt has his hands full in making a one-note Johnny redeemable but Moore's adult education co-ed adds some much needed ballast to an otherwise over-the-top vibe sustained throughout. Hopefully next time the aspiring auteur will take into accounts that not all Jersey guys are ass-hats.
THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS (2009) ** George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Lang, Robert Patrick, Stephen Root, Glenn Morshower, Nick Offerman. Middling satirical comedy trying in vain to be a 21st century "Catch-22" meets "Dr. Strangelove" with intrepid reporter McGregor (seemingly miscast as an American) whose desire for finding real news lands him in the Middle East where he comes across Clooney (gung-ho kookiness in check), claiming to be a former member of the US Army's First Earth Battalion, which incorporates paranormal techniques for its self-professed 'Jedi Knights' (mmm, maybe that's why McGregor was cast  tongue-in-cheekily?). Despite a game cast (including Bridges as the hippie-a-la Lebowski officer who created the zany program) and its latter day Coen Bros.' vibe, novice filmmaker (and frequent Clooney collaborator) Grant Heslov has a somewhat flat-footed way of directing and the screenplay by Peter Straughan (based on Jon Ronson's book) is a hit-and-miss affair yet there are a few goony laughs to be had.
BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF America FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN (2006) ** Sacha Baron Cohen, Ken Davitian, (Cameo: Pamela Anderson as herself) Cohen's alter ego, Borat Sagdiyev, the Kazakhstanian 'telejournalist" makes the big screen transition in a mockumentary with the foreigner traveling across America in pursuit of meeting Pamela Anderson and in the process meeting its citizens with great skill at making the awkward and uncomfortable into an improvisatorial art with moments of genius that recall Andy Kaufman's take-no- prisoners guerilla comedy but the novelty grows weary by the film's end but I get the joke ; it's only a question if you will. (Dir: Larry Charles)
CAPTIVITY (2007) * Elisha Cuthbert, Daniel Gillies, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Michael Harney, Laz Alonso, Chrysta Olson, Carl Paoli, Trent Broin. (Dir: Roland Joffe)Repugnant and reprehensible; a new low in torture porn.The latest to cash in on the new 'torture porn' subgenre of the slasher horror film is perhaps the most repugnant and reprehensibly stupid offering to audiences in some time and that's saying a lot with the high being SAW and the middle-brow HOSTEL on vapors with its last chapter recently.The film focuses on a famous super model named Jennifer (24's Cuthbert) who is lured to a hot nightclub under false pretenses, is drugged and abducted by a madman who returns her to his dank, creepy home where he plans on torturing her apparently for being a famous person and also someone who may or may not resemble his mother (ah, mommy issues!) It really doesn't matter as the plot for what it's worth is just about subjecting a hottie to one sick display of violent methods at his demented whim (i.e. subjecting her to a smoothie concocted of a Tupperware container of bloody human tissue including an eyeball) for four never-ending, hellish days until she realizes she is not the only one being held captive when she meets another young attractive person named Gary (Gillies), who also is being subjugated to the psycho's physically nauseating acts (i.e. a painful removal of a tooth by pliers). The two eventually are allowed to remain together in one of the labyrinth-like chambers the lunatic has throughout his lair untiloh yeah, 'the twist'  which quite frankly is rather lame and eye-rollingly awful. Not to mention the fact that an Oscar nominated director is attached to this dreck, Joffe ("THE MISSION" and "THE KILLING FIELDS") should be ashamed even if it is true as the rumor goes that there was many cuts to his work in the process (the film was under brutal scrutiny in a controversial turn of events this year with its publicity of billboards that depicted Cuthbert in its pornographic trappings). Never the less I blame schlock screenwriter Larry Cohen (who collaborated with newbie Joseph Tura) for this mess. Cohen scripted recently "PHONE BOOTH" and "CELLULAR" and is responsible for the cult classic "IT'S ALIVE" but where those three projects offered some originality and genuine tension here there are no likable characters nor any reason to invest time and care into the reason once the twist is revealed. Let's just say sibling rivalry is involved.What is really a shame is the state of the modern day horror film in its bankablility at the box office and critical acclaim at a discerning low; is it conceivable audiences are just too jaded and laugh at any type of on screen terror since we've been immune to violence for decades upon decades and simply want to be entertained? The horror, the horror.
CONTRABAND (2012) ***1/2 Mark Wahlberg, Kate Beckinsale, Ben Foster, Giovanni Ribisi, Lukas Haas, Caleb Landry Jones, Diego Luna , JK Simmons. Better-than-anticipated action/drama about an ex-smuggler-gone-straight-family man (Wahlberg, getting in touch with his inner-Cagney), who must pay for the sins of his foolish brother-in-law (Jones) who gets on the bad side of scumbag Ribisi. Wahlberg's calm-before-the-ass-kicking façade, Ribisi's greasy jag off thug and yeoman character actor of his generation Foster with his canny snake-in-the-grass characterizations rise above the B-movie plot (based on an Icelandic film "REKJAVIK-ROTTERDAM" by Arnauldur Indridason & Oskar Jonesan gets the true blue Hollywood adaptation by Aaron Guzikowski, with some quality crafty set-pieces). The original film's producer, Baltasar Kormakur, directs and allows his star to take full control proving his mettle as a box office draw even in the paper-thin-storyline.
SHOOT 'EM UP (2007) ***1/2 Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, Monica Bellucci, Stephen McHattie, Ramona Pringle, Greg Byrk. Over-the-top, tongue-thru-cheek action-packed piece of pulp fiction that has no qualms about going the extra yard for ludicrous content with this overstylized, hyperkinetic homage to the genre with laconic every(anti-)hero Smith (Owen at his uber cool best gleefully enjoying every silly, macho moment) getting neck deep in a heinous plot involving the hit assigned to a newborn infant for the nefarious deals of a corrupt politician and the evil Hertz (Giamatti relishing his scuzz-ball villain to the hilt) out to do the dirty deed. Along for the ride is zaftig Amazonian, lactating hooker-with-a-heart- of-gold Donna Quintano (sex goddess Bellucci at her most luscious) in league with her paramour to save the baby at any cost. Relative newcomer filmmaker Michael Davis pulls out all the stops and gets the heart pumping with new fervor even while you're thinking how ridiculous it all seems. Think a Tarantino film meeting a Bugs Bunny Looney Toons cartoon (replete with Smith's carrot munching and original usage as weapons!) A true guilty pleasure for the popcorn crowd.
TALK TO ME (2007) *** Don Cheadle, Chiwtel Ejiofor, Taraji P. Henson, Martin Sheen, Cedric the Entertainer, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Mike Epps. (Dir: Kasi Lemmons)Cheadle Sparkles in BiopicDon Cheadle is perhaps the most underrated best actor of his generation giving it all in every film performance and not getting the true props and recognition for his craft of versatility. Perhaps this, one of his best roles to date, will change perspectives overall.Cheadle plays ex-con Petey Greene, a street-smart smoothie, attempting to go legit by looking up a fellow prisoner's brother, Dewey Hughes (Ejiofor also giving an excellent turn), an uptight Washington, DC radio programming manager on the rise who is at a crossroads himself in the hope for bigger and brighter things in a broadcasting career he aspires to. When Petey arrives, all hell breaks loose, with genuine concern expressed by Dewey's boss E.G. Sonderling (Sheen) who has given him the daunting task of making the station a more viable form of entertainment for its dwindling listening in audience. Dewey reluctantly sees inspiration in the foul-mouthed Greene and recruits him only after a series of arguments, insults and a one-up-manship in a game of pool reducing Greene to his basics: a brother in need of a j-o-b.After a near disastrous opening show, Greene is given one more shot by a scheming Dewey (who locks out all the staff as Greene goes into his fast-talking no b.s. mode) with the gambit paying off to callers ringing the phones off the hook. In the interim, Dewey begins booking Greene on stand-up comic networking him into a local TV showcasing the controversial DJ and eventually to the top: a spot on "The Tonight Show" in NYC. Director Lemmons deftly balances the prickly comedy with the genuine drama best depicted in the day Martin Luther King, Jr is assassinated and having Petey shine in his finest hours telling it like it is and uniting the city from the firestorms and rioting in the streets. She has a good command for her actors allowing each one to shine like the formidably funny and fierce Henson as Petey's vulgar yet golden-hearted hoochie mama. Overall the acting is solid and on the money, again with Cheadle and Ejiofor showing deft acting chops with versatility of drama and comedy.The only flaw in the otherwise fine screenplay by Michael Genet and Rick Famuyiwa is you never get the full story on this larger than life character who has something of a kindred spirit with the late, great Richard Pryor yet the film manages to push on with his sadly limited life (Greene succumbed to cancer in the mid'80s). The gift of gab has never been so enjoyable.
THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998) **** Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, Peter Stormare, John Turturro, David Thewlis, Sam Elliott, Ben Gazzara, Jon Polito, Flea, Aimee Mann. Hysterically funny comic noir salute to THE BIG SLEEP from masters of mirth and menace The Coen Brothers gives a wide brush on the genre with one of cinema's greatest characters ever on The Silver Screen, The Dude (Bridges in an unexpected iconic role having a blast and resembling/channeling Warner Bros. Looney Tune Pete Puma; seriously his facial qualities are uncanny), a leftover '60s hippie/radical/slacker who unwittingly is mistaken for the titular LA entrepreneur (Huddleston) in a wild-and-woolly kidnapping scheme by a pack of numbskulled nihilists. Fast and riotously funny and inimitably quotable (i.e. "That rug really tied the room together") with outstandingly out-there performances by Goodman as The Dude's main amigo and bowling partner Walter Sobchak ("I don't bowl on Shabbas"), Buscemi as their dim bud Donny ("You're out of your element Donny!"), Moore as an avante garde artiste, and Turturro as a 'pedarast' sporting foe. So many scenes and quotes to call my favorites but Walter's non-stop rant about Vietnam and showing a dullard teen what happens when you F*** A STRANGER IN THE ASS!! are the tops. The Dude Abides!!!
HECTOR AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS (2014) *** Simon Pegg, Rosamund Pike, Stellan Skargard, Toni Collette, Christopher Plummer, Ming Zhao, Barry Astma, Jean Reno, Sivan Raphaely. Disjointed and off-balanced yet ultimately inspiring and inspired performance by Pegg (who stretches his acting muscles here nicely) as an in-a-rut psychiatrist whose drab everyday life is taking its toll in spite of a solid relationship with sunny Pike that leads him to embark on a globetrotting journey of the titular emotion. Based on Francois Lelord's novel the screenplay by Maria von Heland, Tinker Lindsay and the film's director Peter Chelsom is unwieldy yet well-meaning in making its buffoonish (at first perceived) protagonist wearing blinders to What Life Really Is and That It Is Inside (and at Home) ultimately encountering other cultures, a few misadventures (including a menacing kidnapping) and bonding with one's fellow man (Raphaely's role as a critically ill airline passenger gives the best line: "Listening is love" as the perfect koan for the them evoked. Peppered with some Walter Mitty-esque animation the film takes itself not-too-seriously and keeps its hero on track.
AS ABOVE SO BELOW (2014) ** Perdita Weeks, Ben Feldman, Edwin Hodge, Francois Civil, Marion Lambert, Ali Marhyar. Shaky-cam be damned horror film with familiar formula - band of morons go into a dangerous environment without letting anyone know where they are and only half of aforementioned morons know of the occult warnings presaged upon them : a pretty young explorer attempts to get in touch with her inner Indiana Jones by finding the gates of hell (literally) miles under the streets of Paris within the city's historical catacombs housing millions of dead. Not a good idea; ya think? While the filmmaker John Erick Dowdle has had experience with the enclosed claustrophobic set themed films before here it gets tedious and frankly hoping someone would strangle Weeks for getting them in this clusterfuck he and his partner in crime/bro Drew Dowdle. In spite of a handful of WTF moments blending THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and cribbing seriously from the aforementioned INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE the ending is something of a shocker (but not in the genre sense; just trust me on this and for that this study in stupidity gets one extra *
BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD (2007) **** Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Albert Finney, Marisa Tomei, Rosemary Harris, Aleksa Palladino, Michael Shannon, Amy Ryan, Brian F. O'Byrne. Filmmaker Sidney Lumet's pitch- perfect drama of errors about two seriously f@cked up brothers (Hoffman and Hawke, both at the top of their game) who conspire to rob their parents' jewelry store find themselves in a downward spiral when things go horribly awry. Novice scribe Kelly Masterson's screenplay is a wonderful conceit on an old chestnut with sharp dialogue and seriously flawed characters that is equally absorbing and repelling. One of the best films of the year.
CHEF (2014) ***1/2 Jon Favreau, Sofia Vergara, John Leguizamo, Bobby Cannavale, Emjay Anthony, Robert Downey, Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt, Amy Sedaris. Funny and warm-hearted comedy with Favreau (who wrote and directed and a return-to-form- with-his-indie-roots) as the titular artiste de culinary who finds a mid-life crises when his creative desires to break free from his stable but unhappy job in a tony LA eatery leads to embarking on a new venture in the unlikely form of a food truck dishing out Cuban cuisine for the working class. Amiably ambling along at a fine clip with enough food porn for the least- interested in the subject and mouth-watering designs for those who crave some new juice in the familiar domestic comedy with father/son bonding over good eats. Anthony as the sharply observant son is a natural while the fine ensemble keeps things lively namely Leguizamo as Fav's aide-de-camp sous chef and Vergara as his comely ex. Better than leftovers.
THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) ***1/2 Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Seigner, Marie-Josee Croze, Anne Consigny, Patrick Chesanais, Niels Arestrup, Olatz Lopez Garmendia, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Marina Hands, Max von Sydow, Isaach De Bankole. Remarkable, deeply devastating yet powerful portrait of the human spirit in the form of French ELLE editor Jean-Dominique Bauby (Jon-Dom) (Amalric in a mesmerizing performance), who suffered a debilitating paralytic stroke rendering his entire body into a 'locked in' state  his only physical movement is his left eye to blink communiqué in an arduous process  while his mind remained fully intact, cognizant and imprisoned. Parts heart-breaking and life affirming with a healthy dose of grim humor thanks largely to a bevy of beauties as Jon-Dom's health aides and affairs of the past/present. Director Julian Schnable makes the impossible  a feature length film about a crippled protagonist  a feast for the eyes (thanks largely to the beatific cinematography from acclaimed cameraman Janusz Kaminski) and the adaptation of Bauby's true-life account published 10 days prior to his death in 1997 at the age of 43 truly is an amazing account of the will of the mind.
DRAG ME TO HELL (2009) ***1/2 Alison Lohman, Justin Long, Lorna Raver, Dileep Rao, David Paymer, Adriana Barraza, Chelcie Ross, Molly Cheek, Reggie Lee. Filmmaker Sam Raimi returns giddily/ghoulishly back to his horror roots in this entertaining and fiendishly funny spookster with sweet bank loan officer Lohman finding herself cursed by an elderly gypsy (Raver making an affective villain to trouble one's sleep since the hey-day of Freddy Krueger!) after she has rejected for an extension on her home. What follows is bad news and three days to make good or find herself on the highway to well the title is appropro. Raimi's skillful use of sound and vision to play tricks on the unsuspecting audience and milk every genre cliché (i.e. squeaking gates, sudden jolts, debunking fortune tellers) that the end result is a humdinger of a good time watching someone truly going through hell to avoid it. One of the best horror films in years; welcome back Sammy!
WANDERLUST (2012) *** Paul Rudd, Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux, Malin Akerman, Alan Alda, Ken Marino, Joe Lo Truglio, Kathryn Hahn, Kerry Kenney, Lauren Ambrose, Michaela Watkins, Jordan Peele, Linda Lavin, Jessica St. Clair, Todd Barry. Frequently hilarious fish-out-of water, high-concept comedy: dissatisfied NYC Yuppie couple Rudd and Aniston find themselves out-of-luck in The Big Apple and wind up in a hippie-dippy commune in this highly engaging comedy of errors with a fantastic comedic ensemble including Theroux as the group's defacto touchie-feelie ringleader and Marino as Rudd's a-hole bro. Rudd continues to do the side-of-the-mouth sarcasm with elan and Aniston has her juiciest role on screen since "The Good Girl". (DIR: David Wain)
THE DUELLISTS (1977) ***1/2 Keith Carradine, Harvey Keitel, Diana Quick, Albert Finney, Tom Conti, Edward Fox, Cristina Raines, Robert Stephens, John McEnery, (Narration: Stacy Keach) Filmmaker Ridley Scott's big-screen debut channels Stanley Kubrick in this fascinating tale of honor - and dishonor - among men and the consequences thereof : to wit in Napoleanic Europe two French officers (Mutt and Jeff, Carradine and Keitel - studies in stoicism and pig- headedness, respectively) enable one another in the ultimate grudge match lasting nearly two decades resulting in endless duels to prove to one another (and themselves) the futility of violence and what it truly means to have honor. Scott's (to be) trademark eye for visual detail and production design are clearly showing an artist's promise enlisting Frank Tidy 's stunning cinematography; gorgeous production design by Peter j. Hampton and Tom Rand's fantastic costumes. Also noteworthy are his protagonists making each one intriguing - what makes them tick and just why they continue the seemingly repetitive study in ego/genuine honor and what really makes a man (in spite of a military background) a man. Richly narrated by Keach and a surprisingly well-played turn by the beautiful Quick as Carradine's lady-in-waiting. Based on Joseph Conrad's novel. And yes that is an impossibly young Pete Postlethwaite shaving Carradine's general.
PAUL (2011) *** Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, (voice of: Seth Rogen), Kristen Wiig, Jason Bateman, Bill Hader, Joe Lo Truglio, Jeffrey Tambor, John Carroll Lynch, Jane Lynch, David Koechner, Jesse Plemons, Sigourney Weaver (Cameo voice over as himself: Steven Spielberg). "Close Encounters of The Geek Kind" could've been the working title for this funnier-than-it-has-a-right-to-be sci-fi valentine comedy from Brit duo Pegg & Frost (who co-scripted) as two UK sci-fi geeks who trek to the USA to see every genre landmark and find themselves with a fugitive alien (Rogen toking good times!) attempting to get 'home' after the Feds are hot on their tails. Slacker homages to all things genre in the pop culture riffing (best bit: a redneck roadhouse's rendition of John Williams' 'cantina theme' from "Star Wars") goes a long way but director Greg Mottola keeps things at an even keel.
THE EXPENDABLES (2010) *** Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Steve Austin, Randy Couture, Eric Roberts, David Zaya, Giselle Itie, Charisma Carpenter(cameos: Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger) Guilty pleasure actioner with Stallone  who directed & co-scripted with Dave Callaham - (and many "I Love the '80s" action heroes) getting together in this popcorn crowd-pleaser about a group of mercenaries targeted for death after their attempt to get a handle on a Latin American dictatorship regime run by former CIA creep Roberts (oily to the max) with enough testosterone and pyrotechniques to supply that fictitious nation (and then some!) Balls-to-the-wall carnage, ginormous fireballs and explosions to the max, and oh-yeah  a "Planet Hollywood" shareholders on screen meet-and-greet with Sly, Arnie & Bruno that eclipses Pacino & DeNiro's diner sequence in HEAT (!) Take off your thinking caps and hang on!
HAIRSPRAY(2007) *** Nikki Blonsky, John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Queen Latifah, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron, Elijah Keeley, Allison Janney, Taylor Parks, Paul Dooley, Jerry Stiller. Winning adaptation of the Broadway musical smash hit based on the John Waters (who has a naughty cameo) cult classic about a '60s era Baltimore teenager Tracy Turnblad (fun newcomer Blonsky) whose love for the local teen dance show "The Corny Collins Show" leads her dream come true by becoming a member of the ensemble and into hot water during the turbulent Civil Rights movement. Fantastic production design by David Gropman, candy colored art direction by Dennis Davenport and wonderful costumes by Rita Ryack help propel director Adam Shankman's vision come true but the true stars are the tart songs by Marc Shaiman and energetic cinematography by Bojan Bazelli prove to be crowd pleasers especially the climactic "You Can't Stop the Beat". While it is a grotesque delight to see Travolta in fat-suit drag it is also a tad off-setting (he looks like Katherine Helmond form "BRAZIL" crossed with HR Puf'N"Stuf!) yet he pulls it off (and still has his dancing jones good!)
TAKEN 3 (2014) *** Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Forest Whitaker, Dougray Scott, Sam Spruell, Leland Orser, Jon Gries, Dylan Bruno, Don Harvey. Neeson is back as Bryan Mills, the man with a 'special set of skills' who finds himself as a fugitive in the murder of his ex-wife (Janssen) and his attempt to find the real criminals while protecting their daughter (Grace) in the process. While Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen reteam with a more tight and streamlined screenplay than the last chapter of the successful high octane franchise - as well as its director Olivier Megaton keeping things lively - it is still predictable as to who the perpetuator is even before he makes his appearance. Still Neeson is undeniably dynamite as the stolid avenger and the ass-kickings are more viscerally fulfilling.
HAPPY FEET (2006) *** (VOICES OF: Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Robin Williams, Hugo Weaving, Johnny A. Sanchez, Carlos Alazraqui, Lombardo Boyar, Jeff Garcia, Fat Joe, Magda Szubanski, Miriam Margolyes, E.G. Daily, Steve Irwin, Anthony LaPaglia,) Surprisingly better-than-anticipated animated family fare about a happy-go-lucky misfit penguin named Mumble (Wood), whose lack of having a signature 'song' that all of his breed have, instead has the titular syndrome of tap dancing to the beat of his own drummer and his quest to find his 'voice' in the world. Some amazing CGI animation of the arctic landscapes and the amusing characters including Williams as a Latino-flavored fine-feathered friend and a Barry White-influenced lothario penguin are take it as you please entertaining. (Dir: George Miller)
SAW IV (2008) * Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, Scott Paterson, Betsy Russell, JulieBenz, Meagan Good, Mark Rolston, Carlo Rota, Greg Bryk, Laura Gordon, Joris Jarsky, Mike Butters, Al Sapienza. Yet another entry in the ever indefatigable "Jigsaw" franchise with its share of gore and splatter-ific Rube Goldberg contraptions to punish sinners, that takes place after the last chapter involving the two surviving police men (Mandylor & Paterson) attempting to solve the mystery behind the late madman (Bell, reprising his iconic role.again, in flashback, since well his death!) Ultimately the repetition and murky cinematography prove to be the kiss of death: boring. While David Hackl, a production designer who concocted many of the mangling machinery for the franchise makes his directorial debut he doesn't exactly rise to the occasion; maybe next time (yeah, I'm sure there'll be a sixth installment!)
YOUNG AT HEART (2008) **** Rock of ages In Stephen Walker's documentary or should I say 'rockumentary'  the Young at Heart Chorus, a group of senior citizens who sing rock and roll songs, based in Northhampton, MA, is profiled with breadth and levity showcasing their individual talents as well as performing as an ensemble, as well as their ailments and the living testimony that it is never too late to rock 'n' roll.Founded by Bob Cilman, a fifty something year old 'kid', originally as a choir specializing in old pop standards, Broadway show tunes and 'old folk' music he came up with the idea over 25 years ago to incorporate classic and contemporary rock staples which became something of a gimmick at first but fully realized as something more: underscoring many of the lyrics with a unique perspective and interpretation by his octogenarian sect (the media age of 80).Since then the group has barnstormed all over the country  and the world  and getting much acclaim. Walker films the several weeks of rehearsal for a new gig and Cilman's tough task-master skills at display in attempting to get his singers to hit the right notes, pick up the right beat cues and most importantly now the song cold. While there are some frustrations felt by Cilman for the most part he is fair and allows his group the time and effort to develop into a finely tuned body that is surprising in the process not only how they are attuned but also how they function. What is unexpected is the melancholy feel throughout as some of the members fall into bad health situations (sadly two of its key singers pass away before their fated concert the film focuses on) but it is also with plenty of humor, insight of what it means to be elderly but not 'old' and how in the autumn of one's life one can appreciate a new calling (i.e. many of the choir prefer classical music than the genre they are covering).The true highlights are the short videos interspersed through out the doc including "Stayin' Alive", "I Wanna Be Sedated" and a clever "On the Road To Nowhere", as well as a performance at a state prison to a captive audience. I was overwhelmed by the professionalism the troupe displayed as 'amateurs' in the old adage "the show must go on" and the true emotional peak is member Fred Knittle's heart- wrenching work on Coldplay's "Fix You" as a suitable eulogy to his fallen comrades; if you don't cry then you are simply made of stone.I whole-heartedly recommend you to seek this indie doc out and experience rock and roll in its purest form I've seen in a long time: aged yet wise, like a fine wine. One of the year's best.
A MOST WANTED MAN (2014) **1/2 Philip Seymour Hoffman, Robin Wright, Rachel McAdams, Grigoriy Dobrygin, Willem Dafoe, Homayoun Ershadi, Mehdi Dehbi, Nina Hoss, Herbert Gronemeyer. Stuffy, staid and hard-too-follow reason from risk adaptation of John le Carre's spy thriller about a disgraced German spymaster (Hoffman in his final starring role does his best but not a memorable turn sadly by any means) attempting a return-to-form by tracing the whereabouts of a Chechen Muslim (the titular character, played far-too-rigidly by Dobrygin) with links to a philanthropist with possible ties to a terrorist organization (read: Al Qaeda). The post 9/11 trappings, far too dreary sequences and a less than stellar screenplay by Andrew Bovell doesn't help in spite of Anton Corbijn's stylish direction and fine cinematography by Benoit Delhomme (autumnal rusts and steel blue chromes).
THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010) **** Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer, Josh Pence, Justin Timberlake, Max Minghella, John Getz, David Selby, Rashida Jones, Rooney Mara. Filmmaker David Fincher's masterful direction and a clever adaptation of Ben Mezrich's book "The Accidental Billionaires" by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin is exemplary in this look at the starting point of the Internet phenom, Facebook, and how its 'founder' in question Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg in a star-making, shrewd turn), a Harvard computer science geek whose 'revenge of the nerds' trappings belies his genius in tapping into the social zeitgeist of enhancing the college experience into the global ethersphere by incorporating a shred of an idea consulted on by fellow classmates, the Winklevoss brothers (Hammer & Pence), crew rowing to-the-manor-borns-wanna-be capitalists and throwing his best (and only) friend Eduardo Saverin (amiable patsy Garfield), the chief financier, under the boss in his seemingly ruthless chance to cash in on something truly amazing (no thanks to gadfly turn by Timberlake, the catalyst as Napster creator Sean Parker, seeing dollars & sense for his comrade-in-arms). Telling true just how maddeningly addictive the format is (me? Guilty as charged) and how one can be overwhelmed and yet embraced of the fruits of one's labor (apparently at any cost) is the stuff dare I say it as a 21st century CITIZEN KANE? Easily the film of the year (so far) and a damn entertaining one too boot!
BE KIND REWIND (2008) *** Jack Black, Mos Def, Danny Glover, Mia Farrow, Melonie Diaz, Sigourney Weaver. Frequently funny comedy of errors about a run-down VHS rental store in Passaic, NJ that encounters a unique situation when their entire inventory is accidentally erased: its simple yet well-meaning clerks (Black & Def making a fine comic duo) use old- fashioned ingenuity by re-shooting the Hollywood films with their own video camera and the home-made offerings begin a cult, rabid following from its clientele. The original film by wunderkind auteur Frenchman Michele Gondry is a wonderfully concocted, nutty and joyous ode to the art of film and more importantly for the film lover at heart; a truly special valentine to cinema even if its third act's echoes of Sturges and Lubitsch pull a bit hard on the heartstrings. Best bits are the recreations of "Ghostbusters" and "RoboCop".
BODY OF LIES (2008) **1/2 Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, Mark Strong, Golshifteh Farahani, Oscar Issac, Ali Suliman, Alon Abutbul, Simon McBurney. Murky geopolitical drama based on David Ignatius' novel about a CIA op (DiCaprio) attempting to take down a Bin Laden-ian terrorist in the Middle East with handler Crowe (going the full Clooney  gaining 50 pounds and literally phoning in his performance) acting as his eyes and ears throughout the course of action that has many pitfalls and dark alleys to pursue. Filmmaker Ridley Scott, working with an at- times-hard-to-keep interesting screenplay adaptation by William Monahan, does his best but ultimately the listlessness is bogged down until the final explosive act.
THE WAY,WAY BACK (2013) *** Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Allison Janney, AnnaSophia Robb, Sam Rockwell, Maya Rudolph, Liam James, Rob Corddry, Amanda Peet, River Alexander, Zoe Levin, Nat Faxon, Jim Rash. Summer vacation coming-of-age comedy with mopey teen James forced to stay with his mom and her jerk boyfriend for the season and makes the most of it by discovering a new life at the local water park. With a fine ensemble cast (including writers/novice-directing team Faxon and Rash) the film coasts on its breezy screenplay and fun field day run by Rockwell (getting in touch with his inner Bill Murray/Walter Matthau) as the slacker employee who befriends the kid but the tenuous tension by the abrasive miscasting of Carell sinks the possibility of a dramedy (or even a real moment of James getting even with the jerk stepfather-wannabe). Echoes of "The Flamingo Kid", "Meatballs" and "Adventureland".
BLACK SNAKE MOAN (2007) **1/2 Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, Justin Timberlake, S. Epatha Merkerson, John Cothran, Jr., David Banner, Michael Raymond-James. Overheated sultry piece of Southern Gothic pulp fiction about an aging R&B singer/farmer named Lazarus (Jackson in arguably his strongest role since "Pulp Fiction") whose struggle to deal with his wife's infidelity leads him to the bottle and crosses the unlikely path to salvation and redemption in the broken form of a young woman named Rae (Ricci in her best work to date) whose unhealthy sexual urges leads to an odd coupling in this melodramatic fable. Fierce acting by the leads buoy this 'button-pushing controversial' story (yeah, the black-white thing and the centerpiece sequence where Lazarus chains up the fevered, 'wicked' Rae nearly takes over the core of the film  a love story; get over it!) and filmmaker Craig Brewer smartly lets his actors work themselves into a lather for this ripe morality tale, however the final act ends too abruptly which makes the previous seem arbitrary by design.
THE THREE STOOGES (2012) **1/2 Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, Chris Diamantopoulos, Jane Lynch, Sofia Vergara, Jennifer Hudson, Craig Bierko, Stephen Collins, Larry David, Kirby Heyborne, Carly Craig, Kate Upton, Brian Doyle-Murray (Cameos: The cast of "THE REAL WORLD" as themselves). The Farrelly Brothers' valentine to the violent prone vaudevillian classic comedy team of Moe, Larry & Curly (well-enthused & highly energetic dopplegangers Diamantopoulos, Hayes and Sasso) starts as an origin story that dovetails into a save the orphanage romp with the dim-witted trio out to stop foreclosure on their beloved home by forcing themselves into 'the real world' and finding themselves ensnared in a dubious murder-for-hire scheme (don't ask). While the thin screenplay by Bobby & Peter (and collaborator Mike Cerrone) is weak in its premise it's the greatest hits (literally!) of the comedy team's pokes, boinks and bone-crushing interplays with one another is a true delight to rekindle even if it will more than likely prompt you (and justifiably) to seek out the originals' videos to watch in the comfort of your own home.
PARKER (2013) *** Jason Statham, Jennifer Lopez, Michael Chiklis, Nick Nolte, Wendell Pierce, Clifton Collins, Jr., Bobby Cannavale, Patti LuPone, Carlos Carrasco, Michah Hauptman, Emma Booth. Statham serves well as a revenge seeking crook with a code who is out for vengeance - and his slice of the pie - after a heist of double crosses leaves him for dead. High octane actioner with a swell ensemble and Lopez' best on screen role since "Out Of Sight" as the fly-in- the-ointment real estate agent that comes into Statham's plan-of-action-by default. Directed with gumption by vet Taylor Hackford and John C. McLaughlin's crackerjack adaptation of the late, great pulp fiction scribe Donald E. Weslake's novel "Flashfire" (under the Richard Stark pseudonym).
I LOVE YOU MAN (2009) **** Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Rashida Jones, Jaime Pressly, Jon Favreau, Sarah Burns, Jane Curtin, J.K. Simmons, Andy Samberg, Rob Huebel. (Cameos as themselves: Rush & Lou Ferrigno) Hysterically funny 'bromantic' comedy about a sweet guy named Peter Klaven (the criminally underrated and dryly uproarious Rudd in finally  a showcase for his wit as a leading man!) who discovers he has no real male friends after getting engaged to his gal, Zooey (the truly supportive in every way possible of the term, Jones) and embarks on finding a 'best man' for the upcoming nuptials, and in the process finds likable lout Sydney Fife (Segel equally funny as the ultimate wingman), who gets the introverted Klaven to loosen up and find his inner dude with some real deliriously funny results. Writer/director John Hamburg is spot-on in depicting how each sex is the same yet different (i.e. in their respective moments of communing with their buds they are equally vulgar) but manages to employ some real heart to the hijinks that his game ensemble accomplishes with brio. One of the funniest comedies of the decade and one of the best of all time; an instant classic.
RUSH HOUR 3 (2007) ** Chris Tucker, Jackie Chan, Noemie Lenoir, Hiroyuki Sanada, Youki Kudoh, Max von Sydow, Yvan Attal, Jingchu Zhang, Tzi Ma, Roman Polanski, Philip Baker Hall, Dan Ivey. Aimless re-teaming of the odd couple of police detectives motor mouth Tucker and mush-mouthed Chan this time re-united to stop a plot involving Asian assassins. Listlessly unfunny for the most part with Tucker & Chan coming across as an ersatz Hope & Crosby with their globetrotting misnomers and schticky slapstick  even Chan's usual daredevil acrobatics is growing wearisome - directed by Brett Ratner (again for the ride) with all the subtlety of a bull in a China shop.
ADMISSION (2013) *** Tina Fey, Paul Rudd, Lily Tomlin, Gloria Reubens, Wallace Shawn, Michael Sheen, Nat Wolf, Travaris Spears, Sonya Walger, Olek Krupa. Funny and warm-hearted comedy of errors with Fey on top of her game as a Princeton admissions officer who finds herself in a moral quandary: a possible candidate for the esteemed university may be her long-lost son. Rudd is amiable and low-key fun as the director of a special school of higher education including the lad in question and has great chemistry with Fey too boot. Tomlin is a stitch as her crunchy granola feminist mom who steals the film. While director Paul Weitz mixes the screwball with the sentimental in fine spurts the screenplay by Karen Croner, based on Jean Hanff Korelitz' novel, cuts the corners a bit in the satire-rich atmosphere.
FURY (2014) **1/2 Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal, Jim Parrack, Brad William Henke, Kevin Vance, Jason Isaacs. Filmmaker Davy Ayer's foray into male bonding via WWII warfare hits all the right marks for a steadily paced but somewhat rote period piece about a tank squadron in 1945's battle-weary European front attempting to remain alive in spite of impossible odds to the no-end-in-sight battles yet to be fought. The characters are somewhat cardboard thin, cookie-cutter (i.e. noble ethnic, muscle-head jerk, religious peacenik and green around the gills rookie) yet the ensemble of talent - particularly a world-weary Pitt (starting to show some character in his handsome face) as the sergeant in command who can feel the unbearable gravity of their plight weighing them down in to only a matter of time. The ugly muck and mire, grime soaked bruised palette by Roman Vasyanov's cinematography and Andrew Menzies production design allows for the gritty verisimilitude amidst sprinkling of graphic red bloodshed and unspeakable violence.
SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999) **** Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Casper Van Dien, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid, Christopher Walken, Lisa Marie, Marc Pickering, Christopher Lee (cameo). Filmmaker Tim Burton successfully brings to full fruition the giddy nightmare of Washington Irving's classic "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" to the screen in his atmospherically rich adaptation blending horror and humor with a deft , dank elan. Depp (in a wonderfully comic affectation inflected performance) is Ichabod Crane, in this version a New York City constable instead of a school master circa 1799, who is banished to the fog enshrouded farming hamlet of Sleepy Hollow Upstate New York to investigate the ghoulish murders involving decapitation and the dark ghost story of a slain Hussein horseman out for bloodthirsty revenge beyond the grave! Think a prehistorical "X-File" if you will as produced by Hammer Films. Exhilaratingly paced action sequences involving some fancy fencing, spine chilling incarnation of the spawn from hell and nasty, graphic beheadings all combine in this spookily superb revival with its truly pitch perfect production design by Rick Heinrichs, Emmanuel Lubezki's black and blue-green desaturated inky eerily beautiful photography and as always Danny Elfman's pulse quickening score. Depp's chicken hearted interpretation of Crane, Ricci's ethereal beauty as his love interest and Walken's frightening presence are evident to the bewitching, hypnotic feverdream of the genius that is Burton. Trivia note: Ray Park, who was Darth Maul in "Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace", is the Headless Horseman.
2012 (2009) *** John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Chiewetel Ejiofor, Thandie Newton, Oliver Platt, Thomas McCarthy, Woody Harrelson, Danny Glover, Liam James, Morgan Lily, Zlatko Buric, Beatrice Rosen, George Segal, Blu Mankuma, Stephen McHattie. Doomsday melodramatic cheese churned with bombastic glee by latter-day Irwin Allen of the 21st century/disaster impresario Roland Emmerich proffers the end-of-the-world in the titular annui while positioning family man/Everyman Cusack to save his brood from imminent death. The real stars of the genre flick are of course the jaw-dropping, eye-popping special effect visual wizardry (to wit for my bang for the buck money shot: the wipe-out of Los Angeles is truly worth the price of admission); having said that (i.e. shooting its wad) the film is logy in its pacing and length (nearly 3 hours; you'd think the end of the world would be quicker?) with far too many 'plot lines' and characters you frankly don't care too much about. Best seen on the big screen for all its vulgar and perhaps tasteless debauchery (i.e. ghosts of 9/11 flicker in many shots); but really a dumb, feel guilty later popcorn flick.
BRIDESMAIDS (2011) **** Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, Chris O'Dowd, Jon Hamm. Terry Crews, Michael Hitchcock, Rebel Wilson, Matt Lucas, Jill Clayburgh, Franklyn Ajaye, Ben Falcone (Cameos as themselves: Wilson Phillips  Carnie Wilson, Chynna Phillips, Wendy Wilson). Hysterically funny comedy that is so much more than "THE HANGOVER" with vaginas! Sadsack Wiig (who co-scripted the brilliantly comical screenplay with Annie Mumolo) stars as Annie a sweet-natured but constantly put-upon ne'er-do-well whose well-meant intentions are put through the wringer when BFF Rudolph (equally wonderful) announces her engagement and forthcoming nuptials entailing Annie to arrange all the ceremonial events much to her chagrin. Although a game trooper her patience is put to the test when Byrne (channeling Jane Seymour and STEPFORD WIVES)  Rudolph's new friend  challenges her to everything set out by Annie. What follows is nearly 2 hours of laugh-out-loud cringe-worthy and sharply skewed comedy that will have you howling for its mix of raunch (witness the food poisoning bachelorette dinner) and heart (pretty much everywhere else) that has been executive producer Judd Apatow's touch. But wait, don't get me wrong it's all about the ladies and what a fine comic ensemble of gifted comediennes assembled: McLendon-Covey as a desperate housewife looking for fun in any shape or form; mild-mannered newlywed Kemper; and finally scene stealer (hell, lock her up for grand larceny!) McCarthy as Rudolph's future sis-in-law who speaks her mind and is in touch with her inner Chris Farley. To say anymore would ruin the experience but I truly say this comedy is the funniest I've seen in years to the point of stomping my feet on the floor in the theater to keep the oxygen flowing from lack thereof from laughing so hard, for so long! The year's best comedy ; hand's down. And seriously I think Oscar-worthy of Wiig (for her funny/sad turn  she has chops!) and her screenplay as well as Best Supporting Actress trifecta of Rudolph/Byrne/McCarthy. Kudos to veteran TV director Paul Feig for balancing the comic strides so skillfully. Seriously funny!
HEREAFTER (2010) *** ½ Matt Damon, Cecile De France, Frankie McLaren, George McLaren, Jay Mohr, Richard Kind, Lyndsey Marshal, Thierry Neuvic, Bryce Dallas Howard, Steve Schirripa, Jenifer Lewis, Derek Jacobi (cameo as himself). Surprisingly affective drama from filmmaker Clint Eastwood (truly stretching himself as an auteur and kudos to my boy Clint!) in this deep thought piece/character story intertwining three linear story lines involving a French television journalist (the beguiling De France), a miraculous survivor of a tsunami (built to devastating, you-can-hear-a-pin-drop shock in the clammy inducing opener); a British identical twin (McLaren) whose sibling is killed in an accident; and a reluctant psychic (Damon in a low-key terrific performance) whose demons he tries in vein to keep at arm's length  all in search of the afterlife and what happens to us (and more specifically what doesn't to those left behind dealing with life in general). Absorbing and modulated paced with an intriguing screenplay by Peter Morgan; a truly moving film  in a word: soulful.
THE INVISIBLE (2007) *** Justin Chatwin, Margarita Levieva, Marcia Gay Harden, Chris Marquette, Alex O'Loughlin, Callum Keith Rennie, Michelle Harrison, Ryan Kennedy, Andrew Francis, Mark Houghton, Alex Ferris. (Dir: David S. Goyer) "The Sixth Sense" for the MySpace generation.Nick Powell (Chatwin) is a smart, well-liked high school senior on the cusp o f graduation but all is not as well as expected for his seemingly charmed life. His beloved father's death years ago has cast a pall upon his relationship with hi smother, Diane (Harden), a cold, business oriented woman who cannot see her son's talents as a budding writer to the point of them arguing about his going to England for a fellowship to pursue his dream of becoming a real writer.To make matters worse Nick's best friend Pete (Marquette) is being bullied by the school's delinquent-at-large Annie Newton (Levieva) and her pair of goons for payments for a black-market cell phone that leads to Nick interfering and getting on Annie's bad side.Annie 's nasty demeanor is belied by her turbulent domestic life, her father is a washed out cop now-rent-a-cop who has shacked up with a worthless skank after the death of her beloved mother and tries to look out for her younger brother Victor. But her criminal mind is put to its limits with her ex-con lover Marcus (O'Loughlin), who has a stash of hot items in his garage. One night on a routine car theft Annie decides to up the ante by a smash-and- grab at a ritzy jewelry shop. When she pisses off Marcus the next day he drops a dime on her causing her arrest (and humiliation) at school. Thinking it was Nick and Pete cooking up revenge she decides to settle the score by beating Nick up after his imbibing at a party. Accidentally knocking Nick cold in the backwoods Annie and her gang leave him for dead in a drainage valve. The next morning Nick returns to school only to discover no one seems to acknowledge his presence and realizes he must be dead. Confirming his worst fears he backtracks to his home where his anguished mother and the police are trying to find him.Nick is virtually 'invisible' to all around him but soon discovers to his horror that he is NOT dead but in a limbo state and has precious few hours left if he wants to remain alive by trying to communicate with everyone, and shaming Annie into confessing to the crime.Based on a Swedish novel by Mats Wahl (and apparently a film as well; I'm not familiar with either), the smart and crafty screenplay by Mick Davis and Christine Roum wisely sets the metaphor for teenage life as being transparent and paralleling the in-between-worlds Nick and the basically lost-in-the-social-cracks Annie, both not being seen literally and metaphorically for who they really are. Buoyed by exceptional performances by lead Chatwin (best known as Tom Cruise's rebellious son in WAR OF THE WORLDS) and newcomer Levieva (who resembles Erika Christensen), both making their characters well-rounded teenagers and not run-of-the-mill stereotypes. Directed by veteran screenwriter Goyer (BATMAN BEGINS) , the film mixes the drama and tension perfectly with time-ticking for Nick to get back to life and Annie to recognize for once her potential for doing something meaningful. The universal theme of teens' rights- of-passage rings true even if it is set in a supernatural setting to a certain extent; life is not meaningless no matter what.
IN A WORLD (2013) *** Lake Bell, Fred Melamed, Ken Marino, Demetri Martin, Michaela Watkins, Rob Corddry, Tig Notaro, Nick Offerman, Alexandra Holden, Jason O'Mara, Geena Davis (Cameos as themselves: Ava Longoria, Jeff Garlin, Cameron Diaz) Triple-threat Bell (who wrote and directed as well - her feature film debuts) stars as a thirty something vocal coach, voice over wannabe whose intimidations and limitations are in the shadow of her bloviating, asinine 'legendary' VO artist father (the unctuous Melamed; frankly I hate him to begin with and the film loses one star simply due to his obnoxious gross presence) who finds herself in the running for a new movie trailer daring to reincorporate the titular opening lines that could lead to bigger things. Cleverly funny and fizzy in tone with a fine comedic ensemble underscores the light, seemingly breezy creative touch by Bell's allure (lush, baby, lush!) overall. An indie seek-out must.
IRON MAN (2008) **** Robert Downey, Jr. , Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Leslie Bibb, Shaun Toub, Faran Tahir, Clark Gregg. Rip-roaring big screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics' cult-classic superhero AKA billionaire extraordinaire Tony Stark (Downey having a field day), an industrialist/arms manufacturer who has his eyes opened to the horrors of his financial gains when he is kidnapped by terrorists and manages his escape by creating an armored suit as his ticket to freedom and regrouping by protecting those he has put in harms way. But his sudden moment of clarity has a price to pay in the form of his second-in-command Obadiah Stane (Bridges having a devilish time here) who poses as a formidable foe in the long run. Screenwriters Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway hammer out a competent, sharp and clever storyline that incorporates origin story cum legend with strong support by director Jon Favreau (who has a bit part as Stark's valet) incorporating stunning ILM CGI, and wisely allowing his actors to shine, particularly Downey's sexy/brainy/snarky Stark with sterling clear-eyed focus and dollops of humor that take off the edge of 'serious'ness, resulting in a humdinger popcorn crowd pleaser and sooth-sayer to the fan boys. Paltrow, in one of her finest turns, is also a breath of fresh air as Stark's personal assistant/love interest Pepper Potts and Howard's unconventional performance as his best bud Jim Rhodes, a military liaison, proves a primer of how a second banana should be played. High-octane thrills and a lot of fun (including the inevitable- and arguably the funniest  Stan Lee cameo) an instant classic and one of the very best comic book adaptations committed to the silver screen; cannot wait for the sequel!
HALLOWEEN II (2009) ** Scout Taylor-Compton, Malcolm McDowell, Brad Dourif, Tyler Mane, Chase Wright Vanek, Sheri Moon Zombie, Danielle Harris, Mary Birdsong, Brea Grant, Howard Hesseman, Angela Trimbur, Duane Whitaker, Betsy Rue, Mark Boone Junior, Richard Riehle, Margot Kidder, Daniel Roebuck, Bill Fagerbakke, Chris Hardwick & "Weird Al" Yankovic (as himself). Rob Zombie's sequel to the remake of the original slasher thriller (got that?) skims the line for revisionism and instead balances brutal violence begetting brutal violence with sinister madman Michael Myers still alive (go figure, huh?) and picking up from the redux in '07, escaping from his coroner's van to unleash more unholy murdering on the trail of his sister Laurie Strode (Taylor-Compton). While it is dank and stylish with the atmosphere and production to die for it again begs to question: Why? Oh Why do we need more 'remakes' of a true classic???
22 JUMP STREET (2014) **1/2 Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Ice Cube, Amber Stevens, Wyatt Russell, Peter Stormare, Jillian Bell, The Lucas Brothers, Nick Offerman, Jimmy Tatro, Dave Franco, Rob Riggle. (Cameos: Richard Grieco, Dustin Nguyen, Queen Latifah, Seth Rogen, Bill Hader) Inevitable sequel to the successful big-screen adaptation of the cult TV series with dynamic duo Hill and Tatum doing.the.same.exact.thing. except in college. While the screenplay by Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel, Rodney Rothman and Hill takes great pride in its metajoke of being bigger, stupider and funnier it is largely hit-and-miss at best yet there's no denying the bromance of the leads having a field day and the smart/dumb dialogue coasts on all plausibilities while Bell steals the show as a sour co-ed who has Hill's number (and then some). Directing team Phil Lord and Christopher Miller also employ their live-action cartoon skills to the hilt. Easily Best Fight Award for the MTV Awards.
THE NUMBER 23 (2007) ** Jim Carrey, Virginia Madsen, Logan Lerman, Danny Huston, Lynn Collins, Rhona Mitra, Michelle Arthur, Mark Pellegrino. Carrey acts up a storm in this middling thriller about an Everyman whose life begins to downward spiral when his wife (Madsen) purchases a second-hand book as a birthday present which begins to take a life of its own with the mysterious power of the titular pre-occupation/obsession that brings him to the brink of insanity. Filmmaker Joel Schumacher continues his ham-fisted approaches with no subtlety what-so-ever, making things bleaker and darker than necessary in this pallid "Twilight Zone" meets "Memento" by way of "The Shining" with little to be scared about except to see a comic actor lose his footing in a poorly conceived attempt to stretch his dramatic muscles.
SPEED RACER (2008) **1/2 Emile Hirsch, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Christina Ricci, Matthew Fox, Scott Porter, Kick Gurry, Paulie Litt, Roger Allam, Rain, Richard Roundtree. High-gloss treatment is given to the big-screen adaptation of the cult classic TV Anime cartoon from the '60s about the titular character (Hirsch in a decidedly one-note turn) whose quest to be the best auto racer since his late, beloved older brother catches the eye of bilious corporate hooligan (Allam, a poor-man's Tim Curry) involving a Grand Prix match that may cost more than his pride or family's loyalty: his life. Written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers the talented siblings use every ounce of cutting-edge technology to give the film a candy-colored hyper intensity that succeeds for the most part as far as the adrenalized visuals go, however the plotting is plodding and the film is too long to sustain any real interest in the matters at hand. But not a complete waste of time either since the duo do capture the spirit of the cartoon series with skillful élan.
V/H/S/2 (2013) ** Second chapter in the budding horror anthology franchise is more miss than hit again with varying degrees of decent scares this time with an investigative couple searching for a missing college student who discover his cache of mysterious VHS collection including: "Phase I Clinical Trials" involving a young man's recent experimental eye surgery's side effects from microchip insertion with a ghostly glitch; "A Ride in The Park" has a bicyclist being attacked by a horde of zombies (the first two chapters are the weakest of the stories offered); "Safe Haven" offers a film crew unearthing more than they bargained for with an unsavory cult leader (the best of the bunch and the most unsettlingly graphically violent; you've been warned!) and finally the not-too-shabby "Slumber Party Alien Abduction" that feels like Fox Mulder's home videos. Best bet to rent or even better buy 'CREEPSHOW' instead (Dirs: Simon Barrett, Adam Wingard, Gregg Hale & Eduardo Sanchez; Gareth Evans & Timo Tjahajanto; and Jason Eisener)
INSIDIOUS : CHAPTER 2 (2013) ** Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey, Steve Coulter, Leigh Whannell, Angus Sampson, Andrew Astor, Hank Harris, Jocelin Donahue, Lindsay Seim, Danielle Bisutti, Tom Fitzpatrick, Tyler Griffin, Garrett Ryan, Michael Beach. More or less of the same in this sequel/prequel to the supernatural chiller beginning where the last one literally ended with the haunted Lambert family still ensconced with terrible living nightmares of possession by a pesky poltergeist determined to take over their living souls. While filmmaking partners in crime James Wan and Leigh Whannell (who reprises his ghostbuster dork on screen) still upend the genre and embrace all its things-that-go-bump-in-the-night- don't-open-that-door ethos the end result is more of the same that listlessly eases into a possible third installment; be afraid!
ROCKNROLLA (2008) *** Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Idris Elba, Thandie Newton, Mark Strong, Jamie Campbell Bower, Tom Hardy, Ludicrous, Jeremy Piven, Karel Roden. Brit filmmaker Guy Ritchie returns to form with this surprisingly straight-forward yet fun and entertaining crime drama with his usual gang of lowlife English hoods and ne'er do-wells in a crazy quilt of intersecting plot lines, this time involving an old school gangster (Wilkinson having a field day) whose real estate brokerings lead to a missing invaluable rare painting - with his most recent clients , a Russian bad guy (Roden, scarily brooding to the hilt)  and his infamous rock star stepson (Bowers stealing every scene he's in) playing dead for good reason: he has the art work in his possession. A game ensemble - Butler particularly as a two-bit criminal whose slapstick methods and empathy with a recently disclosed homosexual associate, is a true stand-out  and the razzle-dazzle camera-work by David Higgs, keeps things lively in this rousingly fine slice of pulp fiction.
SNITCH (2013) *** Dwayne Johnson, Barry Pepper, Jon Bernthal, Susan Sarandon, Michael Kenneth Williams, Rafi Gavron, Melina Kanakaredes, Nadine Velazquez, Benjamin Bratt, Lela Loren, JD Pardo, David Harbour, Harold Perrineau. Better-than-anticipated action/drama with Johnson stretching his acting muscles with some aplomb, as a construction businessman who finds his world turned upside down when his son is set-up in a drug raid sting whereupon the only way to have him released is getting in league with ambitious prosecutor Sarandon's crime task force to infiltrate a top kingpin (Bratt). Surrounded by a top-notch ensemble including Bernthal as one of his employees, an ex-con desperate for a second act and Pepper as a billy-goateed undercover agent whisking him about the dangerous channels, Johnson's vehicle is very cleverly concocted by director Ric Roman Waugh's screenplay with Justin Haythe, with echoes of '70s man-against-the-system élan.
THE BOURNE LEGACY (2012) ***1/2 Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton, Stacy Keach, Scott Glenn, Zeljko Ivanek, Albert Finney, Dennis Boutskiaris, Joan Allen, David Strathairn. Revved up chapter in the ongoing spy franchise this time without Matt Damon (although his image is floated about) instead focusing on another candidate for the undercover secret project to make a super soldier in this case Aaron Cross (intense Renner at his best) who learns of the nefarious underpinnings while attempting to stay alive long enough for exposure of the powers that be with unlikely help from one of his doctors/scientists enlisted to the project (Weisz slipping in effectively). Written and directed by Tony Gilroy (who penned the previous BOURNE flicks with his brother Dan) fits like a glove (a velvet once with an iron fist) in delivering a dense and at times very chatty exposition flowing auctioneer that thankfully kicks into gear with some truly hair-raising awesome stunt works namely a secluded house invasion and one of the best cinematic motorcycle chases ever committed to celluloid ala THE FRENCH CONNECTION. Long live "BOURNE" .
THE KINGDOM (2007) *** Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Chris Cooper, Jason Bateman, Ashraf Barhom, Ali Suliman, Jeremy Piven, Richard Jenkins, Kyle Chandler, Frances Fisher, Danny Huston, Tim McGraw. Post 9/11 drama about an attack on Americans based in Saudi Arabia, which enlists an elite FBI team of investigators to seek answers and ultimately retribution when one of their own was among the victims. Filmmaker Peter Berg (who has a cameo) does the best he can with the somewhat predictable but absorbing script s by Matthew Michael Carnahan). The fine ensemble elevates the tension-fueled plot line with stable support by Barhom as the Saudi Arabian en league to help the preliminaries at hand. The last third's action packed adrenaline fueled violence is relentlessly taut.
THE EQUALIZER (2014) *** Denzel Washington, Marton Csokas, Chloe Grace Moretz, David Harbour, Bill Pullman, Melissa Leo, David Meunier, Johnny Skourtis, Haley Bennett. Big-screen loose adaptation of the cult '80s TV series with Edward Woodward tailored to the finesse of slow-burn Washington as an ex-CIA op whose attempt to keep a low-profile is thwarted when a young prostitute (Moretz) is endangered by her pimp who turns out to be knee-deep involved with the Russian mob who wants vengeance swiftly (and painfully) led by glowering Csokas (a shark in a silk suit incarnate). Washington in in superb form and reunited with skillful filmmaker Antoine Fuqua (who collaborated on TRAINING DAY which scored Washington his Best Actor Oscar) with stealth and lethal ease and a sharp and grittily dark screenplay by Richard Wenk.
TAKERS (2010) **1/2 Chris Brown, Hayden Christensen, Matt Dillon, Michael Ealy, Idris Elba, T.I., Jay Hernandez, Steve Harris, Zoe Saldana, Paul Walker, Marianne Jean-Baptiste. "HEAT" crossed with a GQ cover shoot could've been the pitch for this decent yet predictable cops-and-robbers flick with a crew of stylish in-the-know thieves attempting one last big payoff until a recently paroled ex-gang member (T.I., lean and mean) gums up the works as the wild-card who makes things interestingly lethal, while cops Dillon and Hernandez doggedly pursue their one-step ahead of quarry. Filmed with enough panache and hi-octane adrenalized skills by director John Luessenhop (particularly a fantastically paced foot-chase by Brown through the skyscraper canyons of downtown LA) until the film peters out to a Mexican stand-off finale and cribbing from Tony Scott/Quentin Tarantino's "TRUE ROMANCE"; otherwise an enjoyable popcorn caper pic.
THE BEAVER (2011) ** Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, Anton Yelchin, Riley Thomas Stewart, Jennifer Lawrence. Gibson gives a shrewdly smart performance as a seriously depressed toy manufacturer CEO whose downward spiral leads to a botched suicide attempt where he finds salvation in the titular hand puppet (!) that is his only source of redemption from his estranged family. While the tremendous acting of Gibson is worthy of seeing just for that the "REALLY" factor is abundant (i.e. "Really?! He hasn't been committed yet?! Really?!" ) that overshadows the light and tight direction of co-star (and good friend) Foster with an equally good parallel story of Yelchin as their oldest son attempting to distance himself while falling for class valedectorian Lawrence (who is hiding her own special grief too). Although rookie scribe Kyle Killen tries to breath some life into the mental illness dramatics it also calls to question of the tricky balance of keeping a straight face every time the Cockney accented critter decides to 'speak'.
A MIGHTY HEART (2007) ***1/2 Angelina Jolie, Dan Futterman, Archie Panjabi, Irfan Khan, Will Patton, Denis O' Hare. Absorbing, first-rate adaptation of the book based on Mariane Pearl's (Jolie, in her best work since she won the Oscar and deserving another nod here for her stoic, fierce performance), book about the horrible kidnapping and ultimate murder of her husband (and fellow journalist) Daniel (Futterman does his best in fleeting flashback heavy sequences) who was abducted by terrorists in Pakistan. Filmmaker Michael Winterbottom and screenwriter John Orloff eschew Hollywood theatrics for straightforward and intelligent with a very well produced storyline and a fine ensemble cast particularly Indian actor Khan as "the Captain", a local policeman spearheading the grim task of saving the doomed writer. One of the year's best films.
GONE GIRL (2014) ***1/2 Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens, Patric Fugit, David Clennon, Lisa Banes, Missi Pyle, Emily Ratajkowski, Casey Wilson, Lola Kirke, Boyd Holbrook, Sela Ward, Scoot McNairy. Filmmaker David Fincher once again plumbs the murky underpinnings of America in his excellent adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best seller about a young married couple (Affleck and Pike working expertly in shades of grey and dare I say Oscar worthy turns both) in the throes of unraveling particularly when the beautiful wife suddenly disappears on the day of their 5th wedding anniversary, leaving handsome hubby in the breeze (and under the microscope) by the local authorities investigating and the media pricking new wounds for the masses to savor. Wickedly clever and full of unexpected twists and turns (not exactly Hitchcockian but then again) thanks to Flynn's adaptation of her own novel that cheekily runs rampant with the institution of marriage, fidelity and other mores socially adept. Fincher keeps the tension taut and knotty but plays fair with flashbacks and fade outs when things just start to become boilerplate pot boiling innuendos and secrets and lies. While the film easily could've whittled here and there (admittedly I may be the only one on the planet not having read the source book) the resolute ending may be just to good to be true. Then again maybe not.
CORALINE (2009) **** (Voices of: Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, John Hodgman, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn Fanning, Robert Bailey, Jr., Ian McShane, Keith David.) Excellent stop-motion animated film adaptation of Neil Gaimon's book by wunderkind filmmaker Henry Selick about a young girl named Coraline (Fanning) whose seemingly unhappiness with her family discovers a doorway into a parallel world where she finds an Other Mother and Father, and realizes the motto of 'be careful what you wish for' as a golden rule. Filled with phantasmagoric elements of fantasy not unlike "Alice In Wonderland" but with a slightly darker edge and spookiness but a truly remarkable display of an art form that is rarely given its props and Selick and his team of magicians create an amazingly incredible tour-de-force of painstaking artistry to behold. One of the year's very best.
ABOUT TIME (2013) *** Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams, Bill Nighy, Lydia Wilson, Lindsay Duncan, Richard Cordery, Joshua McGuire, Tom Hollander, Margot Robbie, Will Merrick, Vanessa Kirby (Cameos: Richard E. Grant, Richard Griffiths) Funny and poignant romcom fantasy from filmmaker Richard Curtis, about a young bloke (amiable Gleeson, son of Brendan) who learns from his father (the wonderful Nighy) that they both share a family secret - all the men in their brood can travel in time. With his newfound power he devotes it to finding and falling in love with the babelicious McAdams with a few pitfalls and curves along the merry way. Curtis' clever dialogue and the warm-hearted performances make up for the stretch of imagination of the film's premise but enjoy the ride none-the-less.
COLD IN JULY (2014) *** Michael C. Hall, Sam Shepard, Vinessa Shaw, Don Johnson, Nick Damici, Wyatt Russell. Twisty turny slice of TexMex neo noir cum male bonding flick about a family man (Hall in a tricky role) whose life is turned upside down after killing a burglar in his home when the felon's ex-con father (grizzled and no BS Shepard) enters the picture on parole and seeking vengeance. What seems like a pulp fiction potboiler makes a sharp turn and doesn't hold back half-way in and things get even dicier for both men. Effectively bumpy screenplay by Damici (who co-stars as the town peace officer) adapting the novel by prolific Joe R. Lansdale (a cross between Elmore Leonard and Louis L'Amour if you will) with dark underpinnings only buoyed by a very electric turn by Johnson as Shepard's cowboy investigator/pig farmer friend from the past adding some pepper to the stew. Jim Mickle's steady direction keeps from going off the rails even though the ending is telegraphed it is still worth the trip.
FROM Paris WITH LOVE (2009) ** John Travolta, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Kasia Smutniak. Loud, vulgar and vaguely entertaining popcorn actioner with Rhys Meyers as a diplomatic assistant for the US Ambassador in Paris whose unlikely partnership with a rogue American spy (Travolta at full tilt borderline obnoxious and giddy to a fault) in a convoluted plot line involving a cache of coke and terrorists in the City of Lights. While director Pierre Morel does his best with the scattershot screenplay by Adi Hasak and filmmaker Luc Busson, the on-the-edge-of-cartoon violence makes up for the Swiss-cheese holes of story and Swiss-timing precision for the well-crafted action set pieces on the whole.
THE PINK PANTHER 2 (2009) **1/2 Steve Martin, Jean Reno, Emily Mortimer, Andy Garcia, Alfred Molina, John Cleese, Yuki Matsuzaki, Aishwarya Rai, Lily Tomlin, Jeremy Irons. Martin returns in this not-bad sequel to the re-imagination franchise of Inspector Jacques Clouseau, the buffoon French policeman who winds up as part of an international 'dream team' of investigators trying to stop "the Tornado", a globe trotting cat burglar, while attempting to regain the love of his life back in good graces (the sweet Mortimer). Martin proves to still be an agile performer in this decent blend of slapstick, double entendres and general goofiness for this benign chapter of the series. (Dir: Harald Zwart)
END OF WATCH (2012) ***1/2 Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Pena, Anna Kendrick, Natalie Martinez, David Harbour, Frank Grillo, America Ferrera, Cody Horn. Hard-hitting and absorbing cop drama with hot-shot up-and-coming LAPD patrolmen (Gyllenhaal and Pena both giving career- high turns with lived-in aplomb) who stumble upon a drug cartel with deadly results. While the cinema verite of a traveling video diary is used again to keep a daily log of what goes on during a routine day the film manages to rise-above its tired gimmick from filmmaker David Ayer by infusing the duo's credible performances and their camaraderie with their fellow peace officers without forgetting to ensure just how seriously out-of-hand things can turn on a dime's notice.
GHOST TOWN (2008) **1/2 Ricky Gervais, Greg Kinnear, Tea Leoni, Dana Ivey, Bill Campbell, Alan Ruck, Claire Lautier, Aasif Mandvi. Kristen Wiig. Gervais is the saving grace in this hybrid of "Ghost", "Topper" and "All of Me" as a misanthropic dentist whose routine surgery causes a brief moment of his death and the end result in seeing and hearing ghosts, including recently departed Kinnear, who wants desperately to re-connect with his widow (Leoni). A fairly decent mix of screwball comedy and Gervais' dead-panned, put-upon , awkward social comedy skills make up for the rather formulaic yet winning high-concept fish-out-of-water comedy in the long run; Wiig as his surgeon steals the film. (Dir: David Koepp)
DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS (2010) ***1/2 Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Zach Galifianakis, Jemaine Clement, Stephanie Szotstak, Lucy Punch, Bruce Greenwood, David Walliams, Ron Livingston, Larry Wilmore, Kristen Schaal, PJ Byrne, Andrea Savage, Lucy Davenport, Chris O'Dowd, Jeff Dunham, Octavia Spencer, Rick Overton, Patrick Fischler. Hysterically funny high concept comedy  loosely based on the popular French farce "Le Diner de Cons"  with nice guy corporate ladder climber Rudd finding himself invited to the titular soiree  which involves the invitee to bring along the most ridiculous loser they can find to humiliate (enter doofus Carell having a field day and milking some pathos with the pathetic). What comes across as a hyper blend of Apatow heartwarming gross out comedy with Farrelly Brothers' instincts and an undercoating of bilious Neil LaBute, the film runs on all comedy cylinders with no holds-barred with some truly hilarious bits (namely Rudd attempting to coerce his fiancée Szotstak away from pompous ass 'artist' Clement who nearly steals the movie) and a few genuine sequences of emotional breakdowns (namely Carell's nemesis IRS colleague Galifianakis and his 'hypnotic mind puppetery'!) Love the meticulous 'mousterpieces' that Carell turns into art (dioramas of taxidermied mice!) (Dir: Jay Roach)
RUNNING WITH SCISSORS (2006) ** Annette Bening, Brian Cox, Joseph Fiennes, Evan Rachel Wood, Alec Baldwin, Joseph Cross, Jill Clayburgh, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gabrielle Union, Patrick Wilson, Kristin Chenoweth, Dagmara Dominczyk, Colleen Camp, Jack Kaeding. Listless adaptation of the biographical novel by Augusten Burroughs (played with guileless aplomb by newcomer Cross)  who collaborated on the screenplay with the director Ryan Murphy  and his life of misery sparked by his eccentric and mentally unbalanced free-spirit mother (Bening in an Oscar worthy performance making a complex and unsympathetic character full-blooded instead of camp), a 'creative type' who self-aggrandizes herself to be a genius writer to the point of mania resulting in her dumping her only child into the crazy family of her shrink (Cox), a quack with many odd methods and questionable practices. While the film tries to sustain some sort of crazy quilt of weirdo characterizations it becomes a bit maddening to find anyone to empathize (or recognize) to contain interest in all the ugliness that ensues.
THE HEAT (2013) *** Sandra Bullock, Melissa McCarthy, Demian Bichir, Marlon Wayans, Michael Rapaport, Jane Curtin, Spoken Reasons, Dan Bakkedahl, Taran Killam, Michael McDonald, Thomas F. Wilson, Tony Hale, Kaitlin Olson, Joey McIntyre, Michael Tucci, Bill Burr, Nathan Corddry, Jessica Chaffin, Jamie Denbo, Ben Falcone. Formulaic yet riotously funny buddy comedy with fastidious fussbudget FBI agent Bullock forced to team up with rough-around-the- edges Boston detective McCarthy to take down a drug dealer out to put the harm on McCarthy's screw-up bro (Rapaport) to boot. Odd coupling of the two stars are comedic gold for the most part until the uneven screenplay by Katie Dippold (veering into violence and bloodshed) peters out yet veteran comedy helmsman Feig wisely lets his stars command the offerings at hand.
BUG (2007) **1/2 Ashley Judd, Michael Shannon, Lynn Collins, Brian F. O'Byrne, Harry Connick, Jr. Unnerving and at times precious portrayal of paranoia-induced madness based on Tracy Letts' play about an abused white-trash woman (Judd, giving an Oscar caliber performance in one of her strongest turns in years) whose life takes a drastic change when she meets a seemingly nice, haunted man (Shannon getting his ya-yas out) who isn't all he appears to be when he reveals a psychosis triggered by the delusion he is infested with 'bugs' and transfers his fears onto the gullible lover. Director William Friedkin returns to the fold as a filmmaker to be reckoned with by making the horrors more esthetic and visceral than graphic (but indulges a bit there as well) yet by the finale (if you hang in there throughout the craziness) the viewer is spent in this exhaustive yet original modern-day horror story.
ROCK OF AGES (2012) ** Diego Boneta, Juianna Hough, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Bryan Cranston, Paul Giamatti, Malin Akerman, Mary J. Blige, Will Forte. Less than dazzling adaptation of the Broadway hit musical with big named talents largely wasted in this '80s era time warp boy-meets-girl (varying degrees of vanilla and plastic provided by largely miscast Boneta and Hough) while employing the jukebox tunes of hair bands and hard rock as the Greek chorus for the dreams of fame and success along LA's Sunset Strip including Baldwin (looking at a quick unfunny paycheck turn with bad wig extensions) as a former rocker turned club owner trying to save his business with a deal with the devil in the form of snake-hipped Axl Rose manqué Stacee Jaxx (Cruise proving his commitment in his intense, low-key fun performance; the only one GETTING it!) while politico crusader ala Tipper Gore, Zeta-Jones tries to put the hose on everyone getting their ya-yas out. A major disappointment no thanks to the static direction by Adam Shankman and a lackluster, joyless script by Justin Theroux, Allan Loeb and Chris D'Arienzo (whose musical this is based on). A severe case of Hollywood bloat mars the sex, drugs and rock-and-roll nothing but a good time vibes the original source truly provided.
A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST (2014) ** Seth MacFarlane, Charlize Theron, Amanda Seyfried, Liam Neeson, Giovanni Ribisi, Neil Patrick Harris, Sarah Silverman, Wes Studi (Cameos: Christopher Lloyd, Gilbert Gottfried, Ewan McGregor, John Michael Higgins, Bill Maher, Jamie Foxx, Ryan Reynolds, Patrick Stewart (voice) ) More miss-than-hits vulgarian satire of oaters with MacFarlane (who also directed and co-wrote the script with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild) as a cowardly sheep farmer facing many pitfalls in survival of the titular calamity facing him and his friends including murderous outlaw Neeson while unknowingly befriending Theron (the villain's neglected but sharp-shooting wife). While this is no "Blazing Saddles" in which it attempts to be in many ways is a throwback to the "Paleface" Bob Hope vehicles but with toilet humor and crass language that wears out its welcome as does the rather lengthy 'plot' (easily twenty minutes could've been trimmed). But the game ensemble and gung-ho attitude solicits a few chuckles amidst the carnage.
BIG HERO 6 (2014) ***1/2 (Voices of: Ryan Potter, Scott Adsit, Jamie Chung, TJ Miller, Daniel Henney, Damon Wayans, Jr., Genesis Rodriguez, James Cromwell, Alan Tudyk, Maya Rudolph) Pixar/Disney do it again! Magical and highly entertaining animated fare about a scientifically gifted tween named Hiro (Potter) who finds himself torn between fulfilling his life-long dreams and seeking the truth about the death of his beloved older brother/mentor with the help of their geek friends and his sibling's life's work: an inflatable robot named Baymax (gently voiced by Adsit with subtle layers of warmth and depth) designed for healthcare and welfare for all mankind. Directors Don Hall and Chris Williams do a remarkable job in incorporating Marvel & DC Comics origin story lines in the mix as an homage -thanks to the shrewd and sentimental screenplay by Jordan Roberts, Daniel Gerson, Robert L. Baird, Duncan Rouleau, Steven T. Segle, Paul Briggs & Joseph Matteo - and silent screen slapstick with a lively, swiftly paced endeavor and a genuine star in Baymax - a cross between the Michelin Man and The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man with a sprinkle of ET - with his pathos and good natured love that practically glows from the silver screen. A genuine pleasure and surprisingly poignant.
STARDUST (2007) ** Charlie Cox, Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert DeNiro, Sienna Miller, Peter O' Toole, Jason Flemyng, Sarah Alexander, Joanna Scanlan, Ricky Gervais (Narrator: Ian McKellen) Spotty adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novel by filmmaker Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman tweaking the fairy telling genre with a young man (vanilla bland Cox) who attempts to retrieve a falling star for his beloved (Miller) but winds up with a young woman (Danes, channeling Gwyneth Paltrow), who indeed is the star but is more trouble than she is worth when a coven of witches desire her heart to replenish their youth and evil ways. A grim Grimm fairy tale with a contemporary flair not unlike "THE PRINCESS BRIDE" but without its simplistic charms, the film tries way too hard and in spite of a gamely fierce turn by Pfeiffer as the lead witch, it sputters by its lackluster ending.
INCEPTION (2010) **** Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Marion Cotillard, Pete Postlethwaite, Michael Caine, Lukas Haas, Talulah Riley. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's mind-blowing, trippy sci-fi thriller about infiltrators of dreams echoes many past films  "The Matrix" by way of "Mission:Impossible" via "Ocean's 11" easily could have been the pitch  but the simple fact that it is a visionary at his peak of incorporating both digital and largely practically visual effects lands him in the pantheon of truly extraordinary filmmakers such as Kubrick, Spielberg, and Hitchcock  with his blend of psychological metaphors (the ultimate 'MacGuffin' ala Hitch is the dreams themselves!  Life is indeed such a dream. DiCaprio continues to delve into inner angst with his haunted agent of dreamscapes and nightmares while the ethereal Cotillard is his avatar of grief and redemption of memories past; truly haunting. The aforementioned state-of-the-art set pieces  take your pick; for me the hotel corridor sequence with Gordon-Levitt is one for the archives  stand alone just for the jaw-dropping beauty of destruction and cataclysmic events overall (whether that be literal or again metaphorical; it works on so many levels). A film that truly demands your patience and above all attention; see it again and again and you'll see what I mean. One of the year's best films and arguably one of the best for the 21st century.
WE'RE THE MILLERS (2013) *** Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Will Poulter, Emma Roberts, Ed Helms, Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn, Molly C. Quinn, Tomer Sisley, Matthew Willig, Luis Guzman, Thomas Lennon, Mark L. Young, Ken Marino. High concept comedy (emphasis on high) with fish-out-of-water tendencies with Sudeikis as a small-time drug dealer who is enlisted by his profiteer Helms to make a South of the Border run for some marijuana by posing as a square family man in an RV. Along for the preposterous (and at times hilarious) ride are Aniston as a stripper, Roberts as a teen-on-the-streets and scene-stealer Poulter as arguably the dorkiest kid ever depicted in cinema. While the screenplay by committee of four scribes cobbles together some good clean raunchy naughty fun the direction by Rawson Marshall Thurber is at best Farrelly Brothers (i.e. flat and plain yet fun and heartfelt). Could've been darker and even nastier but it has moments here and there largely thanks to the riotous couple played by MVPs Hahn and Offerman as a straight-laced foil for the defacto family of errors.
THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING (2006) **1/2 Jordana Brewster, Taylor Handley, Diora Baird, Matthew Bomer, Lee Tergesen, Andrew Bryniaraski, R. Lee Ermey (narrator: John Larroquette). Middling and meanderingly paced 'prequel' to the remake of the cult horror classic about a cannibalistic family led by the hulking homicidal Leatherface whose origins are depicted in bloody detail. The first victims depicted are a doomed quartet whose car comes in the crosshairs of the dirt-choked town of the 'family' who make them more than welcome with the ensuing carnage inevitably at hand. (Dir: Jonathan Liebesman)
THE OMEN (1976) **** Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, Harvey Stephens, David Warner, Billie Whitelaw, Patrick Troughton, Martin Benson, Holly Palance. One of the scariest and most unnerving occult horror films ever made about Satan. US Ambassador Peck and his wife Remick find themselves saddled with the Anti-Christ, Satan's brood (goose-pimple-inducing Stephens), much to their chagrin and disbelief in the Biblical prophecies of the End Days that lead to a series of violent 'accidents' and some seriously sinister proceedings at hand. Director Richard Donner layers the moments of truly gnarly gruesome killings (Warner's doomed photographer is destined as one of the best on screen offings and thanks to the miracle of stop-frame & rewind you'll be thrilled to know it's really gross and truly unsettling) and the bone-chilling score by composing vet Jerry Goldsmith copped a richly deserved Oscar.
MEMENTO (2001) **** Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, Mark Boone Junior, Larry Holden, Jorja Fox, Stephen Tobolowsky, Harriet Sansom Harris. Intricately unravelling, disjointed piece of pulpy neo-noir that focuses on short-term memory victim/anti-hero Leonard Shelby (Pearce in one humdinger of a role) who is avidly trying to find the man who raped and murdered his wife (Fox in flashbacks) but trying desperately to maintain his own scattershot recollections of things past and current, particularly the latter as he finds himself holed up in a seedy hotel, befriended by possible femme fatale Moss and weasel cop Pantoliano (both excellently skewering the plot aloing nicely) and coming to terms with his own sanity. Brilliantly conceived by novice filmmaker Christopher Nolan (who adapted his brother Jonathan's short story "Memento Mori") weaves back and forth with storytelling devices at full throttle including flashback, piecemeal clues and red herrings abound and more tellingly the ingenuous use of editing and the adrenaline pumped consequences the film unspools with great elan and aplomb. One of the best indies in quite some time and original in its execution is only superseded by a heartfelt and justifiably innate turn by Pearce - who adds some black humor liberally when needed - whose identity is in flux from the get go. One of the year's best films, bar none. My favorite: the foot chase sequence when Pearce can't figure out if he is the pursuer or pursuee!
SURROGATES (2009) * Bruce Willis, Radha Mitchell, Rosamund Pike, Boris Kodjoe, James Cromwell, Ving Rhames, Michael Cudlitz. Lame and dreadfully dull sci-fi cyber-thriller that feels like overheated Philip K. Dick (and a mash-up of "Westworld" and practically every other virtual reality subgenre), about the near future where replicants acts as the titular-by-proxy denizens of our world (i.e. human counterpoints remain holed up in their homes) face scrutiny when a conspiracy to kill their users is linked to some unsavory elements. Willis is practically sleepwalking through this dud and Mitchell's plasticity is all-too-real with no help from pedestrian direction by Jonathan Mostow.
UNBROKEN (2014) **** Jack O' Connell, Domhnall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund, Takamasa Ishihara, Finn Wittrock, Jai Courtney, Alex Russell. Incredible biopic about Louis Zamperini (O'Connell in a star-making performance worthy of an Oscar), whose life encompassed highs (winning a medal in the 1936 Olympics for running) and lows (surviving a plane crash during WWII only to wind up a POW in a Japanese internment camp) with only his sheer will and determination to survive at all costs. Based on Laura Hillenbrand's book the adaptation by a blue-chip committee by design of Joel & Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravense and William Nicholson contains all the elements of a finely tuned drama of skill and forbearance as equal to Angelina Jolie's direction that is sure and steady. Overwhelming brutality by Zamperini's imprisoner "the Bird" (a finely sadistic POS, Ishihara) and the strength of the human spirit personified buoys a life-affirming story. One of the year's best films.
GULLIVER'S TRAVELS (2010) ** Jack Black, Amanda Peet, Jason Segel, Emily Blunt, Chris O'Dowd, Billy Connelly, TJ Miller. Disappointing comic adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satire this time tailored to Black as a slacker mail boy of a travel magazine who gets the opportunity to prove to his silent crush, editor Peet, he has what it takes to be a writer when she assigns him a piece set in the Bermuda Triangle and he is shipwrecked on the island of Lilliput where he is a giant amongst the tiny populace and eventually becomes a folk hero. The lame script by Joe Stillman and Nicholas Stoller doesn't find the wonder and excitement the novel did and the pedestrian direction by Rob Letterman sinks the fantasy premise into one mirthless sequence into the next. (SPOILER ALERT: while it does have one moment of personal joy in imagining Peet as a giantess would it have killed them to have her swap places with Black instead to give a fresh spin on this ?) PS: the 3-D is practically absent and useless.
PACIFIC RIM (2013) *** Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, Max Martini, Robert Kazinsky, Clifton Collins, Jr., Ron Perlman, Diego Klattenhoff. Guillermo del Toro's epic valentine to giant monsters run amok horror films is a hybrid of sci-fi including "Godzilla", "Inception" and take your pick of any Ray Harryhausen fantasy with a touch of HP Lovecraft: set in the future Earth finds itself under siege from ginormous alien monsters from an underwater chasm unleashing hellspawns forcing humanity to combat with equally humongous tech savvy robots in a fight to the finish. While its tin-eared dialogue is on par with James Cameron (del Toro collaborating with Travis Beacham), the visual f/x are pretty awesome with its splendidly over-the-top gargantuan bitch slapping over worldwide metropolises and severely major property damage. The behemoth beasties are truly amazing in their looks suggesting Disney's "Night on Bald Mountain" from "FANTASIA" meets the Mos Eisley cantina denizens of "Star Wars".
EASTERN PROMISES (2007) ***1/2 Naomi Watts, Viggo Mortensen, Vincent Cassel, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Sinead Cusack, Jerzy Skolimowski, Josef Altin. Absorbing crime drama and character study served up with dank, dark aplomb by master filmmaker David Cronenberg: a young London-based midwife of Russian heritage (Watts) finds herself embroiled with the Russian mob when one of her charges, a 14 year old girl, dies after delivering a baby, who has ties to the nefarious owner of a respectable restaurant (Stahl, an avuncular monster). Mortensen as the Mafioso's driver is mesmerizing in an Oscar-worthy turn and offers one of cinema's most memorable fight sequences in a steam bath wearing nothing but his tattoos. Steven Knight's serpentine screenplay echoes many other genre films but somehow maintains an originality about it.
IT FOLLOWS (2015) **1/2 Maika Monroe, Keir Gilchrist, Lili Sepe, Olivia Luccardi, Daniel Zovatto, Jake Weary. Supernatural indie chiller about a teenager (Monroe, a hybrid of Reese Witherspoon and Brittany Murphy) who finds herself in one helluva predicament: after having sex with a would-be beau she is informed he's passed on a deadly force (not unlike an STD) that will relentlessly pursue her until she is dead (!) While filmmaker David Robert Mitchell has cobbled together a fairly decent premise with echoes of Romero dread, Craven fear, Carpenter style and Cronenberg body horror he still has a half-baked horror flick that sadly remains inert in its final act in spite of an intriguing premise (which does not a movie break). An A for effort but a lot of eye-rolling 'really' moments (um, WTF is her mother who disappears after the aftermath of her encounter?!) A true case of hype over execution.
ROBOCOP (2014) **1/2 Joel Kinnaman, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Abbie Cornish, Jackie Earl Haley, Michael K. Williams, Jennifer Ehle, Jay Baruchel, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Samuel L. Jackson, Aimee Garcia, John Paul Ruttan. Once again another unnecessary reboot of an '80s classic this time with fair-to-meh results overall in the Frankensteinian mythos cum Dirty Harry meets Iron Man sci - fi action futuristic action flick set in crime-overrun Detroit with recently left for dead cop Alex Murphy (Kinnaman who acquits himself but is no Peter Weller) revived as the titular robotic weapon to vanquish the bad guys. Special effects overload, video-game violent mentality and very little 'fun' involved in spite of some emotional input added and a decent cast. (Dir: Jose Padilha)
THE INCREDIBLE HULK (2008) ***1/2 Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson, Ty Burrell, Christina Cabot, Debora Nascimento. Reboot of the Marvel Comics cult hero is serviced well this time out with a fine mix of cool visual effects and a decent storyline/screenplay by Zak Penn depicting the account of mild-mannered scientist, Dr. Bruce Banner (Norton excelling with his nuanced agonizing performance) and the side-effects of being exposed to gamma rays resulting in the titular creature whenever he is angered. Adding to his fury is the US military's ploy to capture the fugitive for further testings led by macho jerk Gen. Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross (Hurt) and interfering with Banner's romance with Ross' beguiling daughter Betty (Tyler) who is also trying to help Bruce return to 'normal'. Director Louis Leterrier goes gonzo with the action sequences, which prove satisfying with "Hulk Smash!" results including a spectacular throw down with nemesis gung-ho soldier Roth's "The Abomination". Look for Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee's cameos.
HOSTEL : PART II (2007) ** Lauren German, Heather Matarazzo, Bijou Phillips, Roger Bart, Richard Burgi, Vera Jordanova, Jay Hernandez, Jordan Ladd., Milan Knazko. Sadistic sequel to the gorefest splatter retro hashed by filmmaker Eli Roth lathers on the brio of buckets of blood over substance in this sick, twisted and disdainable chapter, this time with a sex change: three American young women are the unsuspecting victims-to-be to the depraved rich and powerful torture club in Slovakia. While German (a dead-ringer for Justine Bateman) acquits herself the film on the whole feels rushed and even sloppy (on all counts, pun intended). While the first attempted to fulfill the '70s grindhouse yore, this only lives up to the hackneyed '80s revival of the snuff/splatter fare.
OBLIVION (2013) ** Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Melissa Leo, Zoe Bell. Hodgepodge sci-fi mashup of 'Moon' meets take-your- pick of any Philip K. Dick genre 'who-am-I' sub genre tailored for an ill-fitting vehicle for Cruise as a futuristic 'clean-up crew' in a post-Apocalyptic Earth ravaged by an alien invasion where he soon discovers his mission is much, much more involved than what it appears to be. While the visual effects and action sequences are well produced, filmmaker Joseph Kosinksi - who co- scripted with Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt - based on a graphic novel he cooked up with Arvid Nelson, gives barely any thought to the supporting cast (i.e. Freeman barely registers; Leo literally phones in her performance; and Bell is completely wasted while Riseborough as Cruise's cohort/romantic interest, is practically a waxwork come to life)yet Cruise as usual delivers as a hero with a hidden soul reserved for mystery woman Kurylenko. A misfire and game attempt at best for being an 'epic'.
SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK (2008) ** Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Michelle Williams, Samantha Morton, Hope Davis, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Emily Watson, Tom Noonan, Dianne Wiest. Borderline nails-on-a-chalkboard oddity from 'genius' scribe Charlie Kaufman's equally off-beat mindset (and his directorial debut to boot) about a schlumpy playwright (Hoffman) whose introspection of his failed life in general causes grist for the mill of meta proportions when his deemed MacArthur grant allows him to pursue his ultimate story: a play in real-time about himself! Precious and at times frustratingly too obtuse but still fascinating in the long run largely to its impressive ensemble.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER (2011) **1/2 Benjamin Walker, Dominic Cooper, Anthony Mackie, Mary Ellizabeth Winstead, Rufus Sewell, Marton Csokas, Jimmi Simpson, Joseph Mawie, Robin McLeavy, Erin Wasson. Insane in the membrane monster mash-up with beloved historical figure is one of the odder and more miss-than-hit hybrid based on Seth Grahame-Smith's novel (he adapted for the screen himself) what-if-scenario of the Kentucky rail splitter as a vengeance seeker for the undead who killed his mother enlisted with a mentor in the unlikely form of 'turned' vampire killer Cooper out to stop the war-mongering plague of vampires, while becoming the politician destined for greatness as the emancipator. With some iffy CGI and far too many MATRIX enhanced fight sequences the film's anemic quality is overshadowed by the production design and at times overcooked direction by Timur Bekmambetov.
THE DEPARTED (2006) **** Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, Anthony Anderson, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Corrigan. Excellent Americanized adaptation of the Hong Kong policier "Infernal Affairs" envisioned with a sharp resonance, brutal no-flinching violence and well-rounded characters, from master filmmaker Martin Scorsese (his best since "GoodFellas") embedded with a top- notch cast and a gritty screenplay by William Monahan depicting two powerful worlds in Boston: the cops and the gangs with a twist: rookie cop Di Caprio is groomed to be a mole to infiltrate violent thug Nicholson's enclave while his own right-hand protégée Damon is sent into the police force to gain information to keep one step ahead of their on-going investigation to but to rest the years long reign of Jack. Excellent acting by all around; a particular wild card in the unlikely form of Wahlberg. One of the year's absolute best. Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, Anthony Anderson, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Corrigan. Excellent Americanized adaptation of the Hong Kong policier "Infernal Affairs" envisioned with a sharp resonance, brutal no-flinching violence and well-rounded characters, from master filmmaker Martin Sheen (his best since "GoodFellas") embedded with a top-notch cast and a gritty screenplay by William Monahan depicting two powerful worlds in Boston: the cops and the gangs with a twist: rookie cop Di Caprio is groomed to be a mole to infiltrate violent thug Nicholson's enclave while his own right-hand protégée Damon is sent into the police force to gain information to keep one step ahead of their on-going investigation to but to rest the years long reign of Jack. Excellent acting by all around; a particular wild card in the unlikely form of Wahlberg. One of the year's absolute best.
THE WRESTLER (2008) **** Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood, Mark Margolis, Todd Barry, Wass Stevens, Judah Friedlander. Triumphant return to form by Rourke in an Oscar caliber performance as a washed up professional wrestler whose current, bleak existence is at a cross-roads where Randy "The Ram" Robinson attempts a comeback at past glory and a shot of redemption in his personal life in the unlikely form of veteran stripper Tomei (equally top notch) and his estranged daughter (Wood gives the film a nice shot of reality). Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky corrals a career defining/resurrection force-to-be-reckoned complex experience from Rourke whose own real-life histories/demons underscore the underdog appeal to this excellent film about requiem and respect. The original screenplay by novice Robert D. Siegel echoes Hemingway in its deceptive simplicity. Rourke appealed to Bruce Springsteen to contribute a track to the film and his poignant tune is pitch-perfect, as is the rest of the film as a whole. One of the year's best.
MAN ON WIRE (2008) **** Wholly absorbing and ultimately rewardingly fascinating documentary about the historical event of French tightrope walker Philippe Petit's daredevil theatrics in crossing over the chasm of NYC's World Trade Center twin towers in 1975. The film is treated almost as a bank heist thriller as Petit recalls in flashback recreations of his incredible plan/dream/life-time achievement in hatching the idea on a whim to a nearly obsessive fever-dream in self-fulfillment of destined derring-do. Director James Marsh makes a clever thriller and lump-in-the-throat valentine to the iconic feat that is only more poignant in the shadow of 9/11 (which is the subtext but never mentioned). A truly magical and at times funny and in the process, humane tale of one man's desire as a global moment in time. A must see and one of the year's best and my choice for Best Documentary Nominee for this year's Oscars.
HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN (2011) **Rutger Hauer, Molly Dunsworth, Brian Downey, Gregory Smith, Nick Bateman, Jeremy Akerman, Pasha Ebrahimi. Hauer  in a somewhat 'comeback' turn  gives it his all as a downtrodden homeless man attempting to gain some self-respect but instead finds himself knee-deep in a no-man's land run by a ruthless ganglord and his sadistic sons (teeth-gnashingly good/awful Downey and Tom Cruise manques Smith and Bateman) who push him to the limit to become the titular avenger  including his only friend, a hooker with a heart of gold (Dunsworth)  with buckets of blood & guts in this old-fashioned grindhouse guilty pleasure. While rookie filmmaker Jason Eisener (FYI: did a faux-trailer for the Canadian release of Robert Rodriguez' "Grindhouse") pulls out all the stops with his direction but the screenplay he co-scripted with John Davies and Rob Cotterill is even rank by most sub-B-flick quickies. But it is just worth the price of admission to see good ol' Rutger dishing out vigilante justice in all its gory glory.
The Beatles' music - and their likenesses - are incorporated into this kaleidoscopic, trippy, fun and altogether marvelous animated classic where The Fab Four are transported into PepperLand on an adventure to restore the citizens to life and having many adventures along their merry way. Truly inspired with timeless music and memorable characters - Jeremy, the fuzzy-wuzzy "nowhere man" and the Mickey Mouse-like Blue Meanies are a few to mention. Fun for the entire family and truly magical in transporting you into a cinematic Never-Never- Land! One of my all time favorite films; dare you not to sing to the titular tune! A true capsule for the hazy, crazy '60s!
SLEEPING BEAUTY (2011) ** Odd and uneven drama about a young coed (Emily Browning, the film's saving grace in a brave turn) attempting to make ends meet  and a reason to exist  finds herself between odd jobs as a high-priced, super confidential lingerie waitress that leads to an elite clientele involving her sedated and literally being the eponymous object. Novice filmmaker Julia Leigh seems to have airlifted the bizarre sexual sequence from Stanley Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT and run with it to the best of her titillation abilities which are more awkward than sensuous. While it is decently paced and offers a glimpse of humor (i.e. Browning's ongoing temp job contentiousness with her icy co-worker/boss rings far too true for the drones!) the film as a whole seems to be missing an essential item: a reason to be told.
RAMBO (2008) *** Sylvester Stallone, Julie Benz, Paul Schulze, Ken Howard, Graham McTavish, Matthew Marsden, Jake La Botz. Stallone's iconic Vietnam vet killing machine extraordinaire John Rambo is back with a vengeance in this entertaining and at-times-over- the-top brutally violent chapter in the franchise instilling some new blood(shed) this time with our reluctant hero called into action when an American missionary troupe is savagely attacked after he escorted them into the Burma jungle resulting in their dire need of rescue. Directed, produced and co-written by Stallone (with Art Monterastelli) the film delivers the brutal, bloody goods with a decent body count and  hey- a relative political message to the true-to-life genocide in the nation at hand.
MR. MAGORIUM'S WONDER EMPORIUM (2007) *1/2 Dustin Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Jason Bateman, Zach Mills, Rebecca Northan. Hodgepodge of "Willy Wonka" but with toys about an ageless child enthusiast (Hoffman in a fright wig and an Ed Wynn lisp) whose magical store is truly alive. However the direction by Zach Helm is stillborn and a real mess particularly wasting the genuine talents of Portman as a wanna-be pianist who seems truly out of sorts throughout and Bateman as an accounting stick-in-the mud. . The rating gets an extra ½ for the decent visuals but that cannot be counterbalanced equally by the god awfulness of this kiddie aimed concoction.
DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (2013) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner, Jared Leto, Denis O'Hare, Steve Zahn, Dallas Roberts, Kevin Rankin, Griffin Dunne, Michael O'Neill. McConaughey gives an Oscar-worthy performance of complex strength and a certain shabby nobility as Ron Woodruff, a rough-and-tumble Texas good ol' boy whose sudden diagnosis of contracting HIV and given a death sentence instead galvanizes the pig-headed, homophobic rodeo cowboy a chance at redemption by sticking to his guns, digging in his heels and serving up an ad-hoc business selling memberships to those similarly afflicted for non-FDA approved drugs. While Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack's screenplay serves the subject all- too familiarly from one-note borderline redneck to patron saint somewhere in between it is the clear eyes direction by Jean-Marc Vallee and his star's amazing acting skills in making an unlikable reprobate something we all recognize: all too human in an unjust world. Leto is equally remarkable as a transvestite homosexual who become Woodroof's aide-de-camp and best friend in the process while Garner's green doctor balances out as a medical professional learning the knotty ropes of big pharma tactics. McConaughey lost a reported nearly 40 pounds to give his skeletal appearance the verisimilitude necessary but make no mistake he delivers the goods, warts an all with a sense of dark humor and self-worth. JKL - Just Keep Livin' ; indeed
OUIJA (2014) * Olivia Cooke, Ana Coto, Daren Kagasoff, Bianca A. Santos, Douglas Smith, Shelley Hennig, Lin Shaye, Vivis Colombetti, Robyn Lively, Matthew Settle, Claudia Kata, Sierra Heuermann, Sunny May Allison. Yet another disappointing horror film with an expendable cast of pretty young things: when a girlfriend commits suicide her BFF investigates to learn she was playing the titular supernatural game with deadly results and makes things worse for her circle of friends when the other side decides to break on through (apologies to Jim Morrison). First-time director Stiles White - who penned the screenplay with frequent collaborator Juliet Snowden - loses control of the the film to be convoluted with a way too loud musical score and audio track does not a genre picture make; Captain Howdy is not pleased (and if you don't get that reference you'll never get it).
LAST VEGAS (2013) *** Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Kline, Mary Steenburgen, Jerry Ferrara, Romany Malco, Roger Bart, Joanna Gleason, Michael Ealy, Bre Blair. "The Hangover" for the AARP audience could've been the pitch for this predictable but not-as- bad-as-expected comedy with The Flatbush Four (Douglas, De Niro, Freeman and Kline) reuniting for Douglas' wedding and bachelor party in Las Vegas with plenty of laughs, grumblings and Viagra jokes. In spite of the by-the-numbers screenplay by Dan Fogelman and able direction by Jon Turteltaub the real pleasure is seeing The Fantastic Four thespians cutting up and enjoying themselves in the process.
MANIAC (2013) **1/2 Elijah Wood, Nora Arnezeder, America Olivio, Liane Balaban, Megan Duffy, Jan Broberg, Sammi Rotibi, Genevieve Alexandra, Steffinnnie Phrommany, Dan Hunter. Morbidly watchable remake of the 1980 cult classic grind house slasher pic with an ashen Wood (who proved he can do creepy ; witness "Sin City" as a blink-free cannibal) as a mannequin restorer whose psychological homicidal impulses are in overdrive as a serial killer who scalps his victims and affixes their bloody pelts to his dummy companions. With obvious echoes of "Psycho" (i.e. momma's boy with a truly odd fetishistic hobby) the film suffers comparisons as well to other (better) genre films (note to future filmmakers: um, NEVER use a very familiar song/or film in a sequence that is cribbed from a better film -to wit, twice here: the song "Goodbye Horses" by Q. Lazzarus from the Buffalo Bob sequence in "Silence of the Lambs" and the German, silent expressionistic horror classic "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"). Newbie director Franck Khalfoun finds some eerie beauty here and there (a fresh take on the bathroom kill is poetically elegiac) however the screenplay by Alexandre Aja, Gregory Levasseur and C.A. Rosenberg is rather dull and by-the-numbers with little sympathy for its crazed lead nor for any of his prey. While I've only seen glimpses of William Lustig's original with stellar make-up f/x by guru Tom Savini this is a rather colorless remix.
DELIVER US FROM EVIL (2014) * Eric Bana, Edgar Ramirez, Olivia Munn, Joel McHale, Lulu Wilson, Chris Coy, Dorian Missick, Sean Harris, Mike Houston, Olivia Horton, Scott Johnsen. Yet another 'based on a true story' horror hodgepodge of exorcism and demon possession this time based on a book by Bronx detective Ralph Sarchie (Bana) who encounters inexplicable phenomena while investigating several crimes with the common link of the supernatural and unexplainable links to The Doors (?!?!).yawn. The barely registrable screenplay adaptation by Paul Harris Boardman and director Scott Derickson pulls out all the tropes including rainy sequences, cats hissing in the dark, etc. that you can see the end results a mile away. Stay away.
SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (2008) **** Dev Patel, Anil Kapoor, Freida Pinto, Madhur Mittal, Azharuddin Mohammad Ismail, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Rubiana Ali, Tanay Chheda, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala. Aborbing and winning drama set in poverty stricken India with Patel as a teen whose pure survival skills through out his amazing life on the hard-bitten streets helps him gain access to the Hindi version of the TV game show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" Told in flashbacks filmmaker Danny Boyle - and co-director Loveleen Tandan, does a fantastic job of holding the audience's attention as each piece of the puzzle finds its way to the climactic moment of truth for our hero: his long-lost childhood love Pinto (ethereally beautiful and truly worthy of being a prize for anyone's hopes and desires). One of the year's very best.
THE FINAL DESTINATION (2009) ** Bobby Campo, Shantel VanSanten, Nick Zano,, Haley Webb, Mykelti Williamson, Krista Allen, Andrew Fischella, Justin Welborn, Stephanie Honore, Lara Grice, Jackson Walker. Fourth and surprisingly predictable installment of the gory horror franchise, this time in 3-D (which admittedly are not that great) with another quartet of bland teens cheating death and attempting to change their fates from one Wile E. Coyote meets Rube Goldberg via The Grim Reaper set piece after the other. The visual effects are very cheesy and look like bad video game reject schematics as well as the current chapter for an otherwise ingenious genre offering. (Dir: David R. Ellis)
CALVARY (2014) *** 1/2 Brendan Gleeson, Chris O'Dowd, Kelly Reilly, Aidan Gillen, Isaach De Bankole, M. Emmet Walsh, Marie-Josee Croze, Domhnall Gleeson, David Wilmot, Pat Shortt, Gary Lydon, Killian Scott, Orla O'Rourke. Gleeson gives a career-defining and Oscar-worthy performance as a world-weary Irish Catholic priest who is marked for death after a confessor confirms he will kill the man in one week's time with Gleeson hedging his bets with a truly contemptible congregation. Written and directed with black élan and dark comedy by John Michael McDonagh the film rests squarely on the broad shoulders of its amiable lead whose attempt to get through what may be his final week alive as a gauntlet of the soul if you will (seriously Gleeson's lethal deadpan conjures a suggestion of being drawn by Chuck Jones!) and a test of faith overall with those he encounters while administering his priestly duties. Funny, poignant and shrewdly performed, directed and produced on location in the evergreens of Ireland the windswept romantic beachheads never looked so intimidating in the face of one's mortality. The only fault is the ever-dreadening gloom and far-too-many pricks to be foreseen as a suspect, yet Gleeson and McDonagh (who teamed previously in the director's debut THE GUARD) play to their strengths. One of the year's best.
BLOOD DIAMOND (2006) ** Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou, Jennifer Connelly, Kagiso Kuypers, Arnold Vosloo, Antony Coleman, Bneu Mabhena, Anointing Lukola, David Harewood, Basil Wallace, Jimi Mistry, Michael Sheen, Stephen Collins. Based on the South African accounts of harvesting diamonds that have been known to finance wars (hence the title), a former soldier of fortune (DiCaprio) reluctantly agrees to help a fellow countryman (Hounsou) find his family after being torn asunder and forced to dig for diamonds by marauding groups of brute force, when a sizable jewel is uncovered proving to be their ticket for salvation. Although a noble effort is undertaken by all involved the funereal pacing and repeat of action sequence  lengthy speech by main character  action sequence etc. taxes the nerves and the fact that Hounsou is reduced to a howling, righteously angry man is getting to be a sad indictment for this otherwise excellent actor's skills. Connelly is miscast as an American journalist who has the misfortune for one of the worst scenes in the film : facing certain death she asks her would-be assassins if it is OK to take their photos (!) (Dir: Edward Zwick)
PLEASE GIVE (2010) **** Catherine Keener, Oliver Platt, Rebecca Hall, Amanda Peet, Ann Morgan Guilbert, Sarah Steele, Lois Smith, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Josh Pais. Funny, touching & poignantly human comedy/drama from filmmaker Nicole Holofcener mixing the mean with the meaningful focusing on a married couple (the always magnetic Keener in arguably a career high and always watchable Platt, ditto), who run a business involving used furniture procured from the grief-stricken family members of the recently deceased elderly and their run-ins with guilt by association with fellow tenant Morgan Guilbert, a cranky senior whose apartment they covet as well. Told with clear-eyed misanthropy mixed with bittersweet loveliness the film packs an emotional wallop while pulling the heart-strings, jerking tears & tickling the funny bone. Kudos to Morgan Guilbert's oil and vinegar granddaughters, wallflower with a heart of gold Hall (who just gets better with each showcase of her talent) and bitch on wheels Peet (a surprising departure from her usual sunny dispositions); one of the year's very best.
THEN SHE FOUND ME (2008) ***1/2 Helen Hunt, Colin Firth, Bette Midler, Matthew Broderick, Lynn Cohen, Ben Shenkman, John Benjamin Hickey (Cameos: Janeane Garofalo, Tim Robbins as themselves) Hunt's auspicious directorial debut is a winnerHelen Hunt has been largely absent from the big-screen (outside of a small role in 2006's BOBBY) and returns in a big way in her auspicious directorial debut that is a real winner.Hunt plays April Epner, a NYC schoolteacher who is facing a mid-life crisis: her recent marriage to fellow teacher Ben (Broderick, one time real-life paramour of Hunt's, and cast against type), an immature mama's boy, is ending when Ben announces he cannot accept their life together; her biological mother, Bernice Graves (Midler in one of her finest turns in years), a TV morning show chat hostess, suddenly finds her and wants to re-connect after forty years apart; and April's biological clock is ticking like a time-bomb in her yen to have a child.While April tries to hang onto every shred of sanity she is also instantly smitten with one her pupil's father, Frank (a dressed down Firth at his stammering sexy best here), an author whose promiscuous wife abandoned him with their young children in his charge, who is equally head-over-heels for April and in his charming, English way (yes he's British), seduces her but after a lengthy process that has many pitfalls including the aforementioned crumbling marriage, reluctant reunion with her 'mother' and the possibility of actually being pregnant.Hunt does an admirable job in her seemingly effortless debut as an auteur (she co- scripted the adaptation of Elinor Lipman's novel with Alice Arlen and Victor Levin with deft cleverness and élan) eliciting strong performances from her reliable and estimable ensemble  including herself; no easy task (as well as serving as the film's producer)  and her many hats to wear are all for the better.As April, a very blunt, uptight and on edge woman who knows what she wants but cannot maintain a tight grasp for, nor for how she is affecting those around her (and vice versea), may not seem to be the most sympathetic, but clearly an empathetic heroine nonetheless. Hunt gives her best performance to date (I personally didn't think she deserved her Oscar for "AS GOOD AS IT GETS" nor cared for the film on the whole; but she acquitted herself on the hit-com "Mad About You" with Paul Reiser) and incorporating her character's strong values (including her Judaism quite winningly and for the most part, thankfully, not stereotypically) I must admit I loved her efforts overall except for the film's conclusion which I felt copped out (since for the most part her one 'stereotype' of 'adopting a Chinese baby' was a running joke throughout the film). Broderick has the most difficult role as her putz husband who cannot come to a decision on anything resembling adulthood (nice touch in 'infantilizing' him by having him wear a ball hat and backpack when April goes to her first ultrasound); Firth gives some dimension to his usual befuddled yet 'right' man (I loved his 'walks' to clear his mind and the last one is a humdinger); and Midler as the woman who may or may have not given birth to Steve McQueen's (!) love-child is wonderful as the touchy-feely say anything from the top of her head mother. Hunt has a good chance to continue as a filmmaker and clearly continued success as an unsung actress.PS: yes that indeed is Salman Rushdie (!!) as April's OB/GYN.
OCEAN'S THIRTEEN (2007) *** George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Al Pacino, Ellen Barkin, Elliott Gould, Don Cheadle, Eddie Jemison, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Bernie Mac, Shaobo Qin, Carl Reiner, Eddie Izzard, Vincent Cassel, Bob Einstein, Andy Garcia, David Paymer Julian Sands. Better-than-anticipated reuniting of the Ocean's con men out to settle a personal score when their old buddy Gould is welched on a multi-million dollar deal with a new Vegas casino by jerk, a-hole business partner Pacino, whose vicious greed gets the goats of the crew to level him in one of the most convoluted, yet entertaining, big score grift. New life is breathed into the franchise thankfully by a sharp screenplay by scribe team Brian Koppelman and David Levien (ROUNDERS) and some truly razzle-dazzle, glitzy cinematography by Peter Andrews AKA filmmaker Steven Soderbergh, who reigns in his motley crew for one final round of carousing high-dealing shenanigans. A sure thing.
THE QUEEN (2006) *** Helen Mirren, Michael Sheen, James Cromwell, Sylvia Syms, Alex Jennings, Helen McCrory, Roger Allam. Mirren gives an Oscar caliber turn as Queen Elizabeth II in an uncanny inhabitation of Her Royal Majesty in the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana and the way the royals badly dealt with the ongoing circus of her subsequent funeral proceedings that lead to a cautious yet alert newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair (Sheen, equally good) to prod the queen to do the right thing in the eyes of her loyal subjects. With impeccable grace and ultimately humanity Mirren scores the unthinkable: making a figurehead  seemingly outdated  of significance and as a human being, a reluctant empathetic subject. (Dir: Stephen Frears)
TERMINATOR SALVATION (2009) *** Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood, Helena Bonham Carter, Anton Yelchin, Jadagrace, Bryce Dallas Howard, Common, Jane Alexander, Michael Ironside. Relatively decent and entertaining but a tad stilted chapter in the sci-fi actioner franchise set in 2018 with an adult John Connor (a very intense Bale) facing a bleak future where Skynet, the nefarious powers that be, have unleashed an apocalyptic hell-on-earth with robots laying waste in their wakes. The only hope is in saving his father-to-be, rebel Kyle Reese (an affective Yelchin) and mysterious Marcus Wright (newcomer Worthington who makes for an efficient cipher) may be the road to salvation. Directed with bombastic style to spare by McG, the film coasts on its mythic yarn with some awesome displays of action set pieces (the chase sequences are worth the price of admission) but admittedly the final act is on shaky ground with the opening possibility of natch another sequel down the line.
THE CRAZIES (2010) ***Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell, Joe Anderson, Danielle Panabaker, Christie Lynn Smith, Brett Rickaby. Well-staged remake of George A. Romero's (who executive produced) cult classic about an American small town suddenly dealing with a plague of violent incidents seemingly caused by its water supply poisoned by a paramilitary virus toxin (!) Cue paranoia and a significant body count as the local populace begins a blood-thirsty panic. Well-crafted, all-stops-pulled direction by Breck Eisner (some creative set pieces include a hairy bit with an electric bone-cutting saw and a terribly tense moment thru an abandoned car wash).
THE COLLECTION (2012) **1/2 Josh Stewart, Emma Fitzpatrick, Lee Tergesen, Christopher McDonald, Navi Rawat, Randall Archer, Johanna Braddy, Daniel Sharman, Andre Royo, Brandon Molale, Erin Way. Sequel to the torture porn horror flick THE COLLECTOR, takes up immediately after its conclusion with the survivor of a serial killer's rampage (Stewart) who is enlisted to help save the young girl of the crazed murderer's booby-trapped lair. Tag-team director/writers Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton cook up some elaborate horrific Rube Goldbergian jerry- rigged set pieces but it grows tedious quickly after there is little character development (or involvement outside the leads) and becomes a chore to sit through the next viscerally graphic carnage at hand.
SAVING MR. BANKS (2013) *** Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks, Annie Rose Buckley, Colin Farrell, Ruth Wilson, Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford, BJ Novak, Jason Schwartzman, Lily Bigham, Kathy Baker, Rachel Griffiths. Behind-the-scenes look at the troublesome courtship of sorts by Walt Disney (Hanks at his most folksy) in wooing author PL Travers (starchy and dry-as-a-bone funny Thompson) to purchase the film rights to "Mary Poppins" depicts the curt wet blanket Aussie's struggle to protect her beloved character while reminiscing of her sad childhood. While director John Lee Hancock manages to balance the flashbacks of Travers' family saga with the battle for Disney the screenplay by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith takes some great liberties (the film's Jiminy Cricket like conscience imbued by Giamatti as her chauffeur) with the facts. However it gets the period details nicely and will have you recalling the classic with even more nostalgia. The give- and-take chemistry of its stars is E-Ticket here.
THE LORDS OF SALEM (2013) **1/2 Sheri Moon Zombie, Bruce Davison, Jeff Daniel Phillips, Judy Geeson, Meg Foster, Patricia Quinn, Ken Foree, Dee Wallace, Maria Conchita Alonso, Fichard Fancy, Andrew Prine, Michael Berryman, Sid Haig. Horror fan aficionado cum filmmaker, rocker Rob Zombie once again attempts to pay homage with this throwback to '70s/80s witchcraft/Satanic ritual sub genre enlisting his lovely Mrs. as a Salem, Mass. based radio DJ who comes into possession of a weird record linked to her lineage that ultimately has grave consequences for her. Armed to the teeth in atmosphere and production values (and some nice nods to horror of yore - i.e. Lon Chaney's silent version of "The Phantom Of The Opera" playing on a flat-screen TV) overcomes the film's shortcomings (sadly Ms. Zombie while easy on the eyes and dead sexy is no Adrienne Barbeau to her John Carpenter if you will and the distracting notion that Phillips -one of her co-workers and ex-paramours - is a Doppelgänger of her own husband!) But it is nice to see vets of the genre including Wallace and Davison having a field day in a so-so shocker.
BULLET TO THE HEAD (2013) **1/2 Sylvester Stallone, Sung Kang, Sarah Shahi, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Jason Momoa, Christian Slater, Jon Seda, Holt McCallany, Brian Van Holt, Weronika Rosati. Stallone is the only reason to watch this stillborn actioner based on a graphic novel by Alexis Nolent (pedestrian adaptation by tin-eared Alessandro Camon) as a New Orleans hit man with a code reluctantly teaming up with an out of his element DC cop (Kang; same could be said of him - the film's weakest link - how is this guy in film is beyond me! boring/zip chemistry/wooden to the point of splinters) seeking revenge on the murders of both their partners in a set-up that only makes pot boiling an art form. A fun cameo more or less by Slater as a sleazy Big Easy muckety muck lawyer barely adrenalizes the film and the sinfully wasted use of the sexy/talented Shahi is a crime in and of itself. But Momoa as the hired mercenary by real estate magnate Akinnuoye-Agbaje, is a formidable presence and hiss-worthy while his climactic axe-battle royale with Sly livens things up. Shame that veteran director Walter Hill's 'comeback' is an asterisk instead of a grand-slam for his record book.
THE DARJEELING LIMITED (2007) *** Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman, Amara Karan, Wallace Wolodarsky, Waris Ahluwalia, Irfan Khan, Barbet Schroeder, Camilla Rutherfood, Bill Murray, Anjelica Huston. Wes Andersons' most precious yet at times warm and funny comic tale of three brothers reuniting a year after their father's death by taking a train journey to India poses as a valentine to Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray and a look at the bonding of siblings when liking one another is more a chore than loving one another. Shot on location and a companion short  "The Hotel Chevalier"  with Natalie Portman and Schwartzman  well suitedly underscores the following storyline.
UNDERWORLD : RISE OF THE LYCANS (2009) **1/2 Michael Sheen, Rhona Mitra, Bill Nighy, Steven Mackintosh, David Grevious, David Ashton. Fair to middling prequel to the vastly popular monster-mash franchise with Sheen as a lycan Spartacus if you will, whose people are enslaved by Nighy's vampire empire is further complicated when he falls in love with the king's princess daughter (sultry Mitra who makes a formidable presence in her feistiness), causing a war between creatures of the night. Directed by Patrick Tatopoulos  who worked as the previous film's special effects chief - does yeoman work with some decent visuals and transformation sequences with the furry beasties yet ultimately it wears out its grisly welcome by the climactic battle royale.
HORTON HEARS A WHO! (2008) **1/2 (Voices of: Jim Carrey, Steve Carell, Carol Burnett, Isla Fisher, Amy Poehler, Will Arnett, Seth Rogen, Dan Fogler, Jonah Hill, Jaime Pressly, Charles Osgood  narrator) Big-screen animated adaptation of Dr. Seuss' classic children's tale about a good-hearted elephant named Horton (Carrey actually dialing it down several levels thankfully) who comes across a microscopic town in a speck on a flower and attempts to convince the jungle community they exist. The eclectic comic talent shine as does the animation in general getting Seuss' characters to remain in their iconic drawn-line schism yet the screenplay by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul feels strained in the padding for a full-length feature yet directing team Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino wisely keep things lively for all ages to enjoy.
A FITTING TRIBUTE (2007) In this crafty British short a young reporter-wannabe is given the disheartening task of interviewing recently bereaved people about their loss and is taken to task by his senior mentor who forces him to prove himself by not taking no for an answer. Upon visiting "Mrs. Wright" he discovers instead of the expected grieving, sadness, anger and confusion a woman who welcomes him whole-heartedly into her home. Obviously a comedy of errors...but at what cost. Craftily produced with a tinge of Rod Serling's classic TWILIGHT ZONE with the O.Henry twist of being careful of what you should wish for. Requires several viewings to appreciate the delicate genius of execution.
THE WATCH (2012) ** Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, Richard Ayoade, Rosemarie DeWitt, Will Forte, Mel Rodriguez, Doug Jones, Erin Moriarty, Nicholas Braun, R.Lee Ermey, Joe Nunez, Johnny Pemberton. Lame sci-fi comedy that tries to do for neighborhood watches what GHOSTBUSTERS did for paranormal scientists but fails miserably in this one-note gimmick with Stiller (who really needs to start stretching from his annoying intense scrutinizing schmucks; seriously) who enlists three unlikely neighbors to investigate a murder of one of his employees only to uncover a galactic invasion of aliens hellbent on crushing the planet (YAWN) with haphazard results. Vaughn is in his trademark motormouth ass mode; creepily svelte down Hill tries TOO hard to be a wanna be bad-ass; and the Zeppo Marx of this ungainly quartet is Brit comedian Ayoade who.I.LOATHED. Seriously so not funny at all. The by-the-numbers-boring- and-way-too-stupidly-vulgar-for-no-reason-crass screenplay by Jared Stern, Seth Rogen & collaborator Evan Goldberg feels half-baked at best and newbie director Akiva Schaffer has no skill for comedy (to wit using gangsta rap over and over to BE FUNNY because the heroes are white (ha! got it!) and go in slo-mo 'hero walks' one too many! Rent EVOLUTION for a slightly better genre comedy at best.
THE LONE RANGER (2013) ***1/2 Johnny Depp, Armie Hammer, William Fichtner, Tom Wilkinson, Ruth Wilson, Helena Bonham Carter, James Badge Dale, Bryant Prince, Barry Pepper, Leon Rippy, Stephen Root. Rip-roaring big-screen adaptation of the pop culture icon from yesteryear cum origin story of 'The Masked Man' with dynamic duo Depp (deadly dead-pan) and Hammer (square-jawed Brendan Fraser channeling derring-do) as vengeance seeking reluctant partners and ultimately BFFs up against railroad magnate Wilkinson and nasty outlaw Fichtner (with a touch of cannibalism too boot!) in ye Olde West as manifest-destiny gets a reboot. Swell set pieces and classic WB toon vibe thru out thanks to yeoman journeyman filmmaker Gore Verbinski (Depp's mash-up partner-in-crime for the "Pirates" flicks) and Jerry Bruckeheimer's blockbuster mentality balances with a well-thought of screenplay by Justin Haythe and Terry Elliott & Terry Rossio (scribes for aforementioned Verbiniski/Depp trilogy). Great hokum hero entertainment and sweet rekindle of the iconic William Tell Overture with a killer train sequence (well three to be exact!)
IDENTITY THIEF (2013) **1/2 Jason Bateman, Melissa McCarthy, John Cho, Amanda Peet, Jon Favreau, T.I., Genesis Rodriguez, Morris Chestnut, Robert Patrick, Eric Stonestreet, Mary-Charles Jones, Maggie Elizabeth Jones, Ben Falcone, Kate Graham. Hit-and-miss high concept/road/buddy/fish-out-of-water hybrid comedy with schmuck Bateman (giving Ben Stiller and Paul Rudd a run for their money as affable put-upons) getting a rude awakening when his identity is stolen by vulgarian McCarthy (a hoot) whose living high on the hog until Bateman decides to track her down and get her to confess to her crimes to save his job. While the simple premise has its huge plot holes no thanks to the pedestrian script by Craig Mazin and Jerry Eeten and colorless direction by Seth Gordon, Bateman does a fine deadpan straight man to McCarthy's loose cannon white trash honey with a heart of gold as their chemistry is right on the money.
JONAH HEX (2010) **1/2 Josh Brolin, John Malkovich, Megan Fox, Michael Fassbender, Aidan Quinn, Lance Reddick, Will Arnett, John Gallagher, Jr., Tom Wopat, Michael Shannon, Wes Bentley, Julia Jones. So-so adaptation of the cult DC Comics' anti-hero, the titular Civil War era soldier cum vengeance seeking bounty hunter (Brolin acquitting himself nicely in gruff, Clint Eastwood stoicism mode) with supernatural methods (i.e. talking to the dead) who is reluctantly enlisted by President Ulysses S. Grant (Quinn) to stop nefarious Quentin Turnbull (Malkovich in phoned-in-for-the-paycheck turn) with his plan of terrorism during the centennial festivities in Washington, DC (and natch, a perfect reason for Hex to seek revenge on him for leaving him literally a branded man ; his scarred face the results of his dastardly deeds). While the production values look first rate and Brolin is gung-ho the film suffers from bland mannequin Fox and lousily paced direction from Jimmy Hayward in this offshoot of "The Outlaw Josey Wales" by way of "The Twilight Zone".
Dracula UNTOLD (2014) ** Luke Evans, Sarah Gadon, Dominic Cooper, Art Parkinson, Charles Dance, Diarmaid Murtagh, Pau Kaye. The infamous vampire gets his own origin story that was hinted at in BRAM STOKER's Dracula, namely that Transylvanian prince Vlad (The Impaler) (Evans brooding magnificently) makes a deal with the devil (in murderous, formidable form of Dance relishing the nasty monster hidden in the nefarious caves) in order to protect his family and kingdom from the bloodthirsty Turks in 15th century warfare. While the production design by Francois Audouy and breathtaking cinematography by Josh Schwartzman is breathtakingly audacious the script by newbie Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless falters only in the fact we all know who Dracula already is and not truly breathing new life into a (un)dead corpse. Gary Shore's directorial debut is a huge undertaking and employing the dazzling digital and visual special effects to the hilt has an eye for the big picture and even the poignant love story which all could've been hamfisted or even trite. A mix bag of an ancient tale but not as terrible as expected; just not as good either.
HOMEFRONT (2013) ** Jason Statham, James Franco, Izabela Vidovic, Kate Bosworth, Clancy Brown, Winona Ryder, Omar Benson Miller, Rachelle Lefevre, Frank Grillo, Chuck Zito, Pruitt Taylor Vince. Fair Statham vehicle streamlined for his ass-kicking form as an ex-DEA agent attempting a new life with his daughter (Vidovic) in Louisiana only finds themselves butting heads with the local meth kingpin (Franco, laughably miscast) whose kin has him in the mix after a schoolyard altercation mushrooms into high-stakes vengeance. Based on Chuck Logan's book and adapted by Statham bud Sylvester Stallone the screenplay at best plays to the strengths of its star's implosive kineticism. Ryder is equally laughable as a 'meth whore' gal pal of Franco's who seems completely baffled as to being in the film at all. Director Gary Fleder keeps the action flowing but the credibility is a still-birth.
GRAVITY (2013) *** Visual effects dominate this otherwise predictable yet immersible sci-fi drama about two astronauts (Sandra Bullock and George Clooney) who find themselves in a dire situation: while making repairs to their space station they wind up in jeopardy essentially lost in space with the clock ticking and insurmountable odds at surviving their cosmic calamity. With state-of-the-art filmmaking and accomplished direction by Alfonso Cuaron -who collaborated on the otherwise pedestrian screenplay with his son Jonas - putting his stars in great peril may be great storytelling in 'showing' then 'telling' (when in reality it would help if it was the opposite). And yes that is Ed Harris as the voice of Houston. Needs to be seen in IMAX 3-D to appreciate the splendor of outer space (and the nerve-shredding silences).
THE HURT LOCKER (2009) **** Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Evangeline Lilly. Filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow's absorbingly, nerve- jangling, Oscar worthy look at the war in Iraq is bold, original and powerful thanks largely to the anchored performance of Renner (seriously should be nominated for Best Actor), as a cool- as-a-cucumber, Unorthodox US Army Staff Sergeant whose mission is to disarm bombs upon combat situations with a team of two others (Mackie and Geraghty equally affective) while jeopardizing the chaos surrounding the trio in constant harms' way. Loaded with enough teeth-clenching, sweat-inducing anxiety and stress the you-are-there-approach echoes Stone's "PLATOON" and Spielberg's "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN" and the film joins the ranks of those two exceptional war films as an elite force unto itself. One of the year's very best and a must see.
DRIVE ANGRY 3D (2011) ** Nicholas Cage, Amber Heard, Billy Burke, David Morse, William Fichtner, Charlotte Ross, Christa Campbell, Tom Atkins, Katy Mixon, Jack McGee. Badass Mother****er John Milton (Cage having a field day) returns from beyond the grave  and literally HELL  to rescue his slain daughter's infant from being sacrificed by a Satanic cult led by her murderous ex (Burke), with spitfire Heard and "The Accountant" (Fichtner should be charged with grand larceny for his scene stealing) in tow. While the 3D is lousy and the connect-the-dots screenplay by Todd Farmer  who co-wrote with director Patrick Lussier  the film is still cheesy good bad B-movie camp.
THE ARTIST (2011) **** Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, Missi Pyle, James Cromwell, Malcolm McDowell, Uggie The Dog. Wonderful valentine to the silent film era from French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius about Hollywood star George Valentin (Dujardin, channeling Douglas Fairbanks, John Barrymore and Errol Flynn) facing a career pitfall with the advent of sound and encountering invigorating rising starlet Peppy Miller (the beguiling Bejo, Hazanavicius' real-life wife and dead-ringer for Natalie Wood) who may be his saving grace. Captured with brilliant production design by Laurence Bennett and gorgeously shot by Guillaume Schiffman in scintillating black and white evoking the silent era to perfection. Glamorous and hear-felt with genuine pathos and peppered with enough knowing laughs (thanks largely to Uggie The Dog as Valentin's constant companion) the film is a masterpiece about movie-making and the magic of the movies. One of the year's best and a must see for cinemaniacs!
SELMA (2014) ***1/2 David Oyleowo, Carmen Ejogo, Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Giovanni Ribisi, Oprah Winfrey, Martin Sheen, Dylan Baker, Tessa Thompson, Lorraine Toussaint, Common, Wendell Pierce, Niecy Nash, Andre Holland, Stephan James, Omar J. Dorsey, Nigel Thatch, Jeremy Strong. Excellent depiction of Martin Luther King Jr.'s epic take on the Civil Rights Movement and the titular firestorm march on Alabama amidst racial strife and a heel-dragging LBJ administration. Oyleowo uncannily sounds like the late leader and gives a powerful Oscar-worthy turn as does Ejogo as his long-suffering better half Corretta Scott King. Novice screenwriter Paul Webb and rookie director Ava DuVernay make a fine team in breathing life into a historical moment that resonates even more today with a rippling effect of social conscience to mainstream injustice.
THE ILLUSIONIST (2006) ***1/2 Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel, Rufus Sewell, Eddie Marsan. Absorbing adaptation of Steven Millhauser's short story about a turn-of-the-century Vienna based magician (Norton, giving another fantastic implosive turn) whose spectacular feats prove to be nothing but a plague for the jealous, and petulant crown prince (a seethingly good Sewell) and the triangle involving his childhood sweetheart and current duchess-to-be (beguiling Biel), with the town's chief inspector (Giamatti, giving another great performance as well) also caught between truth and justice. Adapted and directed by Neil Burger with deftness and aplomb and the uncanny knack of making the viewer breathless and on the-edge-of-one's-seat, the film has a beautiful production design by Ondrej Nekvasil, gorgeous cinematography by Dick Pope, ethereal music by Philip Glass and astounding visual effects by Vujtir Nykker and special effects by Ondrej Pryca that creates some jaw- dropping tricks leaving you stumped.
THE SKIN I LIVE IN (2011) **1/2 Antonio Banderas, Elena Anaya, Marisa Peredes, Jan Cornet, Roberto Alamo, Barbara Lenni, Susi Sanchez. Filmmaker Pedro Almodovar's latest examination of sexual politicas is a doozy: mad doctor Banderas (the 'other' muse of the director, in a return-to-form performance) whose obsession  literally  with a new synthetic skin experiment upon a very unusual case patient  the young man who raped his daughter!  is driven to his insanity. Almodovar provides the usual melodramatics with echoes of "EYES WITHOUT A FACE" and 'flesh for fantasy' auteurs Cronenberg, Lynch, Hitchcock and any Univision telenovella may have gone too far in its agent provocateur of aforementioned rape, sexual mores, borderline torture porn and good old fashioned mind-f#*#ing. Best scene: Sexy Anaya's sudden giantess transformation via the good doctor's security camera allowing him to voyeur her zoom/loom moment!
AWAKE (2007) * Hayden Christensen, Jessica Alba, Terrence Howard, Lena Olin, Christopher McDonald, Sam Robards, Arliss Howard, Fisher Stevens, Georgina Chapman. Seriously try to stay awake in this snoozer thriller about a young well-to-do businessman (seriously miscast Christensen) whose heart condition leads to a necessary surgery and he winds up suffering from "anesthetic awareness" resulting in some seriously awful soap opera tangents involving a conspiracy to murder him (!) Awful dialogue and some truly laughable moments; the biggest sin is not following through on the real premise of someone horrifically experiencing their own operation. (Dir: Joby Harold)
OBSERVE AND REPORT (2009) *** Seth Rogen, Ray Liotta, Michael Pena, Anna Faris, Dan Bakkedahl, Jesse Plemons, John Yuan, Matt Yuan, Celia Weston, Collette Wolfe, Randy Gambill, Aziz Ansari, Patton Oswalt, Danny McBride. Uproariously dark comedy from filmmaker Jody Hill featuring Rogen (side-splittingly hilarious) as a seriously troubled mall security guard who takes his position way too seriously and sees his chance at redemption in ending a pervert's flashing on the grounds at any cost. A game cast (all hail Faris as Rogen's ill-conceived paramour du jour, a bleach blonde cosmetics bimbo) in this vulgar and at times troubling comedy that has undercurrents of drama (Rogen is a self-described bi-polar type) that make for some uncomfortable moments of mirth including some painful slapstick (Rogen's assault with his squad on some hellion skateboard rats is one for the time capsule) but despite the bad taste in may leave in some's collective thought processes, it is definitely an out-there blend of "PAUL BLART: MALL COP" meets "TAXI DRIVER" (reportedly Hill's inspiration).
LAW ABIDING CITIZEN (2009) **1/2 Jamie Foxx, Gerard Butler, Colm Meaney, Bruce McGill, Leslie Bib, Michael Irby, Gregory Itzin, Regina Hall, Viola Davis, Richard Portnow. Over-the-top guilty pleasure-inducing vengeance thriller with Butler out for some justifiable payback for the monstrously brutal murders of his family (ok, a decade later, but stick with it) and playing cat-and-mouse with stubborn ADA Foxx as he scrambles to figure out how he is doing it from behind bars! Echoes of DEATH WISH, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and SAW for its 'torture porn' methods, the film finally runs on fumes in the final act (if you can't guess by then how Butler is doing what he is doing maybe film going isn't for you?) but credit Kurt Wimmer's sly screenplay and some nifty bang/boom/shudder set pieces by director F.Gary Gray keeps things chugging along before derailing into eye-rolling incredulity.
CLOSED CIRCUIT (2013) * Eric Bana, Rebecca Hall, Ciaran Hinds, Jim Broadbent, Riz Ahmed, Julia Stiles, Anne-Marie Duff. Dull as dirt 'courtroom thriller' concerning a terrorist act that has Brit barristers Bana and Hall, former lovers, (sadly with zip chemistry) paired to try the defense with finding themselves getting more than they bargained for. Has the feel of a Joe Esterhaus late '90s conspiracy pot-boiler (without the sex or dynamism). Boredom from the get-go no thanks to a water-logged screenplay by Steven Knight and pedestrian direction from John Crowley. And a completely laughable turn by Stiles as a NY Times investigative reporter. Just plain awful.
ALL IS LOST (2013) ***1/2 Robert Redford gives a solid performance as a solitary man at sea whose yacht faces imperceptible odds after colliding with a downed shipping container in filmmaker J.C. Chandor's taut, lean film study of literally a calm before the storm with his silent character (and film for that matter) remains a force to be reckoned with in spite of the odds and his calm, non-panic aplomb by improvising at every given turn he must face with a grim horizon looming. With the elements and sudden changes set upon him, Redford (in his 70s now) is amazing (having done practically all the physical grunt work himself; reportedly losing hearing in one ear due to water pressure hoses during production!) and a testament of what a film star can do with limited tricks of the trade: presence.
SAFE HOUSE (2012) ***1/2 Denzel Washington, Ryan Reynolds, Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson, Sam Shepard, Ruben Blades, Nora Arnezeder, Robert Patrick, Liam Cunningham, Joel Kinnaman, Fares Fares. Excellent action thriller with Washington in fine form as an ex-CIA agent 'way-off-the-reservation' whose seemingly traitorous methods find him in the titular holding of green agent Reynolds (equally good) who is in over his head trying to do the right thing before they're both killed. Filmed with breakneck outta nowhere elan by newcomer Daniel Espinosa and a lean, gritty screenplay by David Guggenheim, the film runs on all cylinders with its brash, kinetic energy leavened by editor Richard Pearson and filmed gorgeously by cinematographer Oliver Wood gives the high-octane flick a notch higher up than the usual genre bang-bang.
FRUITVALE STATION (2013) ***1/2 Michael B. Jordan, Melonie Diaz, Octavia Spencer, Ariana Neal. Absorbing account of the last day in the life of ex-con Oscar Grant (riveting Jordan), an Oakland, California family man attempting to go straight in spite of his past and inner turmoil to do the right thing which inevitably lead to his killing by a transit police after an altercation on a train post New Year's Eve celebrations. Newcomer Ryan Coogler - who wrote and directed - manages to convey a young man's plight when the deck is so stacked against his best intentions in sadly a tale too often proved to be true in this day and age. An indie gem to seek out to see.
DOM HEMINGWAY (2014) *** Jude Law, Richard E. Grant, Demian Bichir, Emilia Clarke, Kerry Condon, Madalina Diana Ghenea, Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, Jordan A. Nash, Jumayn Hunter. Law has a field day chomping at the bit as a vulgar ex-con recently sprung from the joint looking to get back at his old ways including payback from keeping quiet and a possible reconnection with his estranged daughter. As the titular reprobate Law is a sight to see with his fierce muttonchops, Cockney accent and gnashing teeth at anyone within arm's length with a gleam in his eye and perhaps a soul lurking beneath his venal disposition. Able support by Grant as one of his back-in-the-day partners in crime and Bichir as the still-waters-run-deep employer who has more than enough for the safe-cracker to get his teeth into. Written and directed by Richard Shepard the film only falters in attempting to cool Dom's jets just as he's getting his sea legs back yet the performance of a lifetime is worth the price of admission, lock, stock and barrel.
FEAST (2006) *** Navi Rawat, Krista Allen, Balthazar Getty, Judah Friedlander, Jenny Wade, Duane Whitaker, Josh Zuckerman, Eileen Ryan, Clu Gulager, Henry Rollins, Anthony Criss, Eric Dane, Diane Goldner, Jason Mewes. Bloody good old-fashioned creature feature B-movie horror flick about a rag-tag group of miscreants in a no-man's land ramshackle bar forced to fend for themselves against a group of ravenous monsters with nothing but their wits about them. Funny, fast-paced and ultimately a guilty-pleasure endeavor that is highly entertaining for its bare-bones low-budget mentality (thanks in large part to this being the final chapter in the reality TV series Project Greenlight which showcased the production), tongue-thru-cheek humor and buckets of gore, blood and slime (the screenplay by newbies Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton and the big-screen directorial debut of John Gulager, son of veteran character actor Clu who has a supporting role, acquits himself of all his dubiousness with some inventive camera-work and making the most out of the least) mixes the chills and comedy with deft aplomb owing a great deal to "Alien", "The Thing" and any Romero zombie flick yet it is a cult classic in the making; too bad drive-ins are all but obsolete to experience the grindhouse schlock to full affect.
PSYCHO (1960) **** Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, John McIntire, Simon Oakland. The granddaddy of all slasher films and serial killers, this Alfred Hitchcock classic defined the post-Cold War horror film for generations to come in this rather simple storyline: bank employee Marion Crane (Leigh) absconds with a client's bankroll and winds up the proverbial fly in the spider's parlor when she winds up in the middle-of- nowhere's Bates Motel, and mama's boy Norman Bates (Perkins in his iconic role) proving to be more than meets the eye. The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!) by Geroge Tomasini, Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins score and the all-together ookie finale are American classics in every sense of the word. Best line: "Mother isn't , what's the term? Herself today".
JERSEY BOYS (2014) *** John Lloyd Young, Vincent Piazza, Michael Lomenda, Erich Bergen, Christopher Walken, Joseph Russo, Renee Marino, Mike Doyle, Freya Tingley. Big-screen adaptation of the smash Broadway musical biopic about '60s rock and roll quartet The Four Seasons' rags-to-riches ascent to a worldwide phenom largely due to lead singer Frankie Valli (Young reprising his Great White Way role eerily channeling the real deal) and the combative nature of the group over the years. Filmmaker Clint Eastwood manages to mix old school Hollywood melodrama with an almost fairytale like quality of The American Dream and the hard- work and struggle for better things with risk and sacrifice. Well produced (you actually FEEL like you are in a time warp!) and the songs make up for some of the flat-footed dialogue by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice's transition from stage to screen and at-times the broad strokes with the characters border lining stereotypical parody yet works in the long run. Go for the songs, better yet see the musical too.
INTO THE STORM (2014) *** Richard Armitage, Sarah Wayne Callies, Matt Walsh, Max Deacon, Nathan Kress, Alycia Debnam Carey, Arlen Escarpeta, Jeremy Sumpter, Lee Whittaker, Kyle Davis, Jon Repp, Scott Lawrence, David Drumm. Visual effects extravaganza disaster thriller about a freak tornado occurrence threatening to wipe out a small Midwestern town with a team of storm chasers tracking the oncoming weather phenomenon while encountering the local populace. Filmmaker Steven Quale manages to keep the verisimilitude effect in full force in spite of the hamstrung rather predictable screenplay by John Swetnam. The largely unknown cast is buoyed by better known Callies and Walsh as the bickering team of trackers while the ensemble is game enough while all hell is breaking loose. Again the wizardly jaw-dropping effects are the true stars here as anticipated and makes TWISTER look like a student film.
THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM (2007) *** Matt Damon, Joan Allen, Julia Stiles, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Paddy Considine, Albert Finney. Crowd-pleasing final chapter (or is it?) in the amnesiac assassin CIA op Jason Bourne (Damon reprising his iconic role with élan) zeroing in on how he became the person he was  and more importantly who he was before he became that way  with his globe-trotting to come to full closure by any means necessary. Reunited with director Paul Greengrass, who incorporates his vertigo-inducing camera-work by Oliver Wood and nausea-inducing hyperkinetic editing by Christopher Rouse and a crackling good screenplay by Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns and Tony Gilroy cappers off Robert Ludlum's laconic/empathetic killing machine with skill and verve (and one helluva NYC based car chase).
LINCOLN (2012) ***1/2 Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, John Hawkes, James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, Jared Harris, Jackie Earle Haley, Bruce McGill, Joseph Cross, Lee Pace, Peter McRobbie, Gulliver McGrath, Gloria Reuben, Jeremy Strong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Boris McGiver, David Costabile, Stephen Spinella, Walton Goggins, Lukas Haas, S.Epatha Merkerson. Steven Spielberg's years-in-the- making-Herculean effort historical biopic focusing on President Abraham Lincoln's second term enmeshed in the bloodshed of The Civil War and his impassioned plea for getting the 13th Amendment passed by an impenetrable Congress while dealing with family issues and a war-torn nation is buoyed by an uncanny, low-key staid turn by Day Lewis who embodies the iconic presence and innate humanity to the 16th President of the United States with an undercurrent of humor, folksy wisdom and sharp, alacrity disarming his opponents with stealth élan. The film itself is a tad anemic and bloodless with one rival politician trying to top himself in the mandates at hand yet is timeless in depicting just that - the arrogance of governing bodies with a clean screenplay adaptation by Tony Kearns based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book "Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"). Kudos to veteran composer John Williams' gently coaxed score, handsome cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and epic makeup effects in concocting Day Lewis as Honest Abe. Spielberg as always delivers the goods and while not a classic it is still a must see for historic buffs and those who still want to see democracy in action carried out for the better and common good.
FRANCES HA (2013) ***1/2 Greta Gerwig, Mickey Sumner, Adam Driver, Michael Zegen, Grace Gummer, Charlotte d'Amboise, Michael Esper, Patrick Heusinger, Josh Hamilton, Britta Phillips, Juliet Rylance, Dean Wareham, Maya Kazan. Echoes of Woody Allen's MANHATTAN ring out in this funny, romantic comedy of errors involving Gerwig (at her most socially awkward and her generation's Diane Keaton) whose flibbertigibbet titular heroine finds herself attempting to deal with her fledgling career as a modern dancer in NYC while coming to grips with her super close relationship with her bestie Sumner (a true revelation) who is all in tense and purposes her soulmate (w/o the lesbian angle). Fresh, sharp, witty and too-close-to-the-bone screenplay by Gerwig and filmmaker Noah Baumbach who collaborated on the script with her allows a showcase for her warts-and-all persona and surrounds her with some quirky, fun-loving characters including Zegen as one of her rich roomies (he steals the film). Gorgeous black and white cinematography by Sam Levy gives the film a timeless quality. Best scenes: Frances' run thru the streets with David Bowie's "Modern Love" on the soundtrack and her wonderful speech on realizing what love really is. A gem.
LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA (2006) *** ½ Ken Watanabe, Kazunari Ninomiya, Tsuyoshi, Ihara, Ryo Kase, Shido Nakamura, Hiroshi Watanabe, Takumi Bando, Yuki Matsuzaki, Takashi Yamaguchi, Eijiro Ozaki, Mark Moses, Roxanne Hart. Clint Eastwood's powerful bookend to his earlier released  but shot in union with  "Flags of Our Fathers"  depicts the conflicts of our enemy, the Japanese, and the viewpoint of their struggle during WWII in arguably the bloodiest battle and turning point for the war, focusing on several characters including General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (stoically interpreted by Watanbe)  whose letters home to his family (among other Japanese soldiers)  inspired the book the screenplay by Iris Yamashita and Paul Haggis adapted with finesse. Powerful but again the pacing is a bit logy and some editing would've helped but again why quibble as Eastwood continues to age like a fine wine as a master craftsman filmmaker.
EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE (2011) **1/2 Thomas Horn, Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Max von Sydow, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, John Goodman, Zoe Caldwell. Post-9/11 melodrama is the backdrop for this at-times maddening adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel about an adolescent with borderline-Asperger's syndrome (newcomer Horn) who attempts to cope with his grief in the aftermath of losing his father (Hanks in flashbacks) in the WTC attacks  by embarking on a journey to unravel the mystery of a key he believe will lead to something of significance. Directed with some hamfistedness by the usually adept Stephen Daldry (his use of the 'falling man' imagery of 9/11 is rather infuriating) the film is buoyed equally by the frequently obnoxious protagonist preciousness that makes you want to shake him instead of hugging him in spite of his situation. Von Sydow delivers a memorably mute turn as the possible long-lost grandfather who is the 'tenant' of Horn's grandmother across the way.
THE SITTER (2011) ** Jonah Hill, Max Records, Ari Graynor, Landry Bender, Kevin Hernandez, Sam Rockwell, JB Smoove, Jessica Hecht, Bruce Altman, Erin Daniels, DW Moffatt, Reggie Alvin Green. Disappointing high-concept comedy homage to '80s 'babysitting' comedies ala UNCLE BUCK and ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING with slacker Noah Griffith (Hill, who also served as producer) meeting his match in the diminutive forms of his trio of charges and winds up in a memorably hellish evening involving the crazy girl (Graynor, seeming to have a cottage industry and the market covered with ditzy imbibing bimbos) he's 'involved' with and an off-beat drug dealer (Rockwell attempting to channel Joe Pantoliano's 'Guido the Killer Pimp' from RISKY BUSINESS). One-time indie flavor-of-the-month David Gordon Green may have attempted to tap into his inner John Hughes but the shaky screenplay by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka feels at best a first draft that somehow got greenlit. It doesn't help when producer Hill actually thinks the audience will buy another outlandish premise (the hottie  Daniels  falling for the slob) that feels half-baked at best.
STREET KINGS (2008) ** Keanu Reeves, Forest Whitaker, Hugh Laurie, Chris Evans, Martha Higareda, Jay Mohr, John Corbett, Amaury Nolasco, Cedric The Entertainer, Terry Crews, Naomie Harris, The Game, Common, Cle Shaheed Sloan. Amalgam of "Dark Blue", "Training Day", "Harsh Realm" and "LA Confidential" largely due to director David Ayer's going to the well once too many (he penned the first three and directed the third) in this sophomore effort as auteur and with a hodgepodge screenplay by James Ellroy (the author of the fourth film mentioned) and Kurt Wimmer and Jamie Moss, winds up a been-there-done-that retread of a bad LA cop (Reeves at his most surprisingly wooden here) finally seeing the light of the worse cops he's associating with which leads to a trail of murder within the ranks, a set-up (or three) and some truly histrionic brow-slappers that have you wondering how he became a detective in the first place. What does work is the sharp editing by Jeffrey Ford with the action peppered with just enough juice to sustain this barely plausible pot-boiler.
R.I.P.D. (2013) * Jeff Bridges, Ryan Reynolds, Kevin Bacon, Mary-Louise Parker, Stephanie Szostak, James Hong, Marisa Miller, Robert Knepper, Mike O'Malley. DOA - Woeful mashup of MEN IN BLACK meets GHOST BUSTERS attempt at a new sci-fi/comedy franchise based on a comic book by Peter M. Lenkov about an elite supernatural crime fighting force (Rest In Peace Department, get it?) with recently killed-in-the-line-of-fire cop Reynolds teamed up with Old West peace officer Bridges (channeling his Rooster Cogburn with a mouthful of gravel; seriously he's barely comprehensible and I love Bridges but whoa; really bad choice here to go with that) to, what else, save the world from nefarious 'dead-os' (evil dead). Yeah I know. The hackneyed screenplay by Phil Haym Matt Manfredi & David Dobkin delivers no laughs, character development or entertainment and the D-grade level CGI is dreadfully cheesy (do we really need TWO obese 'dead-os'? The monstrosities here are just monstrously tediously terrible). Robert Schwentke is responsible for the reprehensible 'direction'. Truly one of the worst films of the year.
AWAY WE GO (2009) **** John Krasinski, Maya Rudolph, Carmen Ejogo, Catherine O'Hara, Jeff Daniels, Allison Janney, Jim Gaffigan, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Josh Hamilton, Chris Messina, Melanie Lynskey. Winning comedy/drama with Krasinski & Rudolph  perfectly cast  as a young couple of intellectuals whose impending birth of their first child has them navel gazing and wondering the best avenue of raising them by going on a road trip visiting family and friends, discovering there are no easy short-cuts and plenty of pit-falls along the bumpy ride into the heart's wonderings. The sharply funny and smart screenplay by writers Dave Eggers & Vendela Vida provide many moments for the protagonists to mingle with some odd and perhaps bleak outlets to parenthood and life in general. Director Sam Mendes wisely lets the comic cards fall where they may with his gifted leads and inspired ensemble. One of the year's best films and one of the best on relationships in general.
FUNNY GAMES (2008) ½ * Naomi Watts, Tim Roth, Michael Pitt, Brady Corbet, Devon Gearhart, Boyd Gaines, Siobhan Fallon, Robert LuPone.Loathsome depiction of American complacency and American audience's bystanding voyeurism.An atypical upper-middle class family driving to their idyllic summer home instead takes a nightmare detour into this sadistic depiction of American complacency and is an assault on American bystanding voyeurism thanks to filmmaker Michael Haneke's virtual shot-by-shot remake of his 1997 European version (no didn't see it nor even had heard of it).The family, Ann, George and their young son, Georgie (Watts  who executive produced this crap!, Roth and Gearhart), are setting up for a weekend of sailing fun during a picture perfect summertime get-together when it all comes crashing to a gut-wrenching halt when their neighbors' 'guests' Paul and Peter (Teutonic Pitt and Corbet, poster children for The Master Race) stop by first to borrow some eggs and then begin a reign of terror by torturing the unsuspecting family that leads to a night of horror : they bet they won't survive the evening's plans of debauchery.I get what Haneke wants to get across and shove down our throats but I ain't swallowing it. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen and I loathed every minute of it. That was torture enough! To have to describe every creepy nasty moment is a disservice to those who want their entertainment just that : entertaining.All I can say is I hated his other 'acclaimed' film CACHE and this just makes me hate Haneke even more; I won't be fooled again when he has his next project unleashed into theaters; neither should you!
THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES (2013) *** Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes, Bradley Cooper, Rose Byrne, Harris Yulin, Ray Liotta, Mahershala Ali, Ben Mendelsohn, Robert Clohessy, Bruce Greenwood, Emory Cohen, Dane DeHaan. Well acted character study with a novelization approach from filmmaker Derek Cianfrance - who collaborated on the screenplay with Ben Coccio and Darius Marder - enables three acts concerning the tapestry of a motorcyclist-cum- bank robber (Gosling, who teamed with Cianfrance previously for "Blue Valentine", is excellent) after learning a one-night stand (Mendes acquitting herself nicely too) has produced a child to raise; a morally-challenged policeman (Cooper, in a wonderful balance of right and wrong) with aspirations and consequences beyond his realm; and the offspring of the two men years later with echoes of Steinbeck and O'Neill. Well-crafted if a tad too long in structure the film rolls along at a decent pacing with some sublime performances and a great ensemble including the low-key Mendelsohn and a return-to-form by Liotta as a corrupt cop.
PARANORMAL ACTIVITY (2009) (zero stars!) Hugely overrated 'horror' film about an annoying young couple (egregiously acted by Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat) find they are being haunted and instead of leaving their apartment, decide to record the events on the ever-present video camera that acts as a surrogate for the audience since it cannot even begin to depict some truly scary moments (Not.One!) Novice filmmaker Oren Peli resorts to loud, thumping noises off-screen and grainy night-vision sub-par visuals that the end result is headache-inducing inanity. One of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure of watching in its entirety!
LABOR DAY (2014) *** Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin, Gattlin Griffith, Tobey Maguire, Tom Lipinski, Maika Monroe, Clark Gregg, James Van Der Beek, JK Simmons, Brooke Smith, Brighid Fleming, Alexie Gilmore. Jason Reitman's adaptation of Joyce Maynard's dramatic love story set in 1987 about a recently divorced, downward spiraling into depression woman (Winslet, sublimely perfect) and tween son (Griffith) who encounter a fugitive (Brolin acquitting himself nicely) who presses upon staying with them thru the titular three day holiday weekend to avoid the authorities while discovering there are more than one thing that meets the eyes for all the principals involved. While the acting is very good the storyline is at times telegraphed for an all- too-knowing climax and anti-climax too boot yet well worth the viewing even if it is for its much ballyhooed peach pie making sequence meant to rival the clay-sculpture sensuality of "GHOST" (it isn't close).
IRON MAN 2 (2010) *** Robert Downey, Jr., Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L. Jackson, Clark Gregg, John Slattery, Jon Favreau, Paul Bettany (voice), Leslie Bibb, Garry Shandling. Downey returns in fine form as Tony Stark AKA super hero IRON MAN in this serviceable yet streamlined sequel to the franchise that has more hits-than-misses yet manages to keep its tongue-in-cheek screwball comedy underpinnings intact. This time Stark is facing two significant threats: Russkie sociopathic physicist Ivan Vanko (Rourke in top-notch menacing mode echoing Charles Bronson) whose life-long grudge against the industrialist has reached its head  and weaselly competition Justin Hammer (bantam Rockwell milking every oily turn he can)  and a threat to the global peace he has managed to uphold with his alter ego. Adding fuel to the fire are daddy issues, a diminishing heart source and doubling his pleasure with amiable administrative assistant/right-hand-babe/squeeze Pepper Potts (the lush Paltrow) and newcomer to the fold Natalie Rushman (curvaceous-to-a-fault Johansson) AKA Black Widow) while contemplating Nick Fury's (Jackson reprising his bad-ass/eye-patched hero) offer. Favreau's fluid direction (and comic side-kick theatrics) punctuates the familiar tropes yet one feels some punches may have been pulled (i.e. Cheadle is largely wasted in taking over Terrence Howard's "Rhodey"/WarMachine and the final confrontation is frankly too quickly resolved). But fans will be chomping at the bit for the next installment and/or the promising-to-happen AVENGERS flick.
JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH : 3-D (2008) *** Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson, Anita Briem, Seth Meyers, Jean Michael Pare, Jane Wheeler, Giancarlo Caltabiano. Goofy fun and wicked cool 3-D visual effects make Jules Verne's classic novel a 21st century thrill ride when scientist Fraser takes his nephew Hutcherson to try to find his missing father who disappeared while attempting to locate a source to the titular locale by employing guide Briem and finding just that! Director Eric Brevig makes a decent debut as a filmmaker (previously a visual effects wiz which adds to the charm here) who wisely uses the novel as literally a guideline/map into discovering all the wonders/dangers of the underworld with impressive 3-D technology to boot. Fun for the whole family even if it cribs liberally from INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and JURASSIC PARK.
SOMEWHERE (2010) ** Stephen Dorff, Elle Fanning, Chris Pontious, Lala Sloatman, Ellie Kemper, Michelle Monaghan (cameo: Benicio Del Toro) Sofia Coppola's almost decidedly existential look at celebrity showcases Johnny Marco (Dorff, the poor man's Kiefer Sutherland), a popular film star whose life is in transit most of the time until he is saddled with his lovely adolescent daughter (Fanning, Dakota's little sis) who proves to be the sole meaning for his life (and soul meaning) in this meandering, listless narrative that gets old fast where nothing seems to be happening and yet everything is (get it?) While I applaud the talented filmmaker for sticking to what she knows she needs to get out of her comfort zone of just that and try something I don't know, more meaningful? Frustratingly good but not great filmmaking on display.
IRON MAN 3 (2013) ***1/2 Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall, Ben Kingsley, Jon Favreau, James Badge Dale, Stephanie Szostak, William Sadler, Dale Dickey, Ty Simpkins, Miguel Ferrer, (Voice of Paul Bettany). Third time's the charm in the indefatigable Marvel Comics' superhero franchise with Tony Snark (er, Stark - Downey in smart mode) facing the pitfalls of THE AVENGERS' after-math with an international terrorist, The Mandarin (Kingsley), out to destroy America with the help of genius bioengineer Pearce who has a personal ax to grind with Stark and his main squeeze Pepper Pots (Paltrow having more to do thankfully and with pithy aplomb). More wows and guffaws thanks to loosey-goosey direction by Shane Black (who collaborated on the fun and fast screenplay with Drew Pearce) and some nicely attuned set pieces (my fave, the hairy "Barrel of Monkeys" free-fall). Buckle up!
THE GREY (2012) ***1/2 Liam Neeson, Durmot Mulroney, Dallas Roberts, Frank Grillo, Nonso Anozie, Ben Bray, James Badge Dale, Anen Openshaw. When a chartered airplane of oil refinery workers crashes in the middle of a wintry Alaskan no-man's land, it's up to hired sharpshooter Neeson (never better) to forge ahead with the handful of survivors to safety before they're killed by a marauding pack of wolves. While filmmaker Joe Carnahan does a credible job of adapting with Ian Mackenzie Jeffers (based on his short story "Ghost Walker") the film feels cribbed from "DELIVERANCE", " ALIVE" and "THE EDGE" with its band of men facing the natural world's terrors awaiting them (and kudos to master F/X & make-up maven Gregory Nicotero for some truly awesome wolves) but wisely anchors the surprising poignancy with his lead actor Neeson (who in flashbacks of his ethereal wife Openshaw keeps his sanity and bearings intact) (emoting deeply perhaps echoing his loss of his wife Natasha Richardson) to do all the heavy lifting literally and metaphorically.
27 DRESSES (2008) **1/2 Katherine Heigl, James Marsden, Edward Burns, Malin Akerman, Judy Greer, Melora Hardin, Brian Kerwin. Heigl shines in this otherwise re-vamp of every rom-com of the past 20 years as an always-a-bridesmaid-never-a-bride single babe in NYC whose unrequited love for her clueless yet well-meaning boss (Burns) faces the ultimate challenge when her younger, trouble-making sister (Akerman), woos and wins him over with the clock racing and to make matters worse a jaundiced wedding columnist (Marsden equally charismatic) who may or may not be the one for her. The screenplay by Aline Brosh McKenna is nothing too special and Anne Fletcher's predictable direction plods on the long-form but her actors make up for it in spades.
FROST/NIXON (2008) ***1/2 Frank Langella, Michael Sheen, Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell, Matthew Macfadyen, Kevin Bacon, Rebecca Hall, Toby Jones. Ron Howard's skillful direction of Peter Morgan's smash play about the famous televised interviews conducted by British personality David Frost and United States President Richard Nixon (played to the hilt exquisitely by Sheen and Langella) comes across as a sharply executed clash of the titans with the expertly timed thrusts and parries of their conversational hours comprised for the world to see in all its infamous glory is a job well done. While much has been fictionalized one cannot discount the two leads' uncanny portrayals of larger-than-life people in recent history and the two talented thesps eat up like bread on gravy. Truly remarkable thespianic displays fully realized.
MARGOT AT THE WEDDING (2007) ***1/2 Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jack Black, Zane Pais, Flora Cross, Ciaran Hinds, John Turturro. Filmmaker Noah Baumbach crafts his uneasy comedy of manners (or lack thereof) about the sibling rivalry of two sisters who drive one another crazy with the titular Margot (Kidman having a field day) arriving for the forthcoming nuptials of her kid sister Pauline (Jason Leigh, Mrs. Baumbach, giving as good as receiving her guest) in her unlikely bonding with slacker Black (in fairly low-key comic form). The scathing putdowns and rudeness is balanced by the deep love the characters actually have for one another but a little goes a long way yet the comedy is witty and sharp enough to cut to the quick.
VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA (2008) ***1/2 Javier Bardem, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Penelope Cruz, Patricia Clarkson, Kevin Dunn, Chris Messina. Woody Allen returns to form in this sexy/crazy/cool rom-com set in the exotique Barcelona where 2 Americans abroad (Johansson and Hall) are seduced by a rakish Spanish artiste (Bardem having a blast) only to become involved with a tangled relationship with his unbalanced ex-wife (Cruz, a lock for Best Supporting Actress, in one of her finest performances to date) in their bohemian lifestyle. Funny, smart, shrewd and neurotic  all Allen trademarks  with the European flavors at full force. The film only is demerited by the unwelcome narration by Christopher Evan Welch.
SABOTAGE (2014) **1/2 Arnold Schwarzenegger, Olivia Williams, Sam Worthington, Joe Manganiello, Josh Holloway, Terrence Howard, Max Martini, Kevin Vance, Mireille Enos, Martin Donovan, Harold Perrineau,Troy Garity. Relatively by-the-numbers action vehicle for Ah-nold (looking a tad rough-around-the-edges) as the leader of a co-op DEA command that find themselves under the microscope and possibly in the cross-hairs of a drug cartel oh and the titular work of one of their members too boot when a cache of stolen loot remains missing. Usual shoot 'em-up pyrotechniques and 'witticisms' thanks to a surprisingly flat-footed screenplay but director David Ayer (doing yeoman work at best) and Skip Woods wasting most of the talent cast, with only wild card Enos seeming to be enjoying her gig and Williams as a fellow fed investigating the murder-by-numbers of Arnie's outfit.
YOUR SISTER'S SISTER (2012) ***1/2 Mark Duplass, Emily Blunt, Rosemarie DeWitt. Funny, frank and keenly witted adult dramedy about two close friends - Duplass and Blunt - dealing with one common bond - grieving over the loss of his brother; her lover - and after a year finding out they are more than that only to have their budding romance infringed upon by her younger sister -DeWitt - a lesbian who has just walked out of a long-term relationship. Written and directed by Lynn Shelton with sharp and comic dialogue that feels very real and natural buoyed by the trifecta of her actors all shining in their own ways and avoiding the common tropes of Nice-Guy-Too-Good-To-Be-True-Romantic; Flibbertigibbet-Yet-Too-Pretty-To-Be-True-BFF; and Earthy-Spacey-Lesbian-Sister - above and beyond. One of the year's indie gems.
THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING (2014) *** 1/2 Eddie Redmayne, Felicity Jones, David Thewlis, Emily Watson, Simon McBurney. Excellently acted biopic about the brilliant British physicist Stephen Hawking and his young wife Jane (Oscar worthy Redmayne & Jones both perfect) who face the greatest challenge of their lives when he is sticker in the prime of their lives with his debilitating crippling illness - Lou Gehrig's disease - and the challenges they both encounter thru out their marriage and relationship of reliance, courage and dependence (as well as independence). Based on Jane's book, Anthony McCarten's adaptation and director James Marsh manage to condense two decades of a lifetime into one soluble storyline with clear-eyed faithfulness to the troubled marriage and ongoing struggles both physical and emotional they endured.
EAGLE EYE (2008) **1/2 Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Billy Bob Thornton, Rosario Dawson, Michael Chiklis, Anthony Mackie, Ethan Embry. Mashup conspiracy action thriller of "ENEMY OF THE STATE", any Bruckheimer/Bay collaboration, any Hitchcock 'wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time' scenario with a touch of "2001"'s malevolent HAL thrown in for good measure in this convoluted 21st century hodgepodge involving two strangers (LaBeouf and Monaghan doing their best to keep up with the lively yet ham-fisted pace by a screenplay credit to 4 scribes  John Glenn, Travis Wright, Hillary Seitz & Dan McDermott) thrown together by a mysterious voice (an uncredited Julianne Moore) instructing them in a deadly game of cat- and-mouse with, seemingly so, no end in sight. In spite of the adrenalized over-the-top histrionics director DJ Caruso manages to make its unlikely heroes thoroughly amiable enough in this popcorn crowd pleaser.
TAKEN (2009) ***1/2 Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Xander Berkeley, Katie Cassidy, Jon Gries, Leland Orser. Jean Claude Olivier. Excellent adrenaline pumping action/drama about former spook Neeson facing his ultimate nightmare: his teenager daughter (Grace) is kidnapped while traveling abroad in Paris by a white-slave trading outfit. Bad news for the bad guys as Neeson's amazing technical skills of survival and torture are given the full gamut in breezily executed sequences of vengeance and a father's anguished quest to save his child before the clock runs out. Paced with precise pockets of dread and unease by Pierre Morel thanks to a lively screenplay by filmmaker Luc Besson and collaborator Robert Mark Kamen, the film rockets along like a cruise missile and Neeson is no slouch proving his mettle as a lethal blunt instrument that would have Jason Bourne and James Bond bowing to his quick displays of cunning and execution.
TENACIOUS D : THE PICK OF DESTINY (2006) ** Jack Black, Kyle Gass, Jason Reed, Troy Gentile, Paul F. Tompkins, Amy Poehler, Fred Armisen, Tim Robbins. (Cameos : Ronnie James Dio, Meat Loaf, Ben Stiller, David Grohl) Black & Gass reprise their aliases  JB & KG AKA Tenacious D- in this so-so 'origin story' (i.e. how the duo got together)  in their musical quest of being the ultimate rock band by obtaining an unholy grail  the titular implement obtained from Satan Himself. Typical stoner comic fair and Black gives his usual gusto in this amusing take on all things rock and quest films like "Lord Of The Rings" which the comedy bases itself in . Fairly funny but strained at its ratty seams. (Dir: Liam Lynch)
SEMI-PRO (2008) ** Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson, Andre Benjamin, Maura Tierney, Andrew Daly, Will Arnett, Andy Richter, David Koechner, Rob Corddry, Matt Walsh, Jackie Earle Haley, Tim Meadows, DeRay Davis, Josh Braaten, Jay Phillips, Peter Cornell, Jason Sudeikis, Kristen Wiig, Ed Helms. More miss-than-hit send-up of basketball films comedy with Ferrell getting his ya-yas out in a ridiculous 'fro as Jackie Moon, a player/coach of the ill-fated ABA Flint Michigan Tropics who face their potentially last season after an announcement of the league ceding with, and the attempts by Moon to get his team into fourth place to gain access to NBA glory. The lackadaisical direction by Kent Alterman and an unnecessarily vulgar screenplay by Scot Armstrong only hinder a few strained laughs and a game ensemble of some of comedy's best-unsung performers.
TRAITOR (2008) *** Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Siad Taghmaoui, Neal McDonough, Jeff Daniels, Aly Khan, Archie Panjabi. Cheadle rises above the tricky storyline about a devout Muslim American who is caught between loyalty to his religion and his country when he is accused of terrorism in light of his affiliation as a government agent with some twists and turns of the screw in this potboiler of globe-trotting intrigue. The screenplay by novice director Jeffrey Nachmanoff  suggested by a story by none other than funnyman Steve Martin (!)  is somewhat knotty and a tad too preachy but overall brings some fresh perspective to the current world climate and has a "Bourne" appeal of an everyman in a nightmarish existence.
SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009) *** Robert Downey, Jr., Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong, Eddie Marsan. Rip-roaring re-imagining of the classic crime solver (Downey having a field day as the British super sleuth) and his long-suffering partner, Dr. John Watson (a nimble and nifty Law), this time teaming up against the nefarious Lord Blackwood (the formidable Strong), whose dabbling in the occult has Victorian England on its knees trembling. Filmmaker Guy Ritchie employs his usual bag of tricks (i.e. slo-mo camera) and a fun and fast screenplay by Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, Simon Kinberg & Lionel Wigram (phew!) keeps things lively and highly entertaining (too bad they pretty much waste the vibrantly appealing McAdams for the most part as a femme fatale/love interest for Holmes). But the impeccable production design by Sarah Greenwood, sharp editing by James Herbert and resiliently gritty cinematography by Philippe Rousselot cancels out any of the film's spottiness. Elementary, my dear viewerElementary Indeed!
MEN IN BLACK III (2012) *** Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Jemaine Clement, Emma Thompson, Michael Stuhlbarg, Mike Colter, Nicole Scherzinger, Michael Chernus, Alice Eve, David Rasche, Bill Hader. Surprisingly decent sequel to the hindered sci-fi comedy franchise, this time with the ever vigilant Agent J (Smith in his now iconic role) trying to save his ever- taciturn partner, Agent K (Jones actually seeming to have some fun!) from a time-tripping alien, Boris the Animal (Clement getting in touch with his inner bad-ass), seeking vengeance by offing the senior agent. While the familiar storyline entangles the old chestnut of time travel a la the BACK TO THE FUTURE flicks, the real proof-in-the-pudding is the ingenious casting of the dead-on accurate Brolin as the younger K with pitch-perfect mimicry (he's a hoot). The sprightly moving (and shockingly sweet-at-times) screenplay by Etan Cohen burns on its vapors by the climax but director Barry Sonnenfeld (in a blink-and-miss cameo) has returned to form with some vibrant mix of 3-D, special effects, fun camera work by Bill Pope, Danny Elfman's great score and again, Rick Baker's amazing creature special effects for a galaxy of aliens (look sharp for him in an even more fun cameo as a bulb-headed being with his trademark ponytail!)
DISTRICT 9 (2009) ***1/2 Fantastic sci-fi parable/mash-up of apartheid/"Alien Nation" meets "ID4" by way of "Enemy Mine" could easily have been the pitch for this shrewd morality tale cloaked in genre trappings: 20 years ago a tremendous mothership hovers over the area of South Johannesburg, South Africa, and its insectoid-like alien 'prawns' are discovered and eventually acclimated into a shantytown cum slum which leads to social unrest with the human populace demanding the unwelcome visitors to be re-located to the titular area run by a conglomerate that has other ideas in store  particularly for its unwitting, hapless drone (newcomer Sharlto Copley straddling the line of comedic sap and affable anti-hero), who finds himself a doomed pawn in their game plan. Executive produced by Peter Jackson and helmed by talented newcomer Neill Blomkamp (who co-scripted the tense, taut screenplay with Terri Tatchell), the seamless CGI of the aliens is truly remarkable and the uncanny parallels of recent history underscores the plight of the creatures at hand.
WIN WIN (2011) **** Paul Giamatti, Amy Ryan, Bobby Cannivale, Jeffrey Tambor, Melanie Lynskey, Alex Shaffer, Margo Martindale, Burt Young. Winning dramedy with Giamatti (gold!) as a small-town attorney/high school soccer coach trying to make ends meet when he assumes legal guardianship of his latest client (Young), deemed incapacitated by dementia and finds a secret weapon for his struggling athletic group in the old man's long-lost grandson (newcomer Shaffer, a real life athlete making a subtle debut). Actor-turned-filmmaker Tom McCarthy  who co-scripted the funny/witty/honest screenplay with Joe Tiboni - once again scores in this tailor-made for sad sack Giamatti (in one of his best roles) with a sweet ensemble (flinty yet loving Ryan as his wife, flighty yet well-meaning divorcée bud Cannivale and odd-duck assistant coach Tambor). A fine gem of an indie that hits all the right spots in entertaining fashion.
QUANTUM OF SOLACE (2008) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Judi Dench, Giancarlo Giannini, Gemma Arterton, Jeffrey Wright, David Harbour, Jesper Christensen. Excellent sequel to "CASINO ROYALE" picking up right from that film's end with James Bond (Craig brooding affectively again as 007) seeking vengeance for the death of his lover by intercepting an international plot to abscond with the world's supply of water by French corporate snake Dominic Greene (a suitably reptilian turn by Amalric) and teaming up with hottie Camille (smoldering Kurylenko), who also has a personal vendetta to meke out. Slam-bang action (the opening car chase is arguably one of the best ever committed to celluloid) with some great fight sequences, a hairy air and sea chase, and some death-defying set pieces (the final fiery climax is a dilly) which mark for a new blood into the venerable franchise (thanks to Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis & Robert Wade's mature script and skillful direction by the unlikely indie wunderkind Marc Forster). Kudos to the snappy editing by Matt Chesse and Richard Pearson.
RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION (2012) **1/2 Milla Jovovich, Sienna Guillory, Michelle Rodriguez, Aryana Engineer, Bingbing Li, Boris Kodjoe, Johann Urb, Robin Kasyanov, Ofilio Portilo, Oded Feher, Shawn Roberts. Fifth of the seemingly endless adaptation of the indefatigable video game series with the indestructible Alice (the always game player Jovovich) - borrowing Kate Beckinsale's catsuit apparel from the UNDERWORLD series - still fighting the evil Umbrella corporation with the usual high-octane pyrotecniques, ass-kicking and nasty beasties. In 3-D has the diorama apparel and a few thrown implements and viscera for good measure; otherwise missable.
MUPPETS MOST WANTED (2014) **1/2 Ricky Gervais, Ty Burrell, Tina Fey, Steve Whitmire, Eric Jacobson, Dave Goelz, Bill Barretta, David Rudman, Matt Vogel, Peter Linz (Cameos: Tony Bennett, Hugh Bonneville, Jemaine Clement, Sean Combs, Rob Corddry, Mackenzie Crook, Celine Dion, Lady Gaga, Zach Galifianakis, Josh Groban, Salma Hayek, Tom Hiddleston, Tom Hollander, Toby Jones, Frank Langella, Ray Liotta, James McAvoy, Chloe Grace Moretz, Usher Raymond, Miranda Richardson, Saorise Ronan, Til Schweiger, Danny Trejo, Stanley Tucci, Christoph Waltz) Everyone's beloved puppet troupe are back to tricks and shenanigans when Kermit finds himself being mistaken for an evil frog named Constantine who is in cahoots with their new manager (Gervais) in plotting a global jewel-heist plan while the Muppets are on a worldwide tour as their alibi. While somewhat scattershot in execution thanks to the hit and miss screenplay by James Bobin (who directed) and Nicholas Stoller, the amiable amphibian and friends still bring the entertainment to the hilt. The seemingly shrug-worthy 'cameos' are somewhat uninspired yet Burrell's Clousea-like Interpol agent and Fey's borscht-thick Russian accented gulag supervisor have their game faces on. Fun for the entire family and a new generation of Muppet-maniacs.
MANHATTAN (1979) **** Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Michael Murphy, Mariel Hemingway, Meryl Streep, Anne Byrne Hoffman, Wallace Shawn. A close tie for my all-time favorite Allen comedy thisclose to ANNIE HALL, in this almost follow up to, with Allen as Isaac Davis a chronic New York neurotic/comedy writer who is attempting to write his first book of fiction on what else, the titular city he lives and romanticizes the hell out of (to paraphrase), while dating a 17 year old (fresh-faced Hemingway) (!), he is distracted by his hateful day job as a TV skit writer, his lesbian ex-wife (Streep) threatening his manhood with a tell-all book of her own, and namely a flibbertigibbet from Philadelphia (Keaton, who scored an Oscar nod as Best Actress), who steals his heart in the process. Beautifully photographed in gorgeous b&w by veteran cinematographer Gordon Willis  who was criminally overlooked for a nomination!!!  the city never looked better and how can you not fall in love with it and/or the movie? Look sharp for Karen Allen (as a TV performer), Mark Linn-Baker and Frances Conroy (as Shakesperean actors), SNL veteran writer Michael O'Donoghue (at a swank party discussing orgasms!) and as herself, politico extraordinaire Bella Abzug.
KNOWING (2009) *R** Nicolas Cage, Chandler Canterbury, Rose Byrne, Lara Robinson, Ben Mendelsohn, D.G. Maloney, Nadia Townsend, Alan Hopgood, Lesley Anne Mitchell, Adrienne Pickering. Chill-inducing doomsday thriller with Cage (surprisingly low-key for the most part and quite affective too boot) as a professor who discovers the end days may be nigh when his son's school unearths a time capsule and the envelope he's been given contains a mysterious list of numbers that prove prophetic in disasters over the years. Well-directed by helmsman Alex Proyas with the right touch of humanity and special effects (the latter featuring some hairy accidents involving a plane crash and a runaway subway train will have you on the edge of your seat) thanks largely to the well-developed script by Ryne Douglas Pearson, Juliet Snowden & Stile White that has an intriguing biblical climax.
OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL (2013) **1/2 James Franco, Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, Zach Braff, Bill Cobbs, Joey King, Tony Cox, Abigail Spencer, Bruce Campbell. Visual effects resplendent prequel/origin story of how The Wizard of Oz came to be with Franco as the charlatan who attempts to win over the denizens of Oz in the crossfire hurricane of a trio of witches after surviving a twister from Kansas and crash landing in the mythical kingdom. With some nice nods to the original "Wizard of Oz" by filmmaker Sam Raimi having a field day with the special effects wizards the film lacks the warmth and characters to actually root for (among the new are a porcelain doll and a flying monkey, both a tad grating and winy) and Franco's turn is a tad too callow and smarmy instead of blustery and confident. While no instant classic the splendor in the eye candy make up for some of the missteps along the Yellow Brick Road.
THE GUILT TRIP (2012) **1/2 Barbra Streisand, Seth Rogen, Kathy Najimy, Miriam Margolyes, Rose Abdoo, Yvonne Strahovski, Colin Hanks, Brett Cullen, Nora Dunn, Adam Scott, Ari Graynor. Better-than-anticipated high concept comedy with Rogen as a scientific inventor attempting to pitch his once-in-a-lifetime product while embarking on a cross-country road trip with his smothering mother (Streisand) in tow. Relatively amiable comedy with predictable sitcom approach by Dan Fogelman's otherwise unremarkable screenplay and stale direction by rookie director Anne Fletcher (her big screen debut) is buoyed by the instant chemistry of its mother/son dynamic with Babs and Rogen having a field day with the matters at hand.
SUPERMAN (1978) **** Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, Margot Kidder, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Glenn Ford, Valerie Perrine, Trevor Howard, Phyllis Thaxter, Susannah York, Jeff East, Marc McClure. Look, up in the sky! It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's the greatest comic book adaptation to date about the classic superhero from Krypton, The Man of Steel AKA Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent (Reeve in his iconic breakthrough performance) who fights for Truth, Justice and the American Way while wooing scatterbrain fellow journalist Lois Lane (plucky Kidder) and battling evil mastermind criminal foe Lex Luthor (Hackman having the most fun on screen in his varied career). Directed with smart, shrewd craftsmanship by veteran helmsman Richard Donner and arguably the most rousing film score by genius composer John Williams, the film never fails to amaze me in its dazzling display of special effects and visual gee-whiz-idness (the latter won a Special Achievement Oscar while the former received a nod too). My favorite scenes: befuddled Kent looking for a phone booth to make his first on screen change into Supe and his subsequent derring do rescue of Lane from a plunging helicopter over Metropolis' bustling streets; and his heart- wrenching scream when he realizes he couldn't save her in another  prompting him to fly around the Earth so fast to change its orbit to go back in time to do just that! Just Super, Man!
ENEMY (2014) **1/2 Jake Gyllenhaal, Melanie Laurent, Sarah Gadon, Isabella Rossellini. Bizarre, creepy and ultimately nerve-wracking suspense sci-fi thriller with Gyllenhaal pulling double duty as a sad-sack history teacher who unexpectedly finds his doppleganger (again Gyllenhaal), a seedy third-rate film actor, who he winds up stalking and inevitably intertwining his life (and vice verse) with some serious f**ked up results that echo the two Davids - Lynch (to wit Rossellini as the first Jake's chilly mom) and Cronenberg (the film takes place in his native Canada). Based on Javier Gullon's novel the screenplay by Jose Saramago has a deliberately slow-paced to the point of numbness storyline while director Denis Villeneueve (who collaborated with Gyllenhaal on last year's PRISONERS) keeps the tension as taut as a spider's web (hint/spoiler alert: several arachnid metaphors and one truly heart- stopping ending that will haunt your dreams; thanks for that!) With an industrial drone score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans and a bruised palette by cinematographer Nicolas Bolduc keeps the film very bleak and captures the unhinging of its protagonists (and arguably its audience).
SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET (2007) **** Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jamie Campbell Bower, Jayne Wisener, Ed Sanders, Laura Michelle Kelly. Epic triumph by master filmmaker Tim Burton in bringing the Stephen Sondheim Broadway musical classic to the big screen and smartly re-uniting with frequent muse Depp (devilishly good here), as the titular tonsorial revenge seeker, a gentleman barber who was banished to prison for a framed crime overseen by a ruthlessly corrupt judge (Rickman at his slimiest), and is now back to his old neighborhood bloodthirsty for vengeance in the loss of his family by uniting forces with pie- maker Carter (equally impressive) by committing graphic murders and turning their prey into meat-pies (!) Ghastly Gran Guignol at its goriest overdone in bright, Technicolor old-school and a grand production design by the great Dante Ferretti, both tips of the hat to the great Hammer films of yore. The make-up by Nana Fischer's crew is top notch giving a funereal pallor to its leads underscoring their tragic existences. But kudos to Burton for having faith in his leads to actually sing on screen with great aclarity and emotion. One of the year's best.
HYDE PARK ON HUDSON (2012) **1/2 Bill Murray, Laura Linney, Samuel West, Olivia Colman, Elizabeth Marvel, Olivia Williams, Elizabeth Wilson. Rather bland but diverting enough account of the affair of FDR (gamely played by Murray) and his distant cousin Margaret Stuckley (Linney very low-key and perhaps miscast) whose arrival to his enclave during the 1939 visit of the King and Queen of England (West and Colman) is the soft center that holds the picture on high in this otherwise negligible, forgettable historical biopic. While Roger Michell gives his actors plenty of room to work there's a listlessness to the tone and Richard Nelson's pedestrian script may as well have had Murray and Linney reading aloud from the diary.
THE HITCHER (2007) ** Sean Bean, Sophia Bush, Zachary Knighton, Neal McDonough. Lackluster and unnecessary remake of the cult '80s Rutger Hauer slasher vehicle this time with a bland one-note Bean in the titular psychotic role whose cross-country odyssey of terror targets young lovers Bush (arguably the stupidest genre heroine in some time setting the bar considerably lower than her previous thespians) and Knighton, as the bad penny from Hell with a high body count and a low threshold for audience suffering in misery. The only thing worth mentioning are the bloody inventive ways Bean's sociopath manages to slip himself out of with unlikelihood at an all time high (or would that be low?) (Dir: Dave Meyers)
RESIDENT EVIL : AFTERLIFE (2010) **1/2 Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter, Wentworth Miller, Kim Coates, Shawn Roberts, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Spencer Locke, Boris Kodjoe, Sienna Guillory, Kacey Barnfield, Norman Yeung, Fulvio Cecere. Filmmaker Paul W.S. Anderson ratches up the adrenaline pumped up CGI action sequences in this otherwise bloodless entry to the lucrative video-game adaptation franchise this time with Jovovich's ass-kicking Alice (perhaps sci-fi's baddest heroine since Sigourney Weaver's "Ripley"?) is still up against the nefarious Umbrella Corporation's takeover in the post-apocalyptic zombie-virus infected globe with yet another rag-tag assembly of survivors (including Larter reprising her amiable and tough-as-nails sidekick) while coming to terms with her own mortality. The 3-D is fairly spectacular as are the aforementioned pulse-quickening set pieces but again more of the same-ol-same-ol (and leaps and bounds for another chapter opening).
JOHN DIES AT THE END (2013) **1/2 Chase Williamson, Rob Mayes, Paul Giamatti, Clancy Brown, Glynn Turman, Doug Jones, Daniel Roebuck, Fabianne Therese, Jonny Weston, Jimmy Wong, Allison Weissman. Gonzo-out-there-cult-classic/midnight movie in the making sci-fi comedy based on David Wong's book about two slackers whose dabbling with the supernatural as eradicators face their biggest challenge in a cosmic 'soy sauce' that heightens one's depth perception, memory and other psychological ramifications - including a parallel universe hellbent on - what else - taking over the Earth forever. Wildly inventive and a tailor-made for genre auteur Don Coscarelli who gets in touch with his inner Sam Raimi in the wacky visual effects cum fantasy world of HP Lovecraft in this happy mess of a hybrid that it's hit-or-miss kitchen-sink modus operandi will have you either hating it or love-to-hate it with tongue-thru- cheek machinations notwithstanding.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED? (2008) **1/2 Robert De Niro, Robin Wright Penn, Catherine Keener, Michael Wincott , Stanley Tucci, John Turturro, Kristen Stewart (as themselves: Bruce Willis and Sean Penn). Satirical comedy about a harried Hollywood producer (De Niro, surprisingly low- key), who is juggling a troubled post-production on a Sean Penn film with a difficult studio head (Keener at her ball-busting best) and an enfante terrible director (Wincott channeling Keith Richards); sex with his ex (Wright Penn); and attempting to coerce Willis (in a fun send- up of his image) to shave his bushy beard for his current production. Based on real-life film producer Art Linson's book (he also adapted the screenplay) and directed by Barry Levinson, it has more hits than misses yet its similar tone to De Niro/Levinson's "Wag the Dog" and "The Player" doesn't come as close for black comedy
X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST (2014) ***1/2 Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Nicholas Hout, Ellen Page, Shawn Ashmore, Peter Dinklage, Omar Sy, Evan Peters, Josh Helman, Daniel Cudmore, Bingbing Fan (Cameos: Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Kelsey Grammar) Ambitious chapter of the ongoing Marvel Comics' universe of the intrepidly fractious mutants who find themselves in the dark future against humans and an army of mutant-destoying giant robots (don't ask; just go with it) with a Hail-Mary pass plan involving Wolverine (the always world-weary yet game Jackman) sent back in time to re-assemble frenemies Professor X (McAvoy) and Magneto (Fassbender) with a few obstacles including a rogue Mystique (Lawrence reprising her role with relish) and the ever-determined inventor of their doom (Dinklage in low-key villain mode). Reunited with filmmaker Bryan Singer's singular vision and a strong script by fellow X writers Simon Kinberg, Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn keep things moving at a decent clip in spite of its groovy '70s era exposition and some fast and furious visual effects (among them future X'er 'Quicksilver' - a game Peters - shaking things up with his wicked fast speed to much welcome comic relief). Keep it going Marvel!
THOR: THE DARK WORLD (2013) *** Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Hopkins, Christopher Eccleston, Jaimie Alexander, Kat Dennings, Idris Elba, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asou, Rene Russo, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Stellan Skarsgard, Alice Krige, Chris O' Dowd, Jonathan Howard. (Cameos: Chris Evans, Stan Lee & Benicio Del Toro) Better-than-anticipated follow-up to the Marvel Comics big-screen adaptation of the Norse god cum superhero with the Teutonic hammersmith (Hemsworth reprising his iconic role) attempting to stop an evasive war between his world of Asgard by a vengeful elf (Eccleston under tons of prosthetic make-up) and Earth while still protecting his amour, physicist Portman. While the subcommittee of its screenplay (5 scribes are attributed) tends to get long-winded in the mythos of the sci-fi fantasy (and a wonky life-force that looks like a spilling of merlot!) the direction by Alan Taylor (and James Gunn, uncredited for the wait-to- the-end-credits-sneak-peak of the next installment) moves along and a sprinkling of humor is welcome amidst the over-the-top digital effects. And once again Hiddleston's Loki gleefully steals the film.
KICK-ASS (2010) **** Aaron Johnson, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Chloe Moretz, Nicolas Cage, Mark Strong, Lyndsy Fonseca, Clark Duke, Evan Peters, Dexter Fletcher, Xander Berkeley, Yancy Butler, Katrena Rochell, Kofi Natei, Elizabeth McGovern. "Superbad" directed by Quentin Tarantino could've easily been the pitch for this radically, graphic adaptation of the graphic novel series by Marvel Comics' Mark Millar & John Romita Jr. (who collaborated on the screenplay with Jane Goldman and the film's director Matthew Vaughn) which is a unique spin on the comic book genre to say the least. Gawky, teenager geek Dave Lizewski (newbie Johnson in an amiable turn) decides to take up his own "What If Ordinary People Who Indulge in SuperHero Comics Actually Decided to Become One" scenario, kicking it up a notch as a self-made vigilante in NYC but faces some serious consequences (i.e. pain inflicted really does hurt!) Also up for some titular tête-à-tête (and personal vengeance vendetta) are "Big Daddy" and "Hit-Girl" (Cage having a field day as an ex-cop/"Batman" manqué and newcomer Moretz who truly steals the film as the whirling dervish combo of The Tasmanian Devil and The Joker with her half-pint stature clearly a perfect foil for her homicidal tendencies with deft aplomb and filthy language to boot; her gauntlet run at the film's climax is truly one for the film vault and worth the price of admission). Stunning, blackly funny and shocking to say the least, but damn entertaining as well. For the kiddies? NO. For those grown-up kiddies: HellzYeah!! One of the year's best and one of the best comic book adaptations to date. Revisionist to say the least!
RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION (2007) **1/2 Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr, Ali Larter, Iain Glen, Ashanti, Christopher Egan, Spencer Locke, Matthew Marsden, Linden Ashby, Jason O'Mara, Mike Epps. Third chapter in the ever popular video game adapted franchise this time with Jovovich's apocalyptic heroine Alice fitted (to be tied) in a duster and roaming the scorch- ridden wasteland of Las Vegas with a reunion of sorts with Fehr & Epps heading a convoy of refugees a la "The Road Warrior" in hopes to find a new civilization while the ongoing zombie horde cum viral outbreak by the nefarious "Umbrella Organization"  led by hiss-able Glen reprising his nasty, evil genius role again  hell-bent on cloning the ass-kicking Alice for their own exploitive means. Not bad but ultimately a tad tedious retread but veteran director Russell Mulcahy keeps the pyrotechnic gore fest on full throttle overload of the senses.
THE PRESTIGE (2006) *** Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Piper Perabo, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson, Samantha Mahurin, David Bowie, Andy Serkis, Roger Rees. Absorbing yet predictable tale about two 19th century competitive magicians, one an acclaimed showman (Jackman), the other a dedicated master of the craft (Bale) - who will go at any lengths to top one another in learning each other's secrets and lies at the prestidigitation at hand. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan - who collaborated on the screenplay adaptation of Christopher Priest's novel with his brother Jonathan - expertly weaves a taut tapestry of tension and suspense but for the avid film-goer the 'twists' are all in the open and a tad too obvious. However to the average person this will be a pleasant exercise in edge-of-the-seat suspense and a display of cunningly performed acting by its handsome, dubious leads.
SHREK FOREVER AFTER (2010) *** (VOICES OF : Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, Jon Hamm, John Cleese, Craig Robinson, Walt Dohrn, Jane Lynch, Lake Bell, Kathy Griffin, Mary Kay Place, Kristen Schaal, Meredith Viera, Ryan Seacrest, Larry King, Regis Philbin, Conrad Vernon.) Better-than-anticipated 'final chapter' to the never-ending story of the lovable titular ogre and his brood that finds the not-so-jolly-green-giant in a funk wishing he was living his old days of yore which leads to runty Rumpelstiltskin to enter the picture  with a vendetta  to offer him a wish come true ala "It's A Wonderful Life" with predictable yet entertaining results. Once again Banderas steals the show as Puss In Boots but this time as a fat cat (literally) and Murphy's braying jack-ass Donkey having a field day and chewing the animated scenery. While it wouldn't be terrible if the powers that be do intend to close the nursery rhyme book on this fabled franchise it wouldn't hurt if they had one more verse to throw in for good measure (note: the IMAX 3-D version works yet it is not a must-see by any means in this medium).

FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL (2008) **** Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, Russell Brand, Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, Maria Thayer, Liz Cackowski, Taylor Wily, Davon McDonald, Steve Landesberg, (Cameos: William Baldwin  as himself, Jason Bateman) Hysterically funny romantic comedy from Troupe Apatow (as in exec producer Judd, King of Contemporary Comedy) written and starring Segel as hopeless shlub Peter Bretter, a musical scorer musician wannabe, whose high-profile relationship with actress Sarah Marshall (Bell) ends in a crushing (and in all forms of the word, nakedly) break-up causing him to downward spiral in a sea of self-pity and woe. Prompted by his stepbrother (Hader lending able comic support) to vacation in Hawaii to forget his troubles, Peter only finds to his shock and dismay Sarah there with her current beau, deplorable rakish himbo Aldous Snow (riotous Brand, a true comic find this side of Sacha Baron Cohen), and into the arms of the resort's customer service personnel  namely Kunis (a truly good egg and engaging rom- com player). Hitting all its targets (Four words: Dracula musical with puppets) with parts salt and sugar - the winning combo in Hollywood today  Segel proves to have a fine ear for richly veined dialogue and situations in the self-depreciative mode; always a plus. Kudos to Apatow regs, the indispensable Rudd as a stoner surfing instructor and Hill, the resort's restaurant host whose ingratiating manner is wince-inducing hilarity. The funniest film this year; go see it!
127 HOURS (2010) ***1/2 James Franco, Kate Mara, Amber Tamblyn, Treat Williams, Kate Burton, Lizzy Caplan. Absorbing fact-based human drama about freewheeling Aron Ralston (played with remarkable focus and depth by Franco) whose high-spirits are soon met with a devastating bluntness: while on a solo expedition in the desert wilds of Utah he is trapped  literally  between a rock and a hard place. Faced with imminent danger to his health, Ralston does everything he can to survive including (spoiler alert) remove himself by any means necessary. Filmmaker Danny Boyle's true achievement in making a possibly stagnant plot line (man in crevasse screwed for days on end) with ingenuity largely due to his creative screenplay (based on Ralston's book "Between a Rock and a Hard Place") with Simon Beaufoy allows the viewer to see what Ralston is (and what the filmmakers have imagined as flights of fancy) buoyed by a rock solid (sorry for the pun) turn by Franco and expert work by cinematographers Enrique Chediak & Anthony Dod Mantle and crafty editing by Jon Harris. A fine depiction of facing the odds, overcoming and persevering.
BLACK SWAN (2010) **** Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder. Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's masterful fever dream of a dark drama explores the highly competitive world of professional ballet and what it means to be an artist at any cost necessary. Enter prima-ballerina-to-be Portman (just give her the Oscar already!; her career best) an identity crises at full tilt as she prepares for her greatest achievement and biggest hurdle: dancing the lead titular performance with only her haranguing mother (Hershey also top-notch and award worthy); a sexy younger rival waiting in the wings (Kunis equally excellent oozing sex appeal); and their commanding, sleazy instructor (Cassel in aging bo-hunk mode). What follows is a downward spiral only Aronofsky can capably achieve thanks largely to a woozy-inducing head-trip screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz & John J. McLaughlin. Think of ALL ABOUT EVE meets a borderline TWILIGHT ZONE horror episode. One of the year's absolute best. A stunner!
RATATOUILLE (2007) ***1/2 (VOICES OF: Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Lou Romano, Brian Dennehy, Peter Sohn, Peter O' Toole, Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofalo, Will Arnett, James Remar, John Ratzenberger. Wonderful animated fare from the good folks at Pixar continuing their winning streak in this unlikely comedy about a rat named Remy(Oswalt) who has a flair for cooking and the bond he faces with a human chef-wannabe (Romano) involving the ghost of a renowned gourmet chef (Garrett), a competitive mentor love interest (Garofalo) and the current chef of the Parisian restaurant (Holm) who has designs to thwart our heroes at any cost. Fantastic set pieces, gorgeously designed backgrounds so photo-realistic you'll be salivating and sharp direction once again from vet director Brad Bird.
IGOR (2008) ** (Voices of: John Cusack, Molly Shannon, Steve Buscemi, Sean Hayes, Eddie Izzard, Jennifer Coolidge, Jay Leno, John Cleese, Arsenio Hall, Christian Slater) Disappointing animated fare attempting to do what SHREK did for storybook characters this tries for classic horror characters ; to wit: the titular hunchbacked assistant to mad scientists (a game Cusack) decides to create his own 'evil' monstrosity and the end result is a gi-normous patchwork gentle giantess named Eva (Shannon also a good sport) who is far from being what he wanted her to be. The look of the film cribs liberally from Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and its awful puns fall like bricks thanks to a logy screenplay by Chris McKenna. Best suitable for the wee ones ; for everyone else rent "Mad Monster Party". (Dir: Anthony Leondis)
PERSEPOLIS (2007) ***1/2 (VOICES OF : Chiara Mastroianni, Catherine Deneuve, Danielle Darrieux, Simon Abkarian, Gabrielle Lopes, Francois Jerosme) Fantastic animated adaptation of the biographical graphic novel work by Marjane Satrapi about her upbringing as a French speaking Iranian girl trying to acclimate to her trouble nation and life in general with a certain jaded perspective yet a hope for a better existence overall. Poignant slice-of-life melodrama and blend of history lesson that translates very well with exquisite black and white animation that is truly a work of art that speaks any language. Funny, heartbreaking and inspiring. (Dirs: Vincent Paronnaud and Satrapi)
SICKO (2007) **** Documentarian filmmaker Michael Moore strikes once again  in this, arguably his best work to date  focusing a scrutinized lens at America's insufficient health care system, the unscrupulous insurance companies, crooked politicos and the general malaise of the world's greatest nation shunning its citizenry with subpar work and no universal national health care that unlike other nations in Europe, Canada and Cuba have and the inexcusably horrific situations many are discovered to have been swept by the side in handling those who are in desperate need of sufficient medical care. For the most part the comedic glance is a bit eschewed in favor of depicting a human portrait instead for a stronger argument that it is truly unfathomable of how we take care of our own. ***A special personal kudos to editor Chris Seward, Mary Anne Van Wagner and Aneetha Rajan, former colleagues and friends of mine who worked on this project; kudos kids!!***
TRANCE (2013) **** James McAvoy, Vincent Cassel, Rosario Dawson, Danny Sapani, Matt Cross, Wahab Sheikh, Mark Poltimore, Tuppence Middleton. Danny Boyle's triply and good ol' fashioned MindF*ck of a movie cum art heist psychological thriller has all the ingredients of an epic genre pic: noirish elements include an amnesia plagued art house auctioneer (McAvoy as an Everyman getting better with each endeavor); his dubious partner-in-crime Cassel (silky malevolence foreboding) and sexy hypno-therapist/femme fatale (Dawson in a strong turn) who has the key to his psyche in the attempt to recall where the stolen masterpiece is hidden. While the simplistic in theory storyline seems barebones, Boyle's enthusiastic visuals and a truly serpentine screenplay by Joe Ahearne and John Hodge - as twisty turny and sharp keeps the viewer guessing who to put their faith in (or whose not to) until the knife-edged climax. Fantastically lensed by Anthony Dod Mantle, razor-gleaned editing by Jon Harris and an adrenalized score by Rick Smith keep things lively. Kind of "Memento" meets "The Thomas Crown Affair" by way of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" if you had to pitch it. One of the year's must sees and very best.
THE JUDGE (2014) *** Robert Downey, Jr., Robert Duvall, Vera Farmiga, Billy Bob Thornton, Vincent D'Onofrio, Jeremy Strong, Dax Shepard, Leighton Meester, Ken Howard, Emma Tremblay, Balthazar Getty, David Krumholtz, Grace Zabriskie, Denis O"Hare, Sarah Lancaster. Solid acting buoys this otherwise run-of-the-mill father/son dynamic drama about hot-shot attorney Downey returning home reluctantly for his mother's funeral and his estranged father (Duvall still awesome and crusty) the titular local courtroom purveyor who winds up in hot water for a murder rap. The pedestrian script by Nick Schenk, Bill Dubuque and director David Dobkin (who seems out of his element from the usual comedies he helms) doesn't help the storyline but the fine dynamic between motormouth Downey and erstwhile scold Duvall has chemistry to burn and make up for the flaws (namely a rote-go-nowhere 'romance' with Downey's former flame Farmiga who is wasted here without her usual tang and bite).
THE READER (2008) ***1/2 Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, David Kross, Lena Olin. Absorbing and rich characterizations of Bernhard Schlink's book adapted with finesse and subtlety by David Hare about a German teenager (newcomer Kross, making an excellent break-through performance) who has an affair with an older woman (Winslet in an Oscar worthy turn). Years later as a law student he comes across her path and discovers she has ties to the Nazi party during WWII, leading to her trial that his class is assigned to observe. While the heavy dramatic themes and the tricky balancing of humanizing someone affiliated with the Holocaust is a rather caustic situation, filmmaker Stephen Daldry steadily steers the film past pretension and strum and drang and instead elicits a truly heartbreaking love story with some ingenious plot devices. Fiennes is especially low-key yet efficiently clear-eyed in his endeavor as the latter- day protagonist and his scene with concentration camp survivor Olin is one for the film vault and for those who want to study what superb acting is all about.
YES MAN (2008) **1/2 Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel, Bradley Cooper, John Michael Higgins, Rhys Darby, Danny Masterson, Fionnula Flanagan, Terence Stamp, Sasha Alexander, Molly Sims. Carrey returns to fine comic form that echoes "Liar, Liar" only in this case he's a sad sack who reluctantly attends a self-help seminar and is bullied into saying "yes" to every chance given to him. High concept comedy that works for the most part with a beyond game Carrey getting his ya-yas out; best bit is the climactic realization on a moped while Journey's "Separate Ways" blasts in the background. Darby steals the show as Carrey's over-enthusiastic boss. (Dir: Peyton Reed)
THE LAKE HOUSE (2006) *** Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Christopher Plummer, Shohreh Aghdashoo, Dylan Walsh, Ebon Moss-Bachrach.Winsome and winning romantic drama with fantastical elements about it: to wit, Bullock and Reeves play star-crossed lovers set apart 2 years with the only common link, the titular edifice they both acquired, and a magical mailbox that gets their cosmic love letters to and fro (!) It shouldn't work but it does on an all too-human scale and some lovely chemistry between the "Speed"sters too. The fine location shootings in Chicago give it an extra oomph as well.(Dir: Alejandro Agresti)
LICENSE TO WED (2007) * Robin Williams, Many Moore, John Krasinski, Eric Christian Olsen, Christine Taylor, Josh Flitter, DeRay Davis, Peter Strauss, Roxanne Hart, Grace Zabriskie, Mindy Kaling, Angela Kinsey, Rachael Harris, Brian Baumgartner, Bob Balaban. Vapid, sit- com-y high concept comedy about a young couple's nuptials being put to the test by the bride-to-be's family minister (a surprisingly sedate Williams) who proves to be a holy terror in the process. Woefully unfunny screenplay by Ken Barker, Tim Rasmussen, Vince Di Meglio and Wayne Lloyd and underwhelming direction by Ken Kwapis (who has collaborated with Krasinski and his THE OFFICE cronies  many submitted to this mess to boot  previously, with such higher hilarious results).
LEGEND (1985) *** Tom Cruise, Mia Sara, Tim Curry, David Bennent, Alice Playten, Billy Barty, Cork Hubbert, Peter O'Farerll, Kiran Shah, Robert Picardo, Style over substance par none in this overwrought yet beautifully designed fantasy fairy tale come alive that's either pure magical hokum or the most expensive Summer's Eve commercial. Filmmaker Ridley Scott once again his uncanny knack of incorporating all his filmmaker skills to muster much-ado- about-a-trifle of the basic Good Vs. Evil Grimm-like story about a spritely young hero named Jack (a seemingly miscast Cruise looking uncomfortable altogether) who must save his beloved, Lili (the ethereal Sara) after her unwitting upsetting the balance of Dark and Light by interfering with unicorns - the epitome of all things good and light - and awakening the Darkness Himself (Curry having a field day in the first of his many hammy evil villains). With elves, goblins and other supernatural ephemera the film coasts solely on the grandiloquent production design by Leslie Diley and Asshteon Gorton; a synth heavy score by the usually sublime Tangerine Dream -with emopop tunes by Jon Anderson and Bryan Ferry; splendid cinematography by Alex Thomson ; William Hjortsberg' (ANGEL HEART) s purple prose leaden screenplay ; and the truly marvelous wizardry of make-up god Rob Bottin for some remarkable creature designs, particularly the aforementioned Darkness of The Devil In The Flesh mixed with Disney's demon of NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN.
QUARANTINE (2008) *** Jennifer Carpenter, Steve Harris, Jay Hernandez, Johnathon Schaech, Andrew Fiscella, Rade Serbedzija, Greg Germann, Bernard White, Dania Ramirez, Elaine Kagan, Marin Hinkle, Joey King, Jermaine Jackson, Sharon Ferguson, Denis O'Hare, Stacy Chbosky, Jeannie Epper. Exhaustive yet affectively shocking thriller about a television journalist (plucky and true Carpenter) whose routine coverage of a local fire department winds up in a living nightmare on a 'routine' call to an apartment complex that unleashes a rabid virus turning its victims into flesh-hungry zombies (!) Shades of Romero and Cronenberg underscore the tension of a band of strangers facing an unsuspecting horror still elicits enough bump-in-the-dark moments of sheer unease thanks largely to the meat and potatoes screenplay by John Erick Dowdle (who also directed) and brother Drew (adapting Spanish film "REC") and a "BLAIR WITCH" visceral momentum keeps things at an adrenaline quickening tempo.
LARS AND THE REAL GIRL (2007) *** Ryan Gosling, Emily Mortimer, Paul Schneider, Kelli Garner, Patricia Clarkson, Nancy Beatty. Oddball yet endearing character driven screwball comedy about a quiet, possibly mentally challenged young man (Gosling giving a decent performance overall) who surprises his married brother, his sister-in-law and his entire community when he sends away for a life-size doll he's convinced is his soul-mate and more importantly alive. What could've come across as truly pathetic and/or creepy is put to the wayside by director Craig Gillespie's latter-day Capra helmsmanship and the sweet screenplay by newcomer Nancy Oliver but the novelty of No One Not Calling on The Ridiculous Of It All is a bit tough to swallow in these hard-bitten contemporary mores. However Gosling's buoyant innocence makes up for the somewhat insane plot.
STRANGER THAN FICTION (2006) ** Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Emma Thompson, Linda Hunt. Frequently amusing but pale imitation of a Charlie Kaufman lite story about a fictional character (Ferrell attempting to be in the same league as Bill Murray  the sad clown) who discovers he's actually real and attempts to avoid his destiny (i.e. his death) by trying to find the narrative voice that plagues him in the form of the story's author (Thompson having a field day with fine dark comic aplomb). Despite the slightly surreal underpinnings of Zach Helm's storyline the end result doesn't reach the treacle that director Marc Forster aims for.
PAN'S LABYRINTH (2006) *** ½ Ivana Baquero, Ariadna Gil, Sergi Lopez, Maribel Verdu, Doug Jones, Alex Angulo, Manolo Solo, Cesar Vea, Roger Massague. Filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro's masterpiece fantasy cum political allegory is set against the WWII backdrop of Franco-era Spain, with a young girl (newcomer Baquero in a fantastic performance), who travels with her pregnant widowed mother (Gil) to be with her mother's new husband, a fascist Army captain (Lopez, a vile, evil second cousin to Ralph Fiennes in "Schindler's List"), who only wants his new baby while ruling with an iron fist. The girl meanwhile discovers an enchanting yet forebodingly dark underworld of woodland creatures and fairies that beckon her as their long-lost princess to lead them into a new future together. Told with imagination beyond capabilities of lesser hands, Del Toro's unwavering originality is on par with his mentor David Cronenberg in his morality plays mixed with macabre and sprinkled with liberal gory violence.
EVENING (2007) * Claire Danes, Toni Collette, Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Dancy, Natasha Richardson, Mamie Gummer, Eileen Atkins, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Barry Bostwick. Overwrought and thoroughly uninteresting adaptation of Susan Minot's novel (co-scripted with Michael Cunningham) about a dying woman's reflections on love's labour lost and the implications that affected her life. Wilson, the unobtainable lover by many parties here, comes across as a plastic figurine. While there is a plethora of incredibly talented actors assembled it is all, sadly for naught, and the fact that the Danes/Redgrave character is highly unsympathetic/pathetic surely doesn't help. (Dir: Lajos Koltai)
*** This comment may contain spoilers ***PERFECT STRANGER (2007) * Halle Berry, Bruce Willis, Giovanni Ribisi, Richard Portnow, Gary Dourdan, Florencia Lozano, Nicki Aycox, Kathleen Chalfant, Daniella Van Graas, Paula Miranda, Patti D'Arbanville, Clea Lewis, Tamara Feldman, (Cameo as herself: Heidi Klum) Abysmal sub- Joe Eszterhaus' erotic thriller (no thanks to the screenplay by newcomer Todd Komarnicki based on a story by Jon Bokenkamp) ) with miscast Berry as a gritty NYC tabloid investigative journalist who goes after an advertising exec (a surprisingly one-note Willis) who may have killed her girlfriend who may have been harboring more than the secret of carrying his baby. Horrible on all counts particularly the character of Ribisi's who is supposed to be a sharp twist in the plot that is ludicrously awful and it doesn't help that Berry chews the scenery and her character is equally unlikable (including her 'twist' to her character by the film's ridiculous 'twist' ending!) One of the year's worst. (Dir: James Foley)
TRANSCENDENCE (2014) ** Johnny Depp, Rebecca Hall, Morgan Freeman, Paul Bettany, Cillian Murphy, Kate Mara, Cole Hauser, Clifton Collins, Jr., Xander Berkeley, Lukas Haas, Wallace Langham. Scattershot sci-fi high concept suspensor with Depp as a tech genius whose passing is superseded by downloading his intelligence into the Internet (or some such nonsense) to create a new, better world at any cost in the progress of mankind. For Wally Pfister (Christopher Nolan's longtime cinematographer making his directorial debut and his boss as an executive producer) the production overall is stellar but the flat-footed script by Jack Paglen (also his first work produced for the big-screen) and misplaced talent (i.e. Murphy is wasted while Mara's hard-eyed villainous terrorist is implausibly laughable) fail to elicit much interest, sympathy for the devil or even an illegal download.
THE DICTATOR (2012) ** Sacha Baron Cohen, Anna Faris, Jason Mantzoukas, Ben Kingsley, John C. Reilly, Kevin Corrigan, Bobby Lee, Fred Armisen, (Cameo : Megan Fox as herself) Lackluster satire from Baron Cohen as ruthless fictional terrorist leader Haffaz Alladeen of Wadiya (as in what-a-ya-kiddn'-me!) whose attempt to deliver a fiery speech at the United Nations has him replaced by his idiot decoy and the fish-out-of-water despot trying desperately to fend for himself in The Big Apple with the unlikely help from organic food store owner Faris (again sadly misused and robbed of her naturally comedic talents). Hamstrung screenplay by Cohen, Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer has more misses-than-hits and the static direction by the usually on-target Larry Charles is woefully inept. A misfire for Baron Cohen and co.
FRIENDS WITH KIDS (2012) **** Jennifer Westfeldt, Adam Scott, Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd, Jon Hamm, Krisen Wiig, Megan Fox, Edward Burns, Lee Bryant, Cotter Smith, Kelly Bishop. Funny, witty, sexy and  finally  adult  comedy about a group of friends coupled for the most part and focusing on the give-and-tug best friends symbiosis of Westfeldt (who wrote the winning screenplay and also skillfully directed) and Scott (arguably his best work and giving Paul Rudd a run for his money of my non-homosexual bromance with) who decide to skip the 'tragedy of their marriage' (i.e. all the bad parts) and dive in to have a child together with decidedly mixed results  namely they are the perfect couple whose blinders-on are driving their other friends crazy. Superb ensemble  mostly collected while working on BRIDESMAIDS together  add enough snap and crackle to the one-liner laden script with panache and make the dramatic moments all that more powerful (witness for my money an Oscar-worthy yes Oscar-worthy turn by Scott as the serial dater/womanizer with a heart of gold who gives an amazing speech about how he really feels for Westfeldt that actually had me applaud after! He's THAT good!) Echoes of Woody Allen, Rob Reiner's WHEN HARRY MET SALLY and Alan Alda's couples comedy THE FOUR SEASONS only show to steal from the best! The Best Comedy (and Film) (so far) of the Year.
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION (2006) **1/2 Catherine O'Hara, Harry Shearer, Eugene Levy, Christopher Guest, Parker Posey, Christopher Moynihan, John Michael Higgins, Fred Willard, Jane Lynch, Ed Begley, Jr. Bob Balaban, Christopher McKean, Jim Piddock, Jennifer Coolidge,, Larry Miller, Ricky Gervais, Paul Dooley, John Krasinksi, Don Lake, Michael Hitchcock, Rachel Harris, Jordan Black, Sandra Oh, Richard Kind, Craig Bierko. Misfire comedy from the Guest troupe of well-meaning nincompoops this time satirizing show business with a terrible film whose cast and crew are so delusional that the rumor-mongering of Oscar talk has everyone buzzing is ludicrous yet not hysterical as anticipated from the likes of Guest and Levy (who collaborated on the strained screenplay that elicits more knowing smiles than guffaws) but O'Hara as a has-been/never was long-in-the-tooth third rate film actress deserves an Oscar nod for bringing heart to an easily mocked character type.
MONEYBALL (2011) **** Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Robin Wright, Chris Pratt, Stephen Bishop, Spike Jonze, Arliss Howard, Brent Jennings. Pitt gives an Oscar-worthy performance in arguably his best on screen work as determined Oakland A's baseball General Manager Billy Beane, whose desire to get his last-placed major league team to a fulfilling winning season in a genuine pennant race by employing the unorthodox plan involving a statistics number crunching green wunderkind (Hill in a surprisingly underplayed winning performance equally worth a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award too boot). Based on the best-seller by Michael Lewis, dream team scribes Aaron Sorkin & Steve Zaillian hit a grand-slam with equally refined clear-eyed direction by Bennett Miller. Wisely Pitt in charge with a low-key, no 'bs' in his performance of a man attempting to do one specific goal : to win-in-spite-of-the-odds underdog undertaking that so easily could fall into a sports film cliché (which it lingers with admittedly) but is arguably the best film ever made about the game and one of the year's best films, bar none. '
PRECIOUS: BASED ON THE NOVEL 'PUSH' BY SAPPHIRE (2009) **** Gabourney 'Gabby' Sidibe, Mo'Nique, Paula Patton, Mariah Carey, Sherri Shepherd, Lenny Kravitz, Stephanie Andujar, Chyna Layne, Amina Robinson, Xosha Roquemore. Harrowing yet ultimately inspiring and uplifting melodrama about an abused, near-illiterate teenage girl (portrayed with amazing skill by novice Sidibe in this jaw-dropping big-screen acting debut) whose incest-plagued homelife nearly poisons her to the point of self-destruction with only her welfare-dependent monstrous mother (incredibly enacted by comedienne Mo'Nique) whose love/hate relationship has taken its toll to the limit. Novice filmmaker Lee Daniels makes an indelible impression with his flair for fantasy and reality that blends and blurs the edges of a young woman who is at the precipice of despair. Oscar nominations should be in order for Sidibe, Mo'Nique, Patton  as the sympathetic and inspirational teacher-figure and dare I even say, Carey as a de-glammed social worker whose empathy has its limits. Powerfully overwhelming with human emotion. One of the best films of the year.
MR. BROOKS (2007) *** Kevin Costner, Demi Moore, Dane Cook, William Hurt, Marg Helgenberger, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Danielle Panabaker, Alisha Hinds, Lindsay Crouse, Jason Lewis, Reiko Aylesworth, Matt Schulze, Yasmine Delawari. Traci Dinwiddie. Interesting take on the serial killer thriller with Costner tweaking his clean-cut image as the titular character, a successful businessman, happily married family man whose only trouble is his split-personality obsession of killing anonymous victims. Taut, and slickly directed by Bruce A. Evans, the film only buckles under the other two plot lines involving tenacious cop Moore after 'the Thumb Print Killer'  Brooks' nom de plume  and another serial killer and Brooks' daughter (Panabaker) who harbors her own secrets. Hurt is deliciously evil as Mr. Hyde to Costner's Dr. Jekyll, a la A BEAUTIFUL MIND: a character only Brooks can see & hear, and comedian Cook is better-than-anticipated as a blackmailer cum murderer-wannabe who makes a pact with Brooks: he won't reveal his identity as long as he can be apprenticed to his own desire to kill a stranger. Bent and original.
SUPER 8 (2011) ***1/2 Joel Courtney, Kyle Chandler, Elle Fanning, Riley Griffiths, Ryan Lee, Gabriel Basso, Zach Mills, Ron Eldard, Noah Emmerich, Glynn Turman, Richard T. Jones, Jessica Tuck, Joel McKinnon Miller. Filmmaker JJ Abrams' valentine to his executive producer Steven Spielberg's sci-fi hey day and all creature features of his youth are connected in this lively and entertaining sci-fi dramedy circa 1979 where a group of young kids, while filming a zombie flick for a contest, witness a horrific (and one humdinger of a) train wreckthat unleashes an alien beastie and a military embroiled conspiracy hellbent on covering it up. The underpinnings of a coming of age/father-son bonding thru tragedy/first pangs of love occur synchronically as the goosepimply suspense is deftly applied (thank you composer Michael Giacchino's John Williamsian score) and the neat-o factor of feeling like a kid again pricleless. Kudos to the creator and his mentor for scoring some more movie magic for those who crave the wonder of the movies! BONUS: Stay thru the credits to check out the kids' nifty short subject; it's a gas!
WALK HARD: THE DEWEY COX STORY (2007) **1/2 John C. Reilly, Jenna Fischer, Tim Meadows, Kristen Wiig, Raymond J. Barry, Margo Martindale, Chip Hormess, Chris Parnell, Matt Besser, David Krumoltz, Harold Ramis, Martin Starr, Jack McBrayer, Paul Feig, Frankie Muniz, Jack White, John Michael Higgins, Justin Long, Paul Rudd, Jason Schwartzman, Jack Black, Jonah Hill (as themselves: Eddie Vedder, Lyle Lovett, The Temptations, Jackson Browne, Ghostface Killah, Jewel) Frequently hilarious take-off of musical biopics ala "RAY" and "WALK THE LINE" with Reilly in fine Will Ferrell mode as the titular rocking doofus who manages to sustain a 50 year career with each era mocked to the fullest and with tongue-though-cheek aplomb thanks to the talents of producer/writer Judd Apatow and co-scribe/director Jake Kasdan although the hit-and-miss ratio is more the latter, none-the-less Reilly's gameness for every outrageous task is played to the uproarious hilt.
THE CABIN IN THE WOODS (2012) *** Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford, Brian White, Amy Acker, (Cameo: Sigourney Weaver) The eponymous genre flick gets itself turned inside out in this at times too-cool-for-its-own-school underpinnings from filmmakers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard : five stereotypical young adults venture into the secluded topiary where upon visiting the abandoned edifice .well let's just say things start to happen and then thingsreallystartto..HAPPEN! While the clever premise gets giddy in its final act where the collective horror ya-yas are set loose (literally) there is little terror and more in the line of show-me-how-you-can-top-THIS ethos, the expectations high eventually plateaus but those-in-the-know fanboys/girls will eat this up begging for more. Kudos to Kranz as the clear-eyed stoner getting in touch with his inner Shaggy in this long-form SCOOBY-DOO meets THE EVIL DEAD by way of a cosmic Rubik's cube plotting.
JACK REACHER (2012) *** Tom Cruise, Rosamund Pike, Richard Jenkins, David Oyelowo, Werner Herzog, Jai Courtney, Vlaimir Sizov, Joseph Sikora, Michael Raymond-James, Alexia Fast, Robert Duvall. Cruise's first outing as the titular mysterious ex-military policeman/enforcer of the popular novels by Lee Child (who has a cameo) pits him against a homicide investigation in Pittsburgh where a military sniper has seemingly shot five random victims but murky underpinnings suggest otherwise landing him hip deep in a conspiracy. Workmanlike in execution and adaptation by filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie is buoyed by the laconic, deadeye turn by his star who seemingly miscast (the character is a blind 6'5" force to be reckoned with in the books) manages to rise above the otherwise corkscrew machinations for a relatively entertaining action derivative crime drama.
LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD (2007) ***1/2 Bruce Willis, Timothy Olyphant, Justin Long, Maggie Q, Cliff Curtis, Jonathan Sadowski, Andrew Friedman, Kevin Smith, Yorgo Constantine, Cyril Raffaelli, Chris Palermo, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Zeljko Ivanek. NYPD Detective John McClane (Willis reprising his iconic role with relish) is back in the best of the sequels to date this tame facing the gargantuan task of stopping a cybernetic team of terrorists led by Olyphant (duded up in Johnny Cash black), a disgruntled ex-government expert on homeland security, set on 'fire sale' : wiping out the US of all methods of finance, communication and basic fundamentals during the 4th of July. Aided by reluctant hacker Long (making as the damsel-in-distress and tweaking his Mac TV ad character to the hilt), his trademark cool- under-pressure, quippy alpha male brio and street smarts, McClane is at his best resorting to some sharp, smart improvised bits of business to stop the bad guys. As the "Timex watch in a digital world", he just keeps on tickin'! Kudos to the rapid-fire, adrenalized pumping action and LOL dialogue by scribes Mark Bomback and David Marconi, and the shrewdly skillful direction by Len Wiseman, the team wisely lets Willis flex his over-the-board appeal and over-the-top sequences incorporating Parkour, the French derivative acrobatic leaping about, CGI splendor in some truly realistic, jaw-dripping set pieces including various methods of transportation hurtling at our hero (my have: "killing the copter").Despite the good people at Fox dumbing down the audience to a PG-13 (really should've been an R people!) the violence doesn't feel too-watered down. All I can gleefully say is: "Yippiee-Kay-Ay Mother.er!!!!"
PRIEST (2011) **1/2 Paul Bettany, Karl Urban, Cam Gigandet, Maggie Q, Lily Collins, Lily Collins, Brad Dourif, Stephen Moyer, Christopher Plummer, Alan Dale, Madchin Amick. Post-apocalyptic horror film based on Minn-Woo Hyung's (who adapted with co-scribe Cory Goodman) Korean graphic novels about the titular elite vampire slayers  Bettany stoic as always  out to destroy a new, powerful strain of the blood-thirsty undead with one caveat: his long-lost daughter Collins has been kidnapped by nefarious Urban (aping many of Clint Eastwood's mannerisms from the 'spaghetti Westerns' of yore). While it is refreshing to see the creatures of the night rightfully depicted as ravenous monsters and not primadonna , glistening teenagers the storyline is too familiar with few surprises, albeit a nice but short-lived performance by veteran loon Dourif as a latter-day Renfeld-in-the-process-snake-oil-salesman and the linear plottings of THE SEARCHERS (!) makes an ideal hybrid of western and chiller flick . Director Scott Charles Stewart manages to keep things lively in a RESIDENT EVIL manner  i.e. slo-mo kills. The 3-D is so-so but the gist is given.
TED (2012) **1/2 Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, Seth MacFarlane, Joel McHale, Giovanni Ribisi, Patrick Warburton, Matt Walsh, Jessica Barth, Bill Smitrovich (Narrator: Patrick Stewart); (CAMEOS : Norah Jones, Sam J. Jones, Tom Skerritt. One-note joke comedy from FAMILY GUY twisted genius Seth MacFarlane (in his big-screen filmmaking debut and co-scripted with Alec Sulkin and Wellsey Wild) : a young boy's wish for his teddy bear to be his best friend inexplicably makes the toy come to life and flash forward to the present with the cuddly, fuzzy plaything as a foul-mouthed, whore-mongering, bong smoking lout sharing digs with his human bud Wahlberg in serious Peter Pan denial while his girlfriend Kunis gives him an ultimatum - her or Ted. That's it. Everything else feels like pop-culture riffings and pacing left over from MacFarlane's aforementioned animated blockbuster that doesn't translate too well to the big screen. Scatterings of gut-busting laughs and a game-on turn by its handsome leads are too few to mention and the non-stop FLASH GORDON references fall with a deadening thud. A disappointment.
THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG (2013) ***1/2 Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Evangeline Lilly, Richard Armitage, Ken Stott, Graham McTavish, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Stephen Hunter, Dean O'Gorman, Aidan Turner, John Callen, Peter Hambleton, Jed Brophy, Mark Hadlow, Adam Brown, Lee Pace, Mikael Persbrandt, Sylvester McCoy, Luke Evans, Stephen Fry, John Bell (voice of Benedict Cumberbatch) A return to form for filmmaker Peter Jackson (who co-wrote with his team of Fran Walsh, Phillippa Boyens, and Guillermo del Toro) in his ongoing adaptation of JRR Tolkien's novel with the pack of dwarfs en route to stop the invincible dragon Smaug (scarily intoned by Cumberbatch) from the onslaught of the kingdom laid waste and the all-consuming blood- thirsty Orcs empowered to bring upon even more evil. Faster-paced with swift sequences of fantastic action and thrills (i.e. a shoot-the-rapids barrel ride cum battle and the spooky voyage thru a forest plagued with giant spiders) and a boost of energy (and shout-out to the fan girls) with newly created 'sheElf' Tauriel (babelicious ass-kicker Lilly) and a more easier to understand plot line overall. The as-expected visuals and effects are even more thorough and despite a few video game like executions continues to be the blue chip mix of state-of- the-art-technology with old-fashioned escapist storytelling. The third and final chapter should be a doozy!
NIGHTCRAWLER (2014) ***1/2 Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, Bill Paxton, Riz Ahmed, Kevin Rahm, Ann Cusasck. Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar worthy turn as an ambitious entrepreneur wannabe who stumbles into becoming a news videographer who scrounges LA in the dark hours for the more lurid feeds that will lead to bigger deals and more faster cash than he can imagine in spite of his own sociopathic tendencies which are clearly aligned with his slightly Macchieavealean deal with the local TV station's news managing producer (a very strong Russo channeling her inner Faye Dunaway) who strongly follows the 'if it bleeds it leads' POV in what the media feeds its viewers. A damning black comedy and transfixing indictment of what blind ambition can lead to from filmmaker Dan Gilroy (his big-screen directorial debut who also penned the poisonous screenplay) who employs the nitty, gritty after hours cinematography by Robert Elswit with dank aplomb. Gyllenhaal, with his slick backed hair and saucer eyes, makes his antihero, Louis Bloom, an equal to the pantheon of Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle in TAXI DRIVER and his Rupert Pupkin in THE KING OF COMEDY and succeeds in a career high with laser focus and scary good committal to what could have been an odious portrait of moral bankruptcy.
HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU (2009) ** Jennifer Aniston, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Connelly, Bradley Cooper, Ginnifer Goodwin, Justin Long, Scarlett Johansson, Kevin Connolly, Drew Barrymore, Busy Philipps, Kris Kristofferson. Overstuffed ensemble romantic comedy adaptation of the popular book of the same name with several couples showcased on the verge of falling in and out of love with each other. The screenplay leaves a lot to be desired for by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein with some truly stilted dialogue and cringe-inducing situations that make both sexes seem inept at the subjects of love, sex and romance but the game and talented cast makes the most of what is given, particularly the clueless Goodwin and unlikely lady-killer Long as the obvious cute couple who don't recognize the obvious. Comes off like a second-hand Valentine's Day card. (Dir: Ken Kwapis)
X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (2009) *** Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston, Will.i.Am, Lynn Collins, Kevin Durand, Dominic Monaghan, Taylor Kitsch, Daniel Henney, Ryan Reynolds. Jackman's charismatic turn as the lupine mutant coasts through this rather predictable yet entertaining action prequel to the Marvel Comics' iconic character, showing how Logan became Wolverine, including his ongoing sibling rivalry with half-bro Victor AKA Sabretooth (Schreiber having a blast as the baddie) and the nefarious military ops mechanist Stryker (Huston gleefully chomping at the bit as the villain) attempting to harness their powers for his own use. Decent enough screenplay by David Benioff and Skip Woods and some tightly sequenced set pieces by director Gavin Hood (case in point: Wolfie's attack on a chopper is a dilly) keep the adrenaline pumping despite the histrionic plottings.
THE AVENGERS (2012) **** Robert Downey, Jr. , Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth,Tom Hiddleston, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgard, Gwyneth Paltrow, (Voice of: Paul Bettany), Powers Boothe, Jenny Agutter,Harry Dean Stanton.FINALLY  Fanboys/girls can rejoice in knowing the several years in the making/multi Marvel Comics' film adaptations of THE HULK, IRON MAN, THOR & CAPTAIN America were not for naught in this superbly entertaining conglomeration of the powers that be under one umbrella fan flick that truly satisfies! Basically Earth is in danger no thanks to Thor's angry sub-sibling Loki (Hiddleston getting his ya-yas out in a field day turn) whose plan for total domination involves a crystal blue Maguffin that frankly no one cares about (!) It's THE AVENGERS people! :D Like a super-rock group combined for a world tour of well avenging! Loads of action thanks to Joss Whedon's sharp and sharply funny screenplay with Zak Penn, and helming the megaton endeavor with aplomb and nervy verve and thankfully a lot of well sprinkled humor with one-liners, put-downs and more sight gags not seen since the heyday of ZAZ (Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker of AIRPLANE! fame for the uninitiated). In a word: Super(B!) One of the year's best; can't wait for the next chapter in the franchise!
STONE (2010) *** Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Milla Jovovich, Frances Conroy, Sarab Kamoo. Absorbing drama about career parolee De Niro (in one of his better turns as of late) whose complacent world of lachrymose and regret is upended when a violent prisoner (riveting Norton) enters with his case pending, and a ripe, will-do-anything for her husband wife (the bewitchingly good Jovovich) at his bidding. Seduction, betrayal and good ol'mind f***ing with some great performances and a shrewd direction by John Curran with a serpentine screenplay by Angus MacLachlan making things lively with no redemption in sight.
THE LAST STAND (2013) *** Arnold Schwarzenegger, Forest Whitaker, Eduardo Noriega,Peter Stormare, Luis Guzman, Jaimie Alexander, Johnny Knoxville, Rodrigo Santoro, Zach Gilford, Harry Dean Stanton, Genesis Rodriguez. The Guhvenator is Back! Great return-to-form actioner for Ah-nold - back in his first major leading role since politics - as a small town Cali sheriff whose quiet desert town is in for a rude awakening when the most notorious drug kingpin fugitive (Noriega) sets course in a run for the Mexian border with the FBI in full pursuit with lead agent Whitaker hellbent for justice. Blessed with a fine ensemble including the sexy and plucky Alexander, inept yet amiable Gilford and lax yet willing Guzman as the deputies and goofball Knoxville as the local yokel militia nut mixed with some great set pieces by director Jee-woon Kim and a fun yet empty-headed script by Andrew Knauer it's a full-throttle popcorn flick that is very entraining. Welcome back Arnie!
THE IMMIGRANT (2014) ** Marion Cotillard, Joaquin Phoenix, Jeremy Renner, Dagmara Dominczyk. Disappointing and one-note period piece set in 1920s NYC where recent Polish émigré Cottilard (emoting up a storm) attempts to keep her rocky citizenship entry to America when her tubercular stricken sister is forced to remain on Ellis Island leaving her to no other alternative than entrusting her fate with shady Phoenix (overacting) as a bureaucrat cum pimp (make your own jokes here) who falls hard for her. Things get worse when his magician cousin (Renner, miscast) enters the picture forming an unlikely lover's triangle in a pot boiling melodrama that goes nowhere fast. Filmmaker James Gray (who co-wrote with Ric Menello) spins his wheels while the immaculate production design by Happy Massee and Darius Khondji's cinematography make up for plodding plotting. Would've been more interesting if the male leads switched roles but too little too late.
ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010) ***1/2 Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Matt Lucas (voices of: Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Alan Rickman, Barbara Windsor, Paul Whitehouse, Timothy Spall, Michael Gough, Imelda Staunton, Christopher Lee) Tim Burton's masterful endeavor in re-creating Lewis Carroll's tales of Alice ("Wonderland" & "Looking Glass") is in full bloom of crazy and surreal in this re-imagining of the titular lass now a wan 19 year old uncertain of her future (Wasikowska in full muse mode) whose return to Wonderland has her reluctantly taking the cause to fight off the evil Red Queen (Bonham Carter, a hoot with a full-swollen CGI'd noggin' to boot!) and her weapon of destruction  the Jabberwocky. Wonderfully cast particularly Depp as The Mad Hatter (getting his ya-yas out in nightmare clown make-up that would give The Joker a run for his madness!) and thrilling 3D technology (really filmed in 2D and post-production for 3D but why cripe?); too much of a good thing is the visual eye-candy production design by Robert Stromberg and Burton's aide-de-camp maestro Danny Elfman. By all means see this in IMAX; how else can you enjoy Alice when she's ten feet (well 80 feet on screen)tall!
TROPIC THUNDER (2008) *** Ben Stiller, Robert Downey, Jr., Jack Black, Steve Coogan, Nick Nolte, Jay Baruchel, Brandon T. Jackson, Danny McBride, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Cruise, Bill Hader (as themselves: Tobey Maguire, Jon Voight, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jason Bateman, Lance Bass, Alicia Silverstone). Frequently on-the-mark satirical comedy taking potshots at the film industry and Hollywood egos with sure-footedness by Stiller (who directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen) about a group of primadonna actors on location filming a Vietnam film leading its fed-up director (Coogan) to have them 'experience' the reality they are filming which leads them into uncharted waters when they wind up in the middle of an Asian drug war zone. Downey rises above the rest of the cast as the arrogant, Method to the madness Aussie actor who has a procedure turning his skin black to portray the African American soldier in the picture, by walking the fine-line of PC and blackface vulgarity with deft aplomb. However the one-joke gimmick begins to run on vapors by the final act.
ROOM 237 (2013) 1/2 * Alleged documentary about the supposedly hidden meanings/messages and theories in Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" is arguably one of the worst films I've ever seen and maddening in its 'conspiracy' theorists of unknown crackpots (um, who the F*ck are these idiots? don't ask me since the filmmaker Rodney Ascher doesn't identify them except their names; might as well be Joe Blow From Idaho) who surmise all different things that may or not be of consequence. I have never wanted to walk out of a movie so badly since "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" and it is teeth-gnashingly frustrating to watch the horror masterpiece be opined for no apparent reasons except to satisfy the curiously ridiculous. If you want the cinematic rape of a work of art knock yourself out. How this film even got the use of Kubrick's films (among other films within the film) is beyond me since Warner Bros. and Kubrick's estate issued a statement they had no connection with this 'production'. Shameless and pointless. To quote Roger Ebert when he reviewed "North" : "I Hated, Hated, Hated This Film!"
THE SIGNAL (2008) **1/2 Anessa Ramsey, Justin Welborn , AJ Bowen, Scott Poythress,Sahr Nguajah, Cheri Christian, Chad McKnight, Christopher Thomas. Blood soaked horror film about a mysterious transmission that manages to turn its populace into maniacal murderous zombified rage-aholics and focuses on a young married woman having an affair (Ramsey), her lover (Welborn) and her husband (Bowen) in a three part non-linear approach helmed by three different filmmakers (respectively, newcomers David Bruckner, Dan Bush and Jacob Gentry who collaborated also on the screenplay) with a decidedly uneven mix of bloodletting, dark humor and an amalgam of Carpenter, Cronenberg, Romero and "Invasion of The Body Snatchers" with decidedly well-meant yet ill-conceived intentions.
ZODIAC (2007) **** Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, Robert Downey, Jr., Brian Cox, John Carroll Lynch, Chloe Sevigny, John Getz, Candy Clark, Elias Koteas, Donal Logue, Ciara Hughes, Pell James, Patrick Scott Lewis, June Raphael, Philip Baker Hall, Tom Verica, Zach Grenier, Adam Goldberg, James LeGros, Charles Fleischer, Clea DuVall, Paul Schulze. Filmmaker David Fincher hits a home run in this absorbing, unsettling true-life account of the infamous Zodiac killings in the San Francisco Bay area that haunted California, and in particular its law enforcement, for literally decades. A stellar ensemble with strong performances by Ruffalo and Edwards as homicide inspectors David Toschi and William Armstrong, respectively; Downey as crime reporter of the San Francisco Chronicle, Paul Avery; and especially Gyllenhaal as the newspaper's political cartoonist Robert Graysmith (whose books the excellent adaptation by James Vanderbilt are based on), who doggedly became mired in his own investigation, obsessed with the cryptic cipher who kept a manhunt at bay for so many years of frustration, personal lives shattered and literally thousands of hours of speculation and innuendo. Fincher dials back on the waycool camera trickery and instead wisely focuses on the policier at hand with expert precision and a dynamite '70s feel décor thanks to production designer Donald Graham Burt, dank cinematography by Harris Savides, art director Keith P.Cunningham, costumes by Casey Storm, David Shire's musical score and razor-sharp editing by Kirk Baxter & Angus Wall. The film hearkens back to classic Lumet and '70s suspense as well as "All The President's Men" meat-and-potatoes investigative journalism. Finally the first great film must-see of the year.
GETAWAY (2013) 0 stars Ethan Hawke, Selena Gomez, Jon Voight, Rebecca Budig. Epically ridiculous action thriller with Hawke (dialing in his performance flatly for a quick paycheck) as a washed-up professional race car driver finding himself forced to steal a muscle car for an unknown kidnapper (Voight, shot only in extreme close ups of his jowls; ditto) who has his wife hostage and a time clock ticking. Gomez is the unlikely owner of the super up automobile who is along for the ride and arguably the most laughable 'techie nerd' ever (!) Courtney Solomon's excuse for a movie is simply to show a shiny toy speed really fast and a ton of police cars paying homage to any other action film with an unending loop of a 'chase'. Easily the worst film of the year; heed the titular warning - I wish I did.
HANCOCK (2008) *** Will Smith, Charlize Theron, Jason Bateman, Jae Head, Eddie Marsan. Nifty spin on the superhero flick with Smith having fun as the titular reluctant superhuman whose great powers he finds difficult incorporating great responsibility until his encounter with luckless PR agent Bateman (a model of comic perfection) who decides the foul-mouthed, drunken anti-hero really needs a make-over and fast if he wants to be accepted into society. Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan's sharp, satirical screenplay smartly streamlines comic book ethos and mythology by eschewing the noble cause and instead focus on the fatal flaws while director Peter Berg incorporates the right blend of over-the-top visual effects, spot-on comedy and some depth to the characters at hand ; not an easy task and frankly the third act's 'surprising twist' is seen too far in advance. But Big Willie is the bomb.
GANGSTER SQUAD (2013) **1/2 Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Nick Nolte, Emma Stone, Sean Penn, Anthony Mackie, Robert Patrick, Michael Pena, Giovani Ribisi, Mireille Enos, Sullivan Stapleton, Jon Polito. Fun, two-fisted auctioneer about the real-life account of the LAPD's undercover unit out to stop the mob led by Mickey Cohen (scene chewing Penn) out to run his 'destiny' for gangland rule. Led by tough-as-nails with a heart of gold Brolin appointed by the ever-gravelly voiced Nolte with a ragtag team including cool-as-a-cucumber Gosling (affecting a goofy dese/dem/dose accent); gunslinging cowboy Patrick and his wet-behind-the-ears sidekick Pena; brawler Mackie and electronics geek Ribisi. Stone gives good glam as the reluctant moll and Gosling's main squeeze. The script by newbie Will Beall - based on the Paul Lieberman book - gets the tone down but director Ruben Fleischer's kitchen sink approach is a hit and miss in this cross between LA CONFIDENTIAL meets THE UNTOUCHABLES.
CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR (2007) **1/2 Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, John Slattery, Denis O'Hare, Ken Stott, Emily Blunt, Peter Gerety. Om Puri. Fact- based dramedy about real-life Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson (Hanks having a field day), who enlisted a stealth campaign to assist war-torn Afghanistan under attack by the USSR and the ramifications thereof. Roberts as the Texan socialite who gets the ball rolling and Hoffman as a CIA spook add able and fun support but director Mike Nichols attempt for satire is only saddled by the aftermath of the beginning of terrorism by the Taliban takes the wind out of its blend of comic sensibilities and political grudge making by Aaron Sorkin's skillful adaptation of George Crile's book.
OUT OF THE FURNACE (2013) *** Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson, Zoe Saldana, Sam Shepard, Willem Dafoe, Forest Whitaker, Tom Bower. Well-acted tale about two close-knit brothers (Bale and Affleck) who find themselves at opposite sides of the law in varying degrees and a heated showdown of vengeance with a vile drug-dealer (Harrelson in full bad-ass mode). Filmmaker Scott Cooper (who co-scripted with Brad Ingelsby) lets the tension tighten masterfully while his blue-chip cast emotes with perfection particularly the slow-boil Bale and trip-wire implosion of Affleck. But arguably its Harrelson's nasty methhead monster who steals the show with sprung-coiled venom.
THE EAST (2013) **1/2 Brit Marling, Alexander Skarsgard, Ellen Page, Toby Kebbell, Shiloh Fernandez, Aldis Hodge, Danielle Macdonald, Hillary Baack, Patricia Clarkson, Jason Ritter, Julia Ormond, Jamey Sheridan, Pamela Roylance, Billy Magnusssen, Wilbur Fitzgerald. Fairly absorbing drama focusing on a green recruit (Marling, who co-scripted with director Zal Batmangli) of a PI firm set to task in infiltrating a group of ecoterrorists hellbent on destroying corporate America led by a cult-like leader (Skarsgard) with some unsettling decisions to chose: remain loyal to which cause. While it is a sign of the time treatise the film lacks in its flat direction and one-note performances by nearly everyone (Clarkson is the exception as the icily placid operative in command) makes for a flat-footed execution overall with little suspense or action for a call to arms.
SUPERBAD (2007) **** Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Bill Hader, Seth Rogen, Emma Stone, Martha MacIsaac, Aviva, Stacy Edwards, Joe Lo Truglio, Kevin Corrigan, Dawn Morrow, David Krumholtz, Clement Blake, Erica Vittina Phillips, Brooke Dillman. (Dir: Greg Mottola)Hip To Be Square: One of The Year's Funniest Films; Hilarious  I'm "McLovin' It!!" Every generation gets their American GRAFFITI and the MySpace kids get theirs in one of the funniest films of the year, a howlingly hilarious look at a pair of high school senior buddies who face an uncertain future when they will be going to different colleges come fall.The two pals, Seth (Hill, best known for last year's funfest ACCEPTED and this summer's forthcoming KNOCKED UP) and Evan (Cera of the late, great Fox sitcom "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT"), have known each other since kindergarten and on the cusp of high school graduation, with summer approaching and the need to hook up with someone before the friends go their separate ways. Evan is headed for Dartmouth (Seth failed to make the cut) with another fair-weathered geeky amigo, Fogell (Mintz-Plasse, a star-making scene stealer, who constantly serves as a source of annoyance for Seth who really wants to score with hottie classmate Jules (Stone, who resembles Lindsay Lohan and sounds like she swallowed Linda Fiorentino, with her husky/sexy vocals), who invites him to her weekend party and asks for a small favor: if he can buy her the liquor needed. Seth has it all planned out with Fogell getting a fake ID to get the alcohol, figuring that if they were both drunk the more likelihood they would have sex and she would simply think that he was a bad mistake considering their conditions. Skeptical Evan meanwhile is pining for his gal pal Becca (MacIsaac) who also invites him to Jules' party, so the trio get together to buy the booze, make the date and have the time of their lives one last time.Naturally things don't' go as planned and to divulge too much would take away the fantastically concocted craziness that ensues but lets just say two slacker cops ("SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"'S Hader and co-screenwriter Rogen, who also serves as a producer with his fellow collaborator ,filmmaker Judd Apatow, inheriting the Harold Ramis/Ivan Reitman throne of smart/dumb vulgar comedies with rip-snorting gusto); an adult party involving illegal substances; some unlikely bonding; and of course the Holy Grail: Jules' party. Rogen, who wrote the script with his childhood chum Evan Goldberg  when both were in high school themselves, basing much of it on their experiences - is on a roll since his debut in the lamented excellent high school sitcom cult classic "FREAKS & GEEKS" and its companion college spin-off "UNDECLARED" , and support work in films like THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN  and the anticipated starring gig in the aforementioned KNOCKED UP - has a talent for the raunch mixed with heart in this hysterical teen comedy that proudly wears its vulgarity as a badge of honor, and the mentoring of collaborator Apatow, have created another smash-hit cult classic in the making that ranks up with its genre forefathers like FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH and DAZED AND CONFUSED. Director Mottola (THE DAYTRIPPERS) handles the comedy with great skill and lets his young charges get their ya- yas out (** @ the sneak preview I attended, Rogen, Apatow, Hader and Mottola were there and it was confirmed that the cast were allowed to improvise and it shows) It clearly captures the hellish existence of adolescence, angst, anomie and in general feeling like a loser when a winner is deep inside all of us. And it has a plethora of dick jokes.What more can you ask for? Hill, who suggests the love child of the late Chris Penn and Gene Wilder  the former's raspy voice and the latter's manic likablities  is a truly gifted comic actor  here sporting a Richard Pryor t-shirt and rockin' his Jew'Fro - who finally has a showcase to show just how funny he is and it is genius to have the awkward deadpan of Cera, as the well-meaning and respectful nerd who comes into his own as well.. Sexy newcomers Stone and MacIsaac also hold their own with their likable co-stars. But it is newbie Mintz-Plasse making an audacious film debut (his first acting gig ever!!) who suggests the coolest geek since the aforementioned GRAFFITI'S Charles Martin Smith's "Terry The Toad", as Fogell , AKA , "McLovin'"  the singular moniker he chose for the fake ID, who steals the film with his mouth-breathing stylin' doofus who gets in one crazy situation after another with the police officers, who themselves prove to be just as cluelessly enabling their young charge with one ridiculously insane endeavor after another.Trust me if you need to laugh long and hard from the funky opening credits with a killer soundtrack  from start to finish you will be in spasms of laughter to the point of pee-in- your-pants submission. By all means make sure you see this come August when it will be officially be released. You'll be McLovin' it too!!
DEATH RACE (2008) ***1/2 Jason Statham, Joan Allen, Ian McShane, Tyrese Gibson, Natalie Martinez, Max Ryan, Jason Clarke, Frederick Koehler, Jacob Vargas. High  octane reboot of the 1975 Roger Corman grind house classic "Death Race 2000"- this time set in the near future with a prison system run by a malevolent warden (Allen, slumming with style) whose Pay-Per- View televised national blood sport pits inmates against one another including wrongly accused wife-slayer Statham trying to survive five competitions to an early release. Bone- crunching, fast-paced, hyper-violence served in whiplash fashion by director Paul W.S. Anderson makes for a B-movie guilty pleasure and doesn't hurt with easy-on-the-eyes newcomer Martinez as the bodacious seat cover of Statham's. And yes that is David Carradine supplying the voice of "Frankenstein" in a sly nod to his reprisal from the original flick.
DETACHMENT (2012) **** Adrian Brody, Christina Hendricks, Marcia Gay Harden, Lucy Liu, James Caan, Blythe Danner, Tim Blake Nelson, William Petersen, Bryan Cranston, Sammi Gayle, Betty Kaye, Louis Zorich. Scathing indictment of the American educational system from agent provocateur filmmaker Tony Kaye features a terrific, low-key modulated performance by Brody (his best since copping the Oscar in THE PIANIST) as a haunted New York high school substitute teacher who finds himself at odds with the indifference, angst and anomie of his young charges and the push-pull relationship with a teen prostitute (amazing newcomer Gayle) he takes in under his wing. Brody's sad-sack demeanor and the most expressive eyes on screen since Bette Davis speaks volumes for his anguished character, Henry Barthes, and a stellar ensemble including Caan as a seen-it-all-world-weary colleague and veteran character actor Zorich as his dementia-addled grandfather. Kudos also to Kaye for using his real-life daughter Betty as Barthes' most loyal student with a burden to bare throughout the film until its heady climax that only falters in an otherwise fine screenplay by Carl Lund. The BLACKBOARD JUNGLE of the 21st century and one of the year's best films.
HALLOWEEN (2007) ** Malcolm McDowell, Tyler Mane, Sheri Moon, Daeg Faerch, Scout Taylor-Compton, William Forsythe, Brad Dourif, Danielle Harris, Jenny Gregg Stewart, Richard Lynch, Udo Kier, Danny Trejo, Clint Howard, Tom Towles, Bill Moseley, Leslie Easterbrook, Skyler Gisondo, Hanna Hall, Dee Wallace, Pat Skipper, Sybil Danning, Micky Dolenz, Sid Haig. (Dir: Rob Zombie)Evil Returns To Haddonfield ReduxWhy is it so necessary for Hollywood to insist on restoring a dead franchise in pursuit of the almighty dollar? I realize this is a redundant question and don't expect a real answer but frankly I'm stumped why oh why do they insist on doing so with unmitigated masterpieces such as John Carpenter's fearfest "Halloween" which solidified itself as a modern-day horror classic that has been re-awakened again and again in one turgid sequel after another.Well it seems ultrafan and self-professed horror film freak Rob Zombie decided to write the ultimate return with a re-imagining of the Michael Myers mystique  not unlike say "BATMAN BEGINS"  but without a real rallying cry for new blood to be pumped into the maniacal madman.While Carpenter's original premise of an unstoppable bogeyman returning home to the scene of his heinous crime some 17 years earlier as a child slaughtering his teenage sister and being held under observation in an insane asylum by a dedicated  if not a bit batty himself  psychologist, who pursues Michael back to the tranquil suburban fictitious Haddonfield where he terrorized his hometown and subsequently his long-lost little sister.Now Zombie re-visits the old homestead depicting Michael at age 10 (Faerch) as a love- starved yet deeply disturbed young boy whose domestic situation is a cry for help not unlike the case studies of an atypical broken home: his stripper mother (Zombie's better half, Sheri) is shacked up with an abusive, drunken lecherous pig (Forsythe again proving to be a sickening lug he has cornered the cottage industry on for himself), and his promiscuous older sister Judith (Hall). Michael is made miserable by the taunts of the school bullies, the shame he feels by his elders and the curiosity factor of how living things die. Add all this mindless psycho babble and young Michael in his beloved clown costume wreaks bloody havoc on those who've betrayed him and send him into the arms of his appointed shrink Dr. Loomis (McDowell a good replacement for the late, great Donald Pleasence), who ultimately will cash in on his subject/patient by writing a best-seller yet fail his trustee in the long run.While the first half-hour or so is strenuous at best Zombie's decision to see what makes Michael Myers tick may be the biggest mistake of any horror auteur to make; do we really need to know why Evil is Evil?I should state that Zombie does employ a keen eye for the camera set-ups and knows how to put in a good shudder here and there (Myers stealth has never been so undetected as it is in this film where he literally almost appears to pop up or materialize suddenly out of the shadows  i.e. in the living room of one of the babysitter's charges) but it seems a tad ridiculous to have Myers as a hulking brute (Mane fills in for the adult version nicely but seems looking for a WWF match in the process) which makes him, AKA The Shape, a new definition to his demeanor.Sadly Taylor-Compton fails to register as the plucky Laurie Strode that her predecessor Jamie Lee Curtis filled to a t. The remaining cast is like a Who's Who of previous Zombie films (i.e. his DEVIL"S REJECTS & HOUSE OF 1,000 MANIACS pop in with cameos) and some nice trivial choices (Harris returns to the fold as Laurie's doomed gal pal but was in HALLOWEENs 4 & 5 as a distant relative of Michael's)Although the blood runs deep and the body count impressive, ultimately it feels like a useless exercise in futility  not exactly the sacrilege of Gus Van Sant's shot-by-shot remake of Hitchcock's classic "PSYCHO", however just as unnecessary in the long run. Nice try Mr. Zombie but let Evil just be Evil.
NICK AND NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST (2008) *** Michael Cera, Kat Dennings, Ari Graynor, Alexis Dziena, Aaron Yoo, Rafi Gavron, Jonathan B. Wright, Jay Baruchel, (Cameos: Seth Meyers, Eddie Kaye Thomas, John Cho, Kevin Corrigan, Andy Samberg) Entertaining and funny rom-com for the MySpace generation ala vintage John Hughes about one crazy night spent in NYC's LES with two NJ-ite teens (baby seal incarnate Cera and Addams Family second cousin Kennings as the titular pair) who wind up together despite the odds of their friends, their exes and each other, in an attempt to find their favorite band in an after hours rare live performance. The two leads have chemistry, baby, chemistry and are a winning couple in a post-ironic, self-deprecating waycool way (way!) Graynor steals the movie as Dennings' Drunky McDrunk-Drunk gal pal whose inebriation is a cinematic marvel of ill- inducing slapstick involving her ever-present chewing gum (trust me it's up there with Cameron Diaz' 'gel doo' in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY for ickness factor for laughs). In spite of the Gen-Next indie music jukebox (which this Gen X'er totally can't appreciate; what can I tell ya, it all sounds the same to me  unmemorable static) the film runs on all cylinders thanks to a shrewdly clever screenplay by Lorene Scafaria (who has a memorable cameo involving Cera's Yugo-as-taxi-makeout sequence) based on a novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levitan, and rollickingly droll direction by Peter Sollett.
WORLD WAR Z (2013) ** Brad Pitt, Mireille Enos, Daniella Kertesz, James Badge Dale, Ludi Boeken, Matthew Fox, Fana Mokoena, David Morse, Elyes Gabel, Peter Capaldi, Pierfrancesco Favino, Ruth Negga, Moritz Bleibtreu. Disappointing zombie apocalypse thriller with former UN op Pitt (one-note Johnny in this!) enlisted into the fold to stop the pandemic overtake of a viral infection unleashing hordes of the undead on the global populace. While loosely based on the novel by Max Brooks, the pedestrian screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard, Damon Lindelof and J. Michael Straczynski is hindered severely in the simple fact that there is practically no real violence, some truly retarded moments of incoherency (um, not shutting your phone off while surveying a zombie-heavy environ.at.night.in.the.pouring.rain!)nor up-and-close encounters until its predictable final act and by then Marc Forster's all- thumbs direction (a truly poor choice for this sort of film) proves you can screw up a genre flick real good. Rent any Romero flick or watch any season of The Walking Dead for visceral (and really well written dialogue) instead; pitiful.
YEAR ONE (2009) ** Jack Black, Michael Cera, Oliver Platt, David Cross, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Vinnie Jones, Hank Azaria, Juno Temple, Olivia Wilde, June Diane Raphael, Xander Berkeley, Gia Carides, Horatio Sanz, Bill Hader, Kyle Gass. Disappointing comedy of the ages that tries in vein to be in the same league as "HISTORY OF THE WORLD,PART 1", but misses on almost every mark, even though the gaggle of comic talent (Black & Cera make a fine mismatched team of cavemen-type who wander into Biblical times in search of new lifestyles) is on hand (and largely wasted  i.e. Paul Rudd as Abel the world's first murder victim!) Despite comic genius Harold Ramis (who has a cameo too) at the helm and co-story credit with Gene Supnitsky & Lee Eisenberg, the film feels like a 12:50am skit on SNL that goes nowhere fast).
AMOUR (2012) **** Jean-Louis Trintignant, Emmanuelle Riva, Isabelle Huppert, Alexandre Tharaud, William Shimell, Ramon Agirre, Rita Blanco. Poignant and elegant drama from a very unlikely source - Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke (who up until now despised) - focuses on elderly retired music teachers (sterling Trintignant and epic Riva) who face their biggest challenge as a married couple: complications after a series of strokes to the wife which brings to question: what is the quality of life when hope seems to slip daily and the recipient of the daily nightmare no longer wants to exist? Challenging, triumphant and altogether poignant with more told in silences than volumes of dialogue fueled by well- imbued star turns and genuinely heartfelt emotion. While the subject matter rings true and familiar it is not necessarily the end-all-be-all however it is an important film that sheds light upon ageism, the endless pangs of romantic love and what being a human being is all about: faith. Devestating to a fault yet not treacly nor false. A masterpiece of humanity and a valentine to what true love really is. Heartbreaking; life-fulfilling. Richly deserved of its accolades including Best Foreign Film.
I LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS (2010) **1/2 Jim Carrey, Ewan McGregor, Leslie Mann, Rodrigo Santoro. Fact based dramedy about Steven Russell (Carrey acquitting himself nicely), an openly gay con man in pursuit of the biggest scams for the most money and all for the unapologetic love for the titular soul mate (decidedly mild-mannered McGregor) that proves too good to be true that it could only be a true-life account with its outrageous turns of events and by-the-seat-of-his-pants aplomb performance by Carrey buoys this otherwise jerry-rigged screenplay by its tag-team directing duo Glenn Ficarra & John Requa that eventually runs on fumes.
APPALOOSA (2008) *** Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Renee Zellweger, Jeremy Irons, Timothy Spall, James Gammon, Tom Bower, Lance Henriksen, Adriana Gil. (Dir: Ed Harris) Harris' revisionist oater is a keeper.Ed Harris has always been a fave of mine with his craggy good looks, piercing blue eyes and no-bull- attitude that barely simmers under the surface of calm neutrality. However in his latest endeavor  and second time as director - he truly lets his attributes flex their muscles.Harris stars as Virgil Cole, who winds up taking a job as marshal for the titular hamlet back in the Old West, who, along with lifetime friend Everett Hitch (stoic man-of-few-words Mortensen) as deputy, fulfill the open position no thanks to land baron baddie Randall Bragg (Irons), whose just dispatched of the previous lawman and his deputies in cold blood by his own guns. The duo are somewhat in over their heads but both rely and depend on one another  and more importantly - are loyal to one another, knowing each one will gladly lay his life down for the other.To add to the mix a stranger comes to the dusty town in the shapely form of Mrs. Allison French (Zellweger), practically penniless, who takes a job as the hotel pianist, and awakens Virgil's dormant romanticism. The lawman is smitten with her and courts her promptly resulting in a sudden engagement for marriage and the purchasing of a newly constructed home in the town's outskirts.As new information is discovered regarding the Bragg murders, the two friends set out to arrest the lowly killer and find themselves at an impasse when it is also shown that Mrs. French is not who she appears to be.Based on Robert B. Parker's novel, Harris - who co-adapted with Robert Knott  had a field day as the lovesick yet tough as leather Virgil, a man who knows right from wrong but apparently has no druthers to beat a man to a pulp when his hair-triggered temper gets the best of him (in the one truly shockingly violent moment of this otherwise workmanlike Western).Mortensen is equally good as the somewhat silent but very knowledgeable right-arm to Harris' stalwart anti-hero, and their scenes together have a flinty comic brio (the two collaborated previously in David Cronenberg's A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE) and brotherly love that is clearly established to the hilt.Harris' direction is equally impressive with a fine cast of character actors sprinkled in the midst (i.e. gravel-voiced veteran Gammon and Brit Spall as the town assemblymen) and the ace cinematography by experienced lens man Dean Semler is impeccable.I only wish there was more to it in the long run; the final act feels incredibly rushed and the end scene so abrupt it almost felt as if the production had run out of film stock.Nevertheless this oater is a keeper and just seeing fine actors of Harris and Mortensen's ilk on screen makes all the difference.
INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009) **** Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, Diane Kruger, Daniel Bruhl, Til Schweiger, Gedeon Burkhard, Jacky Ido, BJ Novak, Omar doom, August Diehl, Denis Menochet, Sylvester Groth, Martin Wuttke, Mike Myers, Julie Dreyfus, Richard Sammel, Alexander Fehling, Rod Taylor, Soenke Mohring, Samm Levine, Paul Rust, Michael Bacall. (Narration: Samuel L. Jackson; unbilled voice over : Harvey Keitel) Quentin Tarantino's epic homage to WWII 'men on a mission' films like "THE DIRTY DOZEN" gets his ya-yas out big time in the Herculean task of a revenge fantasy involving the titular band of brothers, a platoon of 8 Jewish American soldiers led by the no- guts, no-glory Lt. Aldo Raine (Pitt, chewing every morsel of cinematic sinew from the bone, in QT's nod to film god Aldo Ray), a Hillbilly from hell, who are out to scalp & kill Nazis while a feverish plan to off the German's military elite - including Hitler  in a world premiere event at a French occupied cinema run by survivor Shosanna Dreyfus (the beguilingly stoic Laurent), who also wants blood-soaked revenge for the murders of her family by Nazi detective Col. Hans Landa (Waltz, a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actor, as the evil hubris loving baddie here) whose uncanny knack for finding the truth may be his Achilles' heel. Blood-drenched with enough gallows' humor & QT's signature dialogue spewing get the best of the film's intentions in the long run but how can you fault him when this is clearly a valentine to cinema overall. One of the year's best.
RIGHTEOUS KILL (2008) ** Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Carla Gugino, John Leguizamo, Donnie Wahlberg, Curtis Jackson, Brian Dennehy, Trilby Glover, Alan Rosenberg, Sterling K. Brown, Barry Primus, Melissa Leo. Abysmal crime drama about a serial killer possibly with a cop as the main suspect is only noteworthy for the re-teaming of the dynamic duo of De Niro & Pacino (last on screen in "HEAT") should have had more spark (and originality; the snoozer script by Russell Gewirtz feels like a left-over "Law & Order" episode) and the lame direction by Jon Avnet only makes the logy pacing bogged down in genre clichés (i.e. 'colorful' nicknames of Turk & Rooster for Bobby & Al's characters!) A real let down.
MEET DAVE (2008) ** Eddie Murphy, Elizabeth Banks, Gabrielle Union, Scott Caan, Ed Helms, Kevin Hart, Mike O' Malley, Pat Kilbane, Judah Friedlander, Marc Blucas, Austyn Myers. Harmless yet dopey sci-fi comedy with Murphy in dual roles: a captain of tiny aliens and the spaceship formed in his shape they ride to Earth in a plan to swipe the world's water sources for their own gets the fish-out-of-water treatment when starship Dave becomes friendly with the enemy, namely comely Banks and her son Myers in NYC. While the screenplay by Rob Greenberg and Bill Corbett is pedestrian, Murphy makes up for the mirth with a somewhat return to form employing a lot of physical comedy and even though collaborating with most recent bomb NORBIT's director Brian Robbins the film is a mild diversion for those who have small children and a fascination with size over matter. A few laughs but otherwise regrettably forgettable in the high concept of the wee with the gigantic.
THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU (2011) ***1/2 Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, John Slattery, Anthony Mackie, Terence Stamp, Michael Kelly. Crackling good Philip K. Dick adaptation with a politico (Damon at his low-key best) finding himself the unwitting pawn of a phalanx of the titular 'men-in-hats' who control select persons' fates and futures makes things difficult for the choice in his career climbing ambitions for the love of a beautiful dancer (eternally beguiling Blunt)  wherever the chips may lie. Trippy and provocative with its emotional core stripped to some serious on screen chemistry for the couple in peril and the ramifications of Dick's freewill vs. fascistic state is wonderfully put to task by filmmaker George Nolfi who also did the clever adaptation  a decidedly romantic "1984" if you will.
RACHEL GETTING MARRIED (2008) ***1/2 Anne Hathaway, Rosemarie DeWitt, Bill Irwin, Debra Winger, Mather Zickel, Anna Deavere Smith, Tunde Adebimpe, Anisa George. Hathaway gives an Oscar caliber performance as a young woman currently in rehab who is released tentatively to attend her sister's weekend nuptials and confronting her dark past with moments of clarity all too real for her to deal with. Heartbreaking and heartwarming are equally balanced by filmmaker Jonathan Demme (his best work since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) in this verite documentary feel throughout and a winning screenplay by Jenny Lumet (director Sidney's daughter). A fine ensemble and an arresting supporting turn by Winger as the girls' estranged mother make for a memorable, viscerally real and honest film experience.
THE SESSIONS (2012) **** John Hawkes, Helen Hunt, William H. Macy, Moon Bloodgood, Annika Marks, Adam Arkin, Rhea Perlman, W. Earl Brown, Robin Weigert, Blake Lindsley, Ming Lo, Rusty Schwimmer, Jennifer Kumiyama. Inspiring and life-affirming biopic about Mark O'Brein, a California based poet (Hawkes in an Oscar worthy turn) whose life-long challenge with polio (and using an iron lung to live) faces one more chronic obstacle: losing his virginity. Enter sex surrogate/therapist Hunt (equally deserving of an Academy Award and her best work since her previous winning) who comes to slowly realize just how her own personal life has pitfalls that are enlightened when her new charge adds some light to her drab life. Ben Lewin -who adapted the film from O'Brien's accounts of his encounters with the therapist - smartly allows his actors to make the characters real flesh and blood with warts-and-all dark humor and moments of true poignancy that never borders treacle nor does it do a disservice to the subject - empathy and love among all people -afflictions not-with-standing. One of the year's very best.
THE BRAVE ONE (2007) **1/2 Jodie Foster, Terrence Howard, Nicky Katt, Naveen Andrews, Mary Steenburgen, Jane Adams, Zoe Kravitz. Foster gives another one of her patented flawless performances in a somewhat flawed in execution update for "Death Wish", as an NYC radio personality whose life goes into freefall after being brutally attacked in Central Park by a gang of thugs, resulting in the death of her beloved fiancé,. Determined to make a go of returning to her lifestyle she encounters a sudden change in vengeance leading her into vigilante territories and an unlikely friendship with the police detective (Howard equally strong) investigating the carnage at hand. Although veteran director Neil Jordan gives enough palpable dramatic license for his actors to flex their thespianic muscles the screenplay by Roderick and Bruce A. Taylor and Cynthia Mort fails in the final act which becomes a ludicrous attempt at winning over the crowd.
AVPR: ALIENS VS. PREDATOR  REQUIEM (2007) ** Steven Pasquale, Reiko Aylesworth, John Ortiz, Johnny Lewis, Ariel Gade, Kristen Hager, Robert Joy, Sam Trammell, David Paetkau, Tom Woodruff Jr., Ian Whyte. Better than anticipated ( yet still worlds apart offering from their original sources) sequel of the grudgefest between two of the most lucrative sci-fi monster series this time with an alien infestation on contemporary Earth with the Predator in high pursuit of his intergalactic fugitive quarry. While the human factor is a null and void affair the battle sequences also could've been a tad meatier but it is kinda cool to see these beasties at each others' throats. (Dirs: Colin and Greg Strause)
FAIR GAME (2010) *** Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, Noah Emmerich, David Andrews, Ty Burrell, Jessica Hecht, Norbert Leo Butz, Rebecca Rigg, Brooke Smith, Thomas McCarthy, Adam LeFevre, Sam Shepherd, Polly Holliday. Absorbing and eye-opening true-life conspiracy drama about CIA op Valerie Plame (strident Watts) whose life is turned upside down when the Bush Administration has outed her in retaliation to her outspoken husband Joseph Wilson(Penn equally good) which becomes a down-the-rabbit hole investigation into what really is the price of being a patriot to your own cause (or for worse your country's?) Adapted from both Plames and Wilson's own-account books by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and directed stolidly by Doug Limon as a latter day ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN without the cloak-and-dagger.
LITTLE CHILDREN (2006) ***1/2 Kate Winslet, Patrick Wilson, Jennifer Connelly, Gregg Edelman, Sadie Goldstein, Ty Simpkins, Noah Emmerich, Jackie Earle Haley, Phyllis Somerville, Raymond J. Barry, Helen Carey, Jane Adams, Trini Alvarado. (Dir: Todd Field)Careful What You Wish For: Complacency in Suburban HellSarah Pierce (Winslet in an Oscar worthy performance of intelligence and nuance), is an unhappy housewife who doesn't realize it until it is too late and in the form of a stay-at- home dad named Brad Adamson (Wilson in a solid turn), who too doesn't realize how his inner sadness is about to blossom into something he hadn't expected to harvest in the form of unbridled lust for Sarah, who he meets one day in the local park where the other snarky housewives go to let their children play. Sarah can see through the masks of complacency of her neighboring mothers and deep down resents being one, recognizing that she is a reasonably smart, literate and attractive woman who hungers for something, ANYTHING, in her dull life that she is sharing with her complicit husband Richard (Edelman), whose secret need for online porn is shockingly discovered one day by Sarah giving her license to enact her desires for "The Prom King" (as the nasty mothers have dubbed the good-looking Brad), and the two begin a seemingly warm yet intense affair. Brad's beautiful wife Kathy (Connellly), a free-lance documentary producer, is unknowing at first about the affair which only leads to more tension for Brad who cannot fathom why he is even cheating on her to begin with only knowing that he too craves for something  certainly not his third attempt in taking the bar exam for a career as a lawyer  and finds Sarah's forbidden fruit refreshingly satisfying to his unspoken needs.To add fuel to the fires a recently released pedophile has returned to the neighborhood prompting a parallel storyline involving a co-hort of Brad's, Larry Hedges (veteran character actor Emmerich in arguably his best role to date), a former cop who has a vendetta to make the ex-con's life a living hell by confronting him on many attempts to show a glaring spotlight on the evil infesting the environs.The evil is Ronald James McGorvey (played by one-time child star Haley in a truly amazing comeback nod and a surefire shot for Best Supporting Actor), a slight, balding and bantam weight compact man who lives with his loving elderly mother May (Somerville instilling some decency for the film's moral counters), and seems normal except for his disease of sexual gratification with minors. That is nothing to make light of nor am I suggesting it should be, but it shows that 'evil' is not all horns and capes with smoke but in the small figure of a ruined shell of a man; sympathy for the devil if you like.Based on Tom Perrotta's novel, director Field (who collaborated with the author on the screenplay) continues to impress in his tactile sure-handed methods that he displayed in his debut, "In The Bedroom", which showcased his ability to allow actors room to grow while containing tensions and dread for a showdown at the end with their characters. Again, here he excels and deserves an Academy Award nomination (as well as for the screenplay which is one of the year's absolutely best written). Winslet continues also to impress as the actress of her generation and ascending the mantle of contemporaries like Emma Thompson, her gifts are on full display and she makes Sarah such a well-rounded character inhibited with all the things that make one human: humor, desire, brains, emotion and namely, spirit. Wilson matches her step by step in arguably the more difficult roles of the two in the sense that he is blindly allowing his vanity get the best of him unwittingly; a truly loaded weapon just bound to go off. Connelly does the most with her slight part but her amazing eyes work to full affect when she begins to put two and two together giving the film some antsiness. Emmerich, who I admit is not one of my favorite actors usually is a load, but his disgraced lawman adds depth and underscores the themes perfectly and again not enough can be said for the sad, lonely and ultimately heart-breaking performance for comeback kid Haley in his pathetic, doomed character. The film works on the basic level of the old adage, be careful what you wish for; the same can be said for the movie itself.
DUMB AND DUMBER TO (2014) ** Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, Kathleen Turner, Rob Riggle, Laurie Holden, Rachel Melvin, Steve Tom, Don Lake, Tembi Locke. Dynamic duo Carrey and Daniels reunite with filmmakers Peter & Bobby Farrelly for more knuckle headed mirth with more miss-than-hits in this leaden sequel to the vastly popular gross-out and politically incorrect farce with the dim-witted buds rekindling their friendship to help one another. To wit: Daniels' long-lost daughter may be his saving grace in the hopes of getting a sorely needed kidney transplant while Carrey's starry-eyed would-be romantic doofus only has the hots for her. Ramshackle production (as per usual from the Brothers Farrelly with flat cinematography and odd editing) only hinder the rather uninspired reteaming of its game and go-for-broke comedy team who make it more or less worth seeing for their back-to-where-they-left-of-without-a-hitch chemistry.
BROTHERS (2009) *** Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman, Tobey Maguire, Clifton Collins Jr., Sam Shepard, Mare Winningham, Bailee Madison, Taylor Geare, Patrick Flueger, Jenny Wade, Carey Mulligan, Ethan Suplee. Well acted adaptation of the Swedish film "Brodre" with Gyllenhaal and Maguire (both at the tops of their game) as loving siblings who face a unique crises: while Maguire is away at war in Afghanistan  and presumed dead - his ne'er-do-well brother Gyllenhaal steps up to care for his family including his comely yet heartbroken wife (Portman equally fine here). Filmmaker Jim Sheridan, with a competent screenplay by David Benioff, manages to avoid treacle for the most part and succeeds in this compelling Middle East war parable/morality tale largely due to his talented cast.
THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU (2014) ** Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Jane Fonda, Adam Driver, Rose Byrne, Corey Stoll, Kathryn Hahn, Connie Britton, Timothy Olyphant, Dax Shepard, Debra Monk, Abigail Spencer, Ben Schwartz. Dysfunctional comedy of a family grieving over the recent death of the paterfamilias involving his adult children all flailing about and argumentative while their own lives are in mass disarray sitting shiva as his last dying wish. While Bateman's trademark dry put-upon Everyman schtick glides thru the middling dramedy the supporting cast is more or less stranded by the stilted script adaptation by Jonathan Tropper (based on his novel) and laying it on thick direction by hamfisted, tone deaf Shawn Levy. The supporting cast is game but hard-to-believe anyone is remotely related (or relatable or even likable) which makes the storyline one long wait for something/anything to be resolved.
GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS (1992) **** Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Jonathan Pryce. Razor-sharp adaptation of playwright David Mamet's depiction of real estate as bloodsport with a dynamic cast of heavyweight talent all chomping at the bit for sales on new leads in an office contest where jobs are hanging in the balance. Each actor is given a truly sterling moment to shine either sharing a scene with each other or a great monologue (Baldwin's shark bastard was written especially for the screen and is a classic) to chew on. Lemmon is memorable as Shelley "The Machine" Levene, the dinosaur member who is practically drowning in his own juices. Pacino scored a Best Supporting Actor nod as the flashy Ricky Roma. (DIR: James Foley)
(500) DAYS OF SUMMER (2009) **** Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Zooey Deschanel, Geoffrey Arend, Chloe Moretz, Matthew Gray Gubler, Clark Gregg. A truly wonderfully executed rom/dramedy that has echoes of John Hughes/Cameron Crowe romanticism/whimsy about boy-meets-girl (the amazingly subtle Gordon-Levitt and the deliciously delightful Deschanel, channeling John Cusack from "SAY ANYTHING" and Ally Sheedy from "THE BREAKFAST CLUB" as archetypes of the nice-guy/off-center muse) in sunny LA (never looking better thanks to fantastic camera-work by Eric Steelberg), comes off executed as a mix-tape to the heart in how falling in love can be remarkably schizophrenic/inspring/crazingly difficult/intoxicating/infuriating/admirable/shocking/familiar and practically universal in how one goes from one extreme to the other in attempting to figure out soulmate status or casual sex with leaps and bounds of highly imaginative screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. Marc Webb makes a fantastic directorial debut allowing his main characters free-range in displaying their chops as well as showcasing their personas. A superb soundtrack also helps, namely the charming use of Hall & Oates' "You Make My Dreams Come True" and the ethereally poignant "Bookends" by Simon & Garfunkel. Complex and sublime; one of the year's best films and highly recommended; a must see!
TRANSPORTER 3 (2008) **1/2 Jason Statham, Natalya Rudakova , Robert Knepper, Francois Berleand, Jeroen Krabbe. Statham returns in his signature role as driver for hire/mercenary by trade Frank Martin in this latest over-the-top actioner this time involving delivering package Rudakova, a Ukranian party-doll whose influential father (Krabbe) is put to the screws by baddie Knepper involving ecoterrorism (plot, schmlot!) But the real story is how nattily suited Statham continues to kick ass in this at-times silly yet still entertaining bone-crusher, high octane nonsense. Directed to the hilt by Olivier Megaton (subtlety is not his surname).
THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 (2014) **1/2 Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Colm Feore, Felicity Jones, Paul Giamatti, Sally Field, Chris Cooper(Cameos: Martin Sheen, Embeth Davidtz, Campbell Scott, Denis Leary, Stan Lee) Second chapter in the unnecessary reboot to the Marvel franchise with Spidey facing some big challenges, namely his on-again/off-again relationship with main squeeze Gwen Stacy (real chemistry still burns between Garfield and Stone) and a couple of new foes in the unlikely forms of nerdy tech specialist Max Dillon (Foxx who quite frankly is wasted in the role and barely seems to be enjoying the gig as a villain) AKA Electro (after a freak accident, natch, at Oscorp) and long- lost 'best bud' Harry Osborn (DeHaan -suggesting Leondardo DiCaprio on a meth binge) who is more frenemy if anything (cue - Green Goblin - resembling Gollum on a meth binge) in his to-the-manor-born heir of the nefarious aforementioned conglomerate. While returning helmsman Marc Webb keeps things moving relatively sprightly (including some POV slo-mo action ala "Matrix" when the web head is in action) with his CGI pyrotechniques in overdrive (they don't call him Electro for nothing') the screenplay collaboration of Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner and James Vanderbilt is hit-and-miss in its attempts for balancing darkness and the human element of its tortured Hamlet in tights. Still it is way-cool factor in the fight sequences and battle royal climax cueing up the inevitable Round 3.
UNSTOPPABLE (2010) *** Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson, Ethan Suplee, Kevin Dunn, Kevin Corrigan, Kevin Chapman, Lew Temple, TJ Miller, Jessy Schram. High octane popcorn action flick courtesy of rambunctious filmmaker Tony Scott with a nimble screenplay by Mark Bomback about a runaway freight train with some highly propulsive cargo (supercharged chemicals  go boom!) that is on track to disaster unless erstwhile career engineer Washington and towheaded rookie Pine can attempt to stop the 'missile the size of The Chrysler Building'. Crowd-pleasing thrills and check-your-brain-at-the-box-office frenzied fun with some truly hairy hit-and-miss (literally) moments of genre accredited moments. Hang on!
EVERYTHING MUST GO (2011) *** Will Ferrell, Rebecca Hall, Michael Pena, Laura Dern, Stephen Root, Christopher Jordan Wallace. Ferrell stars as a downward spiraling drunk who has his worst day yet: after being unceremoniously fired from his corporate job he finds his wife has thrown all his worldly possessions out onto their front lawn and locked him out of their home  forcing him to sober up in more ways than one. Based loosely on Raymond Carver's short story "Why Don't You Dance?" newbie filmmaker Dan Rush fleshes out the bare bones storyline by incorporating new characters to interface with Ferrell and the fine cast lends able support to his better-than-expected dramatic turn (shrewdly low-key but humorous as well) that works for what it's worth as a decent dramedy.
SEVERANCE (2007) **1/2 Toby Stephens, Claudie Blakley, Andy Nyman, Babou Ceesay, Tim McInnerny, Laura Harris, Danny Dyer, David Gilliam, Juli Drajko, Judit Viktor, Sandor Boros. "Wes Craven's "THE OFFICE" could've been the pitch for this uneven yet entertaining to a degree hybrid of inane comedy and bloodletting terror about a corporate outing in Hungary with a British arms conglomerate unsuspectedly entering a nightmare when they are detoured into a hellish encampment of crazed psychopaths are lurking, stalking them one by one . Gruesome torturous violence mixed with cutting humor is admittedly not every one's cup of tea but for those in the know should get a kick for the more hit-than-miss dark, bleak satire. (Dir: Christopher Smith)
SOLITARY MAN (2010) ***1/ 2 Michael Douglas, Susan Sarandon, Danny DeVito, Mary-Louise Parker, Jenna Fischer, Imogen Poots, Jesse Eisenberg, Richard Schiff, Olivia Thirlby, Jake Richard Sicilliano, David Constabile, Ben Shenkman, Anastasia Griffith. Douglas is in top form as a self-indulgent well-to-do car salesman who finds himself in tailspin when a few setbacks including the varied relationships in his life with family and lovers which results in a clear-eyed moment of clarity for a suddenly aging lothario who may not be the end result of the sum of his means. Interesting character study by rookies Brian Koppelman and David Levien allows their star a fine role to sink his teeth into (and serious consideration for a Best Actor Oscar); sublimely subtle yet with a dollop of fine gravitas.
JOSHUA (2007) *** Sam Rockwell, Vera Farmiga, Jacob Kogan, Celia Weston, Dallas Roberts, Michael McKean. (Dir: George Ratliff)Sibling Rivalry: A Study in TerrorWhat is it about the need for sibling rivalry in families? Is it simply that one child cannot justify the others' existence except for a battle to be more loved by their parents or is it something altogether an innate, knee-jerk response to a situation that is inevitably stacking the deck against the other in the give-and-take of familial favoritism jockeying for position of good standing?Well the answer is not necessarily found in this disturbing, under-the-skin creepy socio-horror film focusing on an NYC Yuppie couple's newborn daughter brought back to their upscale Central Park West environs and their preternaturally bright, but clearly unstable, young son, Joshua (newcomer Kogan, a real find).The couple, Brad and Abby Cairn (fully fleshed out turns by Rockwell and Farmiga, respectively, both giving career high performances here), are resettling their nest with their new bundle of joy and neglecting to notice how their eldest child is apparently not too pleased with his sudden shift to 'second' favorite child, with all their energies focused on the infant they've welcomed into the world.Joshua is a smart-beyond his years child but he is taking a dark turn with his studies (he takes to the Egyptian method of embalming mummies after a class study breaks his void of finding a niche in something to peak his interests). He's also keenly aware of how his mother's post-partum depression is crippling her sensibilities to the point of mania, manipulating his love for her by picking away at her weak spots (i.e. the baby's constant crying jag that is threatening her sanity) and he can see he is indeed smarter than his father (or so it seems).While hedge-fund organizer Brad is busy at the office he is not as neglectful as it first appears. He clearly loves his family, has a strong if slightly estranged relationship with his devoutly Christian mother (Weston), and enjoys his high-pressured job even if his jerk boss (McKean) can barely tolerate Brad's paterfamilias peccadilloes.When things begin to get difficult (Abby is placed into an institution after an accident causes her to become dependent on painkillers and other meds, and a scary hide-and-seek game with Joshua putting her over the edge), Brad finally sees the forest for the trees and puts a plan into action to keep his baby safe from harm; by any means necessary.The strong acting by the leads buoys the borderline black comedy/camp factor by a thread when the suspense is driven by filmmaker Ratliff, in his first feature film - he helmed HELL HOUSE, a docu on a Christian amusement park aimed at scaring sinners straight  whose screenplay with David Gilbert, another rookie, drives the reality based terror of the aforementioned post-partum depression, family responsibility and the defense mechanism of survival by any means. The eerie, piano jangling score by Nico Muhly and Benoit Debie's foreboding camera-work provide some goosebumps of dread to prick the surface.Rockwell, one of my personal faves and perhaps the most underrated of his (and my) generation, is excellent. The bantam actor walks with a dancer's grace, his retro do suggesting a hep cat who is happy with himself in the world, and sharp features blend nicely into his Brad, who feels his edge on things dwindle not unlike Farmiga's Abby, who has the difficult role of a somewhat unsympathetic character (i.e. a mom incapable of caring for her children to the point of insanity) but acts up a storm in her unorthodox turn.Both make you feel for their desperation and ultimately their last-ditch efforts of keeping their sanities in lock-step. There are distinct echoes of supernatural based 'bad seed' films like THE OMEN (dapper, sober-faced lad with a lethal feel about him; check) and ROSEMARY'S BABY (spooky Upper West Side digs and female protagonist's waif 'do; check) but the line stops there, thankfully, not falling into an easy out (it's The Devil's Child!) but more like a really decent "TWILIGHT ZONE" episode. However the film's final moment feels like a cop out and not an entirely believable close to an otherwise unnerving, nasty slice of the American Dream becoming the American Nightmare.
SOUTHLAND TALES (2007) * Dwayne Johnson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Seann William Scott, Justin Timberlake, Cheri Oteri, Jon Lovitz, Nora Dunn, Amy Poehler, Wallace Shawn, John Larroquette, Miranda Richardson, Holmes Osbourne, Kevin Smith, Curtis Armstrong, Beth Grant, Bai Ling, Mandy Moore, Christopher Lambert, Will Sasso, Zelda Rubinstein. Filmmaker Richard Kelly's folly of a dystopian future in America after a nuclear attack is one big crazy quilt of Lynchian madness and absurd satire with nary a head on its shoulders with its one 'colorful' (read annoying!) character after another and no sense of order except the nightmare it attempts to create is one huge yawn of indifference. Truly a jaw-dropping disbelief in a promising filmmaker (his freshman effort DONNIE DARKO is truly a modern day classic).
THE NATIVITY STORY (2006) ** Keisha Castle-Hughes, Oscar Isaac, Ciaran Hinds, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Stanley Townsend, Alexander Siddig, Nadim Sawalha, Eriq Ebouaney, Stefan Kalipha. By the numbers adaptation about the birth of Christ with a miscast Castle-Hughes in a wooden performance as Mary the Virgin child bride of Joseph (Isaac) who must overcome their faith to prosper in the forthcoming immaculate conception and subsequent arrival of the Messiah is told in a rather staid, far-too-serious and joyless way that is surprising giving the track record of indie filmmaker Catherine Hardwicke. However the locations and the beautiful cinematography by Elliot Davis makes up for the pedestrian screenplay by Mike Rich.
EDGE OF DARKNESS (2010) ***1/2 Mel Gibson, Ray Winstone, Danny Huston, Bojana Novakovic, Shawn Roberts, David Aaron baker, Jay O. Sanders, Denis O'Hare, Damian Young, Caterina Scorsone. Gibson is back after a nearly decade hiatus on screen acting and back in a big way: kicking-ass in this tailor-made vengeance flick. Gibson is a career cop whose estranged daughter (the ethereal Novakovic) when she is brutally murdered in front of him, which leads to his dogged investigation of into the familiar tropes of a shadowy corporation, conspiracy theory melodrama but pulls out all the stops when it comes down to good old revenge (does anyone do heart wrenching anguish as well as Mel??) Director Martin Campbell wisely lets the screws tighten and his star full throttle into the quagmire while the screenplay by William Monahan and Andrew Bovell is lean and mean (based on a popular British TV series).
THE STRANGERS (2008) ** Scott Speedman, Liv Tyler, Kip Weeks, Gemma Ward, Laura Margolis, Glenn Howerton, Alex Fisher, Peter Clayton-Luce. Intriguing set-up for a horror flick: a young couple are alone in a family get-away home in the remote suburbs expecting a romantic weekend instead experience a living nightmare when three masked home-invaders stalk and scare them throughout a hellish ordeal. While promising newcomer Bryan Bertino has some nice touches  silences at first, then unsettling experiences  the tricks of the trade eventually overwhelm and settle for cheap thrills and eventually a nasty, unpleasant ending. Both leads act up a storm and the tension is palpable but overall predictable.
HORRIBLE BOSSES 2 (2014) **1/2 Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, Chris Pine, Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, Jonathan Banks. More-of-the-same sequel with the three dim-witted buddies reteaming in an attempt to self-start a business for themselves find out only to be swindled by a douche father/son team (Waltz and Pine) in the process with them resorting to their would-be-criminal ways in a kidnapping ploy that winds up becoming more than they bargained for. While the three principals' chemistry keeps the bond of idiocy intact the screenplay by Sean Anders, John Morris & Jonathan M. Goldstein & John Francis Daley meanders more into easy-for-laughs vulgarity than any other point of being made comedy with by-the-numbers direction by Anders. Aniston has a field day as her over-sexed boss from hell and Foxx add a bit more flava than the first film. Frequently funny but one big mess altogether.
CHAPPIE (2015) ***1/2 Sharlto Copley, Dev Patel, Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver, Ninja, Yo-Landi Visser, Jose Pablo Cantillo. Superlative sci-fi from wunderkind filmmaker Neill Blomkamp - who co-scripted with Terri Tatchell - set in the not-too-distant future in crime-riddled Johannesberg, South Africa - where a corporate run police force weighs in on its latest tactical ops - a robot with artificial intelligence that can reason, learn and feel emotions in spite of the costs of potential threats to its wielders - to wit: a rag-tag trio of punk criminals out to make a heist with the eponymous prototype (motion-captured to a t by Copley enfusing a child's beguiling awe to everything it comes into contact with) designed by Patel and enviously wanted squashed by his villainous college (Jackman practically gnashing his teeth and growing horns; one of his lesser turns I'm afraid to admit and demeriting the rating by a 1/2 *). Incredible state-of-the-art visual effects, a bombastic yet propelling score by Hans Zimmer and grand mix of epic violence and heart-warming poignancy in this hybrid of "RoboCop" meets "Frankenstein" by way of "E.T". A winning combo of whimsy and wow!
DRINKING BUDDIES (2013) ***1/2 Olivia Wilde, Jake Johnson, Anna Kendrick, Ron Livingston, Ti West, Jason Sudeikis. Relationship comedy about a pair of brewery workers (Wilde, finally showing she can act and has a sense of humor to boot! and Johnson) whose playful flirtatious existence falls into free fall when their significant others throw a few monkey wrenches into the works. Filmmaker Swanberg wisely lets Wilde and Johnson behave as real people and platonic male/female friends do with the undercurrent of sexual tension brimming into a froth while also maintaining the credibility of the old 'duh, they're PERFECT for each other' axiom/chestnut of all classic screwball romcoms. Refreshingly real and at times undeniably spot-on.
THE SPIRIT (2008) **1/2 Gabriel Macht, Samuel L. Jackson, Eva Mendes, Scarlett Johansson, Sarah Paulson, Jaime King, Dan Lauria, Paz Vega, Louis Lombardi, Stana Katic, Eric Balfour. Ambitious yet uneven big screen adaptation of Will Eisner's cult classic comic book hero "The Spirit" (a wan yet amiable Macht) - a dead cop resurrected by mysterious circumstances - with The Octopus (a phoning-it-in Jackson), the city's nefarious gangster, in his sights while dealing with the many sexy women in his life including bad girl Sand Saref (bodacious Mendes having a blast). Contemporary comic book genius Frank Miller's stylistic direction is in vein with his previous work with "Sin City" makes up for the purplish, pulp fiction prose that doesn't always work but when it does ("I'm gonna kill you all kinds of dead" and "Shut up and bleed!" are two better examples) it's aces.
DISTURBIA (2007) **1/2 Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer, Carrie-Anne Moss, David Morse, Aaron Yoo, Jose Pablo Cantillo, Matt Craaven, Viola Davis. Better-than-anticipated Hitchcockian suspensor ala "Rear Window" for the MySpace generation: a teenager under house arrest (equally surprisingly decent LaBeouf, who I normally dread) has little to do to preoccupy his time and begins to spy on his neighbors including the new nubile next-door-neighbor (Roemer) and the creepily quiet neighbor on the other side who may or not be killing off young women in his own home. While Christopher B. Landon & Car Ellsworth's screenplay is a tad trite and pedestrian, director DJ Caruso squeezes out enough taut tension to keep the suspense and action equal to the ever-growing-weary audience to follow the path to the inevitable violent conclusion.
ZERO DARK THIRTY (2012) ***1/2 Jessica Chastain, Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Jennifer Ehle, Harold Perrineau, Mark Strong, Fredric Lehne, Mark Duplass, James Gandolfini, Joel Edgerton, Chris Pratt, Mark Valley. Taut adaptation of the real-life account in the massive manhunt for Osama Bin Laden with a CIA task force scrambling against time in the endless goose chase of Public Enemy No. 1 with worldwide speculations, last-minute decision making and genuine helplessness in the never-ending pursuit for justice and finally redemption on a global scale. Mark Boal's streamlined and sharply woven screenplay is so tightly strung that it manages to pinprick you to reality when a shocking moment of brutal action pops onto the screen, thanks to expert direction by Kathryn Bigelow. The only backward step is the too precise pacing and airlessness throughout but weighing on the slender yet capable shoulders of Chastain, as the rookie CIA analyst whose decade long endeavor brings about the release for millions. The best historical thriller since ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.
TAKE SHELTER (2011) **** Michael Shannon, Jessica Chastain, Tova Stewart, Shea Whigham, Katy Mixon, Kathy Baker. Shannon gives a devastating, pitch-perfect performance  a career high for the journeyman character actor of his generation  and if there's any justice an Oscar nod  as a loving family man suddenly plagued with doomsday nightmares and hallucinations that suggest familial mental illness..or something far more foreboding. Filmmaker Jeff Nichols  who collaborated with Shannon on the equally fine "SHOTGUN STORIES"  expertly blends state-of-the-art CGI sequences of disaster impending while still maintaining the truth/reality of his protagonist and Shannon's Curtis is a decent man (a rare thing on screen these days) whose only flaw is the Achilles' heel of keeping his family (and his wits) about him. Shannon's stoic demeanor is only betrayed by the fantastic body language (a seemingly imposing man slowly imploding) and when Nichols allows one 'showy' showcase of Curtis' rage at a a community supperhall it is with defining merit of a good man pushed to his limits. Not only is the mental health theme prominent but faith in general (God, fellow human beings, self, and of course, family) is questioned with the two at logger-heads in trying to steal Curtis in the process of his dignity and ultimately, his sanity. One of the year's very best and an indie gem; I Urge You To Buy This  Not Rent It when it comes out on DVD.
MARTIAN CHILD (2007) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Bobby Coleman, Amanda Peet, Sophie Okonedo, Joan Cusack, Oliver Platt, Richard Schiff. Melodramatic misfire about a recently widowed sci- fi novelist (Cusack) who decides to adopt a possibly mentally troubled child (newcomer Coleman) who truly believes he is from the Red Planet. While the premise could've been intriguing i.e. is the kid really an alien?- it falls into the "K-PAX" red herring of it doesn't really matter, yet the filmmakers insist on running its gimmicky premise into the ground. Yet Cusack gives a surprisingly affective and strong performance doing all the heavy lifting that his collaboration with director Menno Meyjes (they teamed up previously on "Max") should have had more to offer for himself, and ultimately the audience.
BEE MOVIE (2007) *** (Voices of: Jerry Seinfeld, Renee Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, Patrick Warburton, John Goodman, Chris Rock, Kathy Bates, Barry Levinson, Larry King, Oprah Winfrey, Larry Miller, Megan Mullally, Rip Torn, Michael Richards, Mario Joyner, Jim Cummings, Tom Papa, Carol Leifer, Jeff Altman, David Herman; as themselves: Sting & Ray Liotta) Funny animated fluff about a honey bee named Barry B. Benson (voiced winningly by Seinfeld  who co-scripted - and mined from his comic sensibilities) who wonders if his life has more meaning by thinking  literally  outside the hive when he decides to check out the big world and its human inhabitants, namely a lovely florist (Zellweger doing a lovely bit of acting too), and discovers that their precious honey is being exploited. While the paper-thin premise and punny sense of humor with a few knowing pop culture riffing is the standard, the film is a wonderful explosion of cinematic eye candy thanks to the animating team @ DreamWorks and the fluid direction by Steve Hickner and Simon J. Smith make up for the hit-and-miss production.
IN THE LAND OF WOMEN (2007) *** Adam Brody, Meg Ryan, Kristen Stewart, Mackenzie Vega, Olympia Dukakis, Clark Gregg, Dustin Milligan, Elena Anaya, JoBeth Williams, Ginnifer Goodwin. (Dir: Jon Kasdan)Not A Bad Place to BeCarter Webb (Brody) is a young screenwriter in LA who is in the midst of a mid-life crisis even though he is only 25: his gorgeous exotic actress girlfriend Elena (Bunuel) has dumped him in a diner; his mother (Williams) is despondent over her health debilitating mother (Dukakis) ; and his current gig as a writer for a soft-core porn producer is on the wane. Deciding to hightail it to his native Michigan to check on hi s ailing grandmother, Carter figures he can wait out the doldrums by focusing on writing his dream novel, a recollection of his high school salad days.Upon arrival he finds his grandmother is convinced she is dying, overly medicated, and her house in disarray, Carter has his hands full and to add more fuel to the fire, the neighbors across the street begin to take an interest in the new arrival. Welcomed first by Sarah Hardwicke (Ryan), a pretty suburbanite whose marriage is shaky with her philandering hubby ( Gregg) , she seeks solace in a new ear to speak to and a shoulder to cry on in Carter, whose own fragile state needs nurturing. The two new friends bond quickly in morning walks around the autumnal neighborhood and Carter begins to fall in love with her. Added to the mix are Sarah's daughters Lucy (Stewart), a high school age artist who resents her mother for no good reason except for atypical adolescent rebellion, and precocious Paige (Vega). Lucy invites Carter on a 'date' with her and her sister to the local mall where they probe the young man and his droll demeanor is a unique experience for the sisters, enabling Lucy a new possibility when her love for the high school quarterback is going unfounded. Carter finds himself in the unusual position of a near-love-triangle when Lucy begins to crush on him while he is developing stronger feelings for Sarah, especially when she discovers she has breast cancer, causing the trio to reflect on their respective lives and figuring out what to do best for everyone (and themselves). Written and directed by Jon Kasdan (son of filmmakers Lawrence and bro of Jake, respectively) with a keen ear for witty, meaningful dialogue the film echoes THE GRADUATE and the more recent redux of GARDEN STATE in finding a likable, brainy introverted good- hearted every guy rekindling romance by returning to his past and uncertain of hi s future (let alone his present). A tad quirky but well-meaning blend of drama and comedy the film succeeds in making all its characters interesting even though some border on cruel caricature (i.e. the grandmother entering senility) with heartfelt emotion conquering its drawbacks (namely its abrupt seemingly tacked on and far-too-rushed ending). Brody, best known for TV's THE OC, ha s a Tom Hanks likability here with his dry, wry and under-the-surface sad Carter and Stewart (best known as Jodie Foster's tomboy daughter in PANIC ROOM) proves to be a talent to watch as well as Ryan giving her best performance in years making her character more than someone to be pitied."In the Land Of Women", despite its clunky sci-fi worthy moniker, is not a bad place to be.
MONSTERS (2010) * Whitney Able, Scoot McNairy. Seriously disappointing 'monster' film set in the all-too-near future (aren't they always?) with an 'infected' area of Mexico where alien microbes have manifested into gi-normous squidlike beasties running amok while intrepid yet reluctant photojournalist is enlisted by his powerful boss to escort his daughter back to the States with nothing but trouble ahead. While erstwhile newbie filmmaker Gareth Edwards belabors the points of 'illegal aliens' and 'extraterrestrial aliens' and "us" vs. "them" to the point a bal peen hammer to the skull would be beneficial to the audience benumbed by the obnoxious pair (i.e. seriously neither have a celphone or can't figure out the thunderous noises in the all-too-near distance are the titular creatures???!!!! OY!) The few moments (maybe 5 full minutes) of the monstrosities are effortlessly CGI'd into the docudrama-like proceedings at hand with remarkable skill; now would it have killed them to have them on more often? The most disappointing sci-fi chiller since "PARANORMAL ACTIVITY"; yeah you heard me!
SHAME (2011) *** ½ Michael Fassbender, Carey Mulligan, James Badge Dale, Nicole Beharie, Lucy Walters, Charisse Bellante, Chazz Menendez. Fascinating yet depressing character study about a NYC sex addict (Fassbender in a tour-de-force, Oscar-worthy performance sure to sky-rocket him to international fame) whose 'fixes' can't come fast enough and only hampered when his equally psychologically damaged sibling Mulligan (equally compelling and award pendings) who re-enters his life with disastrous results in the process. Co-written with Abi Morgan, filmmaker Steve McQueen wisely depicts a likable character with a downward spiral most unsavorily with details none would otherwise experience and the ultimate decisions facing a daily habit to hard to break. Fassbender transcends the possible sordidness by allowing his vulnerability to lurk just beneath the surface while the polar opposite Mulligan clearly is heading for a breakdown; you'll never be able to hear "New York, New York" again without thinking of her poignantly saddened interpretation. Personal note: nice job to my bud Menendez ("Hey Romeo!") ; good on ya sir!
MARRIED LIFE (2008) *** Pierce Brosnan, Chris Cooper, Patricia Clarkson, Rachel McAdams. Cross-between a valentine to Douglas Sirk melodramas and Hitchcock suspenser more the former than the latter  about a '40s era adulterous husband (well performed by a low-key Cooper) whose affair with a beautiful younger woman (McAdams in her best role since "The Notebook" ) leads him to contemplating murdering his wife (Clarkson equally good) rather than cause pain by divorce. Based on the John Bingham book "Five Roundabouts to Heaven" filmmaker Ira Sachs' adaptation with scribe Oren Moverman makes a decent effort with a tried-and-true genre film with excellent period detail and a surprisingly strong turn by Brosnan as Cooper's best friend who has designs for McAdams and provides narration in the process.
ESCAPE PLAN (2013) *** Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Caviezel, Faran Tahir, Amy Ryan, Sam Neill, Vincent D'Onofrio, Vinnie Jones. Stallone and Schwarzengger are back (again) in this well-oiled prison break action flick with Sly as an expert in breaking out of maximum secure prisons who finds himself betrayed after being abducted and thrown into a brand new facility run by a sadistic warden (whispery smooth Caviezel). Ah-nold is a fellow prisoner who has some high-stakes info that can help them both break out. The fun and fast- moving script by Miles Chapman and Jason Keller proves to be MacGyver gimmicky yet intriguing while director Mikael Hafstrom lets his rock 'em sock 'em stars get their ya-yas out with plenty of fight sequences and all-out action tropes. Return to form for the '80s action icons (at last together again).
A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD (2013) *** Bruce Willis, Jai Courtney, Sebastian Koch, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Yuliya Snigir, Radivoje Bukvic, Cole Hauser, Pasha D. Lychnikoff. Somewhat underwhelming mash-up of all the other chapters of the DIE HARD series with an ever world- weary John McClane facing the odds against tyranny this time attempting to reunite with his estranged son (Courtney), a CIA agent in over his head in attempting to escort a Russian political prisoner to sanctuary involving weapons of mass destruction (and destruction in the lush svelte form of Snigir). While director John Moore piles on the action in trowels with little character development and logy plotting by Skip Woods the actioner sputters in areas when adrenaline should be pumping (but the hairy climax is a doozy). Yippie-Kay-Yayanother sequel?
OBVIOUS CHILD (2014) **1/2 Jenny Slate, Jake Lacy,Gaby Hoffman, Gabe Liedman, David Cross, Richard Kind, Polly Draper. Fine comedic vehicle tailor-made for sweet Slate as a novice Brooklyn stand-up comic who winds up having a truly terrible time when he is dumped by her asinine boyfriend for another gal pal, finds herself being suddenly downsized and then after a meet/cute hook-up with a super nice collegiate square (Lacy) discovers she's pregnant. What could've been a zany comedic premise thankfully askews itself to a smart story about making decisions (including abortion) with frank honesty and sentiment without treacle. While novice Gillian Robespierre - who co-wrote the clever screenplay with Karen Maine and Elisabeth Holm - adapts her short-film the movie itself feels it could've in fact been even broadened out with the ensemble cast of game players (including a freshly sardonic Hoffman as Slate's BFF and vets Kind and Draper as her supportive divorced parents). Slate is the best part of the film who goes from sunny to sullen to self-deprecation at the drop of a hat and shows her skills at being a natural comedic actress worthy of bigger showcases. Just wish the film was just a bit More the sum of its parts.
A SINGLE MAN (2009) *** Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Nicolas Hoult, Matthew Goode, Ginnifer Goodwin, Jon Kortajarena, Paulette Lamori, Lee Pace. (uncredited v/o : Jon Hamm) Firth gives an Oscar-calibre (and ultimately well-deserved nomination) and career high performance as a closeted homosexual English professor circa 1962 whose inner pain from losing his partner in a car accident has led his despair to a final day of acceptance  a pact to kill himself  that ultimately proves to be a true life lesson. First-time filmmaker  and one time fashion maven/maverick  Tom Ford certainly has a painterly eye for fine detail and impeccable recreated feel of the era but it is truly Firth's turn as a deeply wounded and troubled man facing the abyss that is heartbreaking and fulfilling all at once. A real gem of acting by a underrated thespian.
SPLICE (2010) *** Adrien Brody, Sarah Polley, Delphine Chaneac, Brandon McGibbon, Simona Maicanescu, David Hewlett, Abigail Chu. Sci-fi thriller hybrid of "Frankenstein"; "The Island of Dr. Moreau"/"Species" and Cronenbergian fear of the flesh fantasia in this absorbing tale of genetic splicing gone amok in the careful-what-you-wish-for-don't  mess-with-Mother Nature  tropes that still are buoyed by strong acting from its leads Brody & Polley who face their biggest challenge in containing their latest creation  "Dren" (wonderfully portrayed by Chu as a child and kudos to the ethereal Chaneac as the full-grown 'adult')  whose unique blend of human DNA with many animal mutations results in a chilling cocktail of playing God for a price. Sleekly directed by Vincenzo Natali (who co-wrote the smart screenplay with Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor with some amazing CGI/make-up visual effects seamlessly blended making "Dren" a vision of reviled beauty. Guillermo del Toro is one of the executive producers.
ROCKY BALBOA (2006) *** ½ Sylvester Stallone, Burt Young, Antonio Tarver, Geraldine Hughes, Milo Ventimiglia, Tony Burton, A.J. Benza, James Francis Kelly III, Pedro Lovell. (cameo: Talia Shire) The best of the "Rocky" franchise since the original! Surprisingly the sequel no one wanted (perhaps a reflection to the metaphor for the titular character all along no?) is more than entertaining, competent, heart-felt and rousing than anticipated with the aging Italian Stallion making a reluctant comeback when he's arranged for an exhibition bout with the current champ, Mason "The Line" Dixon (real life boxer Tarver), an arrogant whose popularity is on the wane. Mixed with helpings of hokum, humor and again  heart  Stallone, who wrote & directed, makes his amiable pugilist a true icon of the American Dream. Cue Bill Conti's rousing theme!
PIRATE RADIO (2009) *** Philip Seymour Hoffman, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans, Nick Frost, Rhys Darby, Katherine Parkinson, Chris O'Dowd, Tom Broke, Will Adamsdale, Jack Davenport, Talulah Riley, Ralph Brown, January Jones, Emma Thompson. Wonderfully wacky comedy set in the UK during the swinging '60s where a platoon of colorful radio disc jockeys rocked the boat (the film's original title by the way) with the stodgy government (see stick-up-his-arse Branagh as the main villain) in what was considered 'risque' entertainment for the young, influential masses. Filmmaker Richard Curtis' patented blend of mirth and emotion work well against the backdrop of the Golden Age of Rock & Roll (a truly stellar soundtrack!) that only gets a little too in love with itself by the film's rollicking end; but it's only rock and roll and I like it!!
SNAKES ON A PLANE (2006) ** Samuel L. Jackson, Julianna Margulies, Nathan Phillips, Rachel Blanchard, Bobby Cannavale, Flex Alexander, Kenan Thompson, Keith Dallas, Lin Shaye, Bruce James, Sunny Mabrey, Todd Louiso, Byron Lawson. The title says it all in a new low in mediocrity of bad/good B- movie cheesy horror films that is only memorable for its pre-release Internet buzz that proved hype doesn't sell might. Jackson -steadily losing all big-screen credibility continues his streak of "What The F****?" choices of late - as a Federal Agent escorting a witness to a mob killing has his hands full on a commercial airliner from Honolulu to LA with the titular reptiles posing a deadly menace to all on board. Hearkening back to '70s disaster films and third rate chillers the film fails to contain any true enjoyment and the mostly CGI snakes are not very scary. (DIR: David R. Ellis)
TURISTAS (2006) * Josh Duhamel, Melissa George, Olivia Wilde, Desmond Askew, Beau Garrett, Max Brown, Agles Steib, Miguel Lunardi. "Hostel" goes Brazilian could've been the slapped together pitch for this anemic fright fest with atypical attractive yet stupid young adults unknowingly in harms way with a trio of American friends and a duo of Brits finding themselves in deep trouble in the unfriendly jungles of South America when they are on the menu as unwilling organ donors. Laughable dialogue ("You don't mind if I take my top off do you?" to wit), horrible acting, inept direction and in spite of some close-up on the gore factor very little to be scared of except the fact that the American horror film is in sad shape. (Dir: John Stockwell)
EDGE OF TOMORROW (2014) *** Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Brendan Gleeson, Bill Paxton, Jonas Armstrong, Tony Way, Kick Gurry, Franz Drameh, Drgomir Mrsic, Charlotte Riley, Masayoshi Haneda, Terence Maynard, Noah Taylor. SOURCE CODE meets GROUNDHOG DAY by way of Philip K. Dick could have been the pitch for this hybrid sci-fi vehicle for Cruise as a callow, cowardly military PR man in the midst of a cosmic calamity: invading malevolent aliens hellbent on destroying mankind hurl him into a never-ending time-loop video game-like reset each time he's killed. The crux is to relive his death for the common good and remember every step of the doomed battle to ensure a better strategy with time running out and the only one who will listen to him is a warrior soldier (a game Blunt) who is a kindred spirit of sorts. Mixed with a dark sense of humor sprinkled amidst the carnage and somewhat predictable trappings of the sub genre yet engaging thanks to its star and a fast- moving, quick-witted screenplay adaptation by veteran scribe Christopher McQuarrie and Jez & John-Henry Butterworth based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel "All You Need Is Kill" and director Doug Liman's swift momentum of brain and brawn in equal measures.
EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) Strained 'sequel' to "BRUCE ALMIGHTY" with Carell's jerk anchorman Evan Baxter leaving TV to begin his stint as a freshman Congressional rep has his hands full when God (Freeman reprising his holy role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like Noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have). The Godforsaken sitcom-y script by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow is absolutely lame and only Carell's amiable persona transcends his vain Evan into something resembling a human being. The end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 M for the CGI F/X). Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant. Sacrilegiously unfunny. (Dir: Tom Shadyac)
THE PROMOTION (2008) **1/2 Sean William Scott, John C. Reilly, Jenna Fischer, Gil Bellows, Fred Armisen, Lili Taylor, Rick Gonzalez, Adrian Martinez, Masi Oka. Writer/director (the latter, his debut) Steve Conrad attempts to do for supermarket politics what "Office Space" and "The Office" did for working in an office succeeds for the most part in this amusing comedy of errors when a young assistant manager (Scott) thinks he's a shoo-in for a new branch of the grocery store he works in until a new transplant from a Canadian sister store (Reilly) arrives as the fly-in-the-ointment who only makes things more problematic in the process. While there are some funny situations here and there the film loses its tone/ momentum in its hesitancy to be either a black comedy or a go-for-the-throat parody of deadening jobs and the regrets one have for never achieving their dreams.
RESCUE DAWN (2007) **** Christian Bale, Steve Zahn, Jeremy Davies, Toby Huss, Marshall Bell, Zach Grenier. Absorbing and first-rate real-life account of American US Fighter pilot Dieter Dengler (Bale, in arguably a career high performance, perhaps his best to date) shot down in Laos during the Vietnam War circa 1965, and his harrowing experience in attempting to survive and escape his abductors' brutal torture, imprisoning him with several other POWs. Based on, and re-directed by, master German filmmaker Werner Herzog, LITTLE DIETER NEEDS TO FLY, his 1997 documentary about Dengler  who succumbed to ALS in '01  the current incarnation is a stupendous, mind-numbing horror film cum triumph of the human spirit realized with some truly unforgettable moments  and for me, one sudden and swiftly unnerving death that still shakes me to think about it; not in recent memory has that ever occurred! Zahn gives an Oscar worthy turn in his best turn as well as fellow American prisoner whose desperation is so apparent it is truly one of the most heart-breaking performances ever committed to film. One of the year's best films.
HANNIBAL RISING (2007) **1/2 Gaspard Ulliel, Gong Li, Rhys Ifans, Dominic West, Richard Brake, Kevin McKidd, Stephen Walters, Ivan Marevich, Charles Maquignon, Aaron Thomas, Helena Lia Tiachovska, Ingenborga Dapkunaite, Richard Leaf. Better than anticipated and evenly paced prequel to the legacy of Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter, showing the origins of the notorious good doctor's WWII era beginnings as a survivor of a horrible encounter with Nazi soldiers which trigger his thirst for bloody vengeance. Newcomer Ulliet eerily channels Anthony Hopkins' slithery good manners and the screenplay by Thomas Harris, based on his own novel (and the preceding ones as well) attempts to showcase some of the touchstones of what made him the way he is but in the end only suggests the things to come. Bloody violence (but not bloody enough for my likings;) and a fine production design by Allan Starski stand out in this otherwise pedestrian thriller. (Dir: Peter Webber)
THE UNBORN (2009) **1/2 Meagan Good, Gary Oldman, James Remar, Odette Yustman, Cam Gigandet, Jane Alexander, Ethan Cutkosky, Atticus Shaffer, Carla Gugino. Fair occult thriller mix of THE OMEN, THE EXORCIST & ROSEMARY'S BABY - a trifecta of the '70s if you will  about a teenager (hottie Good) who discovers her dead-in-utero twin 'Jumby" - is haunting her as a dybbuk  a Jewish spirit at unrest  who desires to be born anewat any cost. While filmmaker David S. Goyer does his best to get a goosey jolt every now and then (dig that creepy upside down head of a bull terrier - think Spuds MacKenzie on a bender!) the film suffers from inert acting by its lead and the all-too-familiar set-ups, including the ridiculous final climax that spins its wheels in mysticism nonsense.
BLADES OF GLORY (2007) ** ½ Will Ferrell, Jon Heder, Amy Poehler, Will Arnett, Jenna Fischer, Craig T. Nelson, William Fichtner, Nick Swarsdon, Andy Richter, Rob Corddry, William Daniels (Cameos, as themselves: Scott Hamilton, Jim Lampley, Peggy Fleming, Brian Boitano, Nancy Kerrigan, Dorothy Hamill) Frequently funny comedy spoofing world champion figure skating pitting arch rival men's skaters Ferrell and Heder into a compromising position when they are ousted as individual competition, forcing them to become a male partner pairing with a decent blend of slapstick, homophobic parodying and a game cast of comic actors making up for the somewhat one-note script by Jeff & Craig Cox, coming off as Farrelly Brothers lite. (Dirs: Josh Gordon & Will Speck)
RANGO (2011) **** (voices of: Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty, Bill Nighy, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Stephen Root, Harry Dean Stanton, Ray Winstone & Timothy Olyphant) Quick-witted "Walter Mitty"-esque chameleon (Depp at his liveliest with a Kermit the Frog on acid affectation) winds up unwittingly lost in the desert town of Dirt, where he finds himself the self-appointed duties of the drought-plagued crittery citizenry faced with a corrupt tortoise mayor (Beatty channeling John Huston) and a gang of outlaws in the way. A splendid visual animated feast for the eyes (dig those earth-tones color schemes for the arid environs!) and aural sensation for the quick/sharp dialogue thanks to John Logan's screenplay collaboration with James Ward Byrkit and the inventive director GoreVorebinski (harkening back to classic Warner Bros' Looney Tunes echoing in the canyons). Some inspired riffing on cinema including a take of APOCALYPSE NOW's "Flight of The Valkyries" bat-attack; the storyline of "CHINATOWN" and the revelation of The Spirit of The West in the iconic form of Clint Eastwood's "the Man-With-No-Name" spaghetti westerns. The only genuine surprise is the film was not one of the myriad choices of 3-D as of late and while it surely doesn't need it, it feels like it was for its tactile artistry. One of the year's finest surprises and best films to boot.
THE OTHER GUYS (2010) *** ½ Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, Eva Mendes, Michael Keaton, Steve Coogan, Rob Riggle, Damon Wayans, Jr., Bobby Cannavale, Ray Stevenson, Tess Kartel, Lindsay Sloane, Natalie Zea, Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson (Narrator: Ice T); (Cameos as themselves: Derek Jeter, Brooke Shields, Rosie Perez, Tracy Morgan) Hilarious send-up of buddy cop comedies a la "LETHAL WEAPON" with Ferrell and Wahlberg making an inspired and highly unlikely  comic team of cops: one an uptight,Ps&Qs polite-to-a-fault doofus accountant and the the other a demoted hot-head raring for action (guess who plays which roles?) The duo find themselves up against a Ponzi-scheming Wall Street weasel (enter the always reliant Coogan) and a system of fellow brothers-in-blue who make things unbearable overall. Nonsensical non-sequitars ("America!!"); double & triple entendres; slapstick silliness and the usual hi-jinks (a running gag of the unbelievably hot wife  the lush Mendes true-to-form  as Ferrell's (who has a buried secret past; one word: "Gator"!) make for an uproariously funny comedy of errors and the genre's macho factors to the hilt (thanks to director & co-conspirator in crime with Ferrell, Adam McKay who cameos as "Dirty Mike" ('nuff said!")  and his flair for as much property damage as possible (cue : exploding fireballs & helicopters!) It's a win/win (and a nice job by the wily Keaton getting a few bizarre moments as the haranguing/harangued captain). One of the year's funniest comedies.
OLDBOY (2013) **1/2 Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen, Sharlto Copley, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Imperioli, Pom Kelmentieff, James Ransone, Max Casella, Linda Emond, Lance Reddick, Hannah Ware, Richard Portnow, Hannah Simone. Spike Lee's unnecessary but not-as-bad-as-anticipated remake of Chan-wook Park's 2003 Korean neo noir cult hit with Brolin as an unrepentant advertising rep who finds himself imprisoned by an unknown enemy for twenty years and then suddenly and just as inexplicably released to resolve who his tormentor is and why he has suffered for his captivity .and to plan his vengeance. The fight sequences are on track and just as bloody as the original film's while Brolin embodies a man who is attempting to come to terms of his own ugliness within while seeking balance with something to better it including Olsen as a newfound friend who helps him put the pieces of the puzzle together.
BATTLE: LOS ANGELES (2011) ** ½ Aaron Eckhart, Ramon Rodriguez, Michelle Rodriguez, Bridget Moynahan, Michael Pena, Ne-Yo. Sci-fi actioner with aliens invading Earth and a platoon of Marines  led by staff sergeant Eckhart (at his square-jawed finest)  out to prevent LA from being completely wiped out and saving civilians in the process. While the overwrought video f/x have the appeal of a video game and its "Saving Private Ryan " meets "Aliens" meets "Blackhawk Down" meets "Indepence Day" hybridization of action-packed sci-fi tropes are all-too familiar the better-than-anticipated genre flick gets some skillful direction by Jonathan Liebesman and laundry-list screenplay by Chris Bertolini makes a diverting if headache-inducing (all that shaky cam! Enough!) diversion for the popcorn munching armchair generals out there.
SON OF RAMBOW (2008) ***1/2 Bill Milner, Will Poulter, Jessica Hynes, Jule Sitruk. Ed Westwick. Heartwarming coming-of-age dramedy circa 1982 in the UK about two young boys  one a creative, introvert grieving his father's death, the other a juvenile delinquent who's own family barely cares for him (Milner and Poulter, respectively, and equally excellent)  who bond over "First Blood" and commit to making a short sequel for a local film contest that results in a unique, loving friendship and the joy of creating something from scratch to call your own; a truly remarkable film by Garth Jennings (who wrote and directed) with some great ensemble work by a cast of largely unknowns on this shore; hopefully this film will remedy that right quick. Funny, touching and ultimately a winner.
YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN (2008) **1/2 Adam Sandler, Emmanuelle Chriqui, John Turturro, Nick Swardson, Lainie Kazan, Ido Mosseri, Rob Schneider, Michael Buffer, Shelley Berman, Dina Doron, Alec Mapa, Kevin Nealon. (Cameos: Chris Rock, Dave Matthews; George Takei, Bruce Vilanch, Kevin James, John McEnroe, and Mariah Carey as themselves) Frequently hilarious fish-out-of-water with Sandler as a hummas-loving Mossad counterterrorist agent desperately wanting to get out of 'the life' and pursue his dream in America : to become a hair stylist (!) High-concept ridiculousness ensues thanks to a game cast, a surprisingly decent performance (and Israeli accent to boot too) by Sandler (who co- scripted the hit-and-miss comedy with Robert Smigel  who has a bit part, and quite frankly the film is an extended version of their SNL skit "Sabra Shopping Network"), and comedy maven Judd Apatow), and some sweet chemistry with the waysexy Chriqui as the Palestinian hair salon owner who reluctantly allows him to learn the trade. Slapstick, one-liner zingers and some equally surprising political commentary (i.e. a laugh-out loud moment where Turturro's terrorist, The Phantom, plays paddle-ball using a grenade with Zohan is perhaps the best way to transcribe the Middle Eastern strife the likes of Mad Magazine come to life). Laugh yourself silly. (DIR: Dennis Dugan)
THE SPECTACULAR NOW (2013) ***1/2 Miles Teller, Shailene Woodley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kyle Chandler, Brie Larson, Masam Holden, Dayo Okeniyi, Bob Odenkirk, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Wonderful coming-of-age teen dramedy based on Tim Tharp's novel about a happy-go-lucky high school senior (Teller uncannily getting in touch with his inner John Cusack) whose philosophy of the title has him drifting until he meets a sweet girl in his graduating class (Woodley in easily the breeziest performance of a teenager ever) who anchors him in all the right ways, including love. Smart/funny screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber works incredibly well with James Ponsoldt's straight-forward clear-eyed direction with echoes of Cameron Crowe and John Hughes, involving all the pitfalls of adolescence and heartbreak along the path of adulthood. Seek this indie gem out!
THE TOWN (2010) *** Ben Affleck, Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, Blake Lively, Slaine, Owen Burke, Titus Welliver, Pete Postlethwaite, Chris Cooper. Well-executed sophomore effort by Affleck  going the full Eastwood (acting/directing/co-scripting adaptation of Chuck Hogan's novel "Prince of Thieves" with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard)  about a team of Boston-area bank robbers whose latest knockoff has them in hot water namely in the lovely form of Hall (aces), a bank teller they hold hostage (and Affleck falls for) that has the feds (led by tenacious Hamm) hot on their tracks. Affleck pulls off the yeoman workload with finesse and allows his characters room to mix and mingle (notably a superb turn by hot-headed Renner as his childhood chum and loose cannon). Using the locations and local flavor to his reckoning the film feels fresh in an otherwise been-there-done-that caper drama.
WRECK- IT RALPH (2012) **** (VOICES OF : John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, Adam Carolla, Alan Tudyk, Mindy Kaling, Joe Lo Truglio, Ed O'Neill, Dennis Haysbert, Edie McClurg, Rachael Harris, Rich Moore, Horatio Sanz.) Fun-tastic Disney animated comedy about video game 'villain' Wreck-It Ralph (wonderful work by Reilly) whose conflict ion in celebrating the 30th anniversary of his work dovetails with his desire to no longer be the 'bad guy' and takes it upon himself to become a hero, in spite of possibly destroying other games in the process. Funny, fast, frenetic and dazzlingly candy colored confection that will have gamers (and non-gamers) digging the pop culture riffing on the genre's characters (a great bit is a take on a support group for villains ala Alcoholic Anonymous! a big risk for a family film that pays off its gambit with guffaws). Great vocal work by McBrayer as 'nemesis'/friend Fix-It Felix, Jr. whose sweetness is his Achilles' heel; Lynch as a Sigourney Weaver/Ripley action heroine named Calhoun is very tough and sexy (yes sexy as in Jessica Rabbit sexy!) and the scene-stealing (film stealing) Silverman as the caffeinated pixie 'glitch' Vanellope who befriends and bedevils Ralph is a real wonder to watch (dare I say an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress? yes I do). A lively, smart original screenplay by Phil Johnston, Jennifer Lee, Jim Reardon and the director Rich Moore keeps things at full-throttle. Takes animated family fare to the next level! One of the year's best films and surprises.
CATFISH (2010) *** Part social experiment, part quasi-documentary this absorbing navel-gazing character study and glance into the funhouse mirror of the Internet  specifically a Facebook acquaintance relationship becoming something even more as not-so-reluctant subject Nev, the brother of filmmaker Ariel Schulman and friend of co-auteur Henry Joost, finds himself in a unique situation: an infatuation with a seemingly very open and artistic Mid-western family who seem to get their emotional hooks into his unsuspecting yet yielding good nature for the best of him until some events just don't add up. What results is a fascinating culture-clashing neo-Hitchcockian investigation into the psyche of a nation's latest fixation with a fairly novel yet addictive service (a Facebook account, to wit) and the ramifications of being open and closed at the same time. Until the third act's fairly predictable yet illuminating conclusion the film holds up very well (despite the ham-fisted promotion as a 'thriller' with its very misleading and unfortunate trailers) as a barometer for what it means to take a leap of faith and what a friendship (should)entails.
HARRY BROWN (2010) *** Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, Charlie Creed-Miles, David Bradley, Iain Glen, Sean Harris, Ben Drew, Jack O' Connell, Jamal Downey, Lee Oakes, Joseph Gilgun, Liam Cunningham, Liz Daniels, Klariza Clayton.Michael Caine is one of those actors who seemingly has been around forever (and pretty much has been for over 40 odd years) and is one of those movie stars that surely belongs in the pantheon of The Golden Age of thesps previous to his career (i.e. Spencer Tracy, Henry Fonda, Laurence Olivier, et al) and we seem to take for granted he will continue to be so. But the reality is the most hardest working film actor (at one point in the 80s he & Gene Hackman- his American compatriot  seemed in a dead-lock for appearing in seemingly every film made during the past four decades!) is in his seventies now and has been still appearing in quality work but nothing lasts forever.Until then we have to settle for films like this  not the best but still worthy of watching a master actor at the top of his game, showcasing his craft  in this gritty, yet predictable vigilante thriller with Caine delivering the goods as a recently widowed ex-Marine whose golden years are simply an oxymoron of the cruelest. Living in London's bleak urbane projects system, the pensioner is basically just waiting to join his dearly departed (his wife has just succumbed to a hospital-bed demise of unknown origins and a daughter apparently passed at a very young age)when he's not passing the hours playing chess in the local pub with his sole pal, fellow codger Leonard Atwell (David Bradley), he's dodging the drug-dealing gangs that have invaded his turf like an incurable disease.When Len expresses his own fears and how he's going to handle the next disturbance (brandishing a WWII era bayonets' knife in his overcoat), Harry can foretell things are not going to bode well (and they do not for poor Len who winds up at the wrong end of his bladepermanently).The police come to ask a few questions and the lead on the case D.I. Alice Frampton (Mortimer) seems to have an unspoken personal stake as well in the investigation.What follows is predictable in that Harry decides to take matters into his own hands, only after he too is assailed by one of Len's attackers and his vendetta is an unspoken truce he seems to have made with himself: it's either them or me.While this easily can be compared to the echoes of Clint Eastwood's "Gran Torino", a graying hard-as-nails avenger taking the p*ss out of the dregs of society, newbie filmmaker Daniel Barber's slow-and-steady wins the race pacing of Gary Young's thoroughly matter-of-fact script, in having Harry still retain some of his other characteristics (i.e. emphysema and the general creaks and groans of the aged) yet it is a decent display of Caine's range as fierce and fearful mix that makes Harry something more: human.
DREAMGIRLS (2006) ***1/2 Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy, Jennifer Hudson, Anika Noni Rose, Danny Glover ,Keith Robinson, Sharon Leal, Hinton Battle, Loretta Devine, John Krasinski, John Lithgow. Lavish and excellent adaptation of the famous Broadway musical about the triumphs and travails of '60s R&B performers The Dreams (loosely based on Diana Ross & The Supremes), and the mechanics devised by Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Foxx), a used car salesman turned music impresario (a truly cunning metaphor if there ever was one) whose betrayals to his lover Effie Melody White (newcomer Hudson in an Oscar-worthy turn), the real talent of the trio, and to legend-in-the-making entertainer James "Thunder" Early (Murphy, in arguably the role of his career, equally impressive), sets the plots in motion where the American Dream gets a complete makeover. Director Bill Condon does a masterful job of old-school razzle dazzle and Hollywood panache as well as his screenplay making the characters come alive and again Hudson gives an amazing show-stopping turn with "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" burns down the house.
SHORT TERM 12 (2013) ***1/2 Brie Larson, John Gallagher, Jr., Kaitlyn Dever, Stephanie Beatriz, Rami Malek, Alex Calloway, Kevin Hernandez, Keith Stanfield, Frantz Turner. Remarkable dramedy about a foster care facility and its close and troubled relationships between faculty and residents. Larson gives an incredible performance as the lead staffer whose own personal demons threaten to unbalance her loving boyfriend/co-worker (Gallagher, equally affective and a truly natural performance) when a new arrival tween (Dever, ditto) proves to be a challenge all are not prepared for. Novice filmmaker Destin Cretton makes an indelible debut giving his actors plenty of freedom to inhabit their believable roles while the organic quality of the storyline does not hammer one over the head about the issues at hand (abused kids and long- term psychological damage often go hand in hand) yet is powerfully humane. An indie gem and a must see(k).
NATIONAL TREASURE: BOOK OF SECRETS (2007) **1/2 Nicolas Cage, Justin Bartha, Diane Kruger, Jon Voight, Helen Mirren, Ed Harris, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Greenwood, Ty Burrell. Not bad sequel with Cage and company reprising their adventure-seeking roles this time Cage has to clear his family's name in having one of his ancestors supposedly involved with the Lincoln assassination(!) leads to all sorts of convolutions and cliff-hanging action and Mirren as his mom, and ex-wife of Voight, and Harris in his umpteenth villain role, adds some class to the otherwise enjoyable yet forgettable popcorn franchise chapter. (Dir: Jon Turteltaub)
FACTORY GIRL (2007) *** Sienna Miller, Guy Pearce, Hayden Christensen, Jimmy Fallon, Mena Suvari, Shawn Hatosy, Beth Grant, James Naughton, Edward Herrmann, Illeana Douglas, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Don Novello.Poor Little Rich Girl: Miller shines as the doomed Edie SedgwickEdie Sedgwick (Miller in her best work to date, truly inhabiting her role), the tragic, beautiful art student cum 'actress' of Andy Warhol's inner circle during the pell mell avante garde explosion of the 1960s is depicted as a freshly scrubbed Cambridge art student from a privileged upper crust Upper West Side stock with a sad background: the victim of incest and the loss of her brother to a horrific suicide never gave the haunted young woman much hope to gain footing on her own accord to a peaceful, prosperous life.It didn't help with her naked, wanton ambition to be somebody no matter the cost (even if it meant being a reckless spendthrift to the point of bankruptcy, sex, drugs and rock'n'roll) and the bizarre love triangle she has with the strictly platonic Warhol (who was gay, and marvelously portrayed by Pearce in a truly uncanny, canny turn as the infamous artist and celebrity of the Sotho scene) and "Billy Quinn" (Christensen the weak link attempting to look broodingly cool as Bob Dylan; for legal reasons pending a lawsuit by the singer/songwriter the film lamely refers to him as The Musician) which leads her to her downward spiral in pill- popping, mainlining heroin, and drinking to oblivion while being taken advantage of in many forms of humiliation (despite her attempt at rehabilitation in 1970 she succumbed to a drug OD in 1971).Miller really gives it her all and it helps she resembles the sex icon too but really does give a wonderfully painful performance with her little rich girl trying to maintain an identity despite the ghosts of her family and the no-help from her so-called 'friends' in the art trend world. While Warhol at times is petulant and portrayed as somewhat petty and unfeeling Pearce also excels in making his role a sympathetic/pathetic to a fault 'genius' who is also a great pretender. Directed with great style by George Hickenlooper (known primarily from his documentaries including "Hearts of Darkness" capturing the hell during Coppolla's "Apocalypse Now") who has a real eye for detail and I loved the mix of all the grainy film stocks which truly transport you back to those hazy/lazy/crazy days of that turbulent decade and some excellent production work including Jeremy Reed's fabulous production design, spot on costumes by John A. Dunn and dazzling cinematography by Michael Grady.Halcyon salad days for a doomed goddess; what could be a more fitting tribute?
WENDY AND LUCY (2008) *** Michelle Williams gives a stand-out performance as a young woman whose life is in turnaround due to unknowing circumstances which has caused her to drift seemingly aimlessly across the country to her goal in landing a job in an Alaskan cannery with her only friend in tow, her loving dog. Filmmaker Kelly Reichardt  who co-scripted with Jonathan Raymond  depicts the harsh realities of a homeless woman's plight in attempting to maintain her dignity, stamina and self-assurance is only buoyed by Williams' bravura poignant turn speaking volumes in her nuanced depiction of a woman unknowingly journeying into despair.
SAW IV (2007) * Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, Scott Peterson, Betsy Russell, Lyriq Bent, Athena Karkanis, Justin Louis, Donnie Wahlberg, Angus Macfadyen, Shawnee Smith, Bahar Soomekh, Dina Meyer. Anemic continuation of the graphic serial killer franchise this time with Bell's reprised Jigsaw playing mind-trick life-or-death games from beyond the grave with truly tedious results. Filmmaker Darren Lynn Bousman, who lensed "III", trowels on the gore factor by the buckets but overcompensates with his seizure-inducing camera-work and editing that only causes a migraine. Although there's an opening for another chapter hopefully it won't happen.
THE KINGS OF SUMMER (2013) *** Nick Robinson, Gabriel Basso, Moises Arias, Nick Offerman, Erin Moriarty, Megan Mullally, Marc Evan Jackson, Alison Brie, Eugene Cordero, Gillian Vigman, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Thomas Middleditch. Funny and heartfelt indie gem about a trio of adolescents so fed up with their families they embark to the local woods to set up a ramshackle home of their own and in the process learn some life lessons along the way. The three lads are fine as a comical group and Offerman's deadly dead-pan dad is a hoot. Newbie filmmaker Jordan Vogt-Roberts has glimmers of Wes Anderson whimsy while rookie screenwriter Chris Galletta has echoes of John Hughes ; a winning combo.
TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY (2011) ***1/2 Gary Oldman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, Ciaran Hinds, John Hurt, Toby Jones, Simon McBurney, Mark Strong. Oldman delivers a masterful, crafty performance as career British spy George Smiley whose old-school smarts are enlisted to thrush out a mole amongst his conniving den of thieves colleagues while investigating the death of his mentor and the unraveling of a botched assignment with lethal ripples of espionage gone awry. Based on the international best seller by John la Carre, the tightly wound, knotty crackerjack screenplay adaptation by Peter Straughan and his late wife Bridget O'Connor serves up some classic turns of the screws, cloak-and-dagger genre chestnuts while keeping the audience lively (a few scattered moments of very real violence inflicted) thanks largely to Tomas Alfredson's taut direction, expert cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema (the drab palette of muted greys/blues/browns expertly show a Europe in the dark in its Cold War era) and impeccable production design by Maria Djkorvic with crisp editing by Dino Junsater. But it is hats off to the very lived-in, implosive, internally observant Oscar-worthy turn by veteran Oldman (with a nice tribute to previous role interpreter the late, great Sir Alec Guinness by employing the old master's plummy vocalizations and the owlish specs), whose very stillness only betrays the villainy at hand. Top Notch!
THE HOUSE BUNNY (2008) *** Anna Faris, Colin Hanks, Emma Stone, Kat Dennings, Christopher McDonald, Beverly D'Angelo, Leslie Del Rosario, Katharine McPhee, Rumer Willis, Kiely Williams, Dana Goodman, Kimberly Makkouk, Monet Mazur, Tyson Ritter, Sarah Wright, Rachel Specter, Owen Benjamin, Hugh Hefner (as himself). Faris sparkles in this screwball fish-out-of-water comedy as a sweet but slightly vapid Playboy centerfold wannabe who finds herself suddenly homeless when she is unceremoniously thrown out of The Playboy Mansion on her 27th birthday but finds resilient good tidings by becoming the house mother to a sorority of misfits (think "REVENGE OF THE NERDS" with a sex change) that she takes under her well-meaning wing. Faris is her generation's Goldie Hawn and her timing and knack for mixing physical comedy with wide-eyed innocence is a charming, intoxicating concoction that rises above by the by-the-numbers screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith. Stone is also a treat as the bookish sorority sister who really comes into her own. Best bit : running gag of Faris' "Exorcist" voice whenever she meets someone new (trust me it's LOL funny!) (Dir: Fred Wolf)
SLEUTH (2007) ** Michael Caine, Jude Law. Remake of the 1972 mystery/drama that now has Caine in the Laurence Olivier role as the cuckolded genre author matching wits with his wife's lover, Law  as Caine's original character  a boastful 'hairdresser/actor'  who may have met his match in cunning mind-games or is it vice versea? Director Kenneth Branagh employs a new strategy by employing acclaimed playwright Harold Pinter to adapt the Anthony Shaffer play (reportedly have never read nor seen a performance of the production prior) with decidedly mixed results with a somewhat boring outcome in the long run, in spite of the game Brits having an actors' field day. Trivia note: this is Law's second consecutive Michael Caine film updating ("ALFIE" being the first).
BRUNO (2009) ** Sacha Baron Cohen does it again: unleashing an obnoxious foreigner on the unitiated American populace, this time in the form of the titular flamboyantly gay Austrian fashionista who desires nothing but to be famous and will go to no depths (high or low, well, come on really low) to do so regardless of his own obnoxiousness and outrageous behavior. For the most part it is a rehash of BORAT but with more of a browbeating bull-in-a-China shop-approach with more misses than hits; while there a few funny moments sprinkled about (i.e. usurping an LA PR firm's vapidity is like shooting fish in a barrel). The jokes are strained, vulgar and in a word: passe. You've been warned. (Dir: Larry Charles)
HANSEL & GRETEL : WITCH HUNTERS (2013) ** Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, Famke Janssen, Peter Stormare Pihla Viitala, Thomas Mann, Derek Mears, Robin Atkin Downes (voice), Zoe Bell. Scattershot Grimm fairy tale 're-imagining' with the titular victims of a witch's attempt to devour flash forward to become vigilante bounty hunters on the evil creatures while attempting to help a village plagued with kidnappings and sorcery. While the leads as siblings have zip chemistry and the try-anything-go-for-broke-anachronisms-aplenty by newbie filmmaker Tommy Wirkola is hit-and-miss the film has its appeal in at least being better than "Van Helsing" - and some not-bad on screen kills with plenty of viscera! and a sexy/scary turn by Janssen with some affective CGI and cool make-up by Twilight Creations - even the IMAX 3D doesn't truly disappoint, its the fact that this is executive produced by Will Ferrell's (!) production company that fails to get any yucks when it could've easily gone the Monty Python route.
BAD TEACHER (2011) *** Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, Lucy Punch, Jason Segel, John Michael Higgins, Phyllis Smith, Thomas Lennon, Eric Stonestreet, Dave "Gruber" Allen. Off-putting, slatternly Diaz (never better with her comic chops and full-game here) faces uncertainty after being dumped by her rich fiancé and forced to return to her teaching gig but finds a possible way out in the unlikely goal of saving money for new breasts to woo over dorky new substitute teech (JT ably deconstructing his 'sexy back' image) despite goody-goody colleague Punch (who nearly steals the film) from gumming up the works. While director Jake Kasdan keeps things lively (including a laugh-out-loud seduction sequence involving dweeb testing administrating rep Lennon) the f-bomb dropping screenplay by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisneberg is hit-and-miss and frankly could have been even dirtier/nastier and funnier. Not an A for effort but a nice try.
ENOUGH SAID (2013) ***1/2 Julia Louis-Dreyfus, James Gandolfini, Catherine Keener, Toni Collette, Ben Falcone, Tracey Fairaway, Tavi Gevinson, Eve Hewson, Toby Huss, Amy Landecker, Kathleen Rose Perkins. Excellent romcom with top of their game acting by Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini (in his penultimate role) as a pair of mismatched divorcees attempting a relationship that is complicated by the fact that his ex (Keener) is her masseuse client leading to a comedy of errors and a lot of emotional juggling. Funny, real and spot-on dialogue highlight a great screenplay by Nicole Holofcener allowing her leads to sparkle and display some subtle nuanced charms. A winner.
LOCKE (2014) *** Tom Hardy gives a compelling performance in an essentially one-man film as a beleaguered construction foreman facing an imperative life force in one long drive to London : a one-time indiscretion resulting in an impending pregnancy with a delivery about to come to fruition all while balancing a very important delivery of concrete for a lucrative business venture. While filmmaker Steven Knight gives his leading man plenty of slack and some impressive monologues (and dialogues via blue tooth) the gimmick of a man in an imprisoned environment (his car) tends to wear on the nerves after awhile no matter how many cuts, camera angles and mood lighting to make things vaguely interesting.
LIFE ITSELF (2014) **** Documentarian Steve James' biopic on iconic film critic Roger Ebert is part valentine to the esteemed journalist and part reflection in art imitating life (and vice verse) as it covers the writer's life, ambitions to write and succeed as a tough one for the Chicago Sun-Times subsequently being appointed its film reviewer at the age of 26 (and the only Pulitzer prize winner to boot) , to his unlikely love/hate bromance with fellow Second City scribe Gene Siskel leading to a hit-making PBS TV series and eventually to finding his soulmate, the inimitable Chaz, at the age of 50 (where they say life begins). Absorbing, nostalgic, funny, tragic (the documentary filmed the final five months of his life in a decade battle with cancer that left him horrifically disfigured but inevitably even more verbose and a well-spring of multi-media/social media blogging and globetrotting) and earnest with interviews with his friends, colleagues, family and associates. Ebert's unique writing style is shown and the uncanny narration of a sound-alike (Stephen Stanton) makes his recent passing even more poignant when he could no longer 'speak' for himself. There are some wonderful reflections also from filmmakers including Werner Herzog who adored the critic and Martin Scorsese in a surprisingly moving moment (for himself as well). While it is easy to dismiss the 'thumb's up/thumb's down' fast-food type critiquing he and his partner-in-crime were accused of it none-the-less pierced the mainstream public to film fans and fanatics alike to hear two men sound just like one would assume in dismantling or discussing cinema. So two very big enthusiastic thumb's up indeed.
WHIPLASH (2014) ***1/2 Miles Teller, JK Simmons, Paul Reiser, Melissa Benoist, Austin Stowell, Nate Lang, Chris Mulkey. Teller gives an amazing performance as a steadfast talented drummer who enrolled in a fiercely competitive music conservatory in New York City faces not only his inner will to be the best but his most unlikely mentor, his taskmaster instructor (Simmons at his career best), a sadistical no-nonsense fascist who drives fear as a wedge between achieving his goal as well as instilling a darker side he never knew existed. Written and directed by Damien Chazelle in a stunning debut spares no one from the at-times hard to watch brow-beating, haranguing and general unease put upon Teller by Simmons (all three deserve Oscar nods) proving that blood, sweat and tears into something you love (and crave) just may be your downward spiral nightmare instead of a dream fulfilled.
WE BOUGHT A ZOO (2011) *** Matt Damon, Scarlett Johansson, Thomas Haden Church, Colin Ford, Maggie Elizabeth Jones, Angus Macfadyen, Patrick Fugit, John Michael Higgins, Elle Fanning, Carla Gallo, JB Smoove, Stephanie Szostak, Peter Riegert, Lauren Sanchez. Widowed father Benjamin Mee (Damon in a heartfelt low-key performance) uproots his grieving family and, on a seeming-whim  buys a dilapidated zoo  while attempting to cope with their devastating loss, embarking on a new life chapter. Filmmaker Cameron Crowe  who co-adapted Mee's book with Aline Brush McKenna - tries a-might-too-hard with the metaphors (dying zoo/re-born family) but his heart  and the film as a whole  is in the right place. With its Disney-lite tone and amiable cast of misfits the storyline is a bit disjointed with its tone (i.e. the wrongly underscored with rock guitar solo for cartoon-villain Higgins as an obnoxious park inspector) but hits the marks in how each character is dealing with their new situation and Jones is the most adorable tyke on the big screen yet. Best bit : a loving montage of Damon's ethereal wife (the beguiling Szostak) comes to life from his MAC photo album and the film's central them in two words: Why Not. Why Not indeed! :D
COUPLES RETREAT (2009) **1/2 Vince Vaughn, Jason Bateman, Faizon Love, Jon Favreau, Malin Akerman, Kristen Bell, Kristin Davis, Kali Hawk, Tasha Smith, Carlos Ponce, Peter Serafinowicz, Jean Reno, Temura Morrison, John Michael Higgins, Ken Jeong, Charlotte Cornwell, Amy Hill. Better than anticipated domestic comedy with four pairs of friends go on a tropical retreat to help one of the others' failing marriage with a lot of revealing, soul searching and oh yeah, comedy mixed in for good measure. Vaughn (who co-wrote with Favreau and Dana Fox) is at his taciturn, sardonic best with many of the film's best dialogue and his ensemble lets him have just enough room to hang himself when it gets to be too much of the star (thankfully not the case for the motor mouth's sake) yet without his presence it's a tedious task to get to the final act. Frequent Vaughn/Favreau collaborator (and former child star) Peter Billingsley's directorial debut has a lot left to be desired but is yeoman like in execution gets yardage in his stars' comic chops.
PROMETHEUS (2012) *** Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, Guy Pearce, Logan Marshall-Green, Sean Harris, Rafe Spall, Emun Elliott, Benedict Wong, Kate Dickie, Patrick Wilson. Ridley Scott's long-gestating unofficial/official is-it/isn't it prequel to the ALIEN franchise (um, yes it is!) has vast ambition with a brilliantly designed yet story- weak retread of the original sci-fi classic shocker depicts a crew of scientists sent into deep space to find the answers to the universe: where did we come from? A well-cast, expertly directed and massive undertaking in the jaw-dropping visual effects and production design - to wit: a risky turn by Rapace as the anthropologist/true believer determined to get answers even at her own peril (and I do mean peril!); satin-smooth/scary-smart Fassbender as the synthetic David whose looks (and hidden agenda?) are modeled after Peter O'Toole's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (!) ; and Arthur Max' amazing eye for details with expert cinematography by Dariusz Wolski and a doom-laden score by Marc Streitenfeld - is only hampered by a rather rote storyline by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof - while touchstoning such echoes of its predecessors, Carpenter's THE THING, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and even in ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN (OK OK - Rapace's underwear costume at a key point that rivals the original's chest-bursting arrival out of John Hurt's cavity that truly gives new meaning to pregnant pause). Scott still has the eye for detail and epic scope that can only be rivaled by his legacy and that in itself is worthy of applause but perhaps too much wishful thinking that this would be of even weight. And in 3-D IMAX the only way to see!
MOON (2009) ***1/2 Sam Rockwell gives a bravura turn as Sam Bell, an astronaut serving a 3 year contract for a lunar excavation assignment to recycle its resources for Earths' plight of energy crises in the not-too-distant-future and finds his dwindling few remaining days to be the most difficult: is the encounter with his sudden body double/clone a figment of his cabin fever indulgences or something far more sinister? Like an epic tone poem of the classic "TWILIGHT ZONE" but with some more prickly underpinnings (i.e. playing God) are at the epicenter of this intriguing and very cool sci-fi flick that echoes of "2001" (thanks largely to the robotic computer system, GERTY, an emoticon sporting co-hort  voiced with sonorous calm by Kevin Spacey  a kissing cousin of HAL) yet stands alone as a singular tale told with style and grace by rookie filmmaker Duncan Jones (nee Zowie Bowie, yes, son of "Major Tom" himself, David Bowie). One of the best genre flicks in years.
UP IN THE AIR (2009) *** George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Amy Morton, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, J.K. Simmons, Zach Galifianakis, Clooney excels as a corporate firer for hire whose charm borderlines smarm and the good life (of literally being the title for traveling so extensively as a 'lifestyle') faces his own personal crises when the powers that be saddle him with a freshly scrubbed college grad (ambitiously obnoxious  in a good way  Kendrick) to tag along and see how the route works as she has designed an interfacing method (dismissal by video chat!) Along for the ride is fellow traveler Farmiga (equally wonderful in a icy, brittle fashion) who is Clooney's booty call (and possible wake-up call too boot). Filmmaker Jason Reitman  who co-scribed the witty and timely adaptation with Sheldon Turner of Walter Kirn's novel  covers all the bases  comedy/drama/soul-searching/redemption parable - and makes the film a near-instant classic (when the characters aren't so in love with themselves is the only Achilles' heel; but then again that's the point isn't it?)
12 YEARS A SLAVE (2013) **** Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Brad Pitt, Garrett Dillahunt, Michael K. Williams,  Kelsey Scott, Quvenzhane Wallis, Cameron Zeigler, Scoot McNairy, Christopher Berry, Bill Camp, Devyn A. Tyler, Willo Jean-Baptiste. Remarkable true- life account of slavery in America based on the biography of freeman African-American Solomon Northup (Ejiofor in an incredible performance that is truly Oscar-worthy), who is tricked and abducted while on a trip from New York to Washington and sold into slavery against his will where he burdens many hardships in his long journey into hell. John Ridley's powerful adaptation of Northup's book is a surprisingly clear-eyed, warts-and-all blinding depiction of how history can be a personal gauntlet in spite of the tremendous odds against surviving. Filmmaker Steve McQueen uses all the archetypes of the Southern 'hospitality' usually seen in the genre of a Civil War treatise but doesn't flinch at all in the underpinnings of what is a true blight of humanity. Equally powerful in their acting (and award noticing) are Fassbender as Solomon's cruelest master with nothing but pure hatred broiling at the surface and a heartbreaking stoic turn by newcomer Nyong'o as the 'personal' slave he terrorizes to no end. One of the year's very best films.
HALL PASS (2011) *** Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis, Jenna Fischer, Christina Applegate, Nicky Whelan, Stephen Merchant, Larry Joe Campbell, JB Smoove, Joy Behar, Richard Jenkins, Kathy Griffin (cameo as herself). The Farrely Brothers are back to true-form in this frequently hilarious comedy about two married buddies (Wilson & Sudeikis having a field day) who are given a quasi 'diplomatic immunity' for a week from their wives (Fischer & Applegate) to endure the titular rite of passage with atypical mix of heart and raunch in the mix from the sibling filmmakers (who collaborated on the script with Pete Jones and Kevin Barnett). Best bit  stay for the closing credits for Merchant's pausing to contemplate his wife's suggestion to follow suit.
GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE (2012) ** Nicolas Cage, Violante Placido, Ciaran Hinds, Idris Elba, Johnny Whitworth, Fergus Riordan, Anthony Head, Christopher Lambert. Less-than-spectacular sequel to the Marvel Comics' big screen adaptation of cult hero Johnny Blaze (Cage hamming it up again) AKA the Ghost Rider, who this time is reluctantly added to the fold in protecting a future rider (bland Riordan)and his sexy mother (eye candy Placido) with fellow compatriot Elba while fighting off none-other than the Devil Himself (Hinds in a did-the-check-clear-phone-in-turn). While the f/x are ramped up even more with more effects driven action the storyline is blasé to say the least. (Dirs: Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor )
TAKE THIS WALTZ (2012) *** Michelle Williams, Luke Kirby, Seth Rogen, Sarah Silverman. Actress cum filmmaker Sarah Polley continues to rise in the ranks as a director to watch in this fascinatingly literate absorbing dramedy about a unique relationship budding between neighbors Williams and Kirby (both equally fun and compelling) while her loving husband Rogen (surprisingly good here) is unaware of the flirtations rising to an affair. Wrrtten and directed with some skill and insight to what makes men and women tick is almost too good to be true and sadly falters by its climax yet the journey is worth taking and I must admit Silverman's subplot supporting character is well-done but superfluous at best.
MEGAMIND (2010) *** (Voices of: Will Ferrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, David Cross, Justin Theroux, Ben Stiller, JK Simmons) Fun and frenetic send-up of cartoon superheroes & villains with titular baddie (voiced with gonzo glee by Ferrell), a blue-skinned, chrome-domed alien from another universe attempting to make sense of his well-being when his arch nemesis Metro Man (Pitt) is finally vanquished allowing the supervillain his day of glory (or is it?) Archly humorous thanks to a well thought of screenplay by Alan J. Schoolcraft & Brent Simons) and imaginative verve by director Tom McGrath) suggesting a blend of "Superman" and "The Incredibles" ; the 3-D by the way is passable but not entirely necessary thanks to the vibrant production design by the animators.
LUCY (2014) *** Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman, Min-Sik Choi, Amr Waked, Pilou Asbaek, Analeigh Tipton. Luc Besson's return-to-form (of sorts) with a high-octane sci-fi auctioneer about an American expat (Johansson getting her ya-yas out) who unwittingly becomes a drug mule in Taiwan but suffers a near fatal overdose on a synthetic new drug that expands the mind's thought capacity with unexpectedly near super-human results. Freeman provides backstory as the scientist who's theory about the use of the human mind's capabilities come to fruition when Johansson seeks his consul with a time-ticking biological bomb ready to go off inside. Trippy, fun, silly and crowd-pleasing with some gimmicky visual effects and sequences designed to outweigh the superficial theatrics at hand. Hang on!
THE HOLIDAY (2006) **1/2 Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Jack Black, Eli Wallach, Edward Burns, Rufus Sewell, Shannyn Sossamon, Bill Macy, Shelley Berman, Kathryn Hahn, John Krasinski. Predictable yet well acted romantic comedy about two unlucky in love gals from opposite ends of The Big Pond  Brit newswoman Winslet hopelessly in love with cad co-worker Sewell and LA-based movie trailer producer Diaz in bad break up with jerk Burns  who exchange their living quarters for the winter holidays and wind up falling in love with respectively Black and Law. A real chick flick with all its sugary clichés and filmmaker Nancy Meyers really needs to make her female characters a tad more believable and a whole lot smarter. Still it is a delight to see Winslet in her first attempt at comedy and it suits her lovely.
THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (2011) **** Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer, Stellen Skarsgard, Robin Wright, Joley Richardson, Steven Berkoff, Yorick van Wagenigngen, Goran Visnjic. Filmmaker extraordinaire David Fincher's highly stylized techniques meet their match with the Americanized adaptation of the international best-seller by Stieg Larsson's novel (skillfully orchestrated by vet scribe Steve Zaillian) about disgraced Swedish journalist (Craig nicely underplaying the bookish Mikael Blomkvist) who teams up with troubled yet tenacious researcher savant/cyber-punk hacker incredible Lisbeth Salander (Mara in a truly audacious Oscar worthy performance; one for the ages) after being enlisted as a detective/writer for hire by industrialist magnate Plummer to investigate the mysterious decades-old disappearance of his young relative, a girl who may have met her demise by a nefarious cabal their family. With a knotty plot involving rape, Nazis, torture and other-things-that-go-bump-in-the-collective night, Fincher keeps a sharply clear-eyed viewpoint : the inhumanity humanity inflicts upon itself in the vicious circle of life's evils unleashed. To wit: one of the most harrowing on screen rapes and the subsequent vengeance thrust upon her attacker, Mara's Lisbeth Salander becomes an iconic character with her ingenious plans and underestimated resilient intelligence. From its relentless Trent Reznor cover of Led Zeppelin's "The Immigrant Song" with its post-BONDian title sequence the film gets its tenderhooks in you..and.never.lets.you.GO! One of the year's best films!
THE WOMAN IN BLACK (2012) *** Daniel Radcliffe, Ciaran Hinds, Janet McTeer, Misha Handley, Jessica Raine, Sophie Stuckey, Shaun Dooley, Mary Stockley, Alexia Osbourne, Alfie Field, Victor McGuire, Cathy Sara, Tim McMullan. Old-fashioned ghost story told with panache in a return to form for Hammer Films with Radcliffe giving an excellently haunted turn as a bereaved widowed attorney in early turn-of-the 20th Century England who is sent to resolve a real estate brokerage where the mansion in question is, natch, haunted by a vengeance seeking ghost leaving its hamlet quavering in her bloody wake. Excellent production design by Kave Quinn is the real stand-out in this otherwise familiar but well told genre flick thanks to Jane Goldman's screenplay adaptation of Susan Hill's novel and James Watkins'direction skillfully gets the viewer on edge particularly the nerve-shredding sequence in which Radcliffe explores the manor in the pitch black with sights and sounds lurking every corner!
THE RUNAWAYS (2010) **1/2 Kristen Stewart, Dakota Fanning, Michael Shannon, Stella Maeve, Scout Taylor-Compton, Alia Shawkat, Riley Keough, Johnny Lewis, Tatum O'Neal, Brett Cullen, Hannah Marks. Scattershot biopic about rock and roll female band The Runaways focusing on the lead singer Cherie Currie and guitarist Joan Jett (admittedly I was skeptical when I heard the casting yet Fanning and Stewart, respectively, acquit themselves nicely) during the anything goes '70s with Svengali manager Kim Fowley (Shannon having a field day) as the full-of-himself (and something else) rock enthusiast seeing the future in this 'jail bait' band. While the aforementioned talent do a bang up job inhibiting their intimidating icon roles (especially Stewart with plenty of Body English the shoulder-shrumped slouch is dead-on!), the film itself short-changes the other girls (i.e. Lita Ford, hell-o!) and is rather a by-the-numbers-melodrama. Yet the music rocks so that's something that first time director and screenwriter Floria Sigismondi (who adapted Currie's autobiography "Neon Angel: The Cherie Currie Story") does manage to capture the authentic feel of the era (grainy 16 mm footage helps too!) and the heart of rock and roll in general.
SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS (2012) *** 1/2 Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken, Tom Waits, Abbie Cornish, Linda Bright Clay, Harry Dean Stanton, Kevin Corrigan, Gabourey Sidibe, Zeljko Ivanek, Olga Kurylenko, Long Nguyen, Christine Marzano, Brendan Sexton III, Amanda Mason Warren, Michael Pitt, Michael Stuhlberg. Warped pitch black comedy about a struggling alcoholic LA screenwriter (Farrell playing the straight man) and his two odd friends/dognappers-by-day (Rockwell getting his ya-yas out and Walken well come on, he's the man!) who find themselves in the crosshairs of a wronged/crazed thug (Harrleson) when they kidnap his beloved Shih Tzu and suffer the consequences, while the trio attempt to cobble a screenplay about the titular criminal lunatics. Funny as hell and at times graphically violent mix ala Tarantino with game, lively acting by its principals each apparently outdoing one another in being off-beat (not an easy chore) including song man Waits as a killer-of-serial killers and bunny petter and a fun cameo by Stanton as a grave Quaker out for revenge. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh (who collaborated with Farrell on IN BRUGES) with tongue-thru- cheek gashed by a razor crassness. A hoot and a holler definitely worth checking out.
WAR HORSE (2011) **** Jeremy Irvine, Peter Mullan, Emily Watson, David Thewliss, Niels Arestrup, Tom Hiddleston, Benedict Cumberbatch, Celine Buckens, Toby Kebbell, David Kross, Patrick Kennedy, Eddie Marsan, Leonard Carow. Steven Spielberg's epic homage to John Ford (with distinct echoes of HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY) is on full display in his wonderful approach to the vastly popular story & play about the WWI parable about the unparalleled passion of an adolescent farm boy (newcomer Irvine) and his magnificent horse  only to be literally separated by the emerging European conflict unleashed. The wonderful, beautiful horse is the true star 'emoting' capably and manipulating the viewers' heartstrings in the process brilliantly with its adventures abroad while its master attempts to reunite despite the worldwide calamity. With expert cinematography by longtime collaborative force Janusz Kiminski (with truly gorgeous sequences) and a wonderful ensemble Spielberg capably creates an instant classic with masterpiece filmmaking and an excellent adaptation of Michael Morpurgo's novel by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis. One of the year's very best films!
THIS IS THE END (2013) *** (As themselves {more or less}: James Franco, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Mindy Kaling, David Krumholtz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Rhianna, Martin Starr, Paul Rudd, Channing Tatum, Kein Hart, Aziz Ansari) "Abbott and Costello Go to Hell" could've been the working title if Bud & Lou had lived to see it: Meta comical take on celebrity and fame with everyone's favorite comedians and actors (think Six Degrees of Separation From Judd Apatow) facing the Apocalypse at Franco's new Hollywood digs that leads to pettiness, demon possession, rape jokes and any other form of survival under drug-enduced distress played to the hilt for big laughs and poke-in-the-eye send-ups of the rich and famous. Vulgar and dead-on satire of the haves/have nots with a body count. Written and directed by real-life BFFs Rogen and Evan Goldberg.
WALL STREET : MONEY NEVER SLEEPS (2010) ***1/2 Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin, Carey Mulligan, Eli Wallach, Susan Sarandon, Frank Langella, Austin Pendleton, John Bedford Lloyd, Vanessa Ferlito, John Buffalo Mailer (Cameo: Charlie Sheen) Oliver Stone's impressive sequel to the vastly successful and Oscar-winning original (thanks to Douglas' larger-than-life Academy Award turn as iconic Gordon Gekko, reprising the charismatic reptilian in full-mea culpea mode and worthy of another golden boy too boot) has green financier LaBeouf (intense and eager as ever) whose betrothal to Gekko's estranged daughter only adds fuel to the fire including a nefarious mentor-in-the-making cock-of-the-walk ruthless trader Brolin (having a field day as a wolf in sheep's clothing) who drives Gordo to be a puppet master with a few tricks left up the old dog's sleeves. Great to see Douglas in fine form as the role that personified '80s corporate greed curdled to a fine mess for the 'Naught in this timely and enthralling work (thanks to a sharp screenplay by Stone and collaborators Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff); hats off to cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto's gorgeous lensing making Manhattan a sexy steal of the deal.
WILD (2014) ***1/2 Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Gaby Hoffman, Thomas Sadoski, Keene McRae, Michiel Huisman, W. Earl Brown, Kevin Rankin, Brian Van Holt, Cliff De Young. Witherspoon gives her best performance since winning the Oscar (and may earn a richly deserved 2nd one) as Cheryl Strayed, a young woman whose trek along the Pacific Crest Trail serves as a way of coping with the grief in the epic loss of her beloved mother (Dern, equally Oscar-worthy) and an attempt to 'find herself' in all ways meta. Based on Strayed's best seller, Nick Horby's adaptation streamlines her journey into a one-woman odyssey of the heart, soul and spirit and only interrupts with the occasional rest stop scenario and altercation along the line. Jean-Marc Valle's sure and steady direction wisely allows his star to shine for a character of dubious nature and broken background with beautiful cinematography by Yves Belanger and a soundtrack peppered with contemporary rock (i.e. Simon & Garfunkel et al) to make the journey complete. *Also - the most beautiful rendition of RED RIVER VALLEY since THE GRAPES OF WRATH.
MALIFICENT (2014) *** Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning, Sharlto Copley, Lesley Manville, Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple, Sam Riley,Brenton Thwaites, Kenneth Cranham, Hannah New (Narrator: Janet McTeer) Inventive live-action Disney adaptation of one of their classic animated films "Sleeping Beauty" this time from the perspective of evil fairie Maleficent (Jolie, born to be bad, is splendid) whose vengeance for heartbreak is the backstory of this re- imagining of the fairy tale and an origin story too boot. Linda Woolverton's screenplay leans a tad too-good-to-be-true and lightening the darkness to shades of grey in one of cinema's greatest villainesses but it works well with Robert Stromberg's fanciful direction (taking a page out of Tim Burton's 'freaks are people too' filmmaking) and a grand production design by Dylan Cole and Gary Freeman, a Danny Elfmanian score by James Newton Howard, gorgeous lensing by cinematographer vet Dean Semler and some fine-tweaking digital assisted make-up design by wizard Rick Baker giving the aquiline Jolie jawline planes so sharp it'd cut ice. Fanning is proving to be an up-and-coming-actress-of-her-generation as the sweet Aurora while Copley's callow anti-hero power-hungry king has shades of Alan Rickman oiliness. The 3-D is worth the extra fee for a genuine story book panache.
ADVENTURELAND (2009) ***1/2 Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Martin Starr, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, Jack Gilpin, Wendie Malick, Ryan Reynolds, Paige Howard, Margarita Levieva. Funny and at times hit-the-nail-on-the-head accurate look at teens circa 1987 with Eisenberg as a college grad looking to make some extra cash for a European vacation by working at the titular amusement park in Pittsburg, PA where he gets some life lessons and falls in love with no-nonsense yet troubled Stewart and in the process having a lot of fun amidst the misery of the soul-crushing reality of a truly sucky seasonal gig. Filmmaker Greg Mottola's authenticity is downright uncanny in the pangs of adolescence and young adulthood's strangleholds impinged by society; does for summer jobs what CADDYSHACK did for golf courses. One of the year's best comedies.
APOCALYPTO (2006) ***1/2 Rudy Youngblood, Dalia Hernandez, Jonathan Brewer, Morris Birdyellowhead, Carlos Emilio Baez, Ramierez Amilicar, Israel Contreras, Israel Rios, Maria Isabel Diaz. Epic, enthralling, and brutally violent realization of the final days of the Maya kingdom in the 16th century in Latin America focuses on a young man named Jaguar Paw (Youngblood in an excellent film debut) whose tribe is overtaken by another fierce tribe to sacrifice their captures to the gods. Visually rich in production design with some wonderful locales enraptured by cinematographer vet Dean Semler brings the beauty and the ugly thanks to the unusual visual flair for overt violence by director Mel Gibson whose passion is dubious yet affective.
UNDER THE SKIN (2014) ***1/2 Scarlett Johansson gives a memorable performance as an extraterrestrial femme fatale on Earth (Scotland) who lures single men to their ultimate demise to help feed her planet's life source in this utterly unnerving and remarkably produced science fiction parable based on Michael Faber's novel (adapted by Walter Campbell and directed with echoes of Kubrick, by Jonathan Glazer). With its pinpricking sound design by Johnnie Burn mixed with spooky music by Mica Levi, an ethereal at times production design by Chris Oddy, clear-eyed cinematography by Daniel Landin and some truly stunning visual effects the film succeeds in its literal titular verisimilitude evoked by its filmmaking team. Johansson has the heavy lifting of making her seemingly cold alien with a dollop of humanity thru her acquisitions (which become rote admittedly) thanks to a truly moving encounter with a severely deformed young man. One drawback is the heavily burred inflected dialogue of its citizenry which really needs subtitles (but then again that appears to be the idea implied by Glazer - we are all indeed foreign by design). While I have not read the source material the film should be seen for its own merit in succeeding in the alien being familiar.
PUBLIC ENEMIES (2009) *** Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, Stephen Dorff, Channing Tatum, Rory Cochrane, Stephen Lang, James Russo, Giovanni Ribisi, John Ortiz, Peter Gerety, Leelee Sobieski, Shawn Hatosy, Matt Craven, Diana Krall. Filmmaker Michael Mann's ambitious but at times stalled take on America's gangsters during the Great Depression rightly focusing on charismatic fugitive outlaw John Derringer (Depp, showing the right amount of swagger and ice-cool control  his in-movie-theater brief self-satisfied smirk is worth the price of admission) and his gang trailblazing a crime-spree throughout the country much to the chagrin of up-and-coming Fed J.Edgar Hoover (a clipped-deliver, take-charge Crudup) whose prime choice, the relatively green but determined Melvin Purvis (pallid yet engaging Bale) is truly put to task. Mann manages the gunfights with supreme skill and the chase sequences with enough energy to keep things rolling merrily along until it gets bogged down with its own momentum of trying to be a great film (it's not, but a close cigar folks). Cotillard is incandescent, as Dillinger's flame that ignites his will to live despite the overwhelming odds.
SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS (2006) * Jon Heder, Billy Bob Thornton, Jacinda Barrett, Matt Walsh, Horatio Sanz, Todd Louiso, Michael Clarke Duncan, Sarah Silverman, David Cross, Luis Guzman. (Cameo: Ben Stiller) Disappointingly flat and inert comedy about a loser (Heder) who enlists in a self-awareness class run by a sadist (Thornton) whose questionable methods lead him to believe he can overcome his short-comings by winning over his lovely neighbor (Barrett) until he finds out the good doctor has deigns on her himself. Woefully unfunny and too cruel to be kind methods make the viewer squirm instead of laugh. (Dir: Todd Phillips)
SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD (2012) ***1/2 Steve Carell, Keira Knightley, Connie Britton, Rob Corddry, Adam Brody, Melanie Lynskey, Tonita Castro, Patton Oswalt, William Petersen, TJ Miller, Gillian Jacobs, Derek Luke, Martin Sheen, Rob Huebel. Doomsday black comedy with sad-sack insurance agent (Carell - balancing the dry comedy with the poignant drama to full effect - whose taken the torch from Robin Williams in this cottage industry archetype of late) facing literally the apocalypse in the form of a hurtling meteor for Earth and in the final days begins an unlikely romance with flibbertigibbet narcoleptic neighbor Knightley (in one of her best roles) before it's literally too late. Written and directed with tongue-and-cheek and surprising depth by Lorene Scafaria the sci-fi elements counterbalance arguably cinema's sweetest-most-original 'meet cute' ever and boasting a killer soundtrack (The Hollies' 'The Air That I Breathe' montage seriously had me a sobbing wreck; beautiful!) One of the year's nicest surprises so far. And yes that is Steve's real-life wife as the spouse who dumps him at the film's beginning.
THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (2008) ** Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connelly, Kathy Bates, Jaden Smith, John Cleese, Jon Hamm, Kyle Chandler, Robert Knepper, James Hong. Visual effects laden remake of the '50s sci-fi classic about a visitor from outer space named Klaatu (Reeves at his most - yet appropriately here  wooden) whose message of saving Earth is more than meets the eye. Connelly is the scientist attempting to aid the cosmic traveler in his quest but finds herself at odds with the government and military (natch). While the impressive special effects are light years away from the original, the ham-fisted screenplay by David Scarpa and rather pedestrian direction by Scott Derickson leaves the viewer wanting (and expecting) more.
THE EXPENDABLES 3 (2014) *** Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Harrison Ford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson, Wesley Snipes, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, Kelsey Grammar, Antonio Banderas, Jet Li, Glen Powell, Victor Ortiz, Ronda Rousey, Kellan Lutz, Robert Davi. More of the same in the third chapter of the franchise of bringing The Greatest Hits of Action Stars Past reunited yet again this time with serious payback for Stallone and his cronies against former team founder Gibson, a global arms dealer who has put one of the gang in medical jeopardy. Sly's recruits (largely lackluster accept hottie MMA Rousey adding some tough-feminine wiles to the testosterone overkill ; but she needs to remember 'scowling' is not an attribute to 'acting' and to lose the Cocoa Puff on her face; you're not Cindy Crawford hon) of younger wildcards and some old buds new to the mix (hello a game Snipes, crusty intelligence cohort Ford, rumpled Grammar as the team's agent of new talent, and scene-stealer Banderas as a chatty oddball) make for a decidedly mismatched motley crew but the fast-moving action by news helmsman Patick Hughes makes up for the slap-dash script by Stallone and Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedict. Check your brains by the door and enjoy the ongoing guilty pleasure.
MADAGASCAR : ESCAPE 2 Africa (2008) ** (VOICES OF: Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric The Entertainer, Andy Richter, Bernie Mac, Alec Baldwin, Sherri Shepherd, Will i Am, Tom McGrath) Fairly decent sequel to the animated hit with the menagerie of friends winding up on the African veldt and Alex The Lion (Stiller) re-uniting with his family (Mac in sadly one of his final performances, and Shepherd). A bit looser and some much needed comic relief in the Phil Hartman-like penguin leader (McGrath) stealing the show once again. (Directors: Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath)
SWING VOTE (2008) *1/2 Kevin Costner, Madeline Carroll, Paula Patton, Kelsey Grammar, Dennis Hopper, Nathan Lane, Stanley Tucci, George Lopez, Judge Reinhold, Mare Winningham, Mark Moses, Nana Visitor (Willie Nelson, Richard Petty as themselves). Costner is the best thing about this ham-fisted piece of 21st century "Capra-corn" as a good ol' boy. reprobate drunken single parent to a precocious young daughter (talented newcomer Carroll) whose trail of broken promises and shattered dreams comes to a head when he fails to place his vote in the Presidential election in arguably one of the biggest convoluted plot machinations in recent memory making him the deciding vote in a tie-result (and one scary thought if this is actually true!) The one-note screenplay by Jason Richman attempts to pass muster as political satire but feels like a bad sitcom premise while director Joshua Michael Stern tries to strain at the emotional chords strung too tightly that it ultimately snaps to a dead-halt when in the final act if falls on its face by cheating the audience with some answers. A truly awful attempt in civics lessons via cinema.
CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER (2014) *** 1/2 Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Redford, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders, Frank Grillo, Maximiliano Hernandez, Emily VanCamp, Hayley Atwell, Toby Jones, Jenny Agutter, Garry Shandling (Narration: Gary Sinise; Cameo: Stan Lee) Wham-bam follow up to the Marvel super soldier for life, liberty and justice the American way with still-recovering from 21st century shock, Steve Rogers (Evans affable as always), SHIELD's go-to-hero when a threat to international security - what else is new? - proves to also have personal recprecussions. Namely in formidable foe and titular blast from the past (Stan giving good thrust and parry with Evans) to shake things up. A nimble and quick-moving script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely proves a welcome challenge by directing siblings Anthony and Joe Russo giving back at warp speed with much gusto as can be given. One of the better Marvel sequels to date.
HAMLET 2 (2008) ***1/2 Steve Coogan, Catherine Keener, Joseph Julian Soria, Sklyar Astin, Phoebe Strole, Melonie Diaz, Arnie Pantoja, Michael Esparza, Natalie Amenuela, Marshall Bell, David Arquette, Amy Poehler, Elisabeth Shue (as herself). Uproarious comedy about a misguided high school drama teacher (Coogan in a wonderfully hilarious showcase turn), a failed actor, who is facing many hurdles in his life: namely the threat of his class being cancelled after the current semester which strikes a moment of inspiration desperation  penning a musical sequel to The Bard's immortal classic "Hamlet"  with some controversially unorthodox methods. Pam Brady & Andrew Fleming's (who directed) smart, shrewdly clever and scandalous screenplay is a riot and their songs including "Rock Me Sexy Jesus" should definitely get a Best Song nomination at the Oscars and if there was any justice a Best Actor performance nod for Coogan who truly goes the distance in making a method to his madness means a thing of unparalleled lunacy not seen since Monty Python. Added bonus of having my honey Shue being a good sport by 'playing herself' as a disillusioned star-turned-health care worker.
W. (2008) **1/2 Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Banks, Richard Dreyfuss, James Cromwell, Toby Jones, Jeffrey Wright, Thandie Newton, Ellen Burstyn, Rob Corddry, Dennis Boutsikaris, Scott Glenn, Bruce McGill, Ioan Gruffudd, Colin Hanks, Stacy Keach, Jason Ritter, Marley Shelton, Noah Wyle. Better-than-anticipated biopic on the life and times of President George W. Bush (Brolin, in an uncanny turn and inspired casting) is treaded with fleet-foot direction from iconoclastic filmmaker Oliver Stone, who offer some sympathy for the devil in this informative, and fairly balanced document for one of the nation's most frustrating presidencies and its contemporary airs only further embellish just how much has occurred in his administration. The only problem is it doesn't dig any deeper and gives a somewhat gloss over to certain events (i.e. 9/11) that was expected from the usual firebrand techniques of the director.
MICHAEL CLAYTON (2007) **** George Clooney, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinson, Sydney Pollack, Michael O'Keefe, Ken Howard, Austin Williams, Merritt Wever, Kevin Hagan, David Lansbury. Engrossing drama about a legal 'fixer' (Clooney in arguably his best role to date) for a prestigious law firm finds himself in a conspiracy-tangled web when one of his clients has a meltdown threatening to expose a corporation for its nefarious deeds. Wilkinson is also in fine form as the client whose conscience is on the precipice of madness. The screenplay by first time director Tony Gilroy hearkens back to the Golden Age of The '70s with its precise attention to character development, adult frankness and an anti-hero  flawed yet conscious of making amends  that recalls Lumet, Pakula and Pollack himself.
TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) *** Woody Allen, Alec Baldwin, Judy Davis, Roberto Benigni, Penelope Cruz, Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Greta Gerwig, Alison Pill, Alessandra Mastronardi, Flavio Parenti, Alessandro Tiberi, Fabio Armliato. The Wood-man's travelogue to the Italian capital di amor is a mixed bag quartet of love stories involving: the filmmaker as a semi-retired opera director who makes a startling discovery in the form of his future in-law as a true find ala Caruso; Baldwin as an American actor abroad who acts as a Greek chorus to a young architect (Eisenberg) dealing with his wife Gerwig's oversexualized friend Paige (ridiculously and preciously miscast - all you JUNO haters are gonna loathe her here!); a young newlywed Italian couple accidentally separated with hot hooker Cruz involved and the absurd poke at celebrity when a mid-level Italian bureaucrat (shockingly low-key live-wire Beningi) finds himself the epitome of how media-crazed the world has become when he is the focus of the minutia of his meek life. Kudos to veteran lensman Dariu Khondji for the strikingly romantic cinematography craving you to book your next flight ASAP to Italia! Ciao!
DJANGO UNCHAINED (2012) **1/2 Jamie Foxx, Christop Walz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Samuel L. Jackson, Walter Goggins, Dennis Christopher, James Remar, James Russo, David Steen, Dana Michelle Gourrier, Nichole Galicia, Laura Cayouette, Don Johnson, Tom Wopat, Don Stroud, Russ Tamblyn, Amber Tamblyn, Bruce Dern, M.C. Gainey, Cooper Huckabee, Doc Duhme, Jonah Hill, Lee Horsley, Zoe Bell, Ted Neeley, Tom Savini, Michael Parks, John Jarratt, Robert Carradine. Quentin Tarantino's messy and bloated take on the mythic "Django" spaghetti westerns and "Mandingo" era blaxploitation films has Foxx as a vengeance seeking slave forming an unlikely alliance with bonkers bounty hunter Waltz in hunting down those responsible for the whipping of his kidnapped wife (Washington). Among the brimming cast of Character Actors Past, the purple prose and far-too- long overtly graphic climax (Sam Peckinpah is turning in his grave), the one redeeming factor is DiCaprio's field day extravaganza mustache-twirling worthy turn as the sadistic villain slave owner and the Uncle Tom/Uncle Ben caricature of Jackson's equally nefarious loyal manservant. All for naught in the grand scheme of things and a bit of a disappointment. And yes that is Franco Nero as the original Django in a cameo.
FLIGHT (2012) ***1/2 Denzel Washington, Kelly Reilly, Bruce Greenwood, Don Cheadle, John Goodman, Melissa Leo, Tamara Tunie, Nadine Velasquez, Garcelle Beauvais, Justin Martin. Washington gives a superb performance as a barely-functioning alcoholic pilot whose heroic act of saving his airliner from a catastrophe leads to an criminal investigation and has him on a path of salvation or self-destruction. With the unlikely aid from recently sober heroin addict Reilly (sublimely perfect) a fellow traveler and questionably moral support from colleagues (Greenwood as an airline rep and Goodman as Dr. Feelgood enabler), Washington's troubled anti-hero has some stumbling blocks to overcome: namely himself. Craftily and cannily directed by Robert Zemeckis (welcome back from the dead zone of motion captured animated crap) and an unorthodox screenplay by John Gatins incorporates state-of-the-art CGI (one dilly of a plane crash-landing) and moral turpitude.
ANCHORMAN 2: THE LEGEND CONTINUES (2013) *** Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Christina Applegate, Meagan Good, James Marsden, Josh Lawson, Kristen Wiig, Dylan Baker, Judah Nelson, Greg Kinnear, Fred Willard, Chris Parnell (Cameos: Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson, Vince Vaughn, Jim Carrey, Marion Cotillard, Will Smith, Amy Poehler, Tina Fey, John C. Reilly, Sacha Baron Cohen, Kirsten Dunst) (Narrator: Bill Kurtis) Frequently hilarious followup in the ongoing saga of bloating clueless news reader Ron Burgundy (Ferrell -who co-scripted with frequent collaborator director Adam McKay - back and better than ever) who makes a comeback after a downward spiral from losing his job to a new gig circa 1980, at a NYC 24 hour cable news network ready to launch with his old team of equally clueless egotistical knuckleheads (Carell, Rudd and Koechner a trio of wingmen no one would otherwise be with out) facing new changes in 1980, including beautiful (andblack!) boss Good (sexual chocolate indeed!) and new enemy Marsden as a too-handsome douche co- anchor. Fast and funny with hit-and-miss anything goes absurdity and a nice diversion in giving Carell's Brick Tamland an equally imbecilic love interest (game Wiig, who combined IQ's aren't even in the two-digit range!) Still classy, San Diego!
THE GOOD German (2006) **1/2 George Clooney, Cate Blanchett, Tobey Maguire, Jack Thompson, Beau Bridges, Leland Orser, Robin Weigert, Dave Power, Tony Curran, Dominic Comperatore. Filmmaker Steven Soderbergh's ambitious but adequate attempt to make a WWII era remake of "Casablanca" meets "The Third Man" neo-noir melodrama has more misses than hits but a game cast of powerhouse acting by Clooney as an American journalist who heads to Germany in the dawning days of the war to cover the Potsdam treaty but becomes embroiled in a complex web of deceit involving his old flame Blanchett (channeling Ingrid Bergman and Greta Garbo with a dash of Marlene Deitrich) and his weasel driver Maguire hip-deep in the black market. Filmed in lavish black and white (actually in color and processed technically as b&w), Soderbergh  who also trade markedly shot & edited under pseudonyms  does his best but Paul Attanasio's screenplay adaptation of Joseph Kanon's novel doesn't make it easy to follow what should be a basic potboiler entertainment boilerplate.
GONE BABY GONE (2007) ***1/2 Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, John Ashton, Amy Ryan, Amy Madigan, Titus Welliver, Michael K. Williams, Edi Gathegi, Mark Margolis, Madeline O'Brien, Slaine, Trudi Goodman, Matthew Maher, Jill Quigg. Novice director Ben Aflleck delivers the goods in this absorbing yet familiar adaptation of Dennis Lehane's novel (he co-scripted the screenplay with Aaron Stockard) about a missing 4 year old girl (O'Brien) in South Boston that involves local boy turned PI Patrick Kenzie (Ben's younger sibling giving his best performance to date) and his co-hort/lover Angie Gennaro (Monaghan equally excellent in her strongest role of her young career), the pair enlisted by the girl's family and ultimately working with the police department (Freeman, as the special forces leader, and Harris and Ashton, respectively, the detectives assigned to the crime), coming to loggerheads with them, the community, and each other in the pursuit of the time- ticking end result. Gripping with excellent acting all around  especially Ryan who deserves a Best Supporting Actress nod for her risky turn as the girl's white trash, reprobate mother. Uncompromising and frank, a well-deserved reward for those who like character studies amidst their crime dramas. Affleck uses the locales and locals to full affect.
BURN AFTER READING (2008) **1/2 George Clooney, France McDormand, Brad Pitt, John Malkovich, Tida Swinton, Richard Jenkins, David Rasche, JK Simmons, Elizabeth Marvel. Somewhat disappointing Coen Bros.' fare of 'a league of morons' plot involving an alcoholic, ex-CIA wonk SOB (Malkovich chewing up the scenery) whose computer disk is found in the unlikely hands of a doofus gym employee (Pitt, stealing every scene with gonzo glee at being dim) and his co-worker (McDormand) who team up to exhort money from him for her benefiting radical cosmetic surgery (!) Clooney is added to the mix as yet another CIA wonk whose predilection for dating-outside-his marriage (including his affair with the chilly Swinton, Malkovich's very unhappy wife) adds insult to injury (pun intended). An uneven blend of nutty comedy and dark ennui that is balanced with élan by the comic duo of Rasche and Simmons as subordinate and supervising 'spooks' added to the potboiling gumbo concocted.
THE X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE (2008) *** David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Amanda Peet, Billy Connolly, Xzibit, Mitch Pileggi. Intrepid former FBI agents Scully and Mulder are back again in this second of the big-screen franchise installments based on the classic sci-fi paranormal investigation TV series with true believer Mulder (the always dead-panned brilliant Duchovny) reunited with his former partner, Scully (Anderson the right balance of brainy/sexy stalwartness) when a federal agent is missing causing the agency to enlist the ex- "X-Filers" to help the manhunt leading a dark and dank path to an illicit plot involving body snatching, stem cell research and a dispatched, psychic pedophilic priest (Connolly) to find the truth. Creator Chris Carter  who co-wrote with regular series scribe Frank Spotnitz  makes his big-screen debut with aplomb by incorporating the wintry tundra of Vancouver (the series' long-time home during its run) and Bill Roe's blue/black schism cinematography gives a chill for the long run in this bleak but not-so-bad 'stand alone' SuperSize episode of the late, great show.
GET LOW (2010) ***1/2 Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Bill Murray, Lucas Black, Gerald McRaney, Bill Cobbs. Excellent, low-key work by Duvall one of his best performances  as a Depression era Tennessee backwoods hermit who decides to have a 'funeral party' in his honor with local funeral parlor director Murray (sublimely comic) who chomps at the bit to appease the ol' coot while milking all the publicity for his own means. Spacek is also on spot as a familiar voice from Duvall's past and Black is a natural shining as the go-between assistant who sees the forest for the trees (and then some). Wonderfully directed by rookie Aaron Schneider and gorgeously lensed by cinematographer David Boyd, the film is a sleeper gem.
GET ON UP (2014) *** Chadwick Boseman, Nelsan Ellis, Dan Aykroyd, Viola Davis, Lennie James, Craig Robinson, Jill Scott, Octavia Spencer (Cameos: Alllison Janney & John Benjamin Hickey) Boseman gives it his all totally embodying The Godfather of Soul, James Brown in this otherwise routine and misdirected biopic from director Tate Taylor (who does a yeoman's job at best) and a half-baked screenplay by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth & Steven Baigelman that pogos back in time in a relatively non-linear schism that falters largely in not showing the creative process of who Brown was but instead the man's demons and struggles in becoming The Hardest Working Man in Show Business, warts and all. Lip-synching to the late, great pioneer of r&b Boseman has the man's mannerisms, vocalizations and physiognomy down pact (until the negligible make-up in his later years) particularly in his greatest hits dancing like a slab of butter on a hot skillet and singing as if his very life depended on it. The stock cast is largely wasted except for Elwood Blues (I mean Aykroyd) as Brown's manager and father-figure-of-sorts; go figure. While we get glimpses of what the man was we by no means get the full picture of what truly made him a performer's performer which is a crying shame.
THE DESCENDANTS (2011) **** George Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Amara Miller, Robert Forster, Matthew Lillard, Judy Greer, Beau Bridges, Nick Krause. Clooney gives the performance of his career in an Oscar-worthy turn as the patriarch of a Hawaiian family in crises: a family tragedy  the impending death of his unfaithful wife  and a highly profitable real estate deal brokered pending for a huge familial payoff are the main set pieces in Alexander Payne's brilliant adaptation of Kaui Hart Hemmings' novel (co-scripted with Nat Faxon & Jim Rash). A superb ensemble cast with noteworthy work by newcomer Woodley as the eldest daughter give a well-toned balance to both the drama and comic underpinnings of the film's strengths in divvying up both with equal parts perfection blended with pathos and piquancy. One of the year's best films.
EVIL DEAD (2013) **1/2 Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, Elizabeth Blackmore. Bigger-budgeted remake of the the original "The Evil Dead" cult-classic by Sam Raimi (who produced with his fellow collaborator Bruce Campbell, the original's star) may have more buckets of blood and bang for your book for the special visual effects and make-up however it fails when you have to have an 'explanation' for why sh*t is happening (the beauty of the original was it JUST did!). Case in point Levy (who is excellent and if she had the muster to could be a new Scream Queen) is a 'cold turkey' candidate in attempting to curb her drug abuse with her older, estranged brother (Fernandez) and their 3 friends who camp out for a weekend in a cabin in the woods (again Raimi mastered this first of the 'sub genre' of horror) and get far more than they bargained for when they come across a mysterious book of the dead that subsequently unleashes a threatening supernatural force that is very angry. While the surprisingly by-the-numbers screenplay by filmmaker Fede Alavarez (and a gloss over by Diablo Cody!) suffers in making the stupid kids even stupider is quickly turned-over in its second half when all hell breaks loose. Again the viscera flowing makes up for the hackneyed plot but the film's source material should be seen again for its patchwork shopworn indie cred and ingenuity (although the 'whooshing' frenetic force camera-work thru the woods is re-introduced). Enter at your own peril but buy a copy of the epic precursors instead if you haven't already.
NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM (2006) ***1/2 Ben Stiller, Carla Gugino, Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, Bill Cobbs, Jake Cherry, Ricky Gervais, Robin Williams, Kim Raver, Steve Coogan, Owen Wilson (unbilled), Patrick Gallagher, Rami Malek, Mizuo Peck, Paul Rudd, Anne Meara, (voice of Brad Garrett). Fun, fantastic family fare comedy with Stiller as a recently hired security guard to New York's Museum of Natural History on the night shift, where all things come to life, literally, leading the reluctant protector into a series of adventurous evenings in the hope to win over his son. Based on Milan Trenc's best selling book, Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon's imaginative adaptation keeps things lively and tailor-made to Stiller's trademark neurotic stylings as well as the impressive special effects and interplay with Williams as Teddy Roosevelt come to life and Wilson and Coogan, as respectively, quarrelsome miniature cowboy and Roman soldier, with often hilarious results despite the sappy third act that inevitably happens. (Dir: Shawn Levy)
American SNIPER (2014) ***1/2 Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Kevin Lacz, Jake McDorman, Cory Hardirict, Eric Ladin, Luke Grimes, Keir O'Donnell. Intense and incredibly focused account of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle (a clear-eyed turn by Cooper) and his four tours of duty fighting in the current war against terrorism as a sharpshooter whose deadly accuracy and skills overshadow (and nearly overwhelm) his domestic life with wife Miller (does the best with the somewhat pedestrian character she's given) in between stints in hell. Filmmaker Clint Eastwood' bare-bones, yeoman like craftsmanship is tailor-made for the quick moving, adrenaline pumping screenplay by Jason Hall (based on Kyle's book collaborated with Scott McEwen and James Defelice) that trims the fat of patriotism in favor of a good man in a bad place echoing SERGEANT YORK and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.
VENUS (2006) *** Peter O' Toole, Jodie Whittaker, Leslie Phillips, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Griffiths. O'Toole gives another sterling Oscar caliber performance.Like a lion in the winter  and excuse the pun in re: to this being a title of one of his films from his pact  Peter O'Toole gives yet another sterling Oscar calibre performance (the man has never won but been nominated 7 times prior; another crime against the Academy! His last nod was for one of my favorite films, "My Favorite Year" in 1982, nearly 25 years ago!!!), that may clinch a statuette for the former Golden Boy himself.Playing close to typecast, O'Toole stars as Maurice Russell, an aged actor of some celebrity whose mark is on the wane getting bit parts as dying coots here and there when he's not hanging out with fellow geezer thespians Ian (Phillips) and Donald (Griffiths) in their favorite tavern in London. With little to do but trade pharmaceuticals and ailments while reading the obits to see which of their contemporaries has left this mortal coil, the friends don't have much to do in between naps and loneliness.Enter Jessie, Ian's grand niece, who is sent to live with him to take care of his household needs and cooking but instead proves to be a slovenly disaster area with her blunt meanness and obstinate demeanor with the ridiculous notion of gaining a job as a professional model when her appearance  although lovely  is in a perpetual state of unkempt disarray. Upon his first meeting with his friend's new charge, Maurice is absolutely smitten with the gorgeous young woman, and his charm has some uneven affect on her  she's at first off-put and revolted by the old man's abruptness but then realizes he's a kindred spirit. Maurice is not necessarily wanting her for sex  even after his operation nearly rendering him impotent  but instead a special needs vanity project where he mentors her in the cultural arts, making her outward appearance better reflect her inner and ultimately falling in love one last time before time runs out for himself.Directed by Roger Michell does a fine job with the up and down screenplay by Hanif Kureishi (although both collaborated on 2003's "The Mother" which I didn't see, it is apparent both are in sync with their sensibilities here. A showcase for O'Toole's thinly- veiled biographical turn  a formerly glamorous, raconteur playboy with devilish wit and verve on display in his now 'golden years' as a faded movie star who apparently has been put out to pasture  proves to still have 'it' - true talent and that star quality in one of the year's best performances. His Maurice may be a tad vainglorious and borderline pathetic but he ultimately makes him empathetic and more importantly, touchingly human. Co-star Phillips is a riot as the ever-maladious complaining co-hort who is just as lost and confused as his compatriot. Newcomer Whittaker gives as good as she gets in her thrust-and-parry chemistry with O' Toole and has her moments as well, with her woman-child busting at the seams with ripe Lolitaesque sensuality but saves her character's cartoon-ization in the long run allowing dignity and again, love & self-respect to come through.The main quibble I had is the last act of the screenplay where Jessie's barely spoken of 'boyfriend' enters the film and the results seem rushed and quite frankly improbably idiotic making Jessie  "Venus" (dubbed by Maurice after a museum visit)  less than sympathetic.Again it is nice to see O'Toole, arguably the last of his kind, embrace a role with gusto and his few scenes with the legendary Redgrave as his ex-wife imbue the film with a nostalgic melancholy of exquisite beauty; a rare gem indeed.
SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD (2010) *** Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Alison Pill, Mark Webber, Johnny Simmons, Ellen Wong, Kieran Culkin, Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza, Satya Bhabha, Chris Evans, Brie Larson, Mae Whitman, Brandon Routh, Jason Schwartzman, Keita Saitou, Shota Saito, (Voice: Bill Hader; Cameos: Thomas Jane, Clifton Collins Jr.) Edgar Wright's groovy adaptation of the graphic novel by Bryan Lee O'Malley (co-scripted by Wright and Michael Bacall with lots of savvy and smarts to spare) about a self-involved slacker cum wanna-be rock-star (Cera at his most winning sad-sack best as the titular anti-hero) who goes ga-ga for It Girl, Ramona Flowers (babe-licious Winstead with Day-Glo wigs for each mood), but must face her 'seven evil exes' in fights-to-the-death ala video game duels. Fast-paced and at times too-full-of-itself with its quirky graphics and cartoonisms (sound effects and "Batman" TV show-like titles popping up every so often) yet has its own irresistible charms (i.e. fine chemistry between its unlikely paramours and some great inside villains  genius casting "Superman" Routh as a vegan powered 'ex' and Schwartzman epitomizes the term 'rat bastard'). Colorful, comic and extraordinary.
KNIGHT AND DAY (2010) **1/2 Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Peter Sarsgaard, Jordi Molla, Viola Davis, Paul Dano, Falk Hentschel, Marc Blucas, Maggie Grace, Dale Dye, Celia Weston. Lively and at times tedious yet entertaining spy/comedy/drama/romance hybrid with Cruise in cruise control as an off-the-reservation-spy who enters an unlikely relationship with an innocent bystander (Diaz skating on charm to spare) involving globetrotting amongst a red herring or two plot device addled screenplay by newcomer Patrick O'Neil pulling out all the cliché stops and turning them on their heads with manic glee. Thanks to able direction from vet James Mangold the proceedings at hand are far from flat-footed yet predictable to a guilty pleasure faulting.
HOT FUZZ (2007) *** Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall, Olivia Colman, Kevin Eldon, Karl Johnson, Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward, Stuart Wilson, Billie Whitelaw, Eric Mason, Paul Freeman, Bill Bailey, Elizabeth Elvin, Trevor Nichols, Lorraine Hilton, Patricia Franklin, Anne Reid, Kenneth Cranham, Stephen Merchant., Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan, Bill Nighy,. Uproarious British spoof of Hollywood cop melodramas with the comic team of Pegg and Frost reunited as a straight-arrow-by-the-book top cop from London and his drunken new partner after the former has been re-assigned to the sleepy bedroom community of idyllic Sandford, where nothing is as it seems (at least as far as Pegg is concerned). A comic valentine send-up to the likes of Bruckheimer/Bay/Woo et al celebrating the over-the-top pyrotechniques and pulling out all the stops in the action packed grand finale. While the film is a tad hit-and-miss in its execution (and its grisly hilarious executions come to think of it) the boys are having a field day thanks to the lively, smart script by Pegg and director Edgar Wright. Fast, frenetic and funny and a big shout out for the outrageous editing by Chris Dickens. Look sharp for unbilled cameos by filmmaker Peter Jackson (as a homicidal Santa Claus!) and Cate Blanchett (also masked) as Pegg's ex.
PIRATES OF THE Caribbean : ON STRANGER TIDES (2011) **1/2 Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, Ian McShane, Geoffrey Rush, Kevin McNally, Sam Claflin, Astrid Berges-Frisbey, Richard Griffiths, Greg Ellis (cameo: Keith Richards) Depp returns for his fourth outing as the swanning pirate Captain Jack Sparrow in Disney's ongoing juggernaut of adventures this time in search of The Fountain of Youth and facing the father of his ex (Cruz), the nefarious Blackbeard (stereotypical casting of the glowering McShane) and in cahoots with 'frienemy' Barbosa (a gleefully upstaging Rush). While there are a few moments of inspired hilarity (i.e. opening gambit involving British army, King George (Griffiths) and Sparrow's quest for a crème puff (!) new-to-the-franchise-helmsman Rob Marshall seems in over his head with a bit too much (i.e. waterlogged pacing) or not enough (man-hungry mermaids!) for the most part, yet not nearly captivating enough.
FRACTURE (2007) *** Anthony Hopkins, Ryan Gosling, David Strathairn, Rosamund Pike, Embeth Davidtz, Billy Burke, Cliff Curtis, Fiona Shaw, Bob Gunton, Josh Stamberg, Xander Berkeley, Zoe Kazan, Joe Spano. (Dir: Gregory Hoblit)Hopkins and Gosling Make Affective Thrust & ParryThe courtroom thriller is alive and well in the latest offering of Sir Anthony playing a meticulous structural engineer named Ted Crawford who shoots his cheating spouse Jennifer (the beautiful Davitz, one of my personal unsung faves, last seen in JUNEBUG), confessing to the police he did it and awaits his trial with an unnatural calming demeanor.Enter rookie prosecutor Willy Beachum (Gosling), a young turk who is on the verge of joining a prestigious law firm to shirk his civil duties for greener pastures, who is handed a seeming no-brainer for his boss Joe Lobruto (Strathairn) but soon discovers his lack of preparation and ambition is about to get the best of him.Crawford, a wily, brilliant and cagy man has decided to represent himself and proves an unexpectedly worthy adversary to the young lawyer to the extent that he may in fact be getting himself acquitted of the heinous, premeditated crime. Meanwhile Beachum is juggling his affair with his boss-to-be Nikki Gardner (Pike) as well as finding the murder weapon, which seems to have vanished into thin air.To add insult to injury Detective Rob Nunally (Burke), the cop who arrived at the scene and roughed up Crawford, is the one Jennifer has been having an affair  which Crawford had discovered and calls Nunally on it on the witness stand. The judge pressures Beachum to find hard evidence or else the case looks to be a loser. With time ticking away, his only witness in a coma and his entire career on the line, Beachum is in over his head with only his wits to get by on. That's what Crawford is hoping for.A crackling good screenplay by veteran Daniel Pyne (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE remake) and cinematic newcomer Glenn Gers (TV's "CYBILL") offers some fine scenes of thrust and parry between the two leads, sprinkled with rueful humor and cunning observances that depicts Crawford as a sharp judge of character (he tells Beachum he already has spotted his character flaws during their preliminary meeting) and Beachum as a pressed- to-the-wall shrewd selfish type. Hopkins gives one of his best performances since his Oscar-winning, iconic turn as Hannibal Lecter (there are shades of his notorious character in playing with his young charge not unlike how he unnerved Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling) with canny, cunning ease and Gosling continues to prove to be an excellent sublime actor who echoes a young Paul Newman in his mannerisms and quiet, thoughtful line readings. Admittedly the plotting has some far-fetched moments of frustration (a key piece of evidence seriously not re-considered until the end?) but director Hoblit (best known for the similar courtroom thriller PRIMAL FEAR which brought back Richard Gere to the forefront of leading men and introduced a shocking turn by an excellent new talent, Edward Norton) knows how to roll with the punches to get to what is real and lets his actors show their chops in another wise familiar yet entertaining genre flick.
THE KARATE KID (2010) ***1/2 Jaden Smith, Jackie Chan, Taraji P. Henson, Wenwen Han, Rongguang Yu, Zhenewei Wang. Excellent remake to the '80s classic about a young boy (Smith in his first lead performance) finds solace and ultimately redemption in martial arts (this time in China and kung-fu) with help from an unlikely source: his apartment complex's seemingly broken down maintenance man (Chan in arguably his best work to date) who mentors him after he has been menaced by his roughneck classmates. Instilled with purpose, tenacity and heart by Christopher Murphey's stoic screenplay and sharp direction by Harald Zwart sweeps the audience's leg and wins them over with great élan. Smith's folks, Will & Jada Pinkett executive produced this winning crowd-pleaser.
THE LOVE GURU (2008) * ½ Mike Myers, Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Romany Malco, Meagan Good, Verne Troyer, John Oliver, Stephen Colbert, Jim Gaffigan, Ben Kingsley, Telma Hopkins. (cameos as themselves: Deepak Chopra, Val Kilmer, Kanye West, Jessica Simpson) Jaw-droppingly awful comedy with no one to blame but Myers (who co-wrote the heinous screenplay with Graham Gordy and also served as producer) in this truly cringe-worthy tale about a deluded 'guru' (guess who?) who wants to be the #1 guru in the world and takes on the case of helping a hockey player break his slump after his wife has left him is the bare-bones of the 'plot' but the rest is one painfully terrible pun-inducing, wink-nudge to the camera, 'love fest' for the star who seriously must think he's so adorable as this ass; hopefully Myers will look 'deep within' and kill this alter ego off. (Dir: Marco Schnabel)
SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR (2014) ***1/2 Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Josh Brolin, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Rosario Dawson, Bruce Willis, Eva Green, Powers Boothe, Dennis Haysbert, Ray Liotta, Christopher Meloni, Jeremy Piven, Christopher Lloyd, Jaime King, Juno Temple, Stacy Keach, Marton Csokas, Jude Cicolella, Jamie Chung, Julia Garner, Lady Gaga. Slam-bang sequel to the mash-up of dynamic duo filmmaker Robert Rodriguez and graphic novelist Frank Miller's collaboration in adapting the latter's cult comic book to the big screen (again) with some new faces (hello Gordon-Levitt as a charming lucky/unlucky gambler) and old (good ol' Rourke as the hulking pugilist avenging Marv) in the seedy titular town of trouble. All sorts of crimes are boiling to a full roil including Brolin's Dwight (replacing Clive Owen) returning for some revenge from femme fatale Green (ethereally lethal) and stripper Alba wanting payback for the suicide of her beloved Willis (brooding in spirit). Gruesome violence, duplicitous women and vice to spare, the film runs on full-tilt, high octane brio with the invaluable skills of Rodriguez (who shot/cut and photographed the sleekly gorgeous black and white with slashes of vibrant color) that only falters in going by too fast to savor the sordid proceedings at hand.
THE ICEMAN (2013) ***1/2 Michael Shannon, Winona Ryder, Chris Evans, Ray Liotta, David Schwimmer, John Ventimiglia, McKaley Miller, Megan Sherrill, James Franco, Stephen Dorff, Robert Davi. Absorbing and compelling crime drama/biopic about the titular, notorious NJ hit man, Richard Kuklinski (Shannon in another incredible performance), whose cold demeanor in his profession belied the warm, family man who doted over his beloved daughters and loving wife (Rider equally excellent), all clueless to the monster in their home. Novice director Ariel Vromen - who co-scripted with Morgan Land -based on the Anthony Bruno book "The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer" and Jim Tebaut's HBO documentary "The Iceman Tapes: Conversations with a Killer" - manages to tread the slippery tight-rope of sympathy for the devil and depicting the sociopathic displays of murder with calm efficiency is relentless in its see- sawing of empathy and fearful disdain. Evans provides some gallows humor as an equally sick puppy (an ice cream truck driver cum assassin in cahoots with Shannon's freelance work) and Liotta returns to form with his snake-eyed seething anger at full-tilt.
BEFORE MIDNIGHT (2013) ***1/2 Third time is the charm in this ongoing romantic dramedy with American writer Ethan Hawke and Parisian lover Julie Delpy reexamining their relationship after reuniting nearly a decade ago focusing on their family, dreams and fears all at the same time while on a vacation in Greece (wonderfully lensed by Christos Voudouris). The logorrhea cum travelogue formula remains tried and true as filmmaker Richard Linklater and his stars (again the trio collaborating on the seemingly-on-the-fly-improvised screenplay) continue to navel-gaze, gripe, and ultimately rekindle a flickering flame of eternal love. A valentine for everyone who's ever fallen in love with questions, doubts and the usual baggage it retains.
JUNO (2007) **** Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney, J.K. Simmons, Olivia Thirlby, Rainn Wilson. Wonderfully acerbic comedy about the titular teen (Page in a star-making tour-de-force comic role), who finds herself pregnant by her sort-of-boyfriend Cera (perfecting awkward into an art form), and deciding to give it up for adoption, possibly to a too-good-to-believe yuppie couple (Garner and Bateman equally deserving huzzahs). A sharp, tart, and smart screenplay by novice wunderkind Diablo Cody and directed with wily brilliance by Jason Reitman, creating a warm, devastatingly funny and surprisingly touching modern-day comedy classic in the making thanks also to the talented ensemble including vets Simmons and Janney as Page's all-too-understanding yet suffering parents. Truly a delight from the get-go with its curdled, archness blending with its gooey center  a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter-slice of perfection. One of the year's very best.
THE ROCKER (2008) **1/2 Rainn Wilson, Christina Applegate, Teddy Geiger, Josh Gad, Emma Stone, Jeff Garlin, Jane Lynch, Jason Sudeikis, Will Arnett, Howard Hesseman, Fred Armisen, Bradley Cooper, Jane Krakowski, Demetri Martin. Frequently funny comedy about a thisclose- to-stardom drummer from an '80s heavy metal hair band (Wilson in touch with his inner Jack Black) whose decades long angst finally gets its due when his high school aged nephew (Gad) enlists him in his struggling band which leads to a new opportunity to become a rock star. While Maya Forbes' and Wallace Wolardarsky's screenplay based on Ryan Jaffe's story is uneven to say the least, the film itself has its charms namely in its star's delusional courage and pluck to carry the weight of the unwieldy gimmick of a storyline which actually is sweet (i.e. chase your dreams by achieving your goals, an old chestnut sure, but it works with gumption here). Sudekis is a sublime riot as a Reuben Kincaid-like-manager. Look sharp for ex-Beatle drummer Pete Best in a blink-and-miss cameo at the film's beginning credits. (Dir: Peter Cattaneo)
A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (2010) **1/2 Jackie Earle Haley, Rooney Mara, Kyle Gallner, Katie Cassidy, Thomas Dekker, Kellan Lutz, Clancy Brown, Connie Britton. Yet another unnecessary, Michael Bay executive produced horror film franchise 'reboot' this time with everyone's favorite bad dream: burn victim/phantom killer Freddy Krueger (Haley acquitting himself nicely as the deranged slasher under a ton of realistic scarring make-up) in this origin story about the fate of him and his chilling legacy of pedophilia (thanks to the streamlined screenplay by vet Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer) leading to seek vengeance against the brood of those who doomed him to his crispy fate. While long-time music video director Samuel Bayer delivers the visual goods in his big-screen debut the film feels re-heated especially when it liberally lifts remake shot-by-shot sequences (i.e. the bathtub shot) and just goes to show that even though new generations want to be scared they'd best rent the original screamer.
THE MUMMY : TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR (2008)** Brendan Fraser, Jet Li, Maria Bello, John Hannah, Michelle Yeoh, Luke Ford, Isabella Leong, Anhony Wong Chau-Sang, Russell Wong, Liam Cunningham, David Calder. Lackluster third entry into the vastly popular "Mummy" franchise with Fraser's reluctant hero archaeologist Rick O'Connell trying to save his son (newcomer Ford) from the fate of unearthing the remains of an evil Chinese emperor (Li). Director Rob Cohen's overuse of CGI is an assault on the senses throwing everything from mummies, to dragons, to Abominable Snowmen (!) oh, my! with overloaded synaptic hamfistedness. And while I adore Bello she is no Rachel Weisz (who she replaces with dodgy Brit accent to boot!)
BLUE VALENTINE (2010) *** Ryan Gosling, Michelle Williams, Faith Wladyka, John Doman, Mike Vogel, Marshall Johnson, Jen Jones, Ben Shenkman. Scenes from a marriage  pre & post break up  of a six year relationship and the all-too-real mélange with excellent top-of-their-game-performances by the leads  Gosling's goofy yet endearing man/child whose complacency only stymies the loving yet guarded and quite-frankly tired Williams  make an indelible impression. As does rookie filmmaker Derek Cianfrance, who has some fine moments depicted on screen particularly for me the cringe-inducing brew haha at Williams' workplace lingering a moment too long and for me, Gosling's impromptu make over of a senior citizen's new rest home environs  endears the audience even though his meet-cute with Williams in the simple fact that she never witnesses this (!)
THE WOLFMAN (2010) *** Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, Hugo Weaving, Art Malik, Geraldine Chaplin, Simon Merrells, Cristina Contes. Bloody good (for the most part) remake of the 1941 Lon Chaney, Jr. /Universal Pictures classic about to-the-manor-born Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro, decidedly vulpine to boot and producer of this pet project/labour of love  and it shows!), whose return to his home to search for his missing brother winds up the victim of his sibling's killer  a werewolf - which in turn passes the lurid lycanthropic curse onto him. Fiercely interpreted by director Joe Johnston with gangbusters production design by Rick Heinrichs, gorgeously shot cinematography by Shelly Johnson, Danny Elfman's eerie score, and the true star of the film  Rick Baker (self-professed "Monster Maker" and who by the way has a dilly of a cameo as one of the Gypsy camps' attack first victim!  for incorporating some of Jack Pierce's designs from back in the day and employing his own crafty excellent creature interpretations that are truly scary and hairy (pun intended); all make up for the rather bare-bones yet true to the source material screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker & David Self. Gory to a fault and Del Toro has a field day; will have you howling for more!
THE PURSUIT OF Happiness (2006) *** Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Thandie Newton, Brian Howe, James Karen, Dan Castellaneta, Kurt Fuller. Smith gives an Oscar worthy turn in the best role of his career so far in this truth-based account of a struggling middle-class man named Chris Gardner attempting to change his luck and finances by taking a huge leap of faith in an unpaid internship for a financial investor Fortune 500 company that leads to only more pitfalls and heartbreak including the dissolution of his marriage to his angered and frustrated wife (Newton precariously balancing her character from shrew to fed-up human being with dignity) and raising their only child (Smith's real-life son Jaden making an impressive debut) in the process. Steve Conrad's adaptation of Gardner's account hits all the marks impeccably and director Gabriele Muccino's reality based American dream slices of life are on the spot. But Smith is the one who should be recognized for making Gardner a flesh- and-blood everyman trying to be a better man, a loving father and a champion for the working class. A real winner.
DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2014) **1/2 Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, Toby Kebbell, Kodi Smit McPhee, Kirk Acevedo, Nick Thurston, Karin Konoval, Judy Greer, Jon Eyez (unfilled cameo: James Franco) Disappointing follow-up to the rebooted sci-fi franchise taking up immediately after RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES where the super simian virus has decimated mankind except for a small band of humans attempting to rebuild civilization in the thicket of San Francisco where Caesar (the peerless Serkis) has command over his ape dominion, reluctant to cooperate with predictable negative results. The dodgy screenplay by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback has clunky exposition and some eye- rolling sequences (to wit: a teen explaining a 'kegger' to an orangutan in a bonding attempt!) and listless direction by Matt Reeves, the wooden acting of Russell and waste of Oldman (clearly cashing a paycheck in a retread of 'villain' for 'villain''s sake) and lackluster lead human Clarke barely registers any hope for humanity. While the CGI is again the star by no means do you need to see it in 3D (there's really none there!) Let's hope the next chapter has some weight.
EARTH (2009) ***1/2 Big screen adaptation of the BBC/Discovery Channel series "Planet Earth" offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly jaw-dropping moments of "how the hell did they get this footage?!" while taking in the awesome scenics of animals in their natural habitats and environmental message of the circle of life can be cruel (witness a Great White Shark gulping down a walrus seal as a quick meal!) and adorable (the various babies and their 'rents). The basso profundo tones of narrator James Earl Jones solidifies its 'God's eye views' and profundity. Culled from literally hundreds of hours of footage, the only gripe comes from the fact this should have been in the IMAX format and could've even gone longer! Oh, well, there's always the next time (since Disney Studios has produced this count on a series of more to come). Dirs: Alastair Fothergill & Mark Linfield.
KILLING THEM SOFTLY (2012) **1/2 Brad Pitt, Ray Liotta, Richard Jenkins, James Gandolfini, Scoot McNairy, Ben Mendelsohn, Vincent Curatola, Trevor Long, Max Casella, Sam Shepard. Well-cast yet ponderous post-Tarantino honor among thieves story based on George V. Higgins' novel "Cogan's Trade" about the knocking off of a mob-run poker game by a pair of jerk-offs who face the comeuppance by a world-weary hit-man (Pitt in very low-key mode, who produced as well) facing a nitpicking middle-man (Jenkins) and a gone-to-seed crony (Gandolfini in a mail-in turn). Directed by Andrew Dominik (who also adapted the screenplay) with some style but very little substance; a disappointment.
LAST CHANCE HARVEY (2008) ***1/2 Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, Eileen Atkins, Kathy Baker, Liane Balaban, James Brolin, Richard Schiff. Middle-aged "Before Sunrise" with American jingle writer, father-of-the-bride Hoffman abroad in England to attend his daughter's wedding and the possibility of losing his job in the process, who meets cute a possible soul mate in the lovely, yet painfully disappointed-by-life Thompson in the process. A wonderful chemistry between the two stars make up for the unlikelihood of this odd coupling but that is what makes the love story so winning and winsome at the same time largely thanks to filmmaker Joel Hopkins' light and meaty screenplay and London's picturesque scenery in the background. A fine gem of a romantic dramedy.
ZACH AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO (2008) *** Elizabeth Banks, Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Jeff Anderson, Jason Mewes, Gerry Bednob, Brandon Routh, Justin Long, Ricky Mabe, Katie Morgan, Traci Lords. Frequently hilarious and vulgar comedy from slacker filmmaker Kevin Smith about two long-time platonic roomies (babelicious Banks and the fuzzy/wuzzy Rogen, making a cute couple) who've come to terms with their economic woes by deciding to film a porno video for immediate financial bail-out (!) A game ensemble including Smith stalwarts Anderson and Mewes get the gross-out jokes and f-bomb dropping patois down pact but amidst its blue humor and seedy backdrop beats a pure heart of a romantic comedy  think "When Harry Screwed Sally" if you will  and Robinson steals the movie as Rogen's coffeehouse co-worker cum producer. Funny and sweet at the same time, something for everyone and winningly acted.
INTERSTELLAR (2014) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Mackenzie Foy, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, William Devane, Leah Cairns, Topher Grace, Timothy Chalamet, Brooke Smith (voice of Bill Irwin) Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (and to his daughter) continues his streak of audacious sense of space (literally) and the inner human spirit : set in the bleak future Earth is on the descent of humanity with continuous food demands and climate change with one Hail Mary of a plan by NASA - send a small crew thru a wormhole (just go with it) to see if 'they' can help us. A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation, anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine (a Nolan regular). The true stars are the breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, a stellar score by frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer and fantastic visual effects by literally dozens of geniuses. The only stumbling block is its slightly heavy handed message getting across but the Twilight Zone-ish final act makes up for it in spades. WOW!
RABBIT HOLE (2010) *** Nicole Kidman, Aaron Eckart, Dianne Wiest, Miles Teller, Tammy Blanchard, Sandra Oh, Giancarlo Esposito, Jon Tenney, Patricia Kalember. Kidman and Eckart excel as recently grieving parents over the loss of their beloved child in an accident and the broken pieces of their relationship rests on tenderhooks as the couple attempt to go on living their lives in spite of the tremendous hole in their lives with equal bits of bitterness, resentment, sorrow and ultimately hope. John Cameron Mitchell does a fine job keeping the pace and tone evenly to David Lindsay-Abaire's screen adaptation of his play with a blend of drama, comedy and tragedy that is leads handle with aplomb and a superb supporting cast including Wiest as Kidman's mother who knows only all-too well the deep pains she is dealing with and newcomer (and John Cusack look-alike) Teller as another key ingredient to the unfolding storyline (he also provides the film's double-meaning title with a graphic novel he is working on). For anyone who has ever grieved and finding it difficult to make any sense of a severe loss it is a must-see.
THE QUIET (2006) ** Elisha Cuthbert, Camilla Belle, Edie Falco, Martin Donovan, Shawn Ashmore, Katy Mixon. (Dir: Jamie Babbit) A would-be "Wild Things" for the Next GenerationIn 1998 a pot boiling neo-noir B -movie trash/guilty pleasure, "Wild Things", came out of left field making some waves at the box office and critics were awakened from their complacent naps thanks to some hanky panky between babes Denise Richards and Neve Campbell and an insidious threesome with Matt Dillon incorporating sordid sex with conspiracy for murder and other heinous acts. Since then there have been a few failed attempts to capitalize on its "eww" factor and raise interest in taboos. This latest offering is a fluke just as well.Dot (Belle), is a pretty teenager who is deaf and mute and has come recently into the home of family friends the Deers, after her father has been killed in a freak accident (her mother is referred to as having died years previously). The Deers, Olivia and Paul (Falco and Donovan, respectively) are just getting their bearings in their newly refurbished home which is still in the stages of redesign. Their only daughter, Nina (Cuthbert), is a teenager the same age as Dot and despite their history of being childhood friends have fractured their tentative relationship do in no small part to Nina treating Dot with course abruptness whenever she is with her catty cheerleader girlfriend Michelle (Mixon). But Dot can see through her friend and can tell she is putting on a mask about her demeanor even though Dot herself is stand-offish at school and would rather hide behind her long bangs and over-sized, shapeless clothing.Nina is harboring a horrible secret and when Dot discovers it by chance she is torn about revealing her own secret in lieu of their tenacious friendship: Nina is having an incestuous relationship with her father and Dot can really talk and hear.What follows is a somewhat sordid metaphorical foray into the darker aspects of human nature but it is handled with ham-fisted dialogue by screenwriters Abdi Nazemian and Micah Schraft with plodding direction by Jamie Babbit that by the third and climactic act is all but underscored with a Sharpie marker and is nothing but a junky resolve to what could've been an interesting character study for either of the young, talented actresses to sink their teeth into. Falco and Donovan seem to be wasted in the process with Falco's character zombie'd on sleeping pills and other pharmaceuticals while Donovan's father figure has shades of sympathy until the second half where he becomes a ridiculous monster. Although busty newcomer Mixon makes for a nice bitch her character too becomes a parody of what a nasty little girl has blossomed into and Ashmore provides a somewhat sympathetic nice guy, again until the clumsy ending.The sex scenes are somewhat discreet which is probably a good thing considering incest at the forefront and not unlike its seamy predecessor "Wild Things", baring only in resemblance as an overheated pot that needs to be simmered.
MAN ON A LEDGE (2012) ** Sam Worthington, Elizabeth Banks, Jaime Bell, Genesis Rodriguez, Ed Harris, Edward Burns, Anthony Mackie, Kyra Sedgwick, Titus Welliver, William Sadler. Fugitive NYC cop (bland Worthington) sets to prove his innocence for a crime he didn't commit in an elaborately staged suicidal attempt from The Roosevelt Hotel's ledge setting up a circus of errors and an unlikely bonding with his negotiator (a miscast Banks). Novice filmmaker Asger Leth and screenwriter Pablo F. Ferjves combine the melodramatics of DOG DAY AFTERNOON, PHONE BOOTH & INSIDE MAN in this convoluted mash-up that barely gets the adrenaline pumping nor the brainwaves coaxing  except maybe caliente Rodriguez as younger brother Bell's hottie girlfriend and accomplice.
THE KING'S SPEECH (2010) **** Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi, Jennifer Ehle, Clarie Bloom , Timothy Spall. Excellent drama focusing on King George VI (Oscar-worthy Firth in one of his absolute best performances) whose reluctant ascension to the high order of England is only circumvented by his life-long suffering stammer that comes to a head by enlisting an Unorthodox speech specialist (deviled ham Rush equally worthy of an Academy Award as Supporting Actor) with the full support of his faithfully stoic wife (Bonham Carter, ditto for Supporting Actress). Championed by a sterling script by David Seidler and subtly helmed by director Tom Hooper the film serves as both a parable about a war-torn nation (i.e. WWII UK) being bolstered in spirit by a tongue-tied leader overcoming various demons and all odds against him, succeeding in the long run. One of the year's best and arguably one of the most satisfying acting ensembles in some time.
MOONRISE KINGDOM (2012) *** Jared Gilman, Kara Hayward, Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Bob Balaban, Jason Schwartzman. Wes Anderson's ever straddling of genius filmmaking and twee dioramatic storytelling continues in this funny and light-hearted boy-meets-girl comedy about a precocious adolescent romance between a scout (Gilman) and a paramour in the lovely form of a misunderstood girl (Hayward) who embark on a secret rendezvous only to be thwarted by ever-vigilant scoutmaster Norton (having fun at being a by-the-book nebbish); local law enforcement (melancholic Willis); the girls' miserable parents (Murray and McDormand) and the hands of fate. Deadpanned to a dire degree with its deliveries of sharp, smart and funny dialogue courtesy of Anderson and frequent collaborator Roman Coppola with its cute-as-homemade-shoes approach to a 1965 cameo of a timeless puppy love affair.
This does not star Kurt Russell, but rather allows him what amounts to an extended cameo. This work is more centered around the "son of" story line than it is the actual super heroes themselves, thereby failing to deliver the appropriate level of entertainment, and contributing instead, that enigmatic substance known as "kid appeal." I expected more. But having said that, there is more to this work than meets the eye. The story is modeled after the old classic "B" science fiction movies we hate to love, but do. The effects are nothing spectacular, but are still above what you would expect, all things considering. And beneath the camp, lies a stronger feeling, reminiscent of a classic superhero story, yet it still fails to achieve the desired affect; if only marginally.It was entertaining and I still had great fun in watching it.This rates an 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.
THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (1974) ***1/2 One of the scariest and most ripped-off modern horror films of all time that became an instant cult- classic thanks to filmmaker Tobe Hooper's shrewd low-budget instincts to film the ensuing carnage as a defacto documentary into hell: a group of young friends wind up in a backwater charnel house of horrors as they are stalked by the chainsaw wielding mad-man/butcher Leatherface (a pop culture idol of millions of fanboys and genre lovers to date) and his 'family' of miscreant psychopaths. Disturbing, raw and visceral but surprisingly not gory (the only true setback for me!) and a nice touch of dreadful suspense. Screamer Marilyn Burns as the resiliently reluctant heroine is one of the unsung 'scream queens' of American cinema. And yes that is John Larroquette as the sonorous narrator!
KUNG FU PANDA (2008) ***1/2 (Voices of: Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, David Cross, Randall Duk Kim, James Hong, Dan Fogler, Michael Clarke Duncan, Wayne Knight, Kyle Gass, Laura Kightlinger, JR Reed) Very entertaining animated fare with Black voicing the wannabe titular character, Po, who may or may not be the destined martial arts savior for a village menaced by the sinister snow leopard Tai Lung (a scary good McShane) who wants revenge after being imprisoned by his mentor Shifu, the raccoon (Hoffman in fine, gruff but lovable form). Wonderfully realized animation from the amazing pre-credit sequence to the heroic ending. Fine family fare indeed; Black has a field day and some pleasantly surprising nuanced vocal chops. (Dirs: Mark Osborne and John Stevenson)
THE DARKEST HOUR (2011) ** Emile Hirsch, Olivia Thirlby, Max Mingella, Rachael Taylor, Joel Kinnaman, Veronika Ozerova. So-so sci-fi suspenser about a quartet of young Americans partying abroad in Russia when a sudden invasion of nasty invisible aliens embark and must fight back or else becomeashes! While the ingenuous genre tactics to ward off the intergalactic monsters (microwaves) and warning devices for the unseeable horde (light bulbs!) has a unique quality the film offers some dreadful acting (Ms.Taylor) , horrible dialogue (no thanks to the stilted screenplay by Jon Spaihts, Leslie Bohem and M.T. Ahern) the rookie director does the best he can with a few nifty visual computer generated effects at his disposable in this otherwise disposable film.
WHITE HOUSE DOWN (2013) *** Channing Tatum, Jamie Foxx, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jason Clarke, Richard Jenkins, Joey King, James Woods, Nicolas Wright, Jimmi Simpson, Michael Murphy, Rachel Lefevre, Lance Reddick, Matt Craven, Peter Jacobson, Barbara WIlliams, Kevin Rankin, Garcelle Beauvais. "Die Hard in The White House - Part II" - after the on-the-heels-release of "Olympus Has Fallen" is a near redux this time with Tatum flexing his pecs and right man-in- the-wrong-place-at-the-right-time shading of John McClane as a DC cop who finds himself knee deep in a heavily armed assault on The Oval Office while attending a job interview cum tour of the building with his young daughter in tow. Faced against insurmountable odds (and a lot of credibility swallowing) Tatum makes a good use of his talents (including some dry humor) while saving The President Of The Untied States (Foxx equally good as well) while all hell breaks loose thanks largely to the fun and dumb screenplay by James Vanderbilt and director of mass destruction Roland Emmerich taking pot-shots at his own "Independence Day" with Michael Bay bull-in-the-china-shop/kitchen sink skills at full tilt. Wright steals the show as the White House tour guide who takes perhaps too much pride in his gig.
THE PROPOSAL (2009) **1/2 Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds, Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson, Betty White, Denis O'Hare, Malin Akerman, Oscar Nunez, Aasif Mandvi, Michael Nouri. Relatively formulaic fish-out-of-water romantic comedy with harridan boss-from-hell Bullock (cast against type and acquitting herself nicely), an A-type book publisher exec whose expiring visa forces her to imbibe her long-suffering assistant (Reynolds ditto) into a sham marriage to avoid deportation back to Canada with the hitch that she go away to his family retreat for the weekend in the wilds of Africa. While the pedestrian script by Pete Chiarelli, the direction by Anne Fletcher allows her stars  and an able supporting cast particularly veteran national treasure White as Reynolds' feisty grandmother  to stretch their comedic muscles in a rather winning and sweet mix of slapstick and latter-day screwball comedy.
SAFE (2012) *** Jason Statham, Catherine Chan , Robert John Burke, James Hong, Anson Mount, Chris Sarandon, Joseph Sikora, Igor Jijikine, Reggie Lee. Rock'em, sock'em crime drama/action thriller tailor-made for Statham's strong suits  glowering and ass-kicking. Namely as a disgraced former NYPD detective who finds himself involved with a Chinese triad out to put the hurt on a 12 year old girl (Chan), whose genius for math and numbers has her in deep trouble with a real Maguffin (some nonsense about a computer file with a lot of skinny dirt on a lot of nameable names  YAWN). But thanks to filmmaker Boaz Yakin who also wrote the screenplay that feels cribbed slightly from Luc Besson's "THE PROFESSIONAL" it's the wham/bam fleet-footed fighting skills of the Cockney Willis and the wildly over-the-top car chases executed with some vervy panache in The Big Apple.
DEADFALL (2012) **1/2 Eric Bana, Olivia Wilde, Charlie Hunnam, Sissy Spacek, Kris Kristofferson, Kate Mara, Treat Williams. Neo-noir caper-gone-awry flick with Bana and Wilde as homicidal brother and mistreated sister who wind up in the wintry wilds after a car crash in the aftermath of a casino heist wind up reunited in an unlikely Thanksgiving's Day dinner of a family held hostage by the desperate siblings. In spite of the logy direction by Stefan Ruzowitzky and novice screenwriter Zach Dean's uneven tone of dark comedy or straight-forward crime thriller, the film as a whole makes up in its talented cast and the wild, cold whiteout landscape that is a character unto itself evoking A SIMPLE PLAN meets THE KILLING.
THE CONVERSATION (1974) **** Gene Hackman, John Cazale, Allen Garfield, Frederic Forrest, Cindy Williams, Teri Garr, Robert Duvall. Francis Ford Coppola's mid-piece masterpiece  filmed between the first two "GODFATHER" films  is a study in Watergate-era paranoia and a seminal '70s classic about a walled-off surveillance expert named Harry Caul (Hackman in one of his best performances ever), whose methods of spy ware enlists him into dark waters  namely the plotting for a possible murder  that ultimately sends him into a downward spiral, and more unsettling for Harry: the discovery of his own conscience. Well-crafted and executed with a stellar ensemble including a pre-star Harrison Ford as the veiled homosexual personal assistant to puppet master Robert Duvall and for trivia purists yes that is Robert Shields of Shields & Yarnell as the mime Forrest & Williams witness on one of their ill-fated meetings. One of the best-underrated classics of all time.
A SERIOUS MAN (2009) *** Michael Stuhlbarg, Richard Kind, Fred Melamed, Sari Lennick, Aaron Wolff, Jessica McManus, DavidKang, Adam Arkin, George Wyner, Amy Landecker, Simon Helberg, Fyvush Finkel. The Coen Brothers' modern-day look at Job circa 1967: witness one Larry Gopnik (a perfect Stuhlarg) a hapless, Midwestern, Jewish physics professor, whose life is crumbling around him gradually until near Biblical heights as one unforeseen event tumbles like so many dominoes to the point of high neuroses/psychoses. Pitch perfect in its dead-pan, droll deliveries by the talented filmmakers there are a few moments where the premise is stretched, but the universal question of "Why Me?" has never been more palpable.
ACROSS THE UNIVERSE (2007) ***1/2 Evan Rachel Wood, Jim Sturgess, Joe Anderson, Dana Fuchs, Martin Luther, T.V. Carpio, Spencer Liff, Angela Mounsey, Robert Clohessy, Linda Emond, Dylan Baker, Bill Irwin, Harry Lennix, James Urbaniak, Joe Cocker, Bono, Eddie Izzard, Salma Hayek. Trippy, joyous phantasmagorical magical adaptation of The Beatles' songbook brought to the silver screen by wunderkind director Julie Taymor set in the turbulent Vietnam Era '60s (natch) with a Liverpudlian boy named Jude (Sturgess) falling for a girl named Lucy (Wood) while trekking to NYC to find his father. In the process of the heady and at times heavy prospects of making the Fab Four's material even more accessible there are far more hits than misses and it's hard-pressing to be such a sour-puss when the overwhelming message of 'all you need is love' rings out in sweet harmony.
THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (2009) ** Tony Goldwyn, Monica Potter, Garret Dillahunt, Sara Paxton, Riki Lindhome, Aaron Paul, Martha MacIsaac, Spencer Treat Clark. Repellently ugly and brutal remake of Wes Craven's cult classic chiller about a family terrorized by a family of psychopathic criminals after a kidnapping and vicious rape is inflicted on the daughter and her friend, only for the daughter to barely escape with her life and to find her attackers setting up camp at her family's summer home. A curdled revenge tale that offers little redemption and plain stark imagery of utter cruelty inflicted on the senses it's the equivalent of rubbernecking at an accident or witnessing a snuff movie being filmed; however disturbing the film is well acted and produced and filmmaker Dennis Iliadis sets up the just desserts with relish.
ANNABELLE (2014) * Annabelle Wasllis, Ward Horton, Tony Amendola, Alfre Woodard, Kerry O'Malley, Brian Howe, Eric Ladin. Very disappointing prequel to THE CONJURING giving the origin story of the titular possessed doll which depicts vanilla bland couple Wallis and Horton beginning their lives together with a baby on the way leading to echoes of ROSEMARY's BABY and an overactive sound track. Woodard actually looks beyond bored in a quick paycheck as the owner of a bookstore that specializes in the supernatural (and has a personal risk at stake).While cinematographer-turned-director John R. Leonetti takes the reins for the first time as helmsman from producer James Wan, the rote storyline by Gary Dauberman fails to keep a decent scare ratio nor a sizable body count as anticipated. Better off watching CHILD's PLAY or a true creep fest like "The Dummy" from THE TWILIGHT ZONE. One genuine jolt does not make a sufficient thriller by any means.
SUNSHINE CLEANING (2009) *** Amy Adams, Emily Blunt, Alan Arkin, Jason Spevack, Steve Zahn, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Clifton Collins, Jr., Eric Christian Olsen, Paul Dooley. Winning indie dramedy about two misfit sisters (Adams and Blunt at their most winsome) finding life to be nothing but a dead-end until they wind up in a new job endeavor: biohazard/crime scene clean-up service (!) The fine ensemble makes up for the sometimes cloying screenplay by Meagan Holley but Christine Jeffs elicits strong turns by her leads particularly Blunt in arguably her best work to date. Funny and poignant (Adams' scene with an elderly woman after a horrible suicide speaks volumes).
LOCKOUT (2012) *** Guy Pearce, Maggie Grace, Vincent Regan, Joseph Gilgun, Peter Stormare, Lennie James, Jacky Ido, Anne-Solenne Hatte. Better-than-it-should-be mash up of "Die Hard In Outer Space" meets "Escape From New York" could've been the pitch for this fun and over-the-top sci-fi actioner set in the near future with glib, laconic Pearce (channeling Snake Plissken & John McClane) , a wrongly charged espionage patsy, enlisted to rescue the President's daughter aboard an overrun interstellar prison with the violent inmates running the asylum/hostage scenario with the usual flare-ups of hostility, oil/water chemistry with his sleek charge (a game Grace) and the time-clock ticking away. Revved up action thanks to filmmaking team James Mather & Stephen St. Leger (collaborating with filmmaker Luc Besson on the congested screenplay) and a plucky anti-hero make things more soothe-sailing for the bumpy ride ahead.
SILENT HOUSE (2012) ** Elizabeth Olsen, Adam Trese, Eric Sheffer Stevens, Julia Taylor Ross, Haley Murphy. Fairly effective chiller with Olsen as a young woman in a sort of homecoming who is helping her father get a piece of real estate ready for an impending sale and finds herself trapped when a home invasion occurs (or does it?) The real-time one-take gimmick employed by intrepid married filmmakers Chris Kentis and Laura Lau (who adapted from a film by Gustavo Hernandez) is rather smoothly transferred with impeccable camera-work by Igor Martinvoic yet the premise taxes the nerves (and not in the way it should i.e. gooseflesh/hair-on-end spookiness) by the story's (anti)climax that upends psychological horror instead of its ghost-story approach of things-that-bump-in-the-night in spite of its leading lady's full-on embodiment to a finely tuned pitch of believable angst and genuine terror.
THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008) **** Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Taraji P. Henson, Julia Ormond, Tilda Swinton, Jason Flemyng, Jared Harris, Mahershalalhashbaz Ali, Elias Koteas, Phyllis Somerville, Elle Fanning. Remarkable adaptation loosely based on F.Scott Fitzgerald's short story about a man born old and aging in reverse  becoming younger  is given gravitas and dignity thanks to the surprisingly adult direction by David Fincher and splendid lead performance by Pitt (both arguably career bests and Oscar worthy). Eric Roth and Robin Swicord's screenplay is full of rich characters and touching bravado that echoes "Forrest Gump" in many ways, not the least of which Roth also wrote the adaptation of. Excellent acting by Blanchett as Pitt's star-crossed lover and Henson as his adoptive mother. But the truly impressive feat is by the visual effects crew super-imposing Pitt on other actors in different stages of Button's regression through the decades in a seamless matter. Kudos to Greg Cannom's make-up crew for an amazing job for both Pitt and Blanchett. One of the year's very best films.
GHOST RIDER (2007) ** Nicolas Cage, Eva Mendes, Wes Bentley, Sam Elliott, Peter Fonda, Donal Logue. Lackluster big-screen adaptation of the cult Marvel Comics classic about a daredevil motorcycle stunt driver named Johnny Blaze (Cage attempting to do the best he can but quite frankly a tad long-in-the-tooth to be a brash, "young" hot-shot), who makes a deal with the devil that costs him his soul to be cursed to be the titular avenger with varying results ranging from the rad cool to the utterly laughable (the hackneyed screenplay by the director Mark Steven Johnson is wooden to a point of parody). Yummy Mendes is pretty (and pretty much wasted) as the love interest from his past who gives him a new lease on life. Wish the same could be said of the film itself.
AIN'T THEM BODIES SAINTS (2013) ** Rooney Mara, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Keith Carradine, Kennadie and Jacklynn Smith, Nate Parker. Echoes of Malick ring in this laboriously paced neo noir about a young couple's misguided crimes leading to a long wait for the significant's other to be released from prison culminating in a tedious love triangle and some truly foolish actions. David Lowery conveys only an exercise in futility in spite of a fine performance by Foster (in subtle, low-key brush strokes) and a nifty soundtrack employing hand clapping in a gunfight's rhythm is not enough to maintain interest while looking at one's watch wondering when will this get better and/or end.
RUN ALL NIGHT (2015) ***1/2 Liam Neeson, Ed Harris, Joel Kinnaman, Boyd Holbrook, Bruce McGill, Genesis Rodriguez, Vincent D'Onofrio, Common, Lois Smith, Patricia Kalember (Unbilled cameo: Nick Nolte) Old school gangster film-of-sorts with Neeson in top form as a drunken washed up hit-man whose estranged son (Kinnaman) runs afoul of his boss and lifelong friend Harris in a sins-of-the-father/honor-among-thieves vengeance actioner set on one night in neo noir Manhattan. Lean and taut screenplay by Brad Ingelsby and fluid direction by Jaume Collet-Serra keeps things lively in a predictable yet entertaining genre piece thanks largely to skillful acting by its leads Neeson with his best world-weary flinty resolve and Harris as a reptilian eyed villain with nary a flinch at the bloodshed and body counts amounting in the wake of an eye for an eye.
X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (2011) *** James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Kevin Bacon, Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence, Oliver Platt, Zoe Kravitz, Jason Flemyng, January Jones, Nichols Hoult, Caleb Landry, January Jones, Edi Gathegi, Lucas Till, Glenn Morshower, Matt Craven, James Remar, Michael Ironside, Ray Wise, Jason Beghe, (cameo: Hugh Jackman) The Marvel Comics franchise gets a reboot in this better-than-anticipated prequel to the origins of Charles Xavier and fellow crusading mutant Erik Lehnsherr (both nicely played by McAvoy and Fassbender, respectively) out to stop evil mutant Sebastian Shaw (crisp Bacon having a field day as the baddie) from destroying the world with the backdrop of The Cuban Missile Crisis circa 1962. Director Matthew Vaughn (once previously slated to helm a chapter of the series) balances the fantastic visual effects set pieces (i.e. Magneto lifting a submarine out of the ocean) and allows his young cast of gifted actors (the aforementioned protagonists and Lawrence too as Mystique) to bring some depth with an undercurrent of darkness much needed for the showcase of mutants being recruited to both sides of good and evil.
BABY MAMA (2008) ***1/2 Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Greg Kinnear, Dax Shepard, Romany Malco, Sigourney Weaver, Steve Martin, Maura Tierney, Holland Taylor, James Rebhorn, Denis O'Hare, John Hodgman, Siobhan Fallon, Will Forte, Fred Armisen. Frequently hilarious comedy about a young career woman (Fey at her brainy/sexy best) whose determination to have a baby results in a bid for surrogate in the unlikely form of white-trashy Poehler (a comic gem) and their rocky balance of bonding while fighting ala "The Odd Couple" make for a chemistry, baby, chemistry pair of misfits. A fine comic ensemble particularly a fertile Weaver as the head of the clinic Fey enlists aid and Martin as Fey's New Age-y supercilious boss. Written and directed with comic gusto by Michael McCullers.
INTERVIEW (2007) ** ½ Steve Buscemi adapted and directed this remake of slain European filmmaker Theodor Holman's absorbing yet constrained character study about a once hotshot political journalist (Buscemi) forced into taking a fluff piece assigned by his editor on a superficial actress best known for her lascivious lifestyle (Miller, in another strong performance, proving she's more than a pretty face) than for her questionable work. While there is a generous amount of tete-a-tete between the two unlikely protagonists, the trappings of a 2-person play hinders the exercise in ego, fame, celebrity and ethics. While Buscemi continues to prove his versatility both as an actor and as a filmmaker  given the borders of the piece  it is Miller who shrewdly skewers her own image.
HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY (2008) ***1/2 Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Doug Jones, Seth MacFarlane (voice), Luke Goss, Anna Walton, Jeffrey Tambor, John Hurt. Wunderkind filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's fantastic sequel to his collaboration with/on Mike Mignola's cult comic book hero, Hellboy (Perlman coming across as a cross between Lee Marvin and a strawberry colored Twizzler), this time with the world-weary demon spawn facing a rebellious elf prince (Goss, a cross between Iggy Pop and Legolas from LORD OF THE RINGS) wanting to sever the agreement between mankind and the subterranean otherworld denizens by unleashing the titular soldiers of misfortune. Blair and Jones lend able support reprising their roles as Big Red's main squeeze, fire starter extraordinaire Liz Sherman and empathetic aquatic creature Abe Sapien, respectively. Added to the mix is protoplasmic mystic Johann Krauss (voiced by MacFarlane), new leader of the secret US organization The Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) with his no-nonsense, Teutonic ways of dealing with adversity within the ranks; and ethereal Walton as the elf princess twin sister who also provides a love interest for Abe. Del Toro gets his cinematic ya-yas out by employing some truly dazzling SFX and homages to Ray Harryhausen, STAR WARS' cantina sequence, Barry Manilow (!) and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Rock'em, sock'em rousing entertainment all around. Hell'z yeah!
FRANK (2014) ** Michael Fassbender, Domhnall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Scoot McNairy, Francois Civil, Carla Azar, Tess Harper, Bruce McIntosh. Knee-deep in indie-ville oddity to say the least - loosely based on Frank Sidebottom, the late British comic entertainer - depicts sad sack office drone wanna be musician Gleeson winding up as a member of a truly eccentric band of artistes, including the titular ring-leader who wears a ginormous Mardi-Gras mask resembling the Coney Island mascot Tillile (Fassbender having a field day by obscuring his ruggedly handsome visage and taking a huge leap of faith) who takes him along for a ride of a lifetime; genius obscurity. While the disjointed storyline by Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan and listless direction by novice Lenny Abrahamson barely gel for a rote fish-out-of-water dramedy it does enable the viewer of what the cult of personality can do (and undo) while skirting across the mental health issues outweighed by the free fall of creativity.
EAGLE VS. SHARK (2007) **1/2 Jermaine Clement, Loren Horsley, David Fane, Craig Hill, Morag Hills, Cohen Holloway, Loren Horsley, Rachel House, Brian Sergent, Bernard Stewart, Joel Tobeck, Jackie van Beek. Frequently funny dippy rom-com from New Zealand about two square pegs (the geekily appealing Clement and Horsley) who find each other but apparently have not much in common, in spite of their differences, they make a unique couple. Think the Kiwi hybrid of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE meets ME & YOU & EVERYONE WE KNOW. Writer/ director Taika Cohen infuses genuine heartbreak with pathos and just the right amount of cringing humor to get the laughs out , and intersperses the film with quirky animation.
AWAY FROM HER (2007) **** Julie Christie, Gordon Pinsent, Olympia Dukakis, Michael Murphy, Kristen Thomson, Wendy Crewson, Alberta Watson, Katie Boland. (Dir: Sarah Polley)Christie and Pinsent give Oscar worthy performances in a sterling drama ; a remarkable film-making debut by Polley. Actress Sarah Polley makes an audacious and remarkable film-making debut in her adaptation of Alice Munro's short story "The Bar Came Over the Mountain" with its storyline about an aging married couple's plight when Alzheimer's strikes the wife, Fiona (the gorgeous Christie giving a dynamic performance), who decides in its earliest stages to have herself placed into a health care institutional home to care for her while her loving husband Grant (veteran actor Pinsent, equally compellingly good) is hesitant; the couple have never been apart in 43 years and the trial period of 30 days for Fiona to get acclimated to her new environs, proves taxing particularly for Grant.The couple have been very active over the years and Fiona is considered a real 'lady' who knows quite a bit in relation to culture, the finer things and her husband's philandering past. Grant fears she may be using her dementia as a crutch to punish him for his improprieties and also fears he may be losing her altogether: their marriage a shadowy afterthought in the cobwebs of her dimming memory.To add insult to injury when Grant finally arrives after his month's probationary period to visit, he finds Fiona has begun to slip further away and has struck a new friendship with another patient, the mute Aubrey (veteran character actor Murphy who communicates amazingly with subtle eye and facial movements to convey his sadness) who she claims to have known in the past. His wife Marian (the incomparable Dukakis) tries to do the best she can with her spouse but accepts the limitations involved and strikes up a friendship with Grant as well. Polley, an accomplished young Canadian actress best known for her indie work such as "THE SWEET HEREAFTER" and the remake of "DAWN OF THE DEAD", makes a stunningly astute and heartfelt directorial debut (she also wrote the screenplay adaptation) with remarkable élan, grace and class. Reportedly the short story which appeared in THE NEW YORKER affected her so deeply - (her late grandmother was in a retirement community and her grandfather had a similar condition known as Picks' disease)- she sought out Christie, who she previously co-starred with her in Hal Hartley's "NO SUCH THING" (this marks her third collaboration with the iconic actress), who at first was very hesitant but, wisely , acquiesced, with her excellently executed turn as Fiona, a woman who clearly has a lot to live for and fight for and makes it all the worth while with her sharp chemistry with Pinsent (who I must admit never heard of before but is also an actor of reckoning), whose quiet, introspective yet deeply felt performance and his rich baritone nicely compliment his co-star making you believe they indeed have been a couple for many years.While the film is powerfully acted and directed it is surprisingly not a melancholic syrupy hazy account nor is it a sugar-coated valentine to love's healing powers. It is a frank, adult and very human depiction of one couple's attempt to grow in a seemingly unfortunate fate yet with humor, intelligence and truly mature viewpoint. One of the year's best films and one that should not be overlooked for next year's Oscars for all its major categories.
STATE OF PLAY (2009) ***1/2 Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams, Helen Mirren, Robin Wright Penn, Jason Bateman, Jeff Daniels, Michael Berresse, Harry Lennix, Josh Mostel, Michael Weston, Barry Shabaka Henley, Viola Davis. Tense and taut journalistic thriller about a conspiracy involving a hot shot congressman (Affleck, surprisingly good) ensnared in a scandalous affair gone badly : his assistant is killed and it may have been suicide  or not. Enter Crowe (low-key and excellent) as an old school Washington, DC investigative reporter who is on the story and has his reasons: namely the politico was his college roomie and friend from back in the day. Also aboard is the paper's Internet blogger, feisty McAdams (equally holding her own with the big boys), who gets a taste for real news and real trouble in the process. A game ensemble cast (including Daniels as a shady mentor of Affleck's and Mirren as the grande dame boss to the scribes), a sharply structured, twisty screenplay adaptation (based on the popular BBC TV series) by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy and Billy Ray, and the smooth and efficient direction by Kevin Macdonald makes for an effective valentine to '70s newspaper thrillers like "All The President's Men".
SHUTTER ISLAND (2010) *** Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, John Carroll Lynch, Elias Koteas. Well crafted but loaded with red herrings/MacGuffins galore adaptation of Dennis Lehane's novel about a pair of US Federal Marshals (DiCaprio and Ruffalo) investigating the escape of a patient on a remote island prison for the criminally insane circa 1954 where all is not it appears to be (and then some!) in maestro filmmaker Martin Scorsese's well-checked salute to Hitchcock with some Lynchian underpinnings to make things all oogie-woogie in this at-times-edge-of-your-seat suspenser/ghost story until the exposition choked final act (which becomes tiresome and drawn out for those that might not get the 'gotcha' that's been leading up to its cliffhanger climax). DiCaprio, who gives one of his most exhaustingly expert turns here running the gamut of practically every emotion know to mankind, heads a crackerjack ensemble cast running on all-cylinders (too bad the same can't be said of Laeta Kalogridis' script which becomes a tad redundant). Yet all the same perfect viewing for a dark-and-stormy night.
EXTRACT (2009) *** Jason Bateman, Mila Kunis, Kristen Wiig, Ben Affleck, JK Simmons, Clifton Collins Jr., Dustin Milligan, David Koechner, Beth Grant. Filmmaker Mike Judge (look for his fun cameo) goes to the work force well again in this frequently on-target comedy about a frustrated, put-upon extract factory owner (Bateman sealing his hip-to-be-square fate/straight-man of the '00s) who faces sexual difficulties with his wife (a frigidly funny Wiig) and a pending lawsuit by an injured employee that may both gum up the works in his decision to sell the business. Absurdly amusing with a game supporting cast (particularly an out-there shaggy Affleck as the straw-that-stirs-the-drink barkeep bud catalyst to the plots at hand and Koechner steals the film as the next-door-neighbor-from-hell). Some big laughs sprinkled liberally among the smaller, the film succeeds most in depicting how stupidity reins in the workforce but doesn't quite match its bookend cousin, "OFFICE SPACE".
SERAPHIM FALLS (2007) *** Pierce Brosnan, Liam Neeson, Angie Harmon, Anjelica Huston, Ed Lauter, Michael Wincott, Robert Baker, Kevin J.O'Connor, Xander Berkeley, Wes Studi, James Jordan, Nate Mooney, Jimmi Simpson, Tom Noonan, Shannon Zeller.Vengeance has its price.The revenge Western has been around for quite some time  as long as revenge has been around I suppose (which may be redundant)  and the latest of this sub-genre owes quite a bit to John Ford's "The Searchers" and a kissing cousin to the Clint Eastwood revenge oater "The Outlaw Josey Wales'.In its latest incarnation, the story begins in the wintry confines of the Ruby Mountains circa 1868, and Gideon (a nearly unrecognizable Brosnan as far away from being The Artist Formerly Known As Bond here) is being pursued by a relentless tracker in the form of a taciturn man named Carver (low-key Neeson speaking volumes in his determined yet steely silent eyes), hell-bent on catching his fugitive, in tow with several hired guns to get the job done, by any means necessary.Opening with Gideon being shot in the arm and running through the wintry landscape, falling into a freezing river and eventually excising the silver-dollar sized bullet with wincing dexterity, the pace continues to be breathless and anticipatory as Gideon manages to be one-step ahead while Carver's troupe are two-behind.The reason for Carver's intent is not revealed until the final act (which is the weaker part of the film) but consider its post-Civil War thread and that should sate those who don't want a spoiler thrown in for good measure.Both actors give finely tuned turns here with Brosnan in one of his most physically demanding performances with a certain dirt-under-the-fingernails grittiness, sporting a Don Quixote VanDyke and thatch of graying hair, a grizzled wrinkling pre-aged look that suggests his suffering character is damned in the long run. Proving it takes two-to-tango, Neeson is at his most subtle yet still a looming presence with his brawn and stalwartness bellies his real intent: revenge at any price.There are a few tweaks to the genre's stock characters: young gun bank robbers; a railroad crew of hostile Irishmen and victimized Chinese slave labor; wise Indian proclaiming nuggets of choice phrasings; a snake-oil sales(wo)man (Huston at her slyest) who may-or- may-not-be-a-desert-mirage; and the off-beat missionaries on pilgrimage. But director David Von Ancken making his big-screen debut (a TV vet of such shows as "Numb3rs" & "CSI: NY")  who collaborated on the script with novice Abby Everett Jaques  manages to incorporate some shrewd machinations (a dead horse sequence that actually had me jump out of my seat; kudos to editor Conrad Buff IV) and allow his leads enough space to make the most of their environs (the scenery is a character itself going from the wintry mountains to the arid, no-man's land salt flats) to their advantage.Although when the two characters finally come together after many bloody, graphic sequences, it is somewhat anti-climatic but the theme of doing the right thing at the right time nearly defeats what has transpired in the first half of this revisionist Western, the best since "Unforgiven" and last year's "The Proposition".
REVOLUTIONARY ROAD (2008) **1/2 Leonardo Di Caprio, Kate Winslet, Michael Shannon, Kathy Bates, Kathryn Hahn, David Harbour, Dylan Baker, Max Casella, Max Baker, Jay O. Sanders. Filmmaker Sam Mendes traipses once again onto the finely manicured lawns of American suburbia in this noble rot adaptation of the novel by Richard Yates  the stilted screenplay by Justin Haythe is largely to blame for the logy pacing  about a young married couple (Di Caprio & Winslet re-teaming 10 yrs. after TITANIC act as if it were only yesterday they were together they are so indelible an on screen coupling) circa 1950s who are both listless from complacency searching for something significant in their seemingly lackluster, meaningless existences. The biggest disappointment is the rather pedestrian direction by Mendes and the underlining of Everything. Has. Some. Significance. in its delivery. Ably acted, particularly Shannon in the film's true stand-out performance as a mentally unbalanced neighbor who speaks his mind damn the consequences. Too bad no one else felt that way in this production.
ROBIN HOOD (2010)*** Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett, Max von Sydow, William Hurt, Mark Strong, Oscar Isaac, Danny Huston, Eileen Atkins, Mark Addy, Matthew Macfadyen, Kevin Durand, Scott Grimes, Alan Doyle, Douglas Hodge. Ridley Scott's epic origin story of the legendary folk hero gets a big boost/re-boot for the 21st Century with Crowe as the archer/soldier who decides to fight the establishment (read : King John) and right the wrongs in the process. While the action sequences suggest "Saving Private Ryan" meets "Braveheart" and the echoes of Scott/Crowe's "Gladiator" it still stands on it s own merits largely thanks to a streamlined script by Brian Helgeland and some impressive set pieces (and a fine ensemble particularly a fierce Blanchett as Maid Marian) leading to a new franchise to explore the robber-of-the-rich-and-giver-to-the-poor.
PINEAPPLE EXPRESS (2008) ***1/2 Seth Rogen, James Franco, Gary Cole, Rosie Perez, Danny McBride, Amber Heard, Kevin Corrigan, Craig Robinson, Ed Begley, Jr., Nora Dunn,Bobby Lee, Dana Lee, Ken Jeong, Bill Hader, James Remar. Frequently hilarious action-comedy from Judd Apatow's never-ending quest to conquer the cinematic comedy world producing another fine example of low-brow, filthy tongued and smart dialogue driven 'bro-mance' this time with Rogen (who co-scripted with partner Evan Goldberg and Apatow) as a process server in LA whose only ambition is to get stoned via his slacker dealer (Franco surprisingly hysterical and joining the elite pantheon of truly excellent stoners the likes including Spicoli, The Dude and Floyd, the later character of TRUE ROMANCE is practically a kissing cousin and trajectory for the film's plot) who find themselves embroiled in a drug war when Rogen witnesses a brutal killing by a corrupt cop (Perez) and Franco's distributor (Cole) and end up on the run with Franco to save their hides. Frenetic, fast and funny with some unexpected violence permeating particularly in the final act but even more unexpected is indie wunderkind David Gordon Green at the helm in this '80s buddy film meets '70s AIP exploitation flick. Fun closing tune by Huey Lewis & the News. Totally baked, man, totally!
JEFF, WHO LIVES AT HOME (2012) ***1/2 Jason Segel, Ed Helms, Judy Greer, Susan Sarandon, Rae Dawn Chong. Winning dramedy from The Brothers Duplass  Mark & Jay  who wrote & directed  about sibling rivalry, family dramas, the search for true purpose, and simply relating to one and each other, with surprising moments of clarity and laugh-out-loud self-actualizations refined thanks to the winning cast of Segel as a 30 year old slacker who believes there are signs and everything is connected and Helms as his jerk-off brother who can't see the forest for the trees in his middle-age crisis while their mother Sarandon (in one of her best performances in some time) is also facing her own mortality in the form of a secret admirer with-in her dead-end workplace. Both dovetail into a wonderful blend of acceptance and brilliance that will touch you in places you never dreamed would. A winner.
BULLY (2012) **** A must-see documentary by Lee Hirsch and Cynthia Lowen focusing on the epidemic of bullying in the schools of America which in and of itself can be presumed a pandemic as well in the sense of where anger, hatred and simple narrow-mindedness can manifest from and eventually spread. Five separate mid-Western families are depicted  two attempting to salvage their remaining family in the aftermath of their beloved's suicides confirmed from the relentless attacks they endured to the point of no return  showcase how a blind eye to incredibly frustrating situations (i.e. the closed environs of the school bus as a haven of beatings and humiliations thrust on their prey) are attempted to be dealt with or in the majority simply overlooked and ignored altogether. The one subject, Alex, a shy, sweet and smart adolescent is shown on the first day of school literally trembling (and brilliantly conveyed on the soundtrack of his hindered breathing in knowing what hell will ultimately be unleashed upon him), will have you rooting for him to get through the year and angrily screaming at the screen at the imbecilic school head and her myopic viewpoints that you want to step into the screen and throttle her! At times incredibly sad and tragic, the film is in essence a triumph in how the families stay together to battle this onset of violence and refusing to back down for the sake of their children  and more importantly  other children who have no voice of their own! Thankfully the MPAA JUST re-rated the film as PG-13 (for a few 'F' bombs!) and is a necessity for all parents AND children to see together and begin a dialogue for something that can be avoided/stopped. I urge you all to see this.
STOKER (2013) ***1/2 Mia Wasikowska, Nicole Kidman, Matthew Goode, Jacki Weaver, Phyllis Somerville, Dermot Mulroney. Echoes of Hitchcock's "Shadow of A Doubt" ripple thru this ripping good psychological thriller with a Gothic pulse: the Stoker family has suffered a great loss when the patriarch (Mulroney in flashbacks) dies leading to the unexpected arrival of the clan's black sheep (or a wolf in sheep's clothing, Goode who is very good here) with apparent designs on the grieving sister-in-law (Kidman) and overprotective desires for his niece (scary good Wasikowska) who may have an ace up her sleeve (or two). A surprisingly etched screenplay by actor Wentwork Miller gets able assist in the lucid dream/fever dream stylings of director Chan-wook Park channeling David Lynch and Hitch with a side of curdled Charles Addams murkiness), a killer sound design by Chuck Michael, paper-cut sharp editing by Nicolas De Toth, and darkly handsome cinematography by Chugn-hoon Chung rise the potboiler underpinnings to top-drawer sociopathic melodrama excellence.
THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (2012) ***1/2 Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Irrfan Khan, Campbell Scott, Embeth Davidtz, C. Thomas Howell. Unnecessary but entertaining none-the-less blockbuster reboot to the epic Marvel franchise in its re-imagining of the Peter Parker mythos of his web-slinging alter ego super hero whose origin story should now be known to every man, woman and child. Garfield - exuding James Dean cool/geekiness as the awkward teen - is indelible as he tries to find out who he is, why he is and how to use his powers for greater things (that's right crime fighting). Ifans is reptilian to the hilt as anger management in denial Dr. Curt Connors, a one-armed colleague of Parker's late scientist genius dad attempting to use hybrid species DNA for re- growth of lost appendages and instead becomes the menacing Lizard. Added to the mix is Stone as Pete's gal pal Gwen Stacy and a nice laconic by-the-book Leary police chief dad out to stop the masked vigilante in the jungles of Manhattan. Director Marc Webb (no puns please) does a remarkable, skillful and unlikely heir-apparent helmsman job with the Herculean task of making something old fresh and he's ably capable with a decent script by James Vanderbilt, Steve Kloves an Alvin Sargent (who scripted the last two SPIDER-MAN flicks under Sam Raimi's realm) and some truly vivid 3-D imagery CGI and fantastic lens work by John Schwartzman. Bonus: Stan 'The Man' Lee's fun cameo as a high school music librarian missing out on the action behind him! Get your web on!
LONE SURVIVOR (2013) **1/2 Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, Eric Bana. Filmmaker Peter Berg's top-heavy adaptation of Marcus Luttrell's book about his involvement with a doomed mission as a SEAL Team 10 op in Afghanistan to locate a Taliban leader focuses on the quartet of soldiers (all players equally determined and stoic) sent on the patrol that goes disastrously wrong incredibly fast. More "Black Hawk Down" than "Saving Private Ryan" the film's merits are in the impossible odds while the band of brothers attempt to save one another with limited resources. The visceral violence is further impacted upon by ace make-up work from veterans Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger.
FLUSHED AWAY (2006) *** (VOICES OF: Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, Bill Nighy, Andy Serkis, Shane Richie, Kathy Burke, David Suchet, Miriam Margolyes) Fun and funny animated comedy about a pampered pet rat named Roddy (Jackman having a ball) who is literally flushed down the family toilet and discovers a subterranean world populated by all forms of vermin including the tomboy-ish Rita (Winslet also excelling at pleasing herself), a scavenger who is attempting to help her extended nuclear family's debt to the villainous underworld kingpin , The Toad (McKellen, relishingly good) and his henchmen Whitey and Spike (Nighy and Serkis, respectively). From the geniuses at Aardman Animation and DreamWorks, the lively and warm-hearted family fare will appeal to all ages but occasionally drags to become an instant classic. However the shrieking Greek chorus of slimy slugs are a riot. (Dirs: David Bowers and Sam Fell)
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011) ** Michelle Williams, Eddie Redmayne, Kenneth Branagh, Julia Ormond, Emma Watson, Judi Dench, Toby Jones, Dougray Scott, Zoe Wanamaker, Dominic Cooper. Wed-behind-the-ears filmmaker wannabe Brit Colin Clark finds himself learning some late-in-life lessons while working on THE PRINCE & THE SHOWGIRL and befriending Marilyn Monroe in the process. Williams gives an uncanny impersonation of the late cinematic sex icon with some lovely nuances and skin-deep neuroses cum demons and is the best aspect of this otherwise dull exercise in biopics thru an observer (to with Clark's memoir adapted by Adrian Hodges and directed limply by Simon Curtis proves what a bore the story is otherwise). Branagh hams it up as the late Sir Laurence Olivier attempting in an exercise of vanity and boorishness to re-ignite his stalled acting career , in this otherwise unremarkable film.
GRAN TORINO (2008) ***1/2 Clint Eastwood, Bee Vang, Ahney Her, Christopher Carley, Brian Haley, Geraldine Hughes, Dreama Walker, Brian Howe, John Carroll Lynch, William Hill, Brooke Chia Thao, Chee Thao, Choua Kue, Scott Eastwood, Xia Soua Chang, Sony Vue, Doua Moua, Austin Douglas Smith. Eastwood gives a memorably strong performance in reportedly one of his possible final on screen roles and it's a humdinger, as recently widower Walt Kowalski, a crusty, angry Korean War Vet and bigoted retiree whose twilight years are in for a surprise when he finds himself befriending his Hmong neighbors after one attempts to steal his titular vehicle for a gang initiation gone awry. The unlikely kinship between the flinty senior citizen and a family by proxy is only strained when the gang will not let up on his new friends and then things getwell, down right "dirty". Sure there are echoes of Eastwood's Harry Callahan as imagined if he lived to receive a pension but there is more to meet the eye in the simple yet sharply skewed screenplay by Nick Schenk and Dave Johannson, that Eastwood (who directs as well) turns in one of his more shrewdly layered turns in quite sometime: a fitting hallmark if in fact my boy decides to retire; don't count on it!
THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP (2006) *** Gael Garcia Bernal, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Alain Chabat, Miou-Miou, Pierre Vaneck, Emma de Caunes, Aurelia Petit, Sacha Bourdo, Stephane Metzger. (Dir; Michel Gondry)To Sleep Per Chance to Dream, To Dream Per Chance to Love: Surreal valentine  Dali meets Charlie Kaufman by way of Pee-Wee Herman; Bernal is sexily goofy & Gondry continues his streak of romantic nuttiness.French filmmaker Michel Gondry's fertile imagination and work in the music video field prior to his big-screen endeavors has risen him to the ranks of talented, creative geniuses such as Tim Burton, David Cronenberg, David Lynch and Spike Jones, yet sustains his unique giddy fever-dreams of the human heart. In his latest, a cross between a love child concocted by Salvador Dali and Charlie Kaufman by way of Pee-Wee Herman, he doles out his inventive and at times poignant best.Stephane Miroux (Bernal, in one of his best performances) is a Mexican-French artiste wannabe who returns to Paris after the death of his beloved father from cancer where he has been lined up with a promising job thanks to his mother Christine (French legend, Miou- Miou) at a publishing house. Upon arrival he meets his eccentric co-workers, perpetually horny, middle-aged vulgarian Guy (Chabat in a highly comical turn); the Mutt-and-Jeff team of Martine (Petit) and Serge (Boudo); and his blunt boss Monsieur Pouchet (Vaneck) who all value a forth-coming ski trip to relay moral more so than the tedious job of cut-and-pasting graphics to their glossy calendars, which Stephane is not happy about doing, under the impression he'd be doing a more creative gig (his work consists of child-like colorful displays of cataclysmic disasters that is a running gag to full perverse hilarity). Staying in his mother's apartment he encounters his new neighbor Stephanie (Gainsbourg), a pretty and also self-proclaimed artiste too boot (coincidentally sharing their familiar names adds up to two successful points of a future together), meeting cute as she his having a piano moved into her flat with her girlfriend Zoe (de Caunes). Stephan is intrigued with the lovely neighbor and finds himself obsessing that she may be the one despite his forecast of 'never getting the one he wants'. To further complicate matters  and his life in general  is Stephane's active imagination particularly in sleep mode as his dreams threaten to spill over into reality or at least a romanticized viewings of what he wishes his reality was really like. Not unlike Walter Mitty, Stephane is a hopeless romantic man-child who desperately wants to connect with someone but have fun in the process. His inner mind workings suggest a rec room converted by corrugated paper and two window shades for his eyes as the talk-show of his thought process via a de-facto public access explains how all the ingredients of a recipe for dreams is concocted out of primal emotions, synchronicity and parallel happy accidents. This pretty much sums up the relatively harmless Stephane who realizes that Stephanie truly is his destiny.Gondry, who collaborated with the aforementioned Kaufman on "Human Nature" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", definitely has a knack for the surreal pleasures of the most sensual and sexual organ  the brain  and his absurdist eye is uncanny with some weird animation combining moments of the aforementioned Cronenberg particularly late from "Naked Lunch" with typewriters operated by arachnid limbs. Also on hand  literally  are Stephane's hands becoming unwieldy gigantic; a prancing puppet-like horse; and cellophane water cascading. All in all some genuinely original thoughts expressed with giddy glee.Bernal, one of the most talented actors of his generation, surprises for his dry, sometimes snarky dead-pan humor, hits most of the notes correctly for the comic sequences with his co-workers and the pursuit of Gainsbourg, who for me is the weakest link in the film with barely any real chemistry and her 'beauty' is unconventional yet it seems to work for the most part in making Stephane's quest ungainly. What more though can one ask when Gondry's romantic heart outweighs his creative mind and to sleep per chance to dream of love is a valentine to the human spirit.
JOHN WICK (2014) *** Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Willem Dafoe, Dean Winters, Adrianne Palicki, Bridget Moynahan, John Leguizamo, Ian McShane, Bridget Regan, Lance Reddick, David Patrick Kelly, Clarke Peters. Over-the-top yet a guilty pleasure revenge action flick with Reeves (in arguably his finest role since THE MATRIX) as the titular lethal assassin in retirement who finds himself shoved back into his old ways when the punk son of a former associate Russian mobster (Nyqvist in oily mode) who steals his prized '69 Mustang and kills his puppy - a gift from his recently deceased, beloved wife (Moynahan). Hell bent on getting revenge Wick is laser focused on his prime initiative with a wake of destruction and a huge body count while being contracted for his own hit in the process. Newbie director Chad Stahelski (a veteran stuntman who collaborated with Reeves on THE MATRIX films among others) shows his chops in the carefully executed non-stop fight/shoot sequences with aplomb and enabled with a rogues gallery of veteran character actors peppered out makes up for the somewhat graphic novel trappings of the film border lining pulp cartoon ridiculousness from the anything goes script by novice Derek Kolstad but keeps things brutally lively.
INHERENT VICE (2014) ** Joaquin Phoenix, Josh Brolin, Katherine Waterston, Joanna Newsom, Benicio Del Toro, Owen Wilson, Jena Malone, Hong Chau, Michael Kenneth Williams, Eric Roberts, Serena Scott Thomas, Reese Witherspoon, Martin Short, Sasha Pieterse, Martin Donovan. Paul Thomas Anderson's crazy quilt adaptation of Thomas Pynchon is a mixed cocktail of THE BIG SLEEP meets THE BIG LEBOWSKI with a game Phoenix as a hippie dippy pot smoking PI Larry "Doc" Sportello in SoCal circa 1970 investigating a shaggy dog story involving his old lady (Newsom) whose fling with a real estate tycoon (Roberts) has more threads than one can shake a stick at. Keeping up with the Who's Who star-studded film is a chore in itself with more registering little more than a glorified cameo or outstaying their welcome (to wit: Newsom's glazed over cunty narration gets under the skin like a chigger). Brolin has a field day as what Joseph Wambaugh would term a 'street monster' of an LA flatfoot replete with flattop and constant state of disgruntlement at the counterculture embodied by frienemy Phoenix. The film's pacing is off and the final act takes.for.ever. A misfire sadly so in at least becoming a cult classic.
PREDATORS (2010) ***Adrien Brody, Alice Braga, Topher Grace, Walton Goggins, Oleg Taktarov, Laurence Fishburne, Danny Trejo, Louis Ozawa Changchien, Mahershalalhashbaz Ali, Carey Jones, Brian Steele, Derek Mears. Better than-anticipated chapter to the sci-fi franchise with peddle-to-the-metal action and suspense with a much needed adrenaline boost this time with a throng of mercenaries deposited upon a jungle environ planet and find themselves prey to the titular alien stalkers; sort of a blend of "Alien"/"Rambo"/"The Most Dangerous Game" and "Ten Little Indians". Producer/filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, director Nimrod Antal and scribes Alex Litvak & Michael Finch show obvious love for the monster mash that ensues by paying proper respect to the horror and echoes of the original film making this a crowd-pleasing, popcorn treat.
PROJECT X (2012) *** Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper, Jonathan Daniel Brown, Daz Flame, Kirby Bliss Blanton, Alexis Knapp, Peter Mackenzie, Caitlin Dulany. "The Hangover" for Generation Z: underclassmen trio of buds Mann, Cooper and Brown (Edward Norton/Matthew Modine; Jon Stewart/Chico Marx; John Candy/Jonah Hill manques) plan an epic birthday party for Mann in a 'game changer' to make a mark on their social inadequacies with their high school peers which results in a Bacchanalia of debauchery and kids-gone-wild imbibing and chicanery at full tilt. A bougeliasbaise of John Hughes meets "Animal House"/"Bachelor Party" and "American Pie" that while it borderlines cartoonery the mix of ridiculous comedic moments and an undercurrent of trying to belong are heartfelt but few in between overall. Hilarious more than it has any right to be in its high concept premise alone no thanks to its all-out screenplay by Matt Drake and Michael Bacall and the you-are-there video work by novice director Nima Nourizadeh
THE ROVER (2014) ** Guy Pearce, Robert Pattinson, Scoot McNairy, Tawanda Manyimo, David Field, Gillian Jones, Susan Prior. Meandering post-apocalyptic drama set in the outback wastelands of Australia with a grizzled Pearce looking for payback when his sole possession - his car - is stolen by a pack of scavenging thugs and the only way of getting it back is taking one of the criminals' slow-witted brother (sorely miscast Pattinson; the film's weakest link) by force to lead him to their lair. Bleak, grim and slow-paced potboiler from filmmaker David Michod who co-scripted with Joel Edgerton the storyline takes its sweet time in getting around to the point (and even when it reaches it it's a hug WTF?!) While it aims to be an echo of MAD MAX at the very best it only succeeds in its slow-burning hair-trigger anger prone protagonist that Pearce makes the most of his limited role.
CACHE (HIDDEN) (2005) * (FRENCH/SUBTITLED) Overcooked soufflé of deceit; another reason to hate the French.I must admit that I am a foreign film snob. It's my Achilles heel (and no it has nothing to do with reading subtitles!) but I know that 90% of all the foreign films I cave into going to see leave me cold and quite Xenophobic in the process. Something is lost in the translation and the worst is when I listen to other critics especially if there is a large majority cajoling unsuspecting viewers to see something universally praised as being one of the year's best. I'll save you all the pain : it is one of the year's worst! There I've said it. Oh and for those who have problems with the French; another reason to despise them!The storyline focuses on a well-to-do French couple of the bourgeois set Georges Laurent (Daniel Auteuil), a literary TV host a la Charlie Rose and his pretty wife Anne Laurent (Juliette Binoche), a publishing type, whose quiet, seemingly perfect life find themselves upended when they receive a mysterious videotape that seems to be a surveillance of their upscale home. At first Georges thinks this nothing to be concerned about - some harmless prank perhaps perpetrated by their teenage son Pierrot (Lester Makedonsky) - but as the tapes keep coming they get more disturbing (a crudely childish drawing depicting a child vomiting blood, among other artistic inclusions add fuel to the fire). Anne insists they go to the police but they in turn inform the couple that nothing can be done unless something actually goes into action (i.e. a violent act upon their persons). So what do they do? Argue! Deceive one another, keep secretive (Georges has a skeleton in the closet concerning his family and a foreign family that were his servants which tie into French history's dark little secret too) and in general get progressively stupider as the potboiler continues to percolate. Well not exactly. I honestly couldn't care less what was transpiring. The tapes were boring and stupid as were the main characters who grew in annoyance and carpingly petty until the film's one truly jarring moment of violence (I literally thought seconds before the sequence, "Jesus when the hell is there going to be some action in this f*&$er!??!") that will knock one for a loop but even that aftermath things escalate into idiocy. And the 'don't blink' ending frankly is borderline inane. I just simply hated this film and only give it its rating due to the swift violent moment that frankly felt part of another (better) film in the long run.I do not know anything about the film's director Michael Haneke except that I can only surmise he will cash in on this when there is the inevitable Hollywood remake. Until then don't bother.
LIMITLESS (2011) ***1/2 Bradley Cooper, Abbie Cornish, Robert De Niro, Anna Friel, Johnny Whitworth, Andrew Howard, Robert James Burke, Ned Eisenberg, Richard Bekins, Patricia Kalember. Cautionary tale of Be-Careful-What-You-Wish-For /What IFsci-fi fable about an on-the-outs author Eddie Morra (Cooper in a superb showcase of his acting chops) whose chronic writer's block is given the chance to break his funk when a chance encounter with his ex-brother-in-law gives him a miracle pill, allowing access to '100%' of his brain capacity  and then the fun begins. Trippy Philip K. Dickian logic and an altogether visually impressive genre flick with great camera work by Jo Willems (the first eye-opening oversaturated encounter once the pill 'kicks in' is truly sparkling) and Neil Burger's assured direction allows moments of real emotion (and much needed humor) within the dark undercurrent of Alan Glynn's novel "The Dark Fields" to emerge thanks to a crafty screenplay by vet Leslie Dixon. Also noteworthy is De Niro as a financial powerhouse whose interests in Cooper's freak-show wizardry with numbers proves he can still amaze with his acting (the beatdown speech he gives to his young 'pretender-to-the-throne' is a giddy delight). Take the trip down the rabbit hole  if you dare!
FASTER (2010) **1/2 Dwayne Johnson, Billy Bob Thornton, Carla Gugino, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Maggie Grace, Moon Bloodgood, Mike Epps, Tom Berenger, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Jennifer Carpenter. Fairly routine vengeance B-movie with muscle-bound Johnson as an ex-con out for blood upon his prison release to get revenge for the murder of his brother after a heist goes wrong. Predictable and ridiculous to a fault (i.e. many of the characters' names are really just descriptions  to wit Johnson is only known as "Driver" & Thornton "Cop" !) no thanks to the pedestrian script by siblings Tony & Joe Gayton and over-the-top direction by George Tillman Jr. the film runs on fumes by its climax.
BLUE RUIN (2014) *** Macon Blair, Devin Ratray, Amy Hargreaves, Kevin Kolack, Eve Plumb, David W. Thompson, Brent Werzner, Stacy Rock. Absorbing slice of pulp fiction with a deadly unease of What's Next. To wit: homeless vagrant Dwight Evans (Blair in a low-key yet intriguing performance) learns the murderer of his parents has been paroled leads him down a thorny path of vengeance and perhaps a redemption too boot. Filmmaker Jeremy Saulnier's even-handed direction (and a taut screenplay) keeps one on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next in this twisty-turny darkly comic unspooling of a not-well-thought-of plan. Peppered with shocking violence and poignant underdog empathy for Blair's anti-hero. And yes that is Buzz from HOME ALONE as his long-lost high school bud and Jan Brady as a redneck villain (!)
THE PURGE (2013) **1/2 Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane, Edwin Hodge, Rhys Wakefield, Arija Bareikis, Tom Yi, Chris Mulkey, Tisha French. What Ifsci-fi thriller set in the not-too-distant future where America is at an all time low on crime with one 12 hour day allotted for all to 'purge' their violent tendencies without repercussions leads to a test of conscience and free will for a successful security system salesman (Hawke) and his family when they unwittingly come to the aid of a man under attack allowing him refuge with dire consequences. Echoes of "The Twilight Zone"'s "The Shelter" and "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" with more visceral thrills and less thought provocation. What that classic TV series managed to convey in under thirty minutes this film trips up in under ninety. Nice try. Written and directed with verve and here by newbie filmmaker James DeMonaco.
THE HANGOVER (2009) **** Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifanakis, Justin Bartha, Heather Graham, Sasha Barrese, Jeffrey Tambor, Ken Jeong, Rachael Harris, Mike Epps, Rob Riggle, Cleo King, Bryan Callen, Matt Walsh (Cameo as himself: Mike Tyson) Uproariously raunchy buddy/road-trip comedy with four pals en route to Las Vegas for a bachelor party for groom-to-be Bartha, but results in an aftermath of epic proportions of not recollecting any events of the debauchery that has led them to the titular condition of mistaken identity, a criminal element, a baby, and the missing groom! The inspired lunacy of comic trio Cooper (the brash Vince Vaughn part), Helms (the geeky Ben Stiller bit) and especially the hilarious Galifinakis (in a one for the film vault turn that rivals John Belushi busting onto the screen in ANIMAL HOUSE; it is that memorable!) is worth the price (less) admission for a howlingly funny comedy instant classic with a truly uproarious screenplay by Jon Lucas & Scott More and Todd Phillips (who continues his traditional skeevy cameo) is heir apparent to Ivan Reitman. One of the year's funniest comedies and one of the funniest comedies ever!
MUSIC AND LYRICS (2007) **1/2 Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, Brad Garrett, Kristen Johnston, Haley Bennett. Frequently amusing rom-com with Grant as a has-been '80s pop music star attempting a comeback by penning a hit song for a current sensation (Bennett) who enlists the unlikely help of his plant caretaker (!) Barrymore, whose way with words prove to be magical. Fine chemistry between the comedic leads with fine throw-away lines delivered by Grant and Barrymore's adeptness at physical comedy make a good combo but ultimately the third act of writer-director Marc Lawrence falters into predictability. Fun for a while at any rate.
THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 (2009) *** Denzel Washington, John Travolta, Luis Guzman, John Turturro, James Gandolfini, Michael Rispoli. Pretty decent remake of the '70s classic about a NYC subway hijacked by a madman (Travolta chewing up the scenery, sporting a '70s porn 'stache, neck tatts and major attitude) whose only connection to his demands of $10M ransom is a recently disgraced transit dispatcher (Washington giving fine thrust and parry with his antagonist), who must meet a one-hour deadline as the clock ticks to city-wide tension. While filmmaker Tony Scott surprisingly low-keys his usual hyperkinetic camera-work/editing of epileptic seizure heights, the screenplay- based again on John Godey's best-seller - by usually reliable Brian Helgeland has a lot of holes you could run the captured train thru (i.e. would it have killed him to give some personality to either the criminal gang and/or the hostages?!?) Despite its pitfalls including a ludicrous final act, the film runs on full-steam action.
SCREAM 4 (2011) **1/2 Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Emma Roberts, Rory Culkin, Hayden Panettiere, Marielle Jaffe, Marley Shelton, Alison Brie, Erik Knudsen, Nico Tortorella, Anthony Anderson, Adam Broday, Mary McDonnell, Heather Graham, Nancy O'Dell, Lucy Hale, Shenae Grimes, Anna Paquin, Kristen Bell, Aimee Teegarden, Dane Farwell, (voice of : Roger Jackson) Reboot of the scary movie franchise with the latest wink-wink-nudge-nudge chapter focusing on Sidney Prescott (still fresh faced and plucky Campbell) returning to her hometown as a celebrated self-help author whose homecoming only underscores the upcoming anniversary of the original murders and a game Ghostface ready to deliver a high body count with a new generation of (obnoxious) victims. Relatively bloody good with original scribe Kevin Williamson (and an uncredited Ehren Kruger) back to keep things at a lively clip and horror meister Wes Craven still throwing out the usual scares (pounce music, hand on shoulder close ups etc.) but the young cast is outweighed by its old school original trio in the acting department (i.e. you could care less who gets offed except these three!) and the twists and turns echo the original. A tad too meta and self-referential even for a film that started the whole horror irony genre.
DISCONNECT (2013) *** Jason Bateman, Hope Davis, Frank Grillo, Paula Patton, Alexander Skarsgard, Andrea Riseborough, Colin Ford, Max Thierlot, Jonah Bobo, Haley Ramm, Norbert Leo Butz, Kasi Lemmons. "CRASH" like drama intersecting three connective threads of plotting involving the ways the technology and internet can lead to destructive paths incorporating theft, identity, bullying and good old fashioned bonding. Two young friends, as a goof, decide to torture another schoolmate to devastating results; a young married couple facing the anniversary of the death of their child find themselves victims of identity theft adding more rift to their crumbling relationship; and an ambitious television reporter attempts to book good for her career a promising investigative exclusive about exploitation with myriad conclusions. While director Henry Alex Rubin stirs the nerve-jangled plot from novice screenwriter Andrew Stern, the talented ensemble each have moments to shine and congregate with its strong, cautionary message of how easy it is to lose oneself to cyber-reality instead of reality itself.
KUNG FU PANDA 2 (2011) ***1/2 (VOICES OF: Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Gary Oldman,Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, Jackie Chan, James Hong, David Cross, Dennis Haysbert, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Michelle Yeoh, Victor Garber, Danny McBride, Dustin Hoffman) Excellent animated sequel with Po the Panda (Black having fun) discovers his true origins while facing the greatest challenge of his life in the form of fascist peacock Shen (sleekly sinister Oldman) out for revenge with The Force Five united to defend their village by any means necessary. Lively directed by Jennifer Yuh and a BAMBI-esque screenplay by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger are supported by fantastic animation (and the 3-D here is fantastic) that will have audiences of all ages begging for another chapter!
VACANCY (2007) ** Kate Beckinsale, Luke Wilson, Frank Whaley, Ethan Embry. So-so thriller about a young married couple who wind up off-the-beaten path on a road trip with car trouble who pull into a dilapidated motel where they discover they are the next victims-to-be in a snuff film. The tension is barely taut enough for its rather predictable yet somewhat entertaining downward spiral with decent acting, not bad direction by a guy named Nimrod (!) and kudos to the oogie, skeevy production design by Jon Gary Steele. Just not terrifying enough for yours truly but seriously the most disturbing motel since the Bates in PSYCHO none-the-less. (Dir: Nimrod Antal)
WAR, INC. (2008) **1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergej Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, (Voice of: Montel Williams)A hit-and-miss-21st Century "STRANGELOVE"John Cusack  who co-wrote the script with Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser  stars as a jaded hit-man named Brand Hauser who is burnt out but decides to follow thru on one final assignment by icing a Middle-Eastern oil minister named Omar Sharif (yes, not THAT Omar Sharif but you get the tone here from this misfire for a laugh) commandeered by the ex-Vice President of The USA (Aykroyd, Cusack's old "Grosse Pointe Blank" co-hort, doing a mean Dick Cheney manqué turn here), enlisting Brand to do the deed under the guise of a Trade Show Producer in mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq/Afghanistan) for the American private corporation Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). While being briefed Brand is faced with a moment of clarity when he comes across intrepid journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and eventually falls in love with her. Meanwhile Tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely union of Eastern European teen sensation Yonica Babyyeah (a surprisingly decent Duff aping her own celebrity with tongue- through-cheek) and the idiot son of the country's leader.What follows is a bold attempt for a 21st Century black comedy a la "DR. STRANGELOVE" but for all intense and purposes there are sadly more misses than hits in this broad try for laughs amidst political message (an unjust war being outsourced by American capitalism, check!) While Cusack riffs on his Martin Blank from the aforementioned "Pointe" he does add some nice touches of his man in black (he does shots of Tabasco sauce to take the edge off), the rest of the cast plays catch up (except sister Joan who is a riot as the high-strung aide- de-camp for Hauser and has one of the film's funniest laugh-out lines: "My mass communications skills are finally paying off") for the most part. Cusack visited the Iraq War earlier this year in the 180 degree different "Grace Is Gone" and here he allows his political views wear on his sleeve ; while admirable overall the film's pace and rhythms are off largely no-thanks to first time filmmaker Joshua Seftel making his directorial debut here (and it is noticeable) except for maybe the well-choreographed fight Hauser is involved with Babyyeah's idiotic fiancé's entourage.A nice attempt yet a misguided failure ; maybe next time Cusack won't try so hard and let the idiocy of war speak for itself instead of doing the heavy lifting by himself.
RED (2010) ***1/2 Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Mary Louise-Parker, Keith Urban, Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox, Rebecca Pidgeon, Ernest Borgnine. Highly entertaining actioner based on the graphic novel of Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner  a serviceable adaptation by scribes Jon & Erich Hoeber and quick and loose direction by Robert Schwentke  with Willis (dry-as-a-Saltine-cool-as-a-cucumber having a field day) as an RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) ex black ops agent facing down his former employers (i.e. the good ol' US gov't) out to retire him  permanently. "Getting the band back together" with colleagues in vengeance and cleaning up messes including wily Freeman, wetworks specialist Mirren (!) suggesting Martha Stewart gone wild  and best, for last, loony-toon conspiracy theorist/weapons expert Malkovich (also have a giddy time letting his ya-yas out). Parker is acridly funny as Willis' would-be new flame (a meet cute on the phone as his pension check rep) and Cox too as a Russkie compadre. Some great sequences and a lot of bang for the buck; a guilty pleasure for all to have.
REIGN OVER ME (2007) *** Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Rae Allen, Paula Newsome. At times affecting and at times middling dramedy about a thoroughly depressed man who lost his family on 9/11 (Sandler in his best role since "Punch-Drunk Love") who winds up re-united with his old college roommate and friend (Cheadle continuing to do impressive work with every role to date), a well-to-do dentist who seems to have it all  family, wealth, happiness  but really sees an ally in freedom with his troubled friend's own personal life offerings. Written and directed by Binder (who co-stars as Sandler's former-best friend and acting accountant) with equal parts humor and genuine heartache the film works best when the two stars share the screen until the last act falls into an almost movie-of-the-week treacle with to tidy a solution to the matters at hand.
BAD WORDS (2014) *** Jason Bateman, Kathryn Hahn, Rohan Chand, Philip Baker Hall, Allison Janney, Ben Falcone, Steve Witting, Beth Grant, Rachael Harris. Frequently hilarious high concept comedy starring Bateman (in his big screen directorial debut too boot) as a misanthropic jerk who finds a loophole to enter a regional children's spelling bee with an ax to grind and an unlikely ally in the form of journalist Hahn who abets his unorthodox methods of madness while trying to make the event even more newsworthy. While in the great tradition of BAD (as in SANTA, TEACHER) - foul-mouthed, belligerent anti-hero - Bateman manages to straddle the line of being a likable jerk (think vintage Bill Murray) while also letting loose with deadpan bravado in dropping devastating crudities we all wish could come up with (think curdled Vince Vaughn). Doing double duty also plays into his wheel house in letting his smartly picked cast of character actors to give equal push to his pull including the aforementioned Hahn, Janney as the contest's staid and starchy organizer and veteran character actor Baker Hall as the self-satisfied overseer of the event. Newcomer child actor Chand is a delightful scene-stealing moppet who manages to infiltrate the barbed wire surrounding Bateman's heart and novice scribe Andrew Dodge's vulgar and sweet screenplay hits all the right notes like fine Farrelly Brothers of yesterday. I only wish the filmmakers had gone one extra yard to make it a tad nastier and less syrupy. But to see Bateman having a field day as the one-upman is worth the price of admission alone.
SHINE A LIGHT (2008) ****It's Only Rock And Roll But I Like It!Rock and roll's greatest living band and film's greatest contemporary filmmaker: what a combination! That's the end result in this fantastic concert film capturing the venerable rock statesmen and legendary bad boys, The Rolling Stones, performing for a 2-nite benefit concert in 2006 for a charity event organized by President Bill Clinton (which happens to fall on his 60th birthday too boot!) at NYC's landmark venue, The Beacon Theatre. And on hand to document the intimate, rockin' event is none-other-than Manhattan's own movie magician, Martin Scorsese, with all his trademark flair and care into every thing he commits to celluloid (and it doesn't hurt that he's lensed at least one bonafide rockudrama, The Band's swan song "THE LAST WALTZ").What begins in a stark black and white opening with the band needling Marty about not letting him know the set list until the last second has the asthmatic auteur practically scrambling for his inhaler, yet with all the hoo-ha, Scorsese and his troop of 18 premier cinematographers manage to get every possibly conceived angle with razor-sharp snap and precision you'd never know he was on pins-and-needles at the 13th hour.The Stones may not be aging gracefully  witness their wizened, leathery visage  but do not be fooled, like a fine vintage, they have ripened from the sweetest fruits (of their labor) and prove to be a force to be reckoned with. Led by the indefatigable front man and icon, Mick Jagger, impossibly straw-thin and suggesting a hip Dorian Grey with his portrait somewhere in the attic laughing its head off  shimmies, shakes, and gets his snake-hipped insouciance with energy to spare, kicks the jams out with a non-stop Energizer Bunny kineticism that only sparks his onstage mates to full groove effect. Staid, yet strong to a fault, drummer Charlie Watts keeping the beat; good-time-Charlie Ronnie Wood on guitar having a laugh and a supporting line up of background singers, horns men and bass. But it is legendary axe-man Keith Richards, looking like The Crypt Keeper, with his madman's grimace and Pirates of the Caribbean élan, that makes the whole affair a hoot and he knows he's the king bee as he addresses his buzzing hive. The hits are all covered from "Jumpin' Jack Flash" to "Shattered" to "Sympathy for the Devil" to, natch, "Satisfaction", and three musical guest appearances by Jack White on "Loving Cup", Christina Aguilera bumping-and-grinding with Mick to "Live With Me", and living legend Buddy Guy on Muddy Waters' "Champagne and Reefer"- there's something for everyone, that is if you're a dire hard Stones fan (and who isn't?!)Scorsese may seem to be doing a yeoman's job but he knows what to give his (and their) fans and delivers the goods and the band smartly choosing one of the more intimate premiere NYC stages makes for a shrewd, tried and true night to remember. Filmed in IMAX I chose to see this @ NYC's fabled last movie palace  The Ziegfeld  and it justifiably shows these giants larger than life as the aforementioned format would as well. It may be only rock and roll; but I like it!!
THE WALKER (2007) ** Woody Harrelson, Kristin Scott Thomas, Lauren Bacall, Lily Tomlin, Ned Beatty, Moritz Bleibtreu, Mary Beth Hurt, Willem Dafoe, William Hope. Dull melodrama from filmmaker Paul Schrader who glosses over his film American GIGOLO substituting Harrelson as a gay escort in Washington, DC whose Beltway clients give him a nice lifestyle until he is implicated as a prime suspect for the murder of a fellow escort. Not enough tension or character development makes this a rather unmemorable effort by all involved. Unless you count the ridiculous wig Harrelson sports.
ARGO (2012) *** Ben Affleck, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Victor Garber, Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham, Kerry Bishe, Kyle Chandler, Chris Messina, Zeljko Ivanek, Titus Welliver, Keith Szarabajka, Bob Gunton, Richard Kind. Based on true life account of the 1979 Iran hostage crises focusing on six Americans hidden by the Canadian Ambassador while the CIA orders a covert op to rescue them from harm's way with Affleck as liaison Tony Mendez who cooks up a wild scheme involving Hollywood as a plot point (posing as a film crew scouting exotic locales for the fictional titular sci-fi flick). As the clock ticking potboiler attempts for ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN prestige it falls short namely for the six characters assumed to be worthy of saving when they are instead depicted as quite frankly obnoxious and irritating. Affleck continues his streak as a filmmaker with a tightly scripted docudrama feel from Chris Terrio's adaptation based on an article by Joshuah Bearman and a solid character actor cast buoys its pretensions with aplomb.
THE WAY (2011) **** Martin Sheen, Emilio Estevez, Deborah Kara Unger, James Nesbitt, Yorick van Wageningen, Tcheky Karyo, Matt Clark. A wonderfully poignant drama and personal project spear-headed by co-star, producer, writer and director Estevez about an estranged father son relationship that comes to a sudden head when the son (Estevez in flashbacks) is killed in an accident while beginning a trek on the St. Jean Pied de Port in France. The father (real-life dad Sheen in a finely low-key modulated turn) treks out to retrieve the body but instead embarks on his son's quest to walk the Camino de Santiago  The Way of St. James  and in his pilgrimage encounters three fellow travelers : gregarious-to-a-fault Dutchman van Wageningen; Irish writer Nesbitt & comely yet distressed Canadian Unger (in a stand-out performance). Estevez adapts Jack Hitt's book "Off the Road: A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim's Route" with sublime finesse and makes the personal vendetta of his father all the more poignant. A must see for all particularly sons and fathers and the inspirational, spiritual journey is worth the trip indeed; one of the best films of the year. Thank you, my friend, Brian!
VOLVER (2006) ** Penelope Cruz, Carmen Maura, Lola Duenas, Blanca Portillo, Yohana Cobo, Chus Lampreave, Antonio de al Torre, Carlos Blanco, Maria Isabel Diaz, Neus Sanz. Overrated Pedro Almodovar melodrama about a young woman named Raimunda (Cruz, however in arguably her best work to date, proving she is not a fluke despite her Hollywood- ization of lesser fare) who must come to terms with her past and present: namely the apparent return from the dead ghost of her beloved yet troubling mother and the unexpected killing of her less-than honorable husband. The usual colorful characters and production design attempt to make the film flavorful but ultimately it is a stale carbon copy of many of Almodovar's life lessons as soap opera that is getting a tad long in the tooth.
CLOVERFIELD (2008) *** Michael Stahl-David, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Lizzy Caplan, Odette Yustan, Mike Vogel. "Godzilla" meets "The Blair Witch Project" could've been the pitch by executive producer JJ Abrams in this high-concept upgrade for the giant monster running amok creature feature action/adventure/sci-fi chiller for the 21st century: a small group of twentysomethings are at a going away party in a downtown Manhattan loft when all hell breaks loose in the form of a gi-normous watch-a-ma-call-it wreaking havoc and taking a colossal bite out of The Big Apple, and being recorded by one of the attendees, the guest of honor's best bud, while racing for their lives to get out of Dodge. While the shaky-cam histrionics may cause seizures it's been around over a decade so take some Dramamine in this highly entertaining popcorn flick with some truly jaw-dropping visuals of 'how-the-hell- did-they-do-that?!' to the nth degree (granted the monster is a tad cheesy but what do you want from an homage to great "B" films like "King Kong" , "Independence Day" and "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"). Special shout out for a major film to finally have a character named Marlena (the spunky Caplan), who shares my sister's moniker! (DIR: Matt Reeves)
WATCHMEN (2009) ***1/2 Malin Akerman, Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode, Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Patrick Wilson, Carla Gugino, Matt Frewer, Stephen McHattie, Laura Mennell. Epic big-screen adaptation of Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons' cult-classic graphic novel involving a cadre of heroes in a parallel consideration of America in 1985 (Nixon is in his 5th term!) who are under attack when one of their allies is brutally murdered, sending the surviving avengers into dark and deeply thought whirlpools of existential dread (i.e.: Is it really worth saving the world if you can't save yourself?) Visually amazing and adept thanks to the 'visionary' filmmaker Zack Snyder the film is truly awe-inspiring in capturing the genre down-pact maybe just too much (if that's a caveat so be it) but not to take away from some truly draw-dropping set pieces (one word: Mars!) and stand-out turns by Crudup (as the tragically altered Jon Osterman aka "Dr. Manhattan") Morgan (as the amoral slain Comedian) and most definitely Haley (as the vigilante Rorschach), who blends classic Cagney and Ledger's "Joker" with a touch of Claude Raines' "Invisible Man" as a force to be reckoned with, making for a truly memorable anti-hero.
CLOUD ATLAS (2012) *** Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Whishaw, Keith David, James D'Arcy, Xun Zhou, David Gyasi, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant. One hot mess of an epic adaptation of David Mitchell's novel by the Wachowskis (Lana and Andy) with Tom Tykwer - who took turns directing - involving a meta-verse of six plots interweaved in flashback/forward of how one generation inspires another and vice versea with themes of revolution, self-discovery, racism, ageism, conspiracies, class struggles, science fiction hybrid with fantasy tone poem - phew- among others with its principals doing triple (and more) duties/roles with questionable results (largely the uneven make-up - one rotting nose prosthesis is plenty if you ask me for Hanks!) and a lot of precious, preachy sociopolitical ramifications throughout. While there is a lot of visual effects of jaw-dropping beauty and CGI spotty here and there the end result is a lot of endurance (easily could've dropped 20 minutes somewhere!) and tolerance but oddly enough picks up steam 3/4 thru involving the viewer for its trippy , time-skipping, globe trotting and interlinking crazy quilt of filmmaking the likes of which haven't been seen in quite some time.
FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS (2006) ***1/2 Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford, Adam Beach, John Benjamin Hickey, John Slattery, Barry Pepper, Jamie Bell, Paul Walker, Robert Patrick, Neal McDonough, Melanie Lynskey, Thomas McCarthy, Chris Bauer, Judith Ivey, Myra Turley, Joseph Cross, Benjamin Walker, George Grizzard, Harve Presnell, George Hearn, Len Cariou, Beth Grant, Connie Ray, Ann Dowd, David Patrick Kelly, Jon Polito, Ned Eisenberg, Gordon Clapp, Tom Verica, David Clennon, David Rasche, Tom Mason. Epic WWII drama about the heroes of Iwo Jima  specifically the men who raised American flag on the beach captured in full iconic form by Associated Press  which provided a major boost in the war effort back home, in spite of the facts being laid by the wayside, and the 'heroes' facing their own personal demons. Well acted particularly Bach as the tormented, alcoholic Ira Hayes, a Native American who never fully recovered to civilian life. Based on James Bradley & Ron Powers book the sprawling screenplay adaptation by William Broyles, Jr. and Paul Haggis occasionally lurches in its flashback sequences unevenly yet the narrative is held steadily by director Clint Eastwood in spite of the logily paced final act, the film definitively depicts the horrors of battle in signature sequences a la "Saving Private Ryan" with yeoman like exceptional work by editor Joel Cox  an Eastwood veteran  and skilled cinematography by Tom Stern. Executive produced by Steven Spielberg.
SMOKIN' ACES (2007) **1/2 Jeremy Piven, Ray Liotta, Ryan Reynolds, Andy Garcia, Alicia Keys, Taraji P. Henson, Ben Affleck, Peter Berg, Martin Henderson, Common, Jason Bateman, Joseph Ruskin, Alex Rocco, David Proval, Nestor Carbonell, Chris Pine, Kevin Durand, Maury Sterling, Mike Falkow, Tommy Flanagan, Curtis Armstrong, Vladimir Kulich, Matthew Fox, Christopher Michael Holley, Davenia McFadden, Zach Cumer, Scott Halberstadt, (cameo as himself: Wayne Newton). Remember the climax of "True Romance" involving a suitcase of stolen-from-the-Mob cocaine, a gunfight-at-the-OK-Corral involving Feds, fugitives and the aforementioned Mafia? Well blow that out-out-of-proportion about 100 times to bloat a nearly 2 hour film, mix with other Tarantino/Guy Ritchie/Tony Scott films of the past decade, mix liberally with hookers, songstress Keys as an unlikely professional assassin (!), a coked-out-of-his-mind mobbed up has-been Vegas magician (Piven), hit frappe and you get this over-the-top, high-octane giddily cranked up to 11 guilty pleasure of kinetic violence, pop-culture infused, adrenaline fueled, testosterone soaked mess of a pulp fiction hybrid from filmmaker Joe Carnahan you'll be laughing in disbelief at his kitchen-sink haphazard balls-to-the-wall panache in spite of yourself at the appalling hubris yet popcorn crowd frenzy on display.
TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT (2011) *** Topher Grace, Anna Faris, Dan Fogler, Teresa Palmer, Chris Pratt, Michael Biehn, Jeanie Hackett, Lucy Punch, Michelle Trachtenberg, Demetri Marin, Michael Ian Black, Bob Odenkirk, Angie Everhart. '80s retrospective with Grace (who co-executive produced and contributed as a writer on the screenplay) as a college grad facing his unlikely future by going to a crazy party to win over high school crush Palmer, with brainy twins sister Faris and slob best bud Fogler in tow. While the era's soundtrack and in-joke hommages to John Hughes (i.e. "Shermer High" as the characters' alma mater) are on point the film tries too hard to have that Hughesian vibe throughout its scattershot mix of mirth, raunch and heart. (Dir: Michael Dowse)
STILL ALICE (2014) ***1/2 Julianne Moore, Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth, Alec Baldwin, Hunter Parrish, Stephen Kunken. Moore gives an Oscar worthy performance as a gifted linguistics professor who suddenly begins showing signs of memory loss which inevitably is diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease which thrusts her into a journey of self-preservation and attempt to retain as much of herself, and memory, as possible. Based on the novel by Lisa Genova and skillfully adapted by filmmakers Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland the film's strengths rely upon a remarkable star performance by Moore whose intelligent, nuanced turn is a slowly progressive study in heartbreak and healing all at once; a miracle of itself. Low-key performances by Baldwin as her equally counterbalanced husband who has more difficult in the shattering news to the fold than his better half and especially Stewart as their youngest daughter, an actress in transition herself. Modulated with keen observation to the paralyzing fear, frustration and eventual devastation of a truly heinous disease that robs its victims of their identities and memory it is equally poignant in the reality that Glatzer suffers from ALS and cannot talk anymore speaks volumes to the delicate yet sharply keen observations on what the human spirit truly is all about.
FOXCATCHER (2014) *** Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, Sienna Miller, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Michael Hall. Absorbing fact-based drama about Olympic-driven wrestler Mark Schultz (Tatum) who finds himself invited to be sponsored for the 1988 Olympics by eccentric (to say the least) millionaire John E. du Pont (Carell, buried under puttified make-up and prosthetic nose and teeth, giving one creepazoid yet genuinely great performance) whose bizarre status building dreams overshadow the dark underpinnings of male bonding, self-privileged allusions and ultimately paranoia. While the pacing by director Bennett Miller is at times teeth-grindingly dull (with practically zero soundtrack and dead spots of unease silence to a fault) the well-structured script by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman is spot-on with how one's perceptions tend to overshadow one's reality (i.e. 'the American Dream'). Ruffalo gives a quietly dignified supporting turn as Mark's older brother David whose weariness in duPont's Macchiavelean ego foreshadows its tragic final act all too well.
OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN (2013) **1/2 Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Rick Yune, Dylon McDermott, Angela Bassett, Melissa Leo, Robert Forster, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Finley Jacobson, Ashley Judd. "Die Hard in The White House" best sums up this by-the-numbers yet entertaining to a fault popcorn actioner with Butler as a disgraced Secret Service agent attempting a shot at redemption when Washington DC is plagued with a horde of Korean terrorists hellbent on nuclear destruction and basically the usual ploy of making life on Earth hell. A high body count doesn't make up for a pedestrian script by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt but director Antoine Fuqua keeps the pace fast but not so furious.
TRICK 'R TREAT (2009) *** Dylan Baker, Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Leslie Bibb. Devilishly horrific anthology throwback to CREEPSHOW and "TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE" in this finely crafted string of interconnected vignettes set on All Hollow's Eve involving werewolves, serial killers, vengeance seeking ghosts and a malevolent spirit all making a heady, cinematic witches' brew perfectly fitful viewing for the holiday or a dark, dank spooky moonlit evening thanks to filmmaker Michael Dougherty's valentine to '80s era horror with enough tongue-thru-cheek humor and genuine dread combining to keep one on the edge of their seats.
SALT (2010) *** ½ Angelina Jolie, Liev Schrieber, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Daniel Olbrychski. "NO WAY OUT" meets "THE BOURNE IDENTITY" with a sex change could've been the pitch for this fast-paced, adrenalized high octane action thriller with Jolie (in a role originally slated for Tom Cruise!) as CIA agent Evelyn Salt who finds herself accused as being a Russian mole and on the run to clear her name (or is she?) with the clock ticking in an assassination plot for both the US President & USSR Vice President (!!) Double jeopardy has never been this fun or excitingly sexy largely due to Jolie's star presence in swift, ass-kicking form too boot! Directed with finesse by veteran Phillip Noyce and a diamond-cut, pretzel twisty doozy screenplay by Kurt Wimmer.
GREENBERG (2010) **** Ben Stiller, Greta Gerwig, Rhys Ifans, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Chris Messina, Susan Traylor, Merritt Wever, Brie Larson, Juno Temple. Stiller is wonderful as a miscreant, miserable slacker recently recovering from a nervous breakdown who visits his well-to-do brother in LA for house-sitting duties and meets a true challenge: true love in the unlikely form of his bro's personal assistant (Gerwig in a truly Oscar-worthy turn), who is also having difficulties of her own (namely avoiding being a human door mat), which culminates in a bittersweet involvement that will have you cringing and cheering at the same time. Filmmaker Noah Baumbach  who collaborated on the bitingly clever screenplay with real-life wife Leigh (who co-stars as Stiller's former flame)  captures the pitch-perfect mid-life crisis for the mid-40's set and elicits a truly raw/tender turn by Stiller (never better) with his misanthropic tendencies. Ultimately the film scores in its characterizations of arrested developments and yearning for self-personal achievement (i.e. getting through life!) One of the year's best films.
JACK THE GIANT SLAYER (2013) *** Nicholas Hoult, Eleanor Tomlinson, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Eddie Marsan, Ewen Bremner, Ian McShane, Christopher Fairbank, Warwick Davis (Voices of : Bill Nighy, John Kassir) Entertaining and diverting re-imagining of the classic fairy tale about a young farm boy (Hoult uncannily resembling a young Tom Cruise) finding himself befriended by the princess of his kingdom (Tomlinson fair and feisty) only to lose her to the proverbial beanstalk leading them to the cloudy environs of the land of fearsome giants itching to return to the Earth for retribution. Imaginative screenplay by Daren Lemke, Christopher McQuarrie, Dan Studney & David Dobkin keeps things clever and swift with a keen observation of mixing the mystical with the malevolent (kiddies beware these are by no means 'gentle' giants!) and director Bryan Singer's vivid creativity is en pointe as are his game cast (earnest yet plucky McGregor adding some gravitas as the king's lead knight and Tucci channeling Christopher Guest's Six-Fingered Man from "The Princess Bride" are key). My 'biggest' (sure, pun intended) gripe is umno giantesses? Really?! Where did this 'brotherhood' spawn from? Then again since the representatives of the pituitary challenged are downright hideous thanks to the visual CGI/motion-capture technology, it's probably just as well.
A PERFECT GETAWAY (2009) *** Steve Zahn, Timothy Olyphant, Milla Jovovich, Kiele Sanchez, Marley Shelton, Chris Hemsworth. Decent thriller with newlyweds Zahn & Jovovich in high danger on their honeymoon in Hawaii where they learn a murdering couple are on the loose  and perhaps closer than they think  after encountering two distinctly off-beat, and vaguely threatening, other couples en route to their hike in the island wilds. Written and directed with clever (perhaps too clever for its own good) élan by David Twohy, the twisty-turny plottings are knotty enough for the average viewer, but for those in the know by act two you'll figure out the turn-of-the-screw headings. Well-acted by the young ensemble, the film works on its own merits of a crackerjack popcorn suspenser.
TAKEN 2 (2012) *** Liam Neeson, Famke Janssen, Maggie Grace, Rade Serbedzija, Leland Oser, Jon Gries, D.B. Sweeney, Luke Grimes. Essentially the same as the original action thriller this time with retired CIA op Leeson (still in lethal mode) facing retribution while working in Istanbul from the vengeance seeking father of the kidnapper he killed saving his daughter Grace from white slavery/prostitution ring. Added to the mix is more Janssen (nothing wrong there but sadly misused - and abused to no end) as his estranged ex-wife also marked for death and an even swifter paced film set by Olivier Megaton and the by-the-numbers-but-smarter-than-it- appears-premise screenplay by collaborators Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen.
MIDNIGHT IN Paris (2011) ***1/2 Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Aiden Brody, Michael Sheen, Mimi Kennedy, Kurt Fuller, Carla Bruni, Alison Pill, Nina Arianda, Tom Hiddleston, Yves Heck, Corey Stoll. Splendid return-to-form Woody Allen comedy about a harried writer (Wilson never before so good and nuanced!) dreaming of living in the past  The Golden Age of the '20s  while vacationing in Paris with fiancée McAdams discovers he actually can at midnite (!) Allen has concocted a potently funny valentine to The City of Lights with his conceit of hobnobbing with the likes of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein et al as a balm to his neuroses with lush cinematography by Darius Khondji and again Wilson's bittersweet, low-key comedic tour de force. Make a reservation now for the year's most sublime comedy!
TRUE GRIT (2010) ***1/2 Jeff Bridges, Hailee Steinfeld, Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, Barry Pepper, Elizabeth Marvel. The Coen Brothers do it again  making move history look easy  in their triumphant adaptation of Charles Portis' novel  which was made into a classic John Wayne western  about a stoic and wise-beyond her years 14 yr old girl named Mattie Ross (newcomer Steinfeld in a remarkable big screen debut) out to redeem the senseless murder of her father at the hands of a no-account (Brolin) by enlisting the services of boozy US Marshal Rooster Cogburn (the always excellent Bridges in a humdinger interpretation of The Duke's Oscar-winning role ; with a wink by The Dude (trivia: eye-patch now on opposite side!) and a braggadocios Texas Ranger (Damon with confidence to spare working wonders as a bold fool and a subtle hero). Joel & Ethan make it look so easy with the quasi-Shakespearean dialogue and purple prose effortlessly for their actors and lensed handsomely by vet Roger Deakins and a great score by Carter Burwell. The Duke Abides!
NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM: BATTLE OF THE SMITHSONIAN (2009) *** Ben Stiller, Amy Adams, Owen Wilson, Hank Azaria, Robin Williams, Christopher Guest, Alain Chabat, Steve Coogan, Ricky Gervais, Bill Hader, Jon Bernthal, Patrick Gallagher, Jake Cherry, Rami Malek, Mizuo Peck, Jay Baruchel, Mindy Kaling, Craig Robinson, Clint Howard, Ed Helms, (as himself: George Foreman; Voices of: Eugene Levy, Brad Garrett) Entertaining follow up to the first "NIGHT" with Stiller reprising his harried Larry Daley this time as a well-to-do businessman who learns all his exhibit friends are being crated off to Washington, DC's Smithsonian for long-term storage and in the process the magical tablet that enlivens the group is wanted by a power-hungry Egyptian pharaoh, Kahmunrah (Azaria goofily channeling Boris Karloff) and enlists the aide of Amelia Earhart (the effervescently plucky Adams who gives the film a shot of adrenaline) to help fend off the villainous plottings. Director Shawn Levy continues his streak of crowd-pleasing family fare comedy and the film boasts an impressive gaggle of comics including Hader, a hoot, as General George Custer. Better than anticipated by a long shot!
TOY STORY 3 (2010) **** (Voices of : Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Don Rickles, Michael Keaton, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Estelle Harris, John Morris, Jodi Benson, Emily Hahn, Laurie Metcalf, Blake Clark, Teddy Newton, Bud Luckey, Beatrice Miller, Timothy Dalton, Kristen Schaal, Jeff Garlin, Bonnie Hunt, Jeff Pidgeon, Whoopi Goldberg, R.Lee Ermey, Richard Kind) Once again Pixar hits a grand slam in the latest of the TOY STORY franchise in which our beloved toys are facing the possibility of no longer being played with now that Andy has reached college age and find themselves delivered to a day care center which has its ups (toddlers very animated to get their hands on them) and downs (the center's ring-leader, Lotso the bear (voiced nicely by Beatty) who runs with an iron fist-in-a-velvet-glove approach). It's up to Woody & Buzz (the always reliably amiable Hanks & Allen reprising their iconic animated characters) to save the day (and themselves). Warmly and touchingly animated (in wondrous 3-D too boot too!) by the studio artistic geniuses and expert direction by Lee Unkrich with a very shrewd (and decidedly darker) screenplay by Michael Arndt collaborating with John Lassetter, & Andrew Stanto and Unkrich. Among the new standouts is Keaton as the 'metorsexual' Ken doll (acerbically full of himself). One of the year's best.
ONCE (2007) **** Irish filmmaker John Carney's lovely, documentary-like drama about a 'busker'  street musician  and a young Czech immigrant known only as "guy" and "girl" (Glen Hansard and Mrketa Irglova), forge an unlikely bond in sharing musical talents and appreciation, when the two new friends decide to record an audition tape, possibly changing their present for a brighter future. A unique love story, artist-on-the-cusp-of-something- big fable and a wonderful look at the human spirit with the underlying theme of the universal language of music. Humorous, heart breaking and human; also has one of the most heart- in-the-throat codas in recent film history: if you don't shed a tear then you my friend are not human. The sleeper of the year; one of the year's best. And my hope for a Best Original Song with the ethereal "If You Want Me".
DEATH SENTENCE (2007) **1/2 Kevin Bacon, Kelly Preston, Jordan Garrett, Stuart Lafferty, Aisha Tyler, Garrett Hedlund, John Goodman, Matt O'Leary. Graphic 21st century update of "DEATH WISH"  Ian Jeffers' screenplay is based on Brian Garfield's novel (he also wrote WISH)  about a family torn apart when their idyllic life comes to a crashing halt as their eldest son is murdered in a gang-land initiation which sends the father (Bacon acquitting himself nicely) into a downward spiral of vengeance which has its ultimate price to pay. Filmmaker James Wan handles the carnage with aplomb but some of the choices for conveying emotional turmoil is heavy handed (i.e. ethereal chorus) but gets the job done.
THE VISITOR (2008) **** Richard Jenkins, Haaz Sleiman, Danai Jekesai Gurira, Hiam Abbass, Marian Seldes, Maggie Moore, Michael Cumpsty, Bill McHenry, Richard Kind, Tzahi Moskovitz. Absorbing and wonderful slice-of-life dramedy about a complacent widowed academic (character actor Jenkins in an Oscar-worthy turn; a career milestone) whose unexpected return to his apartment in NYC results in an unlikely friendship with two illegal immigrants currently squatting there (Sleiman and Gurira, both sublimely perfect) until one is arrested and facing deportation. Actor-turned-filmmaker Tom McCarthy wrote the tough and tender script and the role particularly for Jenkins and it is tailor-made for his mild-mannered burnt out professor who faces a sudden new  and promising- chapter in his life. Kudos also to the ethereal Abbass as Sleiman's mother and Jenkins' love-interest-to-be; she should also be considered for Best Supporting Actress. From beginning to end a treat and an unflinching look at how America treats its citizens  foreign and domestic. One of the year's best films.
SIDE EFFECTS (2013) ***1/2 Rooney Mara, Jude Law, Channing Tatum, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Polly Draper, Mamie Gummer, David Costabile, Vinessa Shaw, Peter Friedman, Laila Robins, Scott Shephered, Michael Nathanson, Sheila Tapia. Absorbing psychodrama cum suspensor with Hitchcockian underpinnings from Steven Soderbergh about a depressed young woman (Mara giving a deft turn) whose world is upside down when she attempts treatment with experimental drugs via her well-meaning yet possibly duplicitous shrink (Law balancing a tight-wire act with aplomb) that leads to a violent crime and a possible conspiracy. Twists and pretzel turns aplenty yet ultimately rewarding screenplay by Scott Z. Burns keeps the compelling intrigue in a taut, clever storyline that not only calls into question of reliance on 'wonder drugs' in today's troubled world but also who is to be held to task when complications become more than a health risk.
THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES (2008) *** Dakota Fanning, Queen Latifah, Jennifer Hudson, Alicia Keys, Sophie Okonedo, Paul Bettany, Hilarie Burton, Tristan Wilds, Nate Parker. Well acted adaptation of the best seller by Sue Monk Kidd about a young girl (Fanning) living in the Deep South during the Civil Right Era 1960s, who runs away from her belligerent father (Bettany) to discover who her mother really was, and is welcome into the unlikely arms of a trio of entrepreneurial sisters (Latifah, Keys and Okonedo) who produce honey from their bee farm. Director Gina Prince-Bythewood  who also wrote the screenplay - shrewdly avoids any syrupy emotional trickery and instead allows each character's voice to ring true to a fault, with each actress shining in her own right. Warm-hearted and full of life lessons; a pleasant surprise.
DARK SHADOWS (2012) *** Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Eva Green, Jackie Earle Haley, Jonny Lee Miller, Bella Heathcote, Chloe Grace Moretz, Gulliver McGrath, Ray Shirley, Christopher Lee, (Cameo: Alice Cooper as Himself). Groovy ghoulies Depp and filmmaker consigliere Tim Burton reunite (and it's so good) again this time in a devilishly grand silver screen adaptation to the cult '60s TV Gothic soap opera about cursed vampire Barnabas Collins (Depp in a Pete Best wig and hamming it to the hilt) whose 200 year exile beneath the ground arouses his premature burial to save his family's business and stave off immortal enemy, witch Angeilique Bouchard (gloriously exotique Green whose funereal demeanor suggests the late great Conradt Veidt's "THE MAN WHO LAUGHS" {!})  who once again has deigns for offing his reincarnated would-be betrothed (Heathcote). While Burton goes all out on Rick Heinrichs fantastic production design; long-time fellow traveler Danny Elfman's eloquent score; a pop culture 1972 riffing jukebox featuring nuggets by the aforementioned Cooper; and beautifully epically bleak/lovely cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel  the semi-campy screenplay by novelist Seth Grahame-Smith (co-story credited to John August and again based on the late, great Dan Curtis series) seems to run on empty by the climax yet a fun cast  particularly Pfeiffer as matriarch and confidante and Haley as the drunken caretaker cum Renfeld make up for the creaky groans of puns and vampire-out-of-water trappings none-the-less. Look very sharp in blink-and-miss cameos by the original cast including Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker, David Selby and sadly the late Jonathan Frid  the original bloodsucker, who passed away one month prior to the film's release).
RELIGULOUS (2008) *** Comedian Bill Maher's scathing documentary on organized religion is certainly blasphemous enough for those who take their faith very seriously  and that's the point  as he glob-trots to ask those of their beliefs largely on Christianity, Judaism, Islamic Muslim and a few others but largely on the aforementioned 'trinity' with some large, scandalous laughs at the expense of his unwitting subjects (in many cases justifiably so), however the film  directed by co-conspirator Larry Charles  becomes a necessary evil as it attempts to expose the blatant hypocrisies and frankly devoutly so. Funny, sure; thought provoking  you betcha! Going to hell more than likely.
THE NEXT THREE DAYS (2010) *** Russell Crowe, Elizabeth Banks, Ty Simpkins, Liam Neeson, Olivia Wilde, Daniel Stern, Jason Beghe, Aisha Hinds, Kevin Corrigan, Brian Dennehy, Helen Carey. Better than anticipated drama/thriller with Crowe as a man facing insurmountable odds: breaking his wife (Banks) out of prison after she has been revoked parole and looking at a lifetime imprisonment for murder. While it is a familiar and occasionally predictable plot the direction by its screenwriter Paul Haggis makes up for it with some ingenious moments (using a tennis ball to break into a car for one!) and lets his lead man do the thing he does best: implosive dedication for setting thing right.
THE GOODS: LIVE HARD, SELL HARD (2009) ***1/2 Jeremy Piven, Ving Rhames, James Brolin, David Koechner, Kathryn Hahn, Ed Helms, Jordana Spiro, Tony Hale, Ken Jeong, Rob Riggle, Alan Thicke, Charles Napier, Jonathan Sadwoski, Noureen DeWulf, Wendie Malick, Craig Robinson, Bryan Callen, Joey Kern, Kristen Schaal. Hilarious kissing cousin to 1980's cult classic "USED CARS" has self-assured, motor-mouthed jerk Don Ready (Piven getting in touch with his inner-Bill Murray/Michael Keaton/Steve Guttenberg), a license-to-kill-in-car-sales, a freelance rainmaker for pushing metal off the lots, winds up with his three co-horts (tough yet sensitive Rhames, numbskull numbers man Koechner, and ballsy broad Hahn) in small-town Cali dealer Brolin's dealership for a testing Fourth of July weekend. Debauched, vulgar, trashy and a whole lot fun in this anything goes, kitchen-sink comedy that hearkens back to Pat Proft & ZAZ comedies of the '80s, nothing is sacred thanks to the politically incorrect script by Andy Stock & Rick Stempson, and the cool bravado directorial debut of Neal Brennan (who was co-creator of "The Chappelle Show"), and executive produced by Adam McKay and Will Ferrell (who has a memorable cameo). Look sharp for Gina Gershon in an unbilled cameo. "THE GOODS" delivers.
GRUDGE MATCH (2013) ** Sylvester Stallone, Robert De Niro, Kim Basinger, Kevin Hart, Alan Arkin, Jon Berenthal, LL Cool J, Barry Primus, Camden Gray. Rocky vs. Raging Bull was probably the pitch for pretty much just that - the stars of those classic boxing pics - face off again as aging pugilist has-beens who are coerced into a re-match after a 30 year feud with a few mild laughs at best in this rather hackneyed script by Tim Kelleher and Rodney Rothman and pedestrian direction from vet Peter Segal. While the two stars throw down with conviction they both seem to be sleepwalking for the most part in a quick paycheck for a film that really should've been rethought. No Mas!
STAND UP GUYS (2012) *** Al Pacino, Christopher Walken, Alan Arkin, Juilana Margulies, Mark Margolis, Lucy Punch, Addison Timlin, Vanessa Ferlito, Katheryn Winnick, Bill Burr, Craig Sheffer. Amiable but rather dull in parts dramedy about recently paroled long-time criminal Pacino (looking rather haggard sadly but still full of p*ss-and-vinegar) whose best friend and partner- in-crime (ditto Walken) whose been enlisted to whack his chum within 24 hours or else. Arkin co-stars in a too-brief role as the third friend of the aging hoods adds a pinch of mischief to spice up the lugubrious story by novice scribe Noah Haidle. Directed by actor Fisher Stevens, the film's predictability mars the otherwise serviceable but routine buddy flick yet its veterans make it seem old hat at best.
THE INVENTION OF LYING (2009) **1/2 Ricky Gervais, Jennifer Garner, Rob Lowe, Louis CK, Jonah Hill, Jeffrey Tambor, Tina Fey, Fionnula Flanagan, Stephanie March, Martin Starr, John Hodgman, Jason Bateman, Christopher Guest, Edward Norton, Philip Seymour Hoffman. High-concept comedy about a loser (Gervais, always the sport of having egg on his face) in a world where only the truth (brutally honest, awkward, cringe-inducing truth) exists until one day he tells the first lie (of many to come) thereby making his fate not as bleak as it appears to be (or does he?) While the film gets a bit serious (the advent of theology is poked at) the overall result is a tad off and the end result feels like a half-baked satire concoction by its filmmakers (Gervais' big-screen directorial debut and co-written with Matthew Robinson).
THE LOOKOUT (2007) ***1/2 Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeff Daniels, Matthew Goode, Isla Fisher, Carla Gugino, Bruce McGill, Alberta Watson, Alex Borstein, Sergio Di Zio, David Huband, Laura Vandervoort, Greg Dunham, Morgan Kelly, Aaron Berg, Tinsel Korey. Absorbing neo-noir drama written and directed by Scott Frank (his debut in the latter) focuses on a damaged goods janitor (Gordon-Levitt proving to be the best American actor of his generation alongside Ryan Gosling), a former high school hockey star who suffered permanent damage in a car accident causing him to keep a notepad handy for the simplest tasks, befriended by a local scumbag (a very good Goode), enlisting him to aid in knocking off the bank he cleans for. Gritty, surprisingly poignant and blackly funny character driven genre flick rises above its expectations thanks to a skillful cast including Daniels as Gordon-Levitt's randy blind roommate who sees more than his friend does.
THE COMPANY YOU KEEP (2013) *** Robert Redford, Shia LaBeouf, Julie Christie, Susan Sarandon, Nick Nolte, Chris Cooper, Terrence Howard, Stanley Tucci, Richard Jenkins, Anna Kendrick, Brendan Gleeson, Brit Marling, Stephen Root, Jackie Evancho. Echoes of Redford's golden era "Three Days of The Condor"/"All the President's Men", "The Fugitive" and "Absence of Malice" coalesce in this potboiler sociopolitical drama about Redford as an in-hiding former member of a '60s group of radicals who finds himself racing the law no thanks to fly-in-the- ointment ambitious journalist LaBeouf who opens a can of worms when one of Redford's comrades is arrested, leading to the pursuit of him in the long run. Lem Dobbs' adaptation of Neil Gordon's novel is cut-and-dried yet is embodied with stinging, singing dialogue and Redford's shrewd top-notch cast of ensemble heavyweights makes the knotty plot line run smoother than it should.
Texas CHAINSAW 3-D (2013) ** Alexandra Daddario, Dan Yeager, Trey Songz, Scott Eastwood, Tania Raymonde, Shaun Sipos, Keram Malicki-Sanchez, James MacDonald, Thom Barry, Paul Rae, Richard Riehle, Bill Moseley, Gunnar Hansen, David Born, Sue Rock, Marilyn Burns. "The House Of Leatherface" could have been the working title of this return to the well of horror in another chapter of the rebooted franchise this time part prequel and part sequel with the film cleverly beginning with vintage footage of the original scarefest and then running on empty by having a backstory of the hulking butcher's family come to fruition when 'cousin' Daddario inherits the infamous farmhouse and charnel unbeknownst to her (natch) with unwitting friends in tow.let the carnage flow! While filmed in 3D (watch out for that hurtling chainsaw!) the film putters along with great predictability and like his kissing cousins Jason, Michael and Freddy ol' Leatherface gets the psychological profile and misunderstood childhood ala Norman Bates. While it's nice to see newbie filmmaker throw a couple of cameos to original stars Hansen and Burns it calls to ENOUGH.
LES MISERABLES (2012) *** Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, Eddie Redmayne, Aaron Tveit, Samantha Barks, Daniel Huttlestone, Colm Wilkinson, Michael Jibson, Isabelle Allen, Natalya Angel Wallace. Epic overtaking of the adaptation of the smash Broadway musical based on the classic novel by Victor Hugo, the timeless tale of Job-like protagonist Jean Valjean (Jackman nailing it) whose crime of stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's child leads to a chronic manhunt of the parolee by ever-so-determined French policeman Javert (Crowe). Added to the mix is consumptive courtesan Fantine (Hathaway in a harrowing, heartfelt Oscar-worthy turn) whose attempts to support her sole child Cossette (Allen as a child and Seyfried as the mature version) is her sealed fate. Boasting a sprawling cast of extras, impressive production design, and Cameron Mackintosh's smart production overall the film bursts alive in every aspect by busting into song throughout (yes like EVITA but with better results) where the dialogue is also practically sung. While the pacing is a tad off, filmmaker Tom Hooper excels in capturing the emotion and even if Jackman's tenuous tenor trembles on the verge of losing his composure it is a crowd-pleasing success.
TOWER HEIST *** Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Matthew Broderick, Alan Alda, Tea Leoni, Casey Affleck, Michael Pena, Gabourey Sidibe, Stephen Henderson, Judd Hirsch, Nina Arianda, Jessica Szhor. Busy high concept comedy with NYC chi-chi high rise concierge Stiller (somewhat dialed down in his manic mode) concocts a scheme to steal back millions ala Robin Hood theft from occupant Wall Street embezzler Alda (nicely cast against type as the oily suave villain) who has absconded the pension funds of his townhouse staff, with the unlikely help from a motley cure of financial victims and Murphy's wily thief. While the usual scattershot directing from director Brett Ratner is expected, the surprisingly funny (and on occasion thrilling) screenplay by Ted Griffin, Jeff Nathanson, Adam Cooper & Bill Collage delivers the funny in this mix of a blue collar "OCEAN'S 11" meets "IT'S A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD". A fine comic ensemble shines, particularly dense Pena who should be charge with grand larceny for stealing the show with his dim-witted sweetness and comic timing.
THE GUEST (2014) **1/2 Dan Stevens, Maika Monroe, Brendan Meyer, Sheila Kelley, Leland Orser, Lance Reddick, Tabatha Shaun, Chase Williamson, Joel David Moore, Ethan Embrey. Interesting-to-a-point thriller with stranger-in-town Stevens (uncannily resembling a very young Mel Gibson) who claims to be the friend of a dead soldier and infiltrates his family with charm and deceit unbeknownst to them of just how seriously dangerous he is as a threat to their lives. Menacingly charming Stevens does all the heavy-lifting of the touch and go script by Simon Barrett and Adam Wingrand's collaboration with steady assured direction with able support by Monroe as the shrewd teenage daughter, Meyer her younger bullied yet smart brother, veteran character actor as the out-of-sorts father and a nice return by Kelley as the blinded thru grief mother too trusting to a deadly fault. While the strengths play in large favor of its lethal lead the final act borderlines a slasher film with an incredibly eye-rolling plot point of just what really is making the homicidal hero tick.
DUPLICITY (2009) ** Clive Owen, Julia Roberts, Tom Wilkinson, Paul Giamatti, Denis O'Hare, Kathleen Chalfant, Thomas McCarthy, Wayne Duvall, Carrie Preston. Glib and quite frankly boring espionage dramedy with spy vs. spy in the corporate world involving two sexy spooks (Owen and Roberts, whose chemistry is truly the only thing worth mentioning) who decide to team up on their employers and abscond with millions in the process. Filmmaker Tony Gilroy's screenplay is a tad too in love with its clever self and the sluggish pacing and constant flashback/forward story-telling device is maddening instead of intriguing; better luck next time.
VALKYRIE (2008) **1/2 Tom Cruise, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Clarice van Houten, Thomas Kretschmann, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izzard, Kevin McNally. Based on the true story of the attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler during WWII by a team of German officers led by Cruise's Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the historical thriller works for the most part despite the known outcome but the aftermath is quite telling in the long run. A stellar British ensemble lends able support while Bryan Singer's steadfast direction and the screenplay based by Singer's old "Usual Suspects" chum Christopher McQuarrie (and Nathan Alexander) provides just enough tension.
MACHETE (2010) *** Danny Trejo, Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Robert De Niro, Jeff Fahey, Steven Seagal, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson, Shea Whigham, Lindsay Lohan, Daryl Sabara, Tom Savini, Elisae & Electra Avellan. Bloody good vengeance exploitation homage from Robert Rodriguez (who co-helmed with long-time editor Ethan Maniquis and keeping it a family affair, his cousin Alvaro penned the screenplay) based on his faux trailer in "GRINDHOUSE" sets the titular Mexican ex-federale Trejo (finally getting a lead role!), a bad-ass out for revenge for the murders of his family by drug kingpin (a bloated Seagal) and set-up for an assassination attempt on corrupt Congressman De Niro by oily businessman Fahey. Out to help are comely ICE (US Immigration/Customs) agent Alba and sexy rebel revolutionist Rodriguez for Machete to avenge his family. Buckets of gore & gallons of blood shed with over-the-top violence, mayhem, nudity and some very interesting situations in between (namely the unlikely source of a cel phone! 'Nuff said) Guilty pleasure popcorn pleaser with a decent body count and a tongue-thru-cheek valentine to the genre.
THE November MAN (2014) *** Pierce Brosnan, Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich, Amila Terzimehic, Lazar Ristovski, Mediha Musliovic, Eliza Taylor, Catarina Scorsone, Will Patton. Brosnan - who executive produced to boot - is the main reason to see this otherwise standard issue espionage thriller about an ex-CIA op who faces his protégé (lukewarm Bracey) embroiled in a global plot involving a sketchy Russian presidential candidate and sneaky goings on within the agency (what else is new?) While Brosnan may be long-in-the-tooth to longer be Bond he still has skills as a blunt force trauma enforcer (to the hilt here!) with non-stop action from vet helmsman Roger Donaldson and fairly doable adaptation by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek of a novel by Bill Granger ("There Are No Spies"; a better title too if you asked me).
CASINO ROYALE (2006) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench, Jeffrey Wright, Giancarlo Giannini, Caterina Murino, Simon Abkarian, Isaach De Bankole, Jesper Christensen, Ivana Milicevic, Sebastien Foucan. Brilliant jump-start to the James Bond franchise by re-booting to the beginning in the first of the Ian Fleming stories with a new Bond (Craig, perhaps the best actor as 007) gaining his license to kill on his first assignment to stop an international banker (baddie Mikkelsen) from bankrolling a high-stakes poker game to continue lending support to global terrorism, with hottie financial analyst Green (perhaps the best Bond babe to date to boot!) in tow. Handled with great aplomb by director Martin Campbell (no slouch to the series with his intro of Pierce Brosnan in "GoldenEye") who skillfully keeps the action riveting (the opening foot chase is a real hoot), the editing snappy (kudos to Stuart Baird) and the storyline from sagging (the screenplay by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and Paul Haggis bogs things down in the extraneous card game) with enough humor, death-defying gags and mostly for having faith in Craig, who brings a Steve McQueen, craggy handsomeness and under his well-chiseled physique a surprising lethal weapon: a heart. Can't wait for the next!
THE HOAX (2007) *** Richard Gere, Alfred Molina, Hope Davis, Marcia Gay Harden, Stanley Tucci, Julie Delpy, Eli Wallach, John Carter, Christopher Evan Welch, Zeljko Ivanek. Gere gives one of his best on screen performances as Clifford Irving, the man who authored the 1970s faux biography of the reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes, whose lies are one step ahead of the truths haunting him and his quicksilver gift for gab only gets him deeper and deeper into trouble. A fine ensemble including Molina as Irving's aide de camp Dick Susskind, is a riot of flop-sweat and itchy tenacity at hemming the truth for his friend despite the inevitable final act of retribution served coldly. Director Lasse Hallstrom does a serviceable job of the fueled paranoia, desire for the cult of personality and the audaciousness of it all by a smart, sharply skewed screenplay adaptation by William Wheeler based on Irving's (who else?!!) novel.
ZOMBIE STRIPPERS! (2008) 1/2 Robert Englund, Jenna Jameson, Jeannette Sousa, Shamron Moore, Brad Milne, Shannon Malone, Catero Colbert, Zak Kilberg, Jennifer Holland, Roxy Saint, Laura Bach, Joey Medina, Penny Drake, Whitney Anderson, Carmit Levite, John Hawkes, Jen Alex Gonzalez, Laura Bach, Jessica Custodio. Tongue-thru-cheek T&A and dumb-as-a- stump zombie homage mashup of sub-Cormanian sleaze that frankly hasn't a clever thought in its ripped out skull: a futuristic US government run amok has an experiment gone awry resulting in a horde of zombies with a p*ss and vinegar Marine troop set in for the kill, only to unknowingly transmit the virus at a nearby strip-joint resulting in the titular monster- mish-mash. The gore effects are a mixed lot with buckets of viscera for the masses and a hammy  cry for help from Englund as the germ-phobic flamboyant joint owner (!) and porn- star supreme Jameson as the first of the afflicted strippers (!!) You've been warned  although I did like Bach's 'assets' as the busty gung-ho jarhead (and sadly the only one who isn't nude! So a demerit there!) Written and directed by Jay Lee, heir apparent to Ed Wood for the 21st Century anyone?
THE HOST (2007) *** Kang-ho Song, Hie-bong Byeon, Hae-il Park, Du-na Bae, Ah-sung Ko. South Korean filmmaker Joon-ho Bong's inspired valentine to '50s giant monster run-amok horror/sci-fi thrillers is a guilty pleasure, giddily over-the-top combination of "Godzilla" meets "Little Miss Sunshine" when a monstrous sea creature emerges from the tranquil waters of Seoul's Han River terrorizing the community and involving the deeply dysfunctional Park family when their youngest is held captive by the monster, the relatives band together to get her back despite the odds. Funny, frenetic and a tad too dippy but none-the-less entertaining mix of thrills, chills and comedy that will inevitably be Americanized, mark my words, see the original while you can in all its wonderfully goofy winning ways here first.
TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE (2012) *** Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, John Goodman, Jason Timberlake, Matthew Lillard, Robert Patrick, Chelcie Ross, Raymond Anthony Thomas, Ed Lauter, George Wyner, Bob Gunton, Jack Gilpin, Clifton Guterman. Hit-and-miss baseball melodrama with crusty Clint as a grouchy elderly major league baseball scout whose fading eyesight may hinder his chances of his continuing career, unless his estranged daughter Adams (acquitting herself nicely with some pep and spunk), a career oriented attorney with eyes on a promotion to partner, will accompany him for an important prospect. Directed by longtime Eastwood collaborative Robert Lorenz the film mistakenly adds Timberlake as an ex-player turned scout who slows things down in an unlikely romantic pairing with Adams but isn't the only thing making the movies putter along (some editing here and there could've helped and the screenplay by novice Randy Brown is bush league at best. But it's always a pleasure to see Eastwood have some fun along the way even if his aging grump is getting a tad long in the tooth. At best a standing triple instead of a grand-slam.
HAYWIRE (2011) *** Gina Carano, Ewan McGregor, Channing Tatum, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender, Michael Douglas, Bill Paxton, Michael Angarano. Filmmaker Steven Soderbergh's too-cool-for-school spy vs. spy action set piece tailor made for MMA Corano (in her big-screen debut) as a wet-ops agent seeking answers and revenge  not necessarily in that order  when she's targeted for death with some loose ends to be tightened (preferably around her double-crossers' collective throats). Lean-and-mean screenplay by Lem Dobbs (who collaborated with Soderbergh on the criminally underrated indie gem THE LIMEY) sets things in motion with the beautifully lethal Carano (chosen personally by Soderbergh for her sweet skills in kicking some serious ass) up to the task in basically beating the snot out of her dubious co-stars. Shrewdly directed (i.e. the fights are thankfully not a chop-chop edited mélange of WTF just happened; clean and visible and Real! And altering Carano's voice to have a huskier tone is an interesting conceit) with razor-sharp pacing and just enough intrigue to keep the pot boiling. A veteran ensemble cast and the globe-trotting usual plotting mixed in the blend comes across as a toxic tonic for the espionage gone awry crowd. Best bit: Fassbender's pas-de-deux with our Wonder Woman (indeed); I'm in love.
THE ZERO THEOREM (2014) ***1/2 Christoph Waltz, David Thewlis, Melanie Thierry, Matt Damon, Lucas Hedges, Tilda Swinton, Ben Whishaw, Peter Stormare.Terry Gilliam's kissing cousin of BRAZIL with a bouillesbaiese of 1984, THE TWILIGHT ZONE's "The Obsolete Man", WAITING FOR GODOT and Jonathan Swift satire mixed to a colorful cocktail of dystopia in the not-too-distant-future with corporate cog/border-line head case Quohen Leth (a bald and tic fused Waltz getting his ya-yas out to the nth degree) whose ambition to crack the code to What Is The Meaning of ALL THIS and expecting a rather personal phone call perhaps to shed some light. A game ensemble with Thewlis as the touchy-feelie supervisor, Damon as Management (a virtual clone to Karl Lagerfield incarnate), Swinton in her cottage industry of elaborate wigs and prosthetic teeth as a virtual reality shrink and the beguiling Thierry as Waltz' love/lust interest making things very interesting. Kudos to the amazing production design concocted by David Warren, inventive costumes by Carlo Poggioli and clear-eyed surreal cinematography by Nicola Pecorini. Gilliam outdoes himself with the visual scope while balancing the office drone in hell schism to an art form and crushing soul ennui as a totem poem to the proletariate searching for something more THAN THIS. Yes that is the late Robin Williams (unbilled) as a billboard spokesman for of all things The Church Of Batman the Redeemer!
BERBERIAN SOUND STUDIO (2013) **1/2 Eerie psychological thriller with Toby Jones (sublimely excellent) as a meticulous sound engineer whose employment on an Italian horror film becomes an Olympian testament to his psyche as his cruel and clueless bosses plague him as he attempts to do his job while being the brunt of their disdain. What could've been an epic valentine to Italian giallo horror flicks, the film loses its nerve by the final act of incoherency that has a lost in translation vibe throughout yet a game attempt by green director Peter Strickland with echoes of Roman Polanski's mind f#@ks and a fantastic sound effects design (how appropriate).

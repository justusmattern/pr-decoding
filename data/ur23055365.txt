Gangs of New York is a brilliant movie with an extremely well developed storyline and a really talented cast that stay in character perfectly for the whole.Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz both gave dazzling performances,but the best performance has to go to Daniel Day Lewis,he is an unbelievably great actor who is always really believable in his roles,and you know he must be a great actor if he manages to out shine two big stars like them.The three main actors all worked really well together,and they did a really great job,especially for the fact that these three characters are very different compared to any character any of the three have played before and I was very impressed.I was also overall very impressed with the Irish theme in this movie,i'm from Ireland and I usually find American movies take on the Irish very exaggerated,but it was done very well in this,Martin Scorsese knew what he was doing.Gangs of New York is a must see for all fans of Leonardo DiCaprio,Cameron Diaz and Daniel Day Lewis and of course the very talented director,Martin Scorsese.Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to his hometown of New York City seeking revenge against Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis),a man who killed his father in front of him when he was very young.
When in Rome is a brutal movie with a really stupid storyline and a good cast that sadly couldn't make up for this terrible script.We follow Kristen Bell in this movie,who I do like very much as an actress,but her character in this was just not likable at all,and that's the same for Josh Duhamel,but the most annoying characters were certainly the four men who fell in love with Bell,who were sadly played by some great comedy actors,Danny DeVito,Will Arnett and Jon Heder,but it couldn't make up for how irritating these characters were,everything that came out of their mouths was just not funny,and the reason why they fell in love with Bell is ridiculous.Unless you want to see a romantic comedy were you won't laugh or have any care for the characters whatsoever,definitely avoid When in Rome. A New Yorker is pursued by a band of infatuated suitors when she takes some coins from a fountain in Rome,but she has her eyes on someone else.

Silver Linings Playbook is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an impressive cast that all really suit their characters. Bradley Cooper,Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro all delivered outstanding performances and Lawrence definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Although, personally, I preferred Cooper's performance, he really put all his heart in to this character and delivered some very intense dialogue with pure passion, it was also a very unique role and I don't think he had a lot to work with in regards to rehearsing. It's definitely a romantic comedy but the cast and the different characters are very refreshing. At times very dramatic and other times quite funny, there is no other movie like Silver Linings Playbook and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or romance film. A man moves back in with his parents after spending time in a mental institution, and decides to become a new man to impress his ex-wife, but everything changes when he meets Tiffany, who shares many of the similar crazy traits he has.Best Performance: Bradley Cooper Worst Performance: Anupam Kher If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Hitch is a good movie with an enjoyable and heartfelt story line,as well as a good cast.Will Smith and Kevin James offered both heartwarming and hilarious performances.It did seem like a kind of movie Kevin James would do,but I would expect better from Will Smith,he has starred in many phenomenal action movies,and this is very different for him,but his heart was in the performance and he did do a very good job.Alex Hitchens (Will Smith) helps out men who struggle to impress women,but he gets a really challenge when Albert Brennaman (Kevin James) wants his help to impress a wealthy younger girl,but Alex is up for the challenge.Meanwhile,Alex must deal with his own love life,and falls for Sara Melas (Eva Mendes).
Along Came a Spider is a decent movie with a good storyline that has several plot holes but still contains plenty of enjoyable scenes and a good cast.The movie certainly isn't as good as the previous Alex Cross movie Kiss the Girls,it just wasn't as exciting and there wasn't really any mystery as to who the kidnapper and other criminals were,they made the audience aware of everything so there was never a scene where you would be shocked or surprised.Morgan Freeman still does a good performance,but he's definitely done much better and I think he knew himself that about 90% of this script was far fetched and basically ridiculous.After watching this you will definitely be asking yourself a lot of questions,you'll be wondering how one thing happened,how did this happen,etc, you will definitely be confused because the writers clearly didn't develop this story enough.Along Came a Spider has it moments,but it's mostly just a mediocre crime movie and unless you want to see every movie that stars Morgan Freeman,I wouldn't recommend this movie.Forensic psychologist Alex Cross,teams up with secret service agent Monica Potter to track down a psychotic kidnapper.Best Performance:Morgan Freeman Worst Performance:Dylan BakerIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Green Hornet is a very mediocre movie with a storyline that can't seem to make up its mind whether its an action or a comedy and makes it seem more like a parody.I am a very big fan of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg,and this movie dosen't change my opinion on them,I don't think this is the kind of thing they were use to writing and because of that it just turned out very weak,also its 12A so they couldn't throw in the same kind of humour they do in movies like Superbad or Pineapple Express that they do so well.The movie couldn't even make good use of its most talented cast members,Cameron Diaz and Christoph Waltz both clearly did the best they could,but there characters were clearly terribly written,Chudnofsky was an irritating villain that I didn't find funny or creepy,the best performance was definitely from Rogen,and was the closet thing in this movie to his usual movies.I did not like Jay Chou's performance,I feel like this movie was too big for him and he wasn't experienced enough,also his character was unlikeable.I wouldn't recommend the Green Hornet to fans of Seth Rogen or superhero movies,it's not terrible but you would be better off avoiding it.After his fathers death,Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) decides to start fighting crime with his assistant Kato (Jay Chou) and uses his fathers successful newspaper company to get attention.
Saw 2 is a better than average movie with a promising storyline that just didn't turn out as good as it seemed.I did enjoy the dialog between Donnie Wahlberg and Tobin Bell,but the scenes with everyone stuck in the booty trapped room set up by Jigsaw was terrible,the dialog and acting was very mediocre and it mostly relied on gore.It is definitely more gory than the first Saw,a bit too gory for me,the way everyone is killed is just disgusting and graphic.The movie also wasn't as frightening as the first Saw and the story didn't have a build up as exciting as the original.I also didn't like how we didn't get to see much of the Jigsaw puppet and the direction isn't as dark (the director is different) as the first.Saw 2 is very gruesome,but its not very scary,if your a fan of the first you should still check it out,mainly because of Donnie Wahlberg and Tobin Bells impressive performances and a very unexpected twist,but you will be overall disappointed.The Jigsaw Killer has kidnapped the son of cop Eric Matthews.Jigsaw gets Eric to talk to him while his son and many others try to survive.
Since my opinions of them are significantly different, I have broken this up in to two paragraphs, the first focusing on seasons 1 to 8, and the second on 9 to 12. Two and a Half Men is a terrific television series with fantastic writing that packs in so many genuine laughs in a mere twenty minutes and an outstanding comedic cast that you can tell loved working together. The first eight seasons are some of my favourite moments in television history, the chemistry and natural comedic timing of Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer and Angus T. Jones is fantastic, watching these old episodes will always bring a smile to my face, if they had ended on the eight season, I would have given this series a ten. My favourite character is definitely Alan, Charlie is of course well developed and superbly written, and Jake is great no matter how old gets, but Alan is a really original character, not like any other I've seen in any television series, he gets the best lines and is caught up in the most hilarious situations, and Jon Cryer's performance is undeniably gold. They aren't the only people that brought me such joy in these seasons however, I also loved the performances of Conchata Ferrell, Holland Taylor, Melanie Lynskey, Ryan Stiles, Jane Lynch, among many others. As for seasons 9 to 12, the series totally started to jump the shark. Not necessarily in 9 and 10, I think these seasons are underrated, Ashton Kutcher did the best he could and his character was brought in to the series in a good and clever way, but the absence of Charlie Sheen is always noticeable, he was the star of the show and Kutcher simply wasn't enough to fill the void. As for seasons 11 and 12, the series completely started to nuke the fridge, this was when Angus T Jones left, they brought in Charlie's daughter to essentially become the new "half man", and it was simply ridiculous, the show became a parody of itself. The twelfth season is even worse, it had a very slow and repetitive storyline of Alan and Walden getting married just so they could adopt a child. The final episode however is probably the worst hour of television I've ever watched, it was very poorly written, broke the fourth wall constantly and had a brutal anti-climatic ending, and we will never know what happened to these characters in the end. Jon Cryer becomes a bigger star after Sheen leaves, no matter how much charm the series may have lost, he didn't lose any, Alan Harper was the only thing that kept me watching. All in all, the majority of Two and a Half Men is clever and superbly written, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy series, but be prepared for disappointment in the end. After his wife leaves him, Alan Harper is forced to move in to his millionaire brother Charlie's beach house, a place where constant partying and drinking goes on, but Charlie has to change his ways when Alan's son Jake starts visiting.

The Wolverine is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a talented cast.My was very pleased with this movie,Wolverines first spin off film was extremely mediocre and had so many flaws,this movie made up for that,I'm not saying its perfect but it certainly is the solo movie that Wolverine deserves,he's a great character and Hugh Jackman does a great job playing him.The ending is without a doubt my favourite part,it was just such a fun and unexpected scene,I won't spill anything,but it is definitely a set up for X-Men: Days of Future Past.Fans of the X-Men series and Wolverine in particular will be very pleased with the Wolverine and I would definitely recommend it.After Wolverine ends up in Japan,he gets caught up in some major forces that causes to face his own inner demons.Best Performance:Hugh Jackman Worst Performance:Tao OkamotoIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Beverly Hills Cop 3 is an enjoyable movie with a decent storyline and a good comedic cast.Its certainly not better than the first two Beverly Hills Cop but it's still has good comedy and action.My main problem is that Eddie Murphy just didn't seem as inspired this time around,he made Axel in to a much more serious character,I'm not sure if that's how the script was written but I think it was just his acting,definitely one of Murphy's most dull performances,he is usually much more lively.However there still are scenes where Axel Foley had me laughing out loud and Murphy was really in character,particularly the scene where he accidentally ends up in stage and starts dancing with the costumed characters.I really enjoy the Beverly Hills Cop movies and hope a fourth one is someday made,Murphy's age will not be a problem because he still looks great and still plays very lively characters in his movies.Fans of the first two will without a doubt be disappointed,but should definitely watch it because the characters and story is still good. Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) returns to Beverly Hills to find the men who killed his boss,and finds out the case is much more difficult when it leads him to a theme park where the same men are making counterfeit money within the park.
Alvi And The Chipmunks is a great fun family film,with enjoyable characters and music,I enjoy this film even though it is not too well received,a lot of people think its an insult to the original Alvin And The Chipmunks but I feel its a good compliment to the original,although I do think that the sequels,The Squeakquel and Chipwrecked,are just horrible,I don't think the second one is that bad but the third is just a stupid storyline and they never stop singing.A song writer named Dave Seville has ran out of ideas and lost his job,but everything turns around when he meets three singing chipmunks named Alvin,Simon and Theodore.
Van Wilder: Party Liaison is an awful movie with a storyline that seemed interesting but turned out terrible and a great comedic cast that are wasted by a brutal script.The movie is just one ridiculous joke after another,I literally didn't properly laugh at any scene,a lot of parts were just purposely disgusting,like the part with the dog and the twinkies,I don't see how anyone could write something like that and expect people to find it funny instead of just plain gross.I really like Ryan Reynolds as an actor and he's gone on to prove after this film that he can definitely act,but Van Wilder was just an annoying character that I found very unlikeable and wasn't rooting for him throughout this film,the only character who's scenes I enjoyed in any way was Kal Penn's character.Van Wilder: Party Liaison is a terrible movie that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Van Wilder,a student who's been attending college for seven years and showing no sign of leaving,realizes that he is afraid to face the real world when a journalist starts writing about him.

Grown Ups 2 is an alright movie with basically no storylione,just one joke after another,but a very fun cast that are all clearly close friends.I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as I enjoyed the first Grown Ups,I thought the first one had tons of very funny scenes that turned out really good and that it was very underrated by critics,but there are a lot more misses in this one.My biggest problem was that there was too much childish humor (fart jokes,toilet humor,etc) and that Taylor Lutner was in it too much and Andy Samberg wasn't in it enough,when you get a big and funny star like him in your movie,you don't give him a brief cameo were he dosen't even speak.Still there was a lot of funny scenes,mostly from Adam Sandler,Chris Rock,Kevin James and David Spade,and they should have been in it a lot more instead of having a lot of it focus on their kids.If you enjoyed the first Grown Ups,you will be disappointed,but you will still laugh a lot.The gang prepare for a great summer in their hometown and reunite with some old friends and enemies.
Grown Ups is a funny movie,an average Adam Sandler film that makes you laugh,although there isn't really a storyline,its still a fun movie getting to watch all these grown up men being what they truly want to be,kids again.The highlights are definitely from Adam Sandler,Kevin James,Chris Rock and Rob Schneider.I feel the movie is extremely underrated by critics,its a light-hearted kind of movie that you would expect from these actors,also better than some films these actors have been in,for example,Mall Cop (Kevin James) and Jack And Jill (Adam Sandler).A sequel is coming out in 2013 and I look forward to seeing this fun cast together again.Five old friends relive there childhood after the death of there inspirational basketball coach as they head out for a weekend with there family's to spread the coaches ashes.
How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline and a terrific voice cast.The first movie really didn't seem to me like a film that really needed a sequel,but I was proved wrong,because they made a movie that further expands it's universe and I honestly liked it even more than the first.The characters develop more in this movie,we learn an awful lot about several main characters,and even some new ones,which is something I really liked about this movie,it didn't just take these people on a new adventure like most animated sequels do but it also took the time it was given with another movie to get us to learn more about them.I also loved that the characters are older,the first movie was four years ago and that's exactly how much older they look,Hiccup is roughly the same age as me and I really feel like we grew up together,seeing him look older but still following the same dream,like myself.Filled with emotional scenes and parts funny for both kids and adults,How to Train Your Dragon 2 is an outstanding animated sequel that I would highly recommend as a family film. Hiccup and Toothless find themselves caught up in another adventure to protect the freedom of dragons,with some other unexpected events occurring along the way.

The Big Wedding is an awful movie with a poorly written storyline and a great comedic cast that sadly weren't enough to make this movie enjoyable.The set up for the movie sounded fun and unique,and then the cast made it sound even better,but sadly there were very few parts that I genuinely laughed at.The movie had such a great cast and didn't use any of them to full effect,Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton didn't really get to show their dramatic acting skills enough,a great actress like Amanda Seyfried wasn't even in it very long,and Robin Williams (One of the Greatest Comedy Actors of All Time,May He Rest in Peace) could easily have improvised all of his scenes and made them so much funnier,but sadly the director obviously made him go by the script,so all of his lines were very dry humour.Usually the fun thing about comedies that revolve around families is that you can relate to them in a funny way,but there is no way anyone could relate to this family's relationship,the ending was probably what irritated me the most though,most of the conflict in this film isn't resolved.The Big Wedding is not a funny or enjoyable movie and I would recommend it to no one. As their adopted sons mother arrives for his wedding,a divorced couple must pretend they are still married.

Horrible Bosses is a fantastic movie with a really clever storyline and a very talented and comedic cast.It sounded like a really stupid comedy,but it was actually hilarious and there are very few jokes that don't work out.The cast is brilliant,Jason Bateman,Charlie Day,Jason Sudekis all did a fantastic job as the three best friends and Jennifer Aniston,Kevin Spacey and Colin Farell were all hilarious and really bad bosses,Jamie Foxx was also one of the funniest characters,the entiire cast is just brilliant.I would highly recommend Horrible Bosses to all comedy fans.Three close friends that all have a tuff time with their bosses work together to murder all three of them to make their own lives easier.
My Cousin Vinny is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great comedic cast.Its mostly very funny,I think there are many scenes that miss,but the scenes that are funny are hilarious,the scenes that are cringe comedy are definitely the ones that work the best in this movie.Joe Pesci does a great job as Vinny Gambini,the character was very basic for a comedy film and easily could have been played by any random comedy actor,but getting someone as talented as Pesci to play this character brings much more life in to the Vinny and makes him so much likable.Marisa Tomei also does a fantastic job in this movie,her character was funny,clever and very independent,I honestly don't think she deserved an Academy Award for this movie but her performance was certainly the movies best.I don't My Cousin Vinny is laugh out loud from start to finish,but the scenes that are funny are very funny,and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.When two New Yorkers are accused of murder in rural Alabams,one of their cousins,an inexperienced,loudmouth lawyer not accustomed to Southern rules,comes in to defend them.
Dan in Real Life is a great movie with a very well written storyline that has a very good mix of very dramatic and depressing scenes,as well as plenty of very funny scenes. Judging from the films poster,I thought this was going to be a very goofy comedy,but it was actually a very mature and grown up movie on one of those family situations where you know no one is going to come out victorious.Steve Carell did a fantastic job as Dan,he is great on at any kind if comedy because he can play both dramatic characters and ones that are just stupid.If your a fan of drama comedies then you will definitely enjoy Dan in Real Life. Several years after his wives death,Dan (Steve Carell) thinks he may have met the perfect woman.However,this woman is dating his brother.This leads to an awkward weekend with the whole family.
I Am Legend is a brilliant movie with an incredible story line,a great cast and characters.Will Smiths performance in this movie was amazing,he was completely in to his character from start to finish,and hes the main reason this movie is so great,because hes such a good actor.The movie is rated PG-13 but I would say if your a parent thinking about letting your young son or daughter watch this,don't,there are some very creepy seens that have a very real feel to it,that a young kid would be sensitive to.Robert Neville (Will Smith) struggles to find a cure for a plague that killed most of the world and turned the rest in to horrible mutants,it is just him left alone,with his dog Sam in New York City.
Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is as great movie with a well developed storyline and a brilliant cast.It wasn't as great as it could have been,I still think the first one is the best but it does improve on the second,thankfully they got the original characters to play an important role instead of getting a bunch of new characters to take their place,like they did on Battle of the Smithsonian,because although I liked those characters,it's the ones from the first Night at the Museum I want to be seeing the most of.I wasn't very fond of Ben Kingsleys role,I honestly think it was a waste of a good actor,he isn't in it for a very long time and dosen't get to show off any of his acting skills while he is there.The last fifteen minutes are hard to watch,they are certainly the highlight of the whole movie,but they are just filled with emotions,I felt sympathy knowing this would be the last time I see these characters,but even more so because it would be the last movie I ever see Robin Williams in,I'm happy these got to be his last few minutes of film,because it was a sweet and heartwarming send off he deserved,and his memory will live on through the many people he made laugh,and sometimes even cry.A fun and entertaining finale,I would recommend Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb to anyone looking for a good family film. Larry and his friends from the museum must head to London to save the power of the tablet before it is gone forever.

The Naked Gun: From The Files Of Police Squad! is a fantastic comedy with a brilliant story,a great cast,brilliant characters and plenty of laughs all around from start to finish,and its no surprise since its from Jim Abrahams,David Zucker and Jerry Zucker,the people who brought us Airplane,and bought of these movies are some of my favourite movies of all time.And of course,this movie is all great because of Leslie Nielsen,a fantastic comedy actor who will always make me laugh,even movies hes starred in that I didn't like,for example,Superhero Movie,I did enjoy his parts.I was very excited when I first found out they were working on a fourth Naked Gun,but shortly after that Leslie Nielsen died,so because,there is no way,if they ever end up making one I wont see it,because Leslie Nielsen is the only man who can ever play Frank Drebin.Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) gets involved in a case involving a man who shot his friend Nordberg (O.J. Simpson),who is now planning to assassinate the Queen of England,who is visiting America.
The Sum of All Fears is a good movie with a well written storyline and a great cast.It is a very good thriller and it has some great special effects as well,but I didn't find any of the action or dialogue very breathtaking.Its definitely the worst Jack Ryan film to date,although I did really enjoy Ben Affleck as Ryan,he's certainly no Harrison Ford but he was definitely better than Alec Baldwin,I would have liked to see more Ryan films with Affleck in the main role but it dosen't seem like that will be happening anytime soon.I wasn't impressed with the amount of screen time Morgan Freeman received,they made it seem like he was a very main character in this but he probably had 20 minutes of screen time,I was surprised to see James Cromwell in this,I thinks he's an underrated actor who would rarely star in movies like this,but he played an important role and did a great job.Fans of previous Jack Ryan films won't love it,but you won't hate it either,Sum of All Fears is an enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good thriller or drama if it's ever on television. Jack Ryan must prevent the plans of a terrorist organisation that is trying to start huge conflict between Russia and the USA.

The Birds is a fantastic movie with a great and very thrilling storyline with some great actors.This film is without a doubt one of Alfred Hitchocks scariest movies,most of his films before this were very much thrillers,but this is a genuine horror,the birds are genuinely terrifying and I was very impressed that Hitchcock maneged to take such harmless creatures and make them very horrifying,it shows what a great horror director he really was.The Birds is thrilling and very scary,I would recommend it to all Hithcock fans and to anyone looking for a good horror.

Whatever Works is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast that is able to be both at times very comedic and also very dramatic.Since Larry David is in this movie I was expecting it to be like Curb Your Enthuasiasm,that type of humour,but it really wasn't,it is very much a Woody Allen film,which means that some scenes are very funny but other scenes are very depressing,David's character had a very depressing outlook on life and basically everything he says about the world makes you think in a negative way.It is an enjoyable movie but,as Larry David states at the start of the film,don't expect it to make you feel good,although you will certainly laugh.Whatever Works is not a heartwarming romantic comedy,but it is a good one,I would recommend it fans of Woody Allen and Larry David,and to anyone looking for a good romantic comedy.

Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom is a brilliant movie with a great storyline,action,humor and a terrific cast.I think Harrison Ford is a fantastic actor,a lot people consider his role as Han Solo in the original Star Wars series to be his greatest role,which he did do a great job with,but I preferred him as Indiana Jones,this is his greatest role in any of his movies.Like Ford said when they where talking about Shia LeBeouf replacing him as the new Indiana Jones 'no,thats my hat,Shia can get his own hat,I own that hat'.A lot of people say The Temple Of Doom didn't live up to Raiders,but I think it was brilliant,although not exactly as good as Raiders,still a terrific sequel.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) returns along with his new partner Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and his new young friend Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) as they a given a misson by a poor village to find a mystical stone.While searching for the stone they stumble upon a cult,plotting a terrible plan in an ancient palace.
Oceans Twelve is a good movie with a well written storyline and a terrific cast.Its still enjoyable,but it is nowhere near as fun as Oceans Eleven was,there was always a huge sense in the first that these actors were having a lot of fun together,you could tell that they were friends,but that sort of atmosphere was absent this time around and that was certainly something that was leaving a huge gap.The best scene for me was Julia Roberts character pretending to be Julia Roberts,it was so ridiculous and then once Bruce Willis comes along it gets even more silly,but it had me in stitches all the way through.Its not a bad sequel,it is certainly missing some of the heart and chemistry that made the first one so good,but I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime film if you ever see it on television.

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a brilliant movie with a fantastic storyline that is packed with adventure,some very sweet moments and overall great message.I really expected this movie to be a total comedy since Ben Stiller was in the main role,and although there are many funny scenes,the movie is actually very dramatic and probably Stiller's most impressive performance as a serious actor,he also directed this movie,and he did a fantastic job.Kristen Wiig and Adam Scott also did a great job and suited their characters very well.Fans of Ben Stiller and just anyone looking a for a good movie what will make you think should definitely see the Secret Life of Walter Mitty.Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller),a man who works for Life magazine,who constantly daydreams and feels like he's never done anything important in his life,heads off in a big adventure to find the last frame of Life magazines final publish,while trying to build up his courage to tell his work partner Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) how he truly feels about her.
Kick-Ass 2 is a good movie with a very enjoyable storyline and a talented cast.It certainly isn't as good as the first Kick-Ass,it was definitely lacking a lot of the quality entertainment that was in the original.I honestly thought it was going to be better than the first one with the edition of Jim Carrey,one of my all time favourite comedy actors,and from the trailer he looked like he would be a great new character for the sequel,and while for the time he was in it he was outstanding,he wasn't in it for as much as the trailers and posters made it seem,which I found to be a major disappointment,it actually says in the trivia he only had 7 minutes and 45 seconds of screen time,I really wasn't impressed with all the trailers they did that made it seem like he was a very main character,I wasn't impressed.Chloe Grace Mortez and Christopher Mintz- Plasse both deliver great performances,they were just as good as they were in the original and their characters,other than Carrey's,are the most enjoyable and funniest of the movie.Fans of the first Kick Ass will definitely be disappointed,but Kick-Ass 2 is still a fun and enjoyable sequel,and you can still watch and enjoy if you haven't seen the first.Kick Ass returns to the streets with a new superhero team after Hit Girl moves on with her life.Meanwhile,the Red Mist returns,with a new name and is now a villain,and puts Kick Ass and the rest of the team in great danger.
Star Trek: Insurrection is a good movie with a nice storyline but I feel it tried to be too sweet to a degree that there just wasn't enough excitement that you would want in a Star Trek movie.It focuses too much on the characters,which the cast are great at doing,but it does that too much and you just want some adventure that dosen't happen for a very long time.The movie was definitely trying to be the Next Generation version of the Voyage Home,but it just didn't work out as well and didn't have that sense of humour that made it Voyage Home so enjoyable,it was way too sweet than you would want in Star Trek.Insurrection probably would have worked out better as a forty five minute episode rather than a whole movie,but I would still recommend it to Star Trek fans,it's certainly not the worst Star Trek movie,but it is the least exciting.The crew head on a mission to observe the peaceful Baku people,but the Sona covet the Baku's longevity and plan to take over the planet.
Get Him To The Greek is a brilliant movie with a great story line,an impressive comedy cast and some hilarious characters.The movie is a spin off to Forgetting Sarah Marshall,and revolves around the life of Russel Brand's character Aldous Snow.It certainly isn't as emotional as Forgetting Sarah Marshall,and Jonah Hill isn't a better lead role as Jason Segel,in my opinion,but fans of Forgetting Sarah Marshall will enjoy it.If you like Russel Brand as Aldous Snow and Jonah Hill comedies,you will enjoy this movie and some scenes will have you laughing out loud.Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) is hired to bring big solo singer Aldous Snow (Russel Brand) to his big concert in the Greek Theater that they have three days to prepare for.
Gremlins 2: The New Batch is not a great movie and a very big disappointment compared to the original.Gizmo isn't that main,the main characters as the new Gremlins,who are causing trouble around a big building for half of the movie.The original is displayed in a sort of old fashioned neighborhood,this movie is completely different,its an a very futuristic place.Once the Gremlins turn into the monsters the whole plot just gets abandoned and its just gag after gag,at once stage they have to stop the whole movie and Hulk Hogan has to put the movie back on,what where they thinking,you can tell it wasn't written by Chris Columbus.The Gremlins have returned,Gizmo is found by a building where his old owner Billy is now working,and scientists give him water and multiply him.Then the other Gremlins are experimented on and one is able to talk,once again they are fed after midnight,and take total control of the building.Its up to Billy and Gizmo to save the day.
Angels and Demons is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.It's considered a sequel to the Da-Vinci Code but Robert Langdon is really the only thing these two movies have in common,the movie have basically no connection and you could easily watch this without seeing the Da-Vinci Code.The movies storyline is very different as well at in a religious perspective it definitely wouldn't be as offensive,but I still wouldn't recommend religious people watch it.Tom Hanks delivers a performance as Robert Langdon just as good as before,he is without a doubt one of my all time favourite actors,he never fails to amaze me,I was also very impressed with Ayelet Zurer and Ewan McGregor,this was a very different character for him and he did a great job.I would recommend Angels and Demons to all fans of the Da- Vinci Code,but don't expect it to be just as good,also to all fans of mystery and thriller's.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is assigned by the Vatican to solve a case against the Illuminati that plan to attack the Vatican,starting by killing each cardinal.
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a good movie with a pretty good storyline and an average cast.Its definitely not as enjoyable as the first Transformers and it goes on too long,also an awful lot of the movie is very long action sequences,that go on for so long that after a while you don't even know whats going on.Shia Labeouf is just as good as the first,but Megan Fox is probably worse,I didn't like her in the first and I didn't like her in this,she is very attractive that is clearly the only reason she makes it in such big movies,because she can not act.Like the first my favourite actors are definitely the voice actors,they do a very impressive job voicing these strong characters,and the addition of the small auto it's was very humorous and added as a good comic relief.Fans of the first Transformers will be disappointed,but Revenge of the Fallen is still a good sequel. After leaving Bumblebee and the other Autobots for college,Sam (Shia Labeouf) starts experiencing weird symbols in his head that result in the return of the Decepticons.
True Grit is a good movie with a very well developed storyline with a good cast and terrific character development.I read the book which is why I wanted to watch this movie,and as I was reading the book all I could picture while reading Rooster Cogburn's dialogue was John Wayne,it really was perfect casting and it's without a doubt one of his finest performances,an Academy Award dosen't lie.Other than John Wayne however,the cast is my biggest issue with the film,none of the other actors come across as even slightly inspired,I really didn't think the actor that played LaBeouf suited the character one bit,but the worst casting decision was without a doubt Kim Darby,she put no life in to Mattie Ross,she just said her lines,mostly in a very irritating manner,also Mattie comes across as a strong independent character in the book,and she did absolutely nothing to convey that personality in this film,he was like a robot and is the Mai reason why I give this movie a seven and not an eight.I would recommend the remake over this without a doubt,I don't think Jeff Bridges is as good as John Wayne was as Cogburn but still does a great job and every other actor is a huge improvement over the actors in this movie (Hailee Steinfeld,Matt Damon,Josh Brolin,etc.).Despite a mostly very mediocre cast,True Grit is still a very enjoyable movie with a solid performance from Wayne and a well written turn from a book to a film. After her fathers death,Mattie Ross gets two men to join her to seek revenge against the man who killed him,Tom Chaney.
Cars is a great movie and I would say its one of Pixars most underrated movies,I got the DVD to watch it again because I haven't seen the movie seen it hit theaters in 2006,and I wanted to see it after I saw Cars 2,although I personally thought Cars 2 was actually better than the first one,they go to more places and there of a storyline and more fun car characters.Lightning McQuenn(Owen Wilson) is on his way to win The Piston Cup finals,but after he accidentally ends up in an old town called Radiatar Springs,he has to stay there until he fixes up there road.Although Lightning starts making good friends with the people there,especially a tow truck called Mater (Larry The Cable Guy) and Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) and falls in love with a female Porsa called Sally (Bonnie Hunt).
The Lego Movie is a fantastic movie with a very well written and well developed storyline with a very impressive voice cast and charming characters.The movie was hilarious,for both kids and adults and without a doubt one of the finest family comedies I've seen in years.The voice cast really seemed interested in this script,my favourites have to be Morgan Freeman,Will Ferrell and Liam Neeson,also Chris Pratt and Elizabeth Banks did a great job and Will Arnett did a great comedic impression of Batman.This movie also got the rights to show several well known characters,including DC,Star Wars and Lord of the Rings ,among many others,and I was very impressed by this,we haven't seen this many characters owned by different studios since Who Framed Roger Rabbit.The films animation is also beautiful and extremely original,it isn't really made with Lego,but it certainly looked like it,and I was very impressed by that.The Lego Movie is filled with fun and laughter from start to finish and I would highly recommend it as a family film,people of all ages will enjoy After Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) is accidentally believed to be the legendary master builder who will save the whole universe,he heads on a huge adventure with some unlikely characters to stop President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell) from getting rid of all creativity.If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Meet The Fockers is a brilliant comedy with a terrific storyline,a great cast and characters,plenty of very funny scenes and a lot of cringe moments that make this such an enjoyable sequel that make it just as good as the original.The movie is very underrated by critics,and I don't understand why,it has so much funny scenes,it keeps the characters in the same personality as they had been before,it has just as much cringe moments that make you feel sorry for Ben Stillers character,I enjoy these movies and want them to make more just as long as Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro will be in more,because the dialogue between them is terrific and makes it so much more fun,and the edition of Dustin Hoffman makes it even better.Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) are engaged and its time for Jack (Robert De Niro) and Dina (Blythe Danner) to meet Gregs parents.Things aren't going very well for Greg,as his parents (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand) are very personal and mention a lot of things that make Jack unimpressed,and do a bit of investigating on the man who wants to marry his daughter.
Guardians of the Galaxy is a fantastic movie with an extremely well developed storyline and an outstanding cast that are able to be both serious and comedic actors.This movie is easily one of Marvels best movies yet,it is hilarious,action packed and also at times very sweet,the soundtrack is probably one of the best I've seen in any movie,it had me humming along to several different songs throughout.Chris Pratt is outstanding as Peter Quill,this man seemed like he was stuck being a supporting character in comedies for the rest of his career,but that is all going to change completely after this movie,Zoe Saldana and surprisingly Dave Bautista also deliver great performances and Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel's voice work is fantastic,Rocket was definitely my favourite character.James Gunn,a relatively unknown director,got to make this movie,Marvel took a chance on him and it ended up working perfectly and I hope he returns to direct the many sequels this movie deserves,I want to see more from these characters.Guardians of the Galaxy is a unique new superhero movie and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or sci-fi. After the discovery of a powerful orb,Peter Quill must team up with four other outlaws to protect it from getting in to the wrong hands. Best Performance: Chris Pratt Worst Performance: Gregg HenryIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Rocky 3 is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. I really enjoyed this movie and found it very enjoyable for a third movie,and thought it was a lot better than the second one,because that felt like too much of a repeat of the first Rocky,this one was much more original because we got to see Rocky become a very well known boxer and see him take on a different opponent as well,who was very well acted by Mr. T,also I felt this movie contained more character development which is important in a movie.It certainly isn't the golden movie the first Rocky,but fans should still appreciate and enjoy Rocky 3. A defeated Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is trained by his old challenger Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) for a rematch against Clubber Lang (Mr. T).
The Longest Yard is a great movie with a decent story line and a cast that never forgets its characters.I find this movie to be very underrated by critics,I think its a lot of fun,with plenty of laugh out loud scenes and one of Adam Sandlers greatest performances,I'm not a big fan of him and I know he has done some horrible movies,but I thought he did well with this movie,and the addition of Chris Rock makes it even better.I haven't seen the original Longest Yard,so I cant compare the two movies to each other,but as a standalone comedy,I think The Longest Yard is a lot of fun.When ex-football player Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) is put into prison,he is assigned to coach the prisoners in a big football game against the guards.
American Beauty is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.When I first heard about this movie it sounded very basic,a father goes through a mid-life crisis,a subject many films and television series have focused on before,but American Beauty does it in a very different way,we are taken inside the mind of Lester Burnham,we can see exactly what dark thoughts go through his mind and how his passion for his daughters friend develops.Kevin Spacey delivers a truly magnificent performance,he really became this character and put himself in to his shoes in order to truly understand what this man was going through so he could deliver a convincing act,and he went on to win his second Academy Award,and I would say he deserved this even more than his win for Usual Suspects.I liked that the movie didn't just revolve around Lester,we also get to see how the different man he is becoming is affecting his wife and daughter,we get to see how they are changing as well in very dark and negative ways.I feel like everyone can relate to these characters in a way,obviously not as extreme as them,but we have all had times when we craved more excitement than our life delivers,and I think that this is why Lester is such a captivating character,because despite not wanting to,we can definitely relate to him to a certain degree.Dark and somewhat twisted,I would definitely recommend American Beauty to anyone looking for a good drama. A father becomes disillusioned and begins to hunger more excitement in his life.Best Performance: Kevin Spacey Worst Performance: Peter GallagherIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Ugly Truth is a brutal movie with a really stupid storyline that was clearly placed together for comedy but is not at all funny,and most of the jokes in this movie are incredibly sexist to both genders,that what they relied on as being funny for the whole movie,get one gender to insult the opposite gender.While I have liked Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler in previous movies i've seen them in,I just couldn't enjoy them in this,especially Butler's character,he was just irritating and not one bit funny,he's a great serious actor,and he clearly was only in this for the money.All the Ugly Truth wants to be is a comedy and heartwarming,unfortunately in fails on both levels,so I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.A man who seems to know everything about how relationships work,helps out a news producer struggling with her love life,by teaching her what men want in a woman.
The Inbetweeners Movie is a terrific movie, a heartwarming storyline and a brilliant goodbye to Will,Simon,Jay and Neil,although I still think the show is better,although the kind of emotional stuff you see in this movie is something you would never see in the series.The fours boys are finished there school days and the celebrate they all go off on holiday to Malia,but the four are all depressed over there relationship status,Will is a virgin and all he wants is a proper relationship,Simon was dumped by his girlfriend Carli and is in deep depression and things get worse when it turns out she is gone on holidays to the same place with her new boyfriend,Jay has been single for a while but doesn't care much about what he gets and Neil is getting up to a lot of stuff with different women around the town when his girlfriend back home also breaks up with him.
The Matrix Revolutions is a decent movie with a good storyline and a great cast,although they all seem a lot less inspired than they did in the previous two Matrix films.The movie is certainly a disappointing ending to the trilogy,although Matrix Reloaded wasn't great either,it ended with such a great set up for what could have been a fantastic conclusion,but it was just mediocre at best.Both Matrix sequels came out in 2003,which means that they were obviously working on them at the same time,I think if they focused on the movies separately it would have been so much better,maybe just as good as the first one.There isn't a awful lot of Neo in this movie either,not until the end at least,which was a big mistake,Neo is the main character and making so much of it not focus on him was a bad choice.The Matrix Revolutions has its moments,but it's overall a disappointment,but you should still watch it only if you want to finish the trilogy. The human city of Zion defends itself against the invasion of the machines.Neo fights to end the war between man and machine.Best Performance: Laurence Fishburne Worst Performance: Tanveer K.

The Call is a terrible movie with a really promising storyline that could have been so much better storyline and I was very disappointed by how it all turned out.Halle Berry did do a very good job,but the script didn't developed her character enough,in fact we don't get to learn an awful lot about any of the main characters,it definitely needed more time to learn about Berry's character and also the criminal Michael Foster.I was shocked and also really angry when the credits came up,it left way too many questions left unanswered and ended it a really stupid way that you wouldn't want or expect from these characters,the movie definitely should have been at least forty minutes longer.I don't know of the ending was setting the movie up for a sequel or wanting you to guess yourself,but either way,I was not impressed and it is probably the worst ending I have ever seen in a movie.The Call is a very good thriller for a while,but it gets worse as it goes on and I would not recommend it to anyone.A 911 phone operator is put through to a girl that has been kidnapped by an unknown serial killer try's as hard as she can to keep this girl safe in her unknown location.
The 40 Year Old Virgin is a fantastic movie with a well put together storyline by Judd Apatow and Steve Carell,a lot of laugh out loud scenes,a brilliant cast and even some surprising heart.Steve Carell is a fantastic actor who is both really funny but also well able to be more serious,with made him perfect to play this character,and Paul Rudd,Romany Malco and Seth Rogen all just add to that impressive comedic and dramatic acting.The movie is definitely one I would highly recommend to fans of Judd Apatow's films.Andy (Steve Carell),a 40 year old man who is still a virgin is pressured by his work buddies to finally do it,but he may have found the woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with.
Hot Tub Time Machine is a great movie with a ridiculous but very funny storyline and a very comedic cast.I mostly enjoyed Craig Robinson in this movie,he isn't a very well known actor,but I really like him in everything i've seen him in,he's a good actor and also very funny,I also really enjoyed John Cusack,i've only seen him in serious roles in the past and I was surprised that he was so good at delivering a funny performance in this.Chevy Chase did a great job in this,but he needed to be in it a lot more,when you manage to get a comedy actor as big as this in your movie,you need to give them more screen time.I was also surprised with the heart in this movie,I thought it would be an American Pie type of comedy,but it was actually very heartwarming at times and I got really attached to these characters.Fans of very goofy comedies will definitely enjoy this movie and will be laughing out loud.Four discontented men are taken back to the 1980's by a hot tub in their hotel suite,and they must be careful not to change anything before the repairman (Chevy Chase) can get the hot tub working again.
The Imitation Game is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It has a very powerful story that is told in the deep and serious tone that it should be, I honestly never knew about Alan Turing before I saw this, but after watching it I think everyone else should, he is a brave man who saved millions of lives and dosen't receive the credit he deserves, there should be documentaries about him, he should be on history books. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers the performance of his career in this, I've always been a fan of him but I never expected to see him act as stunning as he does here, every line of dialogue he blurts is powerful and you can tell he really means it, hopefully he will get more great roles like this in the future. Dramatic and uplifting, the Imitation Game is an outstanding film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good biography film or drama. Alan Turing, a mathematician, tries to break the enigma code with the assistance of several other gifted mathematicians in order to shorten the Second World War. Best Performance: Benedict Cumberbatch Worst Performance: Mark Strong If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Donnie Brasco is a fantastic movie with a very well thought out and clever story line and a very talented cast.Johnny Depp and Al Pacino both did a fantastic job and you can tell they both know each other well as there is great chemistry between each other in this movie.I found that the story kind of dragged out a bit and that the direction was a bit depressing but it is still very enjoyable.If you are a fan of mafia movies like The Godfather or Goodfellas,I would definitely recommend you see this movie.An undercover agent (Johnny Depp) starts to bond with Lefty (Al Pacino),a mob boss,and his role as a gangster starts to become more than just an undercover disguise.
Ali is a brilliant movie with a very well written and well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.Will Smith does a fantastic job portraying boxing legend Muhammed Ali and was without a doubt perfect casting,I honestly didn't think a character like this would suit him,even though he is without a doubt one of my favourite actors of all time,I just thought his personality didn't seem like one that could pull off playing Muhammed Ali,but I was wrong,I should never have doubted him,he clearly studied this mans history and really became him,it is really hard to believe watching this movie that that is actually Will Smith.I was also concerned that there would be too many fight scenes and not enough story development,but that also was not a problem,there were several fight scenes,but they were put in at very necessary times and were great while they lasted.Ali is a fantastic movie tad to would recommend to all fans of Will Smith and biography films.Biography of the famous boxing champion Muhammed Ali (Will Smith) as we look at the early beginnings of his career,forward to his rising popularity.Best Performance: Will Smith Worst Performance: Mykelti WilliamsonIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant cast.The movie is breathtaking from start to finish,it seemed very risky to make a prequel to this franchise,especially after the disappointing remake,but it ended up to go beyond expectations.The visual effects are absolutely beautiful,it really is so hard to believe these monkeys aren't real,they look so life like and the expressions and moment in their faces are so realistic.Rise of the Planet Apes is one of the most impressive prequels there is,I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great drama or sci-fi,and fans of the previous films will certainly be impressed.

Dirty Dancing is a great movie with a good storyline and some really great performances.The story is nothing outstanding,it's very basic and easy to follow,but it sets the movie up for some great music and absolutely outstanding dancing from both Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze,the ending is certainly the best part as they dance extremely professionally to "I've Had the Time of My Life".Besides the dancing,the acting in this movie is also pretty solid,Grey and Swayze also deliver the best performances of course,and despite the fact that Jennifer Grey didn't want to work with Patrick Swayze,the two still seemed to have had great chemistry.Its storyline is nothing breathtaking but the dancing definitely is,so I would recommend Dirty Dancing to anyone looking for a good music or romance film. A 17 year old from a wealthy family learns a lot about life and falls in love with a hotels dance instructor during a family summer holiday.Best Performance: Jennifer Grey Worst Performance: Kelly BishopIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Van Helsing is a mediocre movie with a decent storyline and a good cast.The movie is certainly a disappointed,a Van Helsing movie with Hugh Jackman in the title role immediately sounds like a great new franchise,but unfortunately so many aspects of this movie were done wrong.I felt like the writers just tried to throw in any famous horror characters they could think of,from Dracula,Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein,it would have been so much better if it just focused on Dracula,and certainly would have been better without that ridiculous werewolf side story.The CGI in this film is very unrealistic,you could tell these characters were animated and it didn't feel like they were communicating with the real actors at all.Also the humour isn't very subtle in this movie,I also appreciate a bit of comedy in an action movie but it was too common in this and was rarely genuinely funny,the character of Carl was definitely only there for comic relief,but I didn't laugh at a single thing he said.Van Helsing has its moments,but is overall not a very good movie that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. The Vatican's star monster hunter is sent to Transylvania to help a princess find and kill Dracula.Best Performance: Hugh Jackman Worst Performance: David WenhamIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Escape from Alcatraz is a fantastic movie with a really well written storyline that is based on a true story and told perfectly in a true way instead of in a more movie like style,it gives you a really good idea of what life was like for prisoners of Alcatraz and how impossible it was to escape,and we learn how Frank Morris slowly digs his way out and becomes the only man to ever escape.Clint Eastwood puts ion a perfect performance like he always does,this role was very different for him and he did a brilliant job,the other actors all did a great realistic job as both prisoners and guards of Alcatraz.I would highly recommend Escape from Alcatraz to all fans of crime and history movies,it educates you about this true story in a very realistic and entertaining way.Based on the true story of Frank Morris (Clint Eastwood),a criminal sent to Alcatraz,as we follow his almost impossible escape.
Caddyshack is a hilarious movie with a laugh out loud story from start to finish and a terrific comedic cast that are usually in good movies.Chevey Chase and Rodney Dangerfield were both brilliant,but I thought Bill Murrays part as Carl was the best,he was stupid and hilarious for every part he was in,every scene hes in,mostly he is talking to himself,which shows how funny he is,he doesn't even need other people around him.The jokes in this movie are so memorable,it reminds me of movies like Airplane,where its a laugh from start to finish and the story isn't very serious.A very exclusive golf club is in trouble as there new wealthy member is causing trouble and a destructive gopher is destroying the entire area.
Broken City is a decent movie with an average storyline and a good cast that sadly don't deliver as well as they could have.The film lacks any bit of originality to make it enjoyable, it follows a very safe and formulaic story,which makes it very underwhelming as basically every move the characters make is predictable.I felt like it could have been better if the actors put more energy in to their performances,no one really seemed that interested,as far as I know,Mark Wahlberg only wanted to produce this film and didn't want to play this character,and it really shows in his acting,Russell Crowe was the only person that seemed to be really enjoying his role and getting sucked in to the character. Predictable and fairly boring,Broken City has its moments and its certainly not an awful movie,but it simply isn't interesting enough to recommend. A struggling private eye accepts a lucrative job from New York's mayor.Best Performance: Russell Crowe Worst Performance: Barry PepperIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The X-Files is a great movie with a well developed storyline with a talented cast.I have never seen a single episode of the television series and decided to watch this movie when I saw that it was on TV,I was afraid that I wouldn't set a lot of it since I haven't watched the series,but it was clearly written so people who don't watch the series could still understand what was going on.The two main actors,Derek Duchovney and Gillian Anderson,are the best part of this movie,they both suit their characters extremely well and you can tell with the on screen chemistry that they were use to working with each other from the series.I think fans of the series will probably still enjoy it very much,but people who haven't seen the X-Files can still definitely watch the movie,and I would recommend as a good sci-fi and mystery.Mulder and Scully get caught up in a worldwide conspiracy that could change the future of mankind.
Coach Cater is an amazing,inspiring movie with a great storyline,cast,emotion and even some humor.Samuel L. Jacksons title character Coach Ken Carter is terrific and I have seen many films with him in it,because he is in so much,but none with him as into the character as he is in this,he was in character from start to finish.Coach Carter will inspire students struggling in school with some amazing speeches and characters that improve on there subjects and other things outside of school along the way.A new coach trains a high school basketball team,he is very strict but just wants them to do well,he stops letting them play until they improve on there subjects and prove they are worthy.
Thor is a brilliant movie with a great storyline and a very talented cast that all suit their characters perfectly.It isn't Marvel's greatest work,but I found it nowhere near disappointing,Chris Hemsworth was the perfect choice for Thor,and I also really liked Natalie Portman,a very attractive and talented actress,and Tom Hiddleston performance as Loki is very inspired.I really liked the references to other Marvel character references,especially the scene where Agent Coulson is asked if a machine was 'one of Stark's guys' and he replies that Tony Stark never tells him anything,and I also liked Stan Lee and Samuel L Jackson's cameo.Thor is a must see for all Marvel fans.After causing a war on his planet Asgard,Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is sent away by his powerful father Odin (Anthony Hopkins).His brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) takes over the throne Thor was meant to have,only to go mad with his power and go against his family and friends.
The Mask is a great movie with a very insane and enjoyable storyline with a really good comedic cast.Its not my favourite Jim Carrey performance,but it is without a doubt one of his most memorable,it really showed just what a wacky and fun actor he really is,and thats why he is one of my favourite comedy actors.The best parts of the movie is without a doubt whenever Carrey has the mask on,its a perfect mix of animation and live action,all these scenes are really exaggerated and very funny,simply impossible not to enjoy.I also really liked Cameron Diaz in this,it was her first film and it really showed the world that she was both a talented,funny and of course very attractive actress.The Mask is without a doubt a must see for all fans of Jim Carrey.When Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) discovers a mask that transforms him into insane superhero,he uses it for his own fun,and to impress Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz),but gets in some big trouble with the law along the way.
Blazing Saddles is a fantastic movie with a very well written and hilarious storyline with an outstanding comedic cast.The movie is a pure Mel Brooks film and definitely some of his finest work.The film was definitely a risky one for its time,topics such as slaves and the KKK were still very much a sensitive subject and it surprises me a movie like this was even released in 1974,but it is a hilarious comedy and became a big hit that year despite its risky storyline.I loved the use of breaking the fourth wall in this film,Mel Brooks always tends to go overboard when he breaks the fourth wall and this is no exception,especially towards the end of the film when the characters crash a set for a different film and even go to a movie theatre to see Blazing Saddles,the joke certainly went too far but that's what made it hilarious.Blazing Saddles is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good western or comedy.In order to take down a peaceful western town,a political boss hires a black man as the towns new sheriff knowing it will cause a lot of tension for this racist community.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a terrific movie with a great story,fantastic cast,brilliant characters and plenty of violence,maybe a bit too much violence for a sensitive viewer.It is without a doubt some of Quentin Tarantino's finest work,with an outstanding performance from Uma Thurman,who seemed to be in to her crazy,insane,revenge seeking character The Bride all the way through.I think basically everyone who was part of this movie was interested in it,there's no wonder the movie was so long that they had to break it up in to two parts.The Bride (Uma Thurman),a master assassin,is out seeking to kill a man she has a great history with,however,Bill has sent out many people to get her,but they myth have no chance against her as she seeks her revenge.
Hollywoodland is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a talented cast.The movie isn't extremely exciting or thrilling,but it is an interesting story,I much preferred the parts that were a biography of George Reeves life over the investigation scenes,the detective scenes were quite slow but Reeves life story was fast paced and very interesting.Ben Affleck did a great job as George Reeves on this film,a lot of people complain about him as an actor,but I think he's really good and I don't feel like he's "just acting",I truly believed he was Reeves,his personality was nothing like the way you would see Affleck on interviews.I wasn't very happy with the ending of the film,although I understood why they did it,it still annoyed me.Hollywoodland can be very slow,but it's still quite enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good biography film or drama.

The Aviator is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding,very professional cast.There was clearly an awful lot if money out in to making this movie and it really shows,the movie is beautifully filmed,you can tell that Martin Scorsese was really interested in the life of Howard Hughes and went through so much effort to make this.I wasn't sure about Leonardo DiCaprio playing Hughes,he seems like a person that should be played by a more wacky actor,but DiCaprio succeeded beyond my expectations,he was extremely wacky as Hughes,and did a great job going from a snobby billionaire to an absolute psychopath later on in the movie,he really does have amazing range.Cate Blanchett also delivered an outstanding performance Katharine Hepburn,she is one of the greatest actresses in Hollywood at the moment and definitely deserved her Academy Award for this film,especially if you read in the trivia the amount of preparation she went through.The Aviator is an outstanding film that I would recommend to all moviegoers. Biopic that follows the early years of fussy film director and aviator Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio),a man who always dreamed about the future.Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio Worst Performance: Alec Baldwin If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
High Crimes is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast.I was expecting it to be more of a thriller,which it certainly wasn't,but it was still an enjoyable movie,mainly because of solid performances and very great character development,the movie does drag out a bit however and isn't completely interesting the whole time.Morgan Freeman was certainly the movies highlight,he delivered a brilliant performance like he always does and his character is certainly the most likable,Ashley Judd also did a terrific job,I've complained about her acting before in Kiss the Girls,but she had certainly improved between the gap of these movies and the character was more suited for her.The thing that bothered me the most about this movie is that the "big twist " at the end was really predictable,the writers were clearly expecting it to shock the audience but it was obvious this would happen about a half hour in to the film.Predictable but still enjoyable,High Crimes is a good movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good crime film. A woman must uncover national security secrets to clear her husband,accused of war crimes in El Salvador.Best Performance: Morgan Freeman Worst Performance: Jim CaviezelIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Honey I Blew Up The Kid is a decent family movie with an average story line.The movie will definitely entertain a younger audience,but adults watching this movie with their kids will probably be bored,although I will say it isn't a horrible family film,its not the best,but its not the worst.The original,Honey I Shrunk The Kids,is definitely a much better movie for the whole family to watch.Honey I Blew Up The Kid will appeal to very young children,but the older audience will be bored,and fans of Honey I Shrunk The Kids will be disappointed by this sequel.Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) gets himself into another very difficult situation when a new experiment causes his youngest child keep growing more and more stories tall.
The Pink Panther is a brilliant,laugh out loud comedy movie with plenty of cringe-worthy,hilarious scenes to entertain people of all ages and every member of the family.This movie has a very big legacy,because it spawned it to more than 10 films after,including two more up to date versions starring Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau (extremely underrated),and its also the first appearance of the wildly known cartoon character,The Pink Panther,who went on to star it hundreds of cartoons because of how popular he proved to be in the opening for this movie.Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) investigates on catching The Phantom,Charles Lytton (David Niven),a professional jewel thief who is acting right under Clouseaus nose.Meanwhile,Clouseaus wife Simone Clouseau (Capucine) is having an affair with a man who is Charles son,George Lytton (Robert Wagner),Clouseau nearly catches them in the act several times,but has no clue.
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is a great movie with a very well put together family friendly storyline with a great cast.If you enjoyed the first Home Alone,if not better.Its certainly more exciting because the characters go all around New York rather than staying at the house the whole time.Macauley Culkin is great as usual,he was a very good actor for his age and I also really appreciated Tim Curry,I really enjoy the creepy tone of voice he can put on and it really suited the character.The worst part about the movie and the only real problem I had was Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern,as much as I liked them in the first,they were just thrown in to this one randomly and just happened to be in the same city as Kevin,it gets even more ridiculous towards the end when Kevin try's to stop them from robbing a toy store,the two are just getting injured over and over again for about twenty minutes with very little dialogue,I like both if these actors,but I didn't appreciate them in this movie and think it would have been better not having them in it.If you enjoyed the first Home Alone then you will certainly enjoy Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,it's fun for the whole family. Kevin ends up in a swish New York hotel while his family are in Florida,but meanwhile the two burglars he defeated before plan to rob a toy store
Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows-Part 2,is a fantastic film,simply brilliant,I couldn't think of a better way to end a trilogy like the way they ended it in this,i'm not a gigantic Harry Potter fan,i never read any of the books apart from Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince,but I have seen all the movies and I would have to say this is the best of all of them.Harry,Ron and Hermione continue the quest for all three of the Horcroxes,Hogwarts is in danger and the lives of everyone,its all up to Harry to save the day,and have one last battle with Voldermort.*****
Die Hard 2 is a good movie with a dent story line,a good cast and some great characters.The movie is the first sequel to Die Hard,it is nowhere near as good as the original,like all the other sequel's,it is impossible to live up to what the original gave us,one of the greatest,if not the greatest action movies of all time,so fans of the original will be disappointed by this sequel,however Bruce Willis is back again as John McClane,while the movie isn't as good,hes a great as ever.Two years after the events of Die Hard,rogue military officials take over an airport in Washington,luckily John McClane (Bruce Willis) is at the same airport.
Reservoir Dogs is a terrific more with a well thought out story filled with twists and plenty of violence,also with some great characters,who's cast fit them perfectly,my biggest credit for the cast would have to go to Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi,who just seemed in to there characters all the way through.The movie is the very first movie that Quentin Tarantino directed,and like all his other movies to follow,it is incredibly violent,especially the scene when they're singing Stuck In The Middle With You while killing someone,its as entertaining,as it is disgusting and almost hard to look at.After a gang on the other side of the law have a bad jewelery heist,they begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant,but the only question is,who could it be?
The Terminal is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.I have certainly come to expect better from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks,both easily some of the most talented men in Hollywood,and if their previous work together (Saving Private Ryan and Catch Me If You Can) is any indication,this movie should have been a classic,and I understand that they were taking a risk and were doing a very unique movie,it just didn't turn out as well as it could have.Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones scenes together are certainly the movies highlights,there is great chemistry between them and seeing Tom Hanks deliver one of his most unique performances was fun to watch.I felt the movie could have been better with a funnier script,it had many funny parts,but for a film that is considered a comedy,it is very dramatic.Nothing outstanding but still an enjoyable two hours,I would recommend the Terminal if you ever see it on television and are looking for a decent comedy or drama,but don't go out of your way to see it. Victor Navorski (Tom Hanks) has to live in an airport terminal after there is a coup in his Eastern European home country while he's visiting New York.Best Performance: Tom Hanks Worst Performance: Diego LunaIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Casablanca is a great,heartwarming film with a fantastic storyline and a very talented and inspired cast.Although I do find that this film is a bit overrated,it's still a great film and it definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1942.Humphrey Bogart plays a terrific role and I would say his performance is one of the best in film history.There are also many memorable line's in this movie that I would still hear quoted today.I have seen this movie a handful of time's,and the more I see it the more I enjoy it,probably because I am getting more mature.Casablanca is a movie that all fan's of film must see someday. Set during the early day's of the second World War,people from America are shipped to Casablanca in Africa.Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) meet's a former love interest,IIsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and the two begin falling for each other all over again.
Saw 3 is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a so-so cast,some actors deliver great performance but others were quite weak.The film certainly isn't as good as the first or second Saw and the story isn't as captivating,but its still a very enjoyable movie,filled with plenty of frightening scenes and lots of thrills.Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith are certainly the best actors in this film,they both deliver very terrifying performances,however I think Bahar Soomekh and Angus Macfadyen were not very professional,although Jeff's story was very well written.Saw 3 is certainly a disappointment compared go the first two but I would still recommend that fans check it out and to anyone looking for a decent horror.John Kramer (Tobin Bell) kidnaps a doctor to give him a free operation to keep him alive,while his Jigsaw counterpart puts a man through a dreadful test involving his dead son.
Fast Five is a fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline that continues right were the fourth Fast & Furious left off.The cast are all brilliant as usual,but a lot of credit for making this the best Fast & Furious yet has to go to the addition of Dwayne Johnson,his performance as Luke Hobbs was outstanding,he was intimidating and scary and he suited the role perfectly.This one is certainly for action packed than the previous four and a much more exciting story to it as well.Fans of the previous Fast & Furious and fans of action movies in general will love Fast & Furious Five.Dominic (Vin Diesel) escapes from prison with the help of Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) and they all become wanted criminals.Dominic plans a heist with a bunch of lose friends to win back their freedom.
Fight Club is a fantastic movie with an extremely good story line,a largely inspired cast,and terrific characters.Brad Pitts performance as Tyler Durden is one of the greatest movie performances I've ever seen,and the twist at the end makes this character even better.Its definitely a movie you will have to give full attention to,because if your doing something else you'll get distracted and get very confused with whats going on.A depressed man (played by Edward Norton) life changes when he mets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and they start Fight Club,a club where men fight each other to cure their boredom.
Carrie is a mediocre movie with a promising storyline that could have been done better and a talented cast that deserved more than this.My main problem with this movie is that it is very slow for the first hour and ten minutes,but there is a constant atmosphere that it is building up to something huge and terrifying,and once that scene we were waiting for finally comes,it is very uneventful,the last twenty minutes or so are brutally filmed and almost appear like stop motion was used to make these characters be blown away by Carrie's power.I have not seen the original Carrie so I can't compare them,but I'm sure I speak for fans of the first as well when I say Chloe Grace Moretz was not a good casting choice,she was fine while we were watching Carrie being a shy and awkward girl,but once Carrie unleashes her dark side that's when Moretz starts to fall flat,she is suppose to be scary in this scene but even covered in blood,I can't take the sweet girl from Hugo very seriously as an iconic horror character.Julianne Moore's performance was outstanding and without a doubt the best part of the movie,she really was able to deliver the dark,creepy personality that was intended for this character,she didn't seem any bit shy or awkward about doing certain scenes,she just completely became her character and this film could have benefited with more of her.Carrie is not as horrifying as it could have been and the majority of it is simply boring,and I think you would be better off avoiding it.A shy and very awkward girl,who is rejected by school mates and sheltered from the real world by her mother,unleashes her true demons at her prom night after she is pushed too far. Best Performance: Julianne Moore Worst Performance: Alex RussellIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Worlds End is a great movie with a very well developed storyline with a brilliant comedic cast.The film is the finale of the Cornetto trilogy,the other two being Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz,and while I certainly think this one is the weakest of the trilogy,it still is a lot of fun with the type of humour we've come to expect from Simon Pegg,Nick Frost and Edgar Wright.Simon Peggs character Gary King is certainly one of the funniest characters he has played to date,in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz his character was the voice of reason,both in this he plays a hilarious character who is beyond stupid and will do anything to get his pint.The Worlds End is a very enjoyable movie that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great comedy or sci-fi. A group of friends reunite to finish a pub crawl they attempted 20 years ago,but unexpectedly get involved with extraterrestrial machines.

The Hangover Part 2 is a great movie with a great storyline,cast,characters and some very funny scenes.I think it is a great sequel that lives up to the first one and find it to be very underrated by critics,although it is definitely not better than the first.However it borrows too much from the original.There's still a wedding,a bachelor party,and still has Phil,Stu and Alan waking up the next morning having no memory of the following night,it seems to be a darker version of the original.However,I still thought it was great,I can never say no to these characters,there simply hilarious and I would be happy to see Zach Galifanakis,Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper play them when their sixty,I love it that much.Stu is getting married in Thailand.Stu,Phil,Alan,Doug and Stu's soon to be wife's brother go on a bachelor party the night before the wedding.They wake up the next morning in Bangkok,with no memory of the following night,and the brother is missing.Once again they must retrace their steps before the big day.
Funny People is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic comedy cast that also do a really good job in scenes when they need to be more dramatic.It's another very well written comedy drama from Judd Apotow,which features a career turn for Adam Sandler,he takes a break from goofy comedies to play a character who really develops as we see him start off as a very pompous character and soon learns from his mistakes and becomes a better man,George Simmons is certainly one of the best performances of his career and without a doubt the character I had the most sympathy for out of everyone he's ever played.Seth Rogen also played a very normal character who I had the most sympathy for,partly because I am a huge fan of Rogen but also because I could really relate to him at times,particularly the awkward situations he was in and the way he just smiles when he can't think of anything to say.The film does bring in some great laughs as well of course,a lot of scenes had me in stitches and there are some quotable lines also.A serious story that still manages to bring in laughs,Funny People is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or drama. When a rich comedian finds out he has leukemia,he reconsiders his life,helped by an aspiring comedian.Best Performance: Adam Sandler Worst Performance: Eric Bana If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Bad Boys is a great movie with a great storyline,great action and a fantastic cast.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith did a fantastic job as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery.However,I think that Will Smith should have had a Mainer role than Martin Lawrence,because hes a bigger actor and has appeared in much better movies than Martin Lawrence,for example,while Will Smith was busy with Men In Black,Martin Lawrence was busy with Big Mommas House.Its probably the best movie directed by Michael Bay,a director that has disappointed people with his movies many times before,particularly with his Transformers franchise,which he is currently making a fourth installment of with a completely new cast.Two detectives,Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence),protect a woman who has witnessed a murder in Mikes apartment,along with her two dogs,while they both investigate a case of stolen heroine.
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a talented cast.I know a lot of people would disagree with me,but I actually like it more than the first Sherlock Holmes,I thought the actors seemed more confident in their roles and I liked seeing the characters go beyond their hometown.I still haven't gotten use to Guy Ritchie directing this,I just don't think his directing style suits this franchise,there are certain scenes in both movies where I feel it would have looked so much better had it been made by someone else.Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a very impressive sequel that I think fans of the first one will definitely be impressed with.The detective tries to link his greatest adversary to a series of crimes including bombing and murders.Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr. Worst Performance: Stephen FryIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Source Code is a fantastic movie with an extremely well thought out story line and an inspired cast.The whole plot to the movie was a very clever idea,and not at all a cliché story line that anyone could come up with.This is my first time seeing Jake Gyllenhaal in a movie before,and my first impression of him is good,I always thought he seemed like an average actor,but after seeing him in this I can see he is actually a really good and talented actor.The movie is very short,but it manages to fit in a much action as it possibly can in that short time.Definitely a movie that both sci-fi and action fans will enjoy.An soldier wakes up,for unknown reasons,in another mans body,and discovers he is part of a mission to stop a bomb that has been put on a train to Chicago.
Training Day is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a very inspired cast.Denzel Washington's performance as Alonzo Harris,and definitely deserved his Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role,he put all his heart in to this very strong character and many of his lines in this movie are extremely memorable and quotable.Etan Hawke also delivered a great performance and it was very interesting being put in to the very hard day this character was having,not really understanding what was going on and slowly realizing that these people are not what they may have seemed.I would definitely recommend Training Day to all fans of crime dramas and Denzel Washington. The story of a rookie cops tough first day of training in an elite LAPD narcotics squad.
A Perfect World is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.I was really expecting this to be a very thrilling crime movie,but it was very much a drama that follows an escaped convict who kidnaps a child that soon makes him change his way.Kevin Costner does an outstanding job portraying this criminal,and the relationship between him and the young child is so sweet and sentimental that it is very hard to believe they are just acting,Clint Eastwood's directing in this is absolutely brilliant.The movie is still very much a thriller as well though,there are some very intense scenes and the characters dialogue is very dramatic and well delivered.Surprisingly sweet and a very easy story to get sucked in to,A Perfect World is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or crime film. An escaped prisoner becomes attached to the boy he kidnaps while on the run from Texas Rangers.Best Performance: Kevin Costner Worst Performance: Ray McKinnonIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Saving Private Ryan is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,an outstanding cast and inspired characters.The cast in this movie are all fantastic,but of course the best performance is the leading role,Tom Hanks,one of the greatest actors of all time,and if you liked him in previous films hes been in,you'll love him in this,he plays Captain Miller with great passion from start to finish,and this movies also one of Steven Spielbergs finest directing jobs,the movie looks magnificent,fifteen years later and it still looks great.Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and several other soldiers are sent out during the war to find Private Ryan (Matt Damon) who's three brothers were killed in battle.
The Dark Knight Rises is brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.This movie is a very pleasing finale to Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy,and I think all fans will be pleased,it's not as good as the Dark Knight,which would have been hard to accomplish anyway,but it's not far off it,Tom Hardy was certainly a great new villain with many,very memorable quotes that I can easily see myself repeating for just as long as I did with the Joker,they are both brilliantly written and truly unforgetful characters.The usual cast,including some new members (Anne Hathaway,Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are all in great form and this fantastic cast is one of the main reasons why these are without a doubt the best Batman movies to date,they all suit their roles perfectly and deliver terrific performances.Fans will without a doubt be impressed with this very pleasing finale,and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or thriller. After eight years,Bruce Wayne returns as Batman,dealing with new a foe who is looking to destroy Gotham.

The Hurricane is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. The performances are really what make this movie, the majority of the credit going to Denzel Washington of course, who truly became Rubin Carter, you can see it in the dramatic scenes, the boxing scenes, it is very clear throughout that he understood and really felt for this man's story. I don't feel like the script really took enough risks, which is probably my biggest issue, it felt very safe about how they told this story, there was very little bits that took us out of the story, and we learn very little about Carters life outside of his boxing career and his trouble with crime, I simply thought it would have been better if it had parts that took us away from the story, something most dramas have. Sincere performances and a very intriguing story, I would recommend the Hurricane to anyone looking for a good drama or biography film. After a boxer is wrongly imprisoned for murder, his autobiography motivates a teenager to campaign for him.

Hotel Transylvania is a pretty good movie with an enjoyable story,some entertaining characters,funny scenes for both adults and kids and a great voice cast.While the movie will definitely appeal to kids more than adults,there are still some scenes that adults will find funny and kids wont get.The movies cast is great,especially the people who starred in Grown Ups,together as good friends in this,Adam Sandler,Kevin James,Steve Buscemi and David Spade.I also enjoyed Andy Samberg,Selena Gomez and Cee Loo Green.Count Dracula protects his daughter and hismonster family in a hotel out where a human is unlikely find it.But on her 118th birthday,his daughter Mavis wants to see the world.Dracula wont let her,but she is old enough to make her own decisions,things get worse when a human arrives at the hotel.
Back To The Fture Part Two is a brilliant movie with a great,extremely well thought out story,amazing characters and a solid cast,this sequels stays true to its characters and wont disappoint fans of the original.The story is more difficult to understand compared to the first,but as long as your paying attention all the way through,you will understand it perfectly.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Llyod are back and as good as ever as Marty McFly and Doctor Emmet Brown,and if you enjoyed them in the first one,you'll love them in this.Fans of the first Back to the Future shouldn't be disappointed.After Marty McFly and Doc Brown visit 2015,Marty must re-visit 1955 to prevent many changes in 1985,but he must avoid himself from his previous visit.
Rush Hour is a great movie with a well written storyline and a very talented comedic cast.The movie is filled with a ton of hilarious scenes from start to finish,most of that coming from Chris Tucker,who apparently improves most of his lines,which is so impressive because there hilarious most of the time.Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan make a great team,Tucker is the comedic person and Chan is the action star,it's a great combination and it also helped that the two seemed to really enjoy making this movie together.Rush Hour is a hilarious movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or action.A marital arts expert cop and hapless LAPD detective must retrieve the kidnapped daughter of a diplomat.Best Performance: Chris Tucker Worst Performance: Ken Leung If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
There Will Be Blood is a fantastic movie with a very well written and well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.The character development is also top notch,especially for the main character,Daniel Plainview,you go on a long journey with this character for two and a half hours and the characters whole story is very well written.It is without a doubt one of Daniel Day-Lewis's greatest characters,he puts all his heart and soul in to this role and well deserved his Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role,you wouldn't even believe it is actually him.The only think that really bothered me is that the title is very off putting,it makes it sound like it will be a very violent intense movie,which it really isn't,I got why it was called There Will be Blood toward the end,but as you're watching it you expecting a lot of violence and war to eventually break out in some way,which dosen't happen.There Will be Blood is a great drama that I would recommend to all moviegoers. Set in early 20th century Texas,Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis),a self made tycoon,will stop at nothing to expand his empire.
Spider-Man is a terrific film,the Spider man trilogy (Spider Man,Spider Man 2 and Spider Man) is truly Marvel at their best,although I'm not so sure how the reboot coming next year is gonna be,there starting all over again with a new actor that totally wont replace Tobey Maguire and there calling it The Amazing Spider Man,maybe it could be good but definitely not as good.Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a spider during a field trip that gives him super spider powers and his personality starts to change,he becomes more confident less of a nerd,and his life long love Mary Jane starts to notice him,but when he decides to use his powers for good as Spider-Man,his new enemy is The Green Goblin,who is actually his best friend Harrys (James Franco)father.
Bad Grandpa is a great movie with a pretty good storyline and really good performances from those who are acting.Most of the movie is hidden camera as Johnny Knoxville playing an old man is communicating with real people who have no idea they are being filmed for a movie,this works out really well and most of the scenes are full of cringe and it is impossible not to laugh.Johnny Knoxville does a very good job as Irving Zisman,he really got interested in this character and it wasn't until I saw a sign that said Knoxville towards the end of the movie that I had completely forgotten it was Knoxville,he puts on a voice very similar to Stan Lee's and play's a really convincing and strange old man from start to finish.The grandson Jackson Nicoll does a very good job as well,I found his comic timing very impressive for a boy his age.I am not a fan of Jackass but I really enjoyed this movie,though I think Jackass fans will enjoy it,it's different enough for people outside the Jackass audience to enjoy,because the humour isn't just watching people get hurt and there is also a storyline.I would recommend Bad Grandpa to anyone who enjoys hidden camera comedies and just comedy in general.When his daughter is sent to jail,Irving Zisman (Johnny Knoxville) takes his grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) on a road trip across the country to take him to his irresponsible father.They get up to some crazy antics around complete strangers along the way.Best Performance: Johnny Knoxville Worst Performance: Georgina CatesIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Clear and Present Danger is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.Harrison Ford returns as Jack Ryan for a second outing,and it's more intense and a lot more action than we saw in Patriot Games,Ford clearly still enjoyed playing Ryan and it shows in his performance.Anne Archer also returns as Jack Ryan's wife Cathy,and I find her as annoying as i did in Patriot Games,I haven't seen her in anything else and I know she's suppose to be a very good actress in other things,but I find her characters dialogue and just the way Archer delivers them very irritating and just unrealistic.Clear and Present Danger is action packed and very intense and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or thriller. After a close friend of the president of the United States is murdered,Jack Ryan gets involved in a war against a powerful drug cartel. Best Performance: Harrison Ford Worst Performance: Anne ArcherIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Marley And Me is a brilliant movie with a fantastic story line and a brilliant cast.The movie is very funny,but also very emotional,especially at the end,but I wont spoil it for anyone reading this who hasn't seen it.Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston both delivered very impressive performances,their roles where funny and dramatic.If you love movies with a lot of heart,and dogs,you will definitely love this movie.Goes true the lives of John and Jenny (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston) as they go through their marriage and their pet Labrador Marley always manages to be their biggest problem.-DILLON HARRIS
Shaun of the Dead is a brilliant movie with a fantastic storyline and a surprisingly impressive comedic cast.It is Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's first movie and they give a very good first impression,their characters were both hilarious in this movie and they were also very impressive as actors.I was also very impressed with Lucy Davis,I didn't think she would be able to deliver a performance like she did in this,because I only knew her from the Office.The movie is said to be a romantic horror comedy,but I would only count it as a comedy,the zombies are more funny than scary and the romance isn't very intense,its more comedic.Fans of British comedies like Spaced,will definitely love Shaun of the Dead.When his town has turned into zombies,Shaun (Simon Pegg) does his best to protect his ex-girlfriend,his mother and his best friend,while trying to make it to his favourite pub.
The Interview is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. I wasn't sure if I was ever going to get to see this movie, and was very grateful that I finally got to experience one of the most controversial films ever made on the big screen, it kept me laughing all the way through and there were some things done that I simply couldn't believe. Controversy aside, it is a genuinely clever comedy that features several cameos from unlikely celebrities that were well able to laugh at themselves. Seth Rogen and James Franco both shine in the lead roles as they always do, I love seeing these two together, it is so clear they are good friends and that makes their performances and the things that they do so much better. This movie does certainly have flaws, its biggest issue was that it repeated jokes too often (ie Firework,Lord of the Rings references), I'll admit this was unnecessary, but you can easily look past it. Many people were disappointed by this but I think that it is simply because they were expecting so much more because of the drama surrounding it, but at the end of the day, it is a Seth Rogen comedy that dosen't shy away too much from movies like Neighbors and This is the End, I think people will look back at it in a few years time and appreciate how cleverly written and risky it really is. I can definitely see why it was so controversial, and that is what made it so funny, the fact that is was nearly banned forever made it even more enjoyable and I would recommend the Interview to anyone looking for a good comedy or adventure.I would like to see these characters again. After a talk show host is given a massive opportunity to interview the dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, himself and his producer are assigned by the CIA to assassinate him.

The Simpsons Movie is a fantastic film,its very well put together and its very funny and beautifully animated,there are loads of memorable scenes in this movie for example,Bart skateboarding naked around Springfield and Homer singing 'Spider Pig' while getting pig footprints on the ceiling.The movie is brilliant and if your a huge fan of the show like me,you'll love it,it will not disappoint.Marge worries about what Grampa says at church after having a religious breakdown,the main things Marge gets stuck in her head is 'Twisted Tail-A Thousand Eyes-Trapped Forever'.Little did Springfield realize is he turned to be right and,beginning with Homer getting a pet pig and throwing a silo of the pigs droppings into lake Springfield,the town gets covered by a giant dome,now its up to Homer Simpson to save the town.
Toy Story 2 is a great movie with a great storyline,characters,cast,some very funny scenes and great fun for the whole family.The Toy Story movies never fail,I think its Pixars best movies and I hope they continue to make more,I would see a fourth,a fifth and so on.Although I think Toy Story 2 is the weakest in the series (I prefer Toy Story and Toy Story 3),its still a fantastic sequel and I'm sure many people think its the best of the three.Woody is kidnapped by a toy store owner who takes him at a garage sale Andys mom had even though he knew he wasn't for sale,he takes him because the toy is worth a lot of money.Buzz Lightyear and the gang go to save him while Woody meets a gang of toys he gets along very well with who are characters in a TV show Woody was the star of.
Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is an alright movie with a storyline that could have been so much better,but a cast that does its best nonetheless.A lot of it is hard to understand if like me you haven't played the game,because the movie just gets straight to the point,you don't get to learn about Lara's origins and don't learn much more over the course of the film.Angelina Jolie definitely suited the character as she is a very talented and attractive actress.My biggest problem with the movie is that's there is way too much action scenes that go on for too long and there isn't enough effort being made at telling a story.Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is a fun action movie,but it isn't much more than that,I wouldn't highly recommend it,but if you want something quick and easy to watch,it's not bad.Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) must battle a secret society in order to get her hands on a priceless artifact that controls time.
Robocop 3 is a brutal disaster,it is without a doubt the worst of the three Robocop's,and thats saying a lot comparing it to the also terrible Robocop 2.I thought the movie began promising,and I thought it seemed better than the second Robocop,but as soon as I saw Robert John Burke as Robocop I knew I was going to hate it,I never knew until I saw this that Peter Weller wasn't in it,and this guy was a terrible replacement,he made no effort to sound any bit similar to the original Robocop.Peter Weller was the only I liked about the second one,and thats what made this movie so terrible,at least they killed off Nancy Allen's character,I never liked her in it,her acting is amazingly terrible and was happy that she wasn't in this very much,but her acting for the beginning of the movie was probably even worse than she was in the first two.If you enjoyed the first Robocop,leave it at that,the sequels are both humiliating,their boring,predictable,too long and the cast are really uninspired,they made me question why I liked the first one.Do not bother with Robocop 2 or 3,trust me,even if you didn't see the first one and have nothing to compare it too,its still terrible.Robocop is completely fixed and takes on a large group that are looking to evict people from Detroit.
The Ides of March is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.I certainly enjoyed this movie,but I will admit,with it's very impressive cast and story matter I was expecting a bit more,my main problem is that it was just too short,it was only one hour and forty minutes but it easily could have been two and a half hours,I would really have liked to see George Clooney and Ryan Goslings characters develop a lot more,as well as Paul Giamatti and Phillip Seymour Hoffman's characters,it all felt a bit too rushed.The films script is very impressive and is a clever take on presidential elections,George Clooney hasn't directed that many movies but he has proved that he really can direct,he takes a step back in this as a supporting actor and lets Ryan Gosling be the star.Political and dramatic but definitely could have been longer,the Ides of March is an enjoyable movie that I would still recommend to anyone looking for a good drama film. As the campaign to choose Democratic presidential candidate ensues,an enthusiastic young staffer learns a harsh lesson about politics.

The Rock is a fantastic movie with a very well written and developed storyline with a star studded and talented cast.The movie is without a doubt my favourite film from Michael Bay,I enjoy him as a director most of his films are usually very cliché action movies with too much action and not enough story,but this is a perfect mix of both.Sean Connery's performance as John Patrick Mason is easily my favourite in any Michael Bay film,he is a fantastic actor a delivers a brilliant performance to a character that is very different for him.I'm not a huge fan of Nicolas Cage,but thought he did a pretty good job in this,and I really enjoyed Ed Harris as a very unique villain,he is able to play any type of character.Fans of action and Michael Bay films will definitely enjoy the Rock.When a group of military men held a bunch of tourists hostage in Alcatraz and create a gas attack that will destroy all of San Francisco,the faith of everyone is put in to the hands of a former Alcatraz prisoner and a chemical weapons specialists.
The Wolf of Wall Street is a fantastic movie with a extremely well written and well developed storyline,an outstanding cast and very impressive character development.The film is nothing you would ever expect Martin Scorsese or Leonardo DiCaprio to do, the film is in all ways filthy and has an 18 rating for a reason,but I think exploring these dark themes and not leaving any think out captured the true story of Jordan Belfort in a much more impressive way,it took you deep in to his life in an intense but also realistic manner,and I honestly think it is without a doubt one of Leonardo DiCaprio 'a finest performances.There isn't a single performance in this movie I didn't enjoy or appreciated,every gives it their all.Jonah Hill's performance was definitely the funniest,and his character is the most quotable and he has also shown the world that he can do more serious films and can go beyond comedies like Superbad or 21 Jump Street.Margot Robbie was also one of the best actors on this film,she is very new to film but she didn't seem even slightly nervous,she is a very promising young actress who has a great career ahead of her,and is of course very attractive.Matthew McConaughey also does a great job, I've never been very fond of him as an actor but he has been proving that he really can act lately,he is in this movie for a very short time,but it's one of the best few minutes of the whole film,and I would have loved to have seen more of Mark Hanna,it says on the trivia that Hanna spent 2 more years working with Belfort,sadly that didn't happen on this film,which I think would have been great to give McConaughey more screen time,his performance once outstanding.Wolf of Wall Street is a outstanding movie that I would recommend to all moviegoers,the only really problem I have is that none of the characters were likable,but it suited the tone of the movie to do that.Follows the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) as we see his rise to power in Wall Street as he turns in to a corrupt criminal with a massive drug problem.
Back To The Future Part Three is a fantastic movie with an amazing story line,terrific characters and a great cast.Fans of the previous two installments wont be too disappointed,I do think that the previous two are better,but this is still terrific,especially for a third installment,but I just found the the previous two,jumping around from past,present and future,more interesting and exciting than the Wild West heme in this,but its still very enjoyable with a good Western parody and wraps up the trilogy perfectly,you wont be wishing they made a fourth one,because they started and finished this trilogy too well to take any chances with a new version.Back to the Future is definitely the weakest of the trilogy,but its still both an exciting and pleasing conclusion.Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travels back in time to 1885,where his friend Doctor Emmet Brown (Christopher Llyod) is enjoying a more peaceful wild west atmosphere there,but Marty must save him,because judging by his gravestone that Marty discovered in 1955,he will be shot and killed in one week.
Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment is a pretty bad movie with very little story,its mainly just the comedy cops goofing around for the entire with one uninspired joke after another.There were some bits that had me laughing,most of them by Steve Guttenberg's character,but this is a very brutal sequel that was clearly only made to make more money,the first Police Academy wasn't that good to begin with,so it was clearly only money why they wanted to make more of them.Police Academy 2 is basically just one joke after another and makes very little effort with an actual story,even if you enjoyed the first Police Academy,you probably should avoid this one.Now graduated and official members of the police force,the cops are given their first assignment,the toughest precinct in town.
Shakespeare in Love is a great movie with a well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.I had this recorded for quite some time but I was reluctant to watch it,although I was aware it was a Best Picture winner,I thought you would have to be seriously interested in William Shakespeare to enjoy this movie,and that it would require some knowledge of the way they spoke back then,but it really didn't,the story is easy to follow,we get to learn enough about Shakespeare before we get to the main plot,without giving us too much knowledge,and the way the characters speak is easy for a general audience to understand while still being as fashioned old as it can possibly be.The chemistry between Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes was absolutely incredible and without a doubt the movies highlight,the lines they deliver to each other is very passionate and intense,something many actors would get shy and awkward about,but the two of them deliver these lines in pure confidence without any hesitation,and Paltrow definitely deserved the Academy Award for her performance.An interesting tale and some very inspired performances,I would recommend Shakespeare in Love to anyone looking for a good drama or romance. William Shakespeare is struggling with writers block before a woman disguised as an actor becomes his muse.Best Performance: Gwyneth Paltrow Worst Performance: Steven O'DonnellIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Empire of the Sun is a fantastic with a very well written and developed storyline and an outstanding and very dramatic cast.Its Steven Spielberg's first serious war film and while it isn't and good as the war related films he's given in more recent years (Schindlers List,Saving Private Ryan,etc.), it still is a great start for a director who has proved he can direct several different types of genres.The film cast is very professional, it's Christian Bale first big movie,he is very young in this movie and inexperienced but that dosen't show in this film,he delivers a very impressive performance,and that also goes for John Malcovich,another amazing actor,this being one if his earliest films.Fans of war films and Steven Spielberg definitely wouldn't want to miss Empire of the Sun. Story of a young boy who is forced to grow up quickly in a Japanese prisoner of war camp during World War 2.
The Soloist is a brutal movie with a poorly written storyline and a very promising cast that sadly failed to deliver.This films story and its powerful leads seemed like an easily enjoyable two hours for me,but sadly it was actually quite the opposite.It wanted to be an uplifting drama that inspired people grateful for what they have and also feel sympathy for these characters,I think it failed on both of those levels,it tries to be uplifting and inspiring much too early on in the movie,and struggles even more throughout.Robert Downey Jrs performance is not terrible,although he was certainly the movies highlight,but I was thoroughly disappointed by Jamie Foxx.He is easily one of the most talented actors in Hollywood at the moment,but fails to show any of his skills in this movie,to play a character like this Foxx needed to do his research in order to play a truly convincing man who is struggling with his mental health,but it is made very clear that Foxx didn't do this,he said his lines,and went home with his pay cheque,very disappointed by him.All in all,the Soloist is a disappointing drama with characters that I simply didn't care about and I would not recommend it to anyone. An LA journalist befriends a homeless musician and begins writing a regular column on him.Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr. Worst Performance: Jamie Foxx If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Big is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline with a talented cast.The film is one of Tom Hanks earliest movies and his first movie that he received an Academy Award nomination for and rightfully so as his performance is so inspired,he plays a thirteen year old boy in a thirty year old mans body and it is believable from start to finish that he is a young boy,he does a pitch perfect impression of a child and it is also so hilarious.The movie is certainly funny,but it is also very heartwarming and emotional,the ending is one of the hardest scenes for me to watch in any movie,I find it so emotional.Big is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or film to watch with the whole family.After a boy wishes to be bigger,he wakes up the next morning to discover he is now a grown man.He decides to head to New York to take advantage of his new independence.Best Performance: Tom Hanks Worst Performance: Mercedes Ruehl If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Smurfs is a fun and enjoyable family film,the animation and the humor is both terrific,it will have both kids and adults laughing,especially with the terrific acting of Neil Patrick Harris as Patrick Winslow and The Simpsons Hank Azaria as Gargamel,Gargamel was a terrific character in the film especially with his cat Azrael,unlike the cartoon series were Gargamel is nothing more than a bad guy.Six Smurfs,Papa,Clumsy,Brainy,Grouchy,Gutsy and Smurfette (voiced by Katy Perry),get lost in New York after they go through a portal that leads them to New York City while trying to escape Gargamel and his cat Azrael after Clumsy Smurf leads them to Smurf village,as the group of six are stuck,they live with a couple,Patrick Winslow (Neil Patrick Harris),who isn't one bit happy with the Smurfs living with them, and Grace Winslow (Jayma Mays) who finds the little blue creatures adorable,and the Smurfs wont be able to get back to the Village and escape Gargamel until a Blue Moon,which is very unlikely.
Hot Shots Part Deux is a better than average movie with a alright story line and a great cast.Its definitely not better than the original Hot Shots,but its not an awful sequel.People who where fans of the first might be disappointed,but I didn't have very high hopes because I wasn't a huge fan of the first,but its definitely not as good as the first,I just found it to be a movie to just laugh at,but still misses a lot,its not as good as movies like Airplane or The Naked Gun.Fans of the first Hot Shots will probably be disappointed,but will probably still laugh at many scenes.Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) returns,this time in a parody of Rambo as he is the leader of a team in heading to Iraq to rescue a soldier who has been kidnapped.
The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift is a below average movie that does not live up to the previous Fast And Furious movies.The movie has pretty much nothing to do with the previous movies,its set in Tokyo and the cast is completely different,and their all very uninspired performances,the only thing that gave me a bit of relief was Vin Diesel's brief cameo.I don't even want to know what they where thinking when they decided to make a Fast and Furious 3 with a completely different cast.Thankfully the regular cast returns in the fourth and I think they realize that this franchise needs Vin Diesel and Paul Walker to stay alive,hopefully they wont make that mistake again.Fans of the previous two Fast and Furious and fans of action movies in general should avoid this.After committing another crime and being forced to move in with his father in Tokyo,Sean Boswell (Lucas Black)becomes a popular figure in Tokyo's drift racing.
The Muppet Movie is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline that is sweet,very funny and filled with lovable characters.The film is packed with a ton of fun and laughs that the whole family will enjoy and also has many beautiful music numbers,of course the Rainbow Connection is a great song.The movie is the first of the many films starring the Muppets that follow,they are great films that have never failed to entertain me and bring me joy. The film is also packed with many well known celebrity cameos,and all of them are gold,my favourite would have to be Mel Brooks.Fans of the Muppet Show should definitely watch and will love the Muppet Movie.Kermit recalls how he decided to try and make it big in Hollywood and how he met all his friends who end up coming with him along the way.
Date Movie is a horrible movie with a story that doesn't really go anywhere,although I will admit it makes a better effort than movies like Epic Movie and Disaster Movie,it's only that and that I like Alyson Hannigan are the only reasons I'm didn't give this one out of ten.Other than that,this movie is awful,one of my least favourite things about it is Jennifer Coolidge,an actress that really annoys me that plays an even more annoying version of Barbra Streisands character in Meet The Focker.Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan) loses a tone of weight to look good for a man she plans to marry,but has to meet his weird parents and ex-wife,who still wants him.
Prisoners is a fantastic movie with a very well developed and well written storyline that is beautifully filmed with an outstanding cast that deliver extremely inspired and dedicated performances.It is without a doubt,in my own opinion,the best acting I have ever seen from both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal,not that they were ever bad actors but I never expected this level of high quality acting from either of them,especially Jackman,scenes like when he's roaring at Paul Dano trying to get him to say where his daughters are,are so intense and dramatic and it's all because of how dedicated Jackman was,and the fact that he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for his performance upsets me,he was absolutely outstanding.The story is really unpredictable and will keep you wondering all the way through,the ending.which I won't spoil,is the kind of ending I don't like when most films do it,but it suited this movie and I thought it was a clever move that I actually really liked.Prisoners is an outstanding movie that should have been nominated for several Academy Awards,and I would recommend to all moviegoers,especially fans of drama and thrillers.A dedicated father will do anything he can to find his missing daughter,while the police are only finding more leads to the kidnapping.Best Performance: Hugh Jackman Worst Performance: David DastmalchianIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Changeling is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a talented cast.It is easily the best performance that I've ever seen Angelina Jolie deliver,I've never seen a movie where she dosen't seem like herself in some way,I can always see a lot of Jolie in her acting,that she isn't full committing to her character.In this however,Jolie has completely became this character,it helps that,her being a mother,lets her know what a situation like this would be like for her,and it makes for a dazzling performance.It is some of the most impressive directing work I've seen from Clint Eastwood,which is saying a lot because he is a fantastic director,but there are so many shots that look absolutely beautiful and tricky to film,he did a superb job.The film got a bit less interesting in the middle which was a small issue for me,the first and final forty minutes are terrific,but half way through I felt it dragged on a little and was a bit too detailed with some slightly unnecessary information. Beautifully filmed and acted, Changeling is a delight for moviegoers and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or mystery. In 1920s Los Angeles,a mother is reunited with her missing son but she claims that he is an impostor.Best Performance: Angelina Jolie Worst Performance: Colm FeoreIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Towering Inferno is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a very professional cast.The movie is without a doubt one of the most memorable disaster movies out there,it is beautifully filmed and for a movie that came out in 1974 it still really holds up today.The best performances without a doubt come from Paul Newman and Steve McQueen,two fantastic actors that were huge at the time and luckily got a chance to do a movie together,I preferred Newman's character,he was more likable and his performance was more inspired.The Towering Inferno is certainly a long movie,and it isn't exciting all the time,but it's still a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or thriller. A fire chief and an architect try to douse the blaze in a 325 story skyscraper where many are trapped.Best Performance: Paul Newman Worst Performance: Jennifer JonesIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
28 Weeks Later is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.I know a lot of people aren't going to agree with me,but I actually liked this movie a lot more than 28 Days Later,I just thought Danny Boyle's directing style wasn't very frightening for that type of movie,and he focused too much on the characters than he did horror,I have no problem with character development but when I'm watching a horror I'm not expecting too much of it,I was expecting a lot of zombies.When I saw 28 Days Later I kept expecting jump scares,but none ever really happened,in this there are plenty,the director was clearly more familiar with how to direct a horror,a lot scenes are very intense and of course very frightening.28 Weeks Later is a good movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a short and sweet horror or thriller. The UK begins to fight back against the blood crazed,virus infected hordes.Best Performance: Rosa Byrne Worst Performance: Mackintosh MuggletonIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Da Vinci Code is a brilliant movie with a really good,clever and unique storyline with a very impressive cast to follow through with this.The movie is extremely controversial and Dan Brown's beliefs will without a doubt offend anyone who is very religious.I don't belief any of the stuff in this movie,but I did find it very interesting,I believe in the Bible but I wouldn't consider myself a very religious person so I was very much able to watch this film and really enjoy it.Tom Hanks,Audrey Tautou and Ian McKellen are my favourite actors in this movie,they all delivered very impressive performances and Ron Howard did an incredible job directing this.If you are religious then I would definitely advice you don't watch this movie,but if you like mystery movies with very unique story lines then definitely watch the Da Vinci Code.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) work together to discover a secret hidden by a secret Chrsitian society for many years by gathering clues from famous paintings.
Star Wars: Episode 3- Revenge of the Sith is a fantastic movie with a brilliant storyline,a very strong cast and great characters and character development as well.It is highly regarded as the best of the prequel trilogy,I prefer Attack of the Clones,but I do see why people would prefer this,because it is all about what lead Anakin Skywalker to the dark side and there is no disappointment in it,its also sort of tragic,I didn't think I could ever feel bad for Vader.I still really don't like Hayden Christensen as Anakin but he does do a much better job in this than he did in Attack of the Clones.Revenge of the Sith is a very pleasing conclusion and I highly recommend it to all Star Wars fans,its still not better than any of the original Star Wars trilogy,but its really good.In the conclusion of Anakin Skywalker's journey towards the dark side,Chancellor Palpatine influences him to learn the ways of the dark side of the force when Padme is pregnant with Anakin's child.
Cars 2 is a great film with tons of laughs from start to finish,I don't see why people are judging it I thought it was good fresh sequel,I actually prefer it to the original Cars,there was more of a storyline and they go to way more place (the first Cars was pretty much just Piston Cup area and Radiater Springs) and a lot of action,I also enjoyed the new characters especially Finn McMissile,brilliantly voiced by Michael,also did anyone notice Joe Mantegnas character Grem sounds just like Fat Tony,the character he plays in The Simpsons.Lightning McQuenn (Owen Wilson) takes on the World Grand Prix along with his pit crew Luigi,Guido,Filmore, Sarge and his best pal Tow Mater(Larry The Cable Guy),although Mater is taken away from Lightnings races after he is mistaken for a spy a female spy named Holly Shiftwell,who Mater assumes is his girlfriend,along with Finn McMissile,they try to stop a Professor Z from using an Allinol oil that causes cars to crash during the Grand Prix race and could happen to Lightnng McQuenn,its up to Mater to save the day.
Mr Poppers Penguins is a fairly good heartwarming family film,although I would say I would have been very bored with the film if it weren't for Jim Carrey as Mr Popper and the humor able penguins all with a funny personality (especially Nimrod).After his father passes away,Mr Popper gets sent six penguins from him in the Antartic,One named Captain,Nimrod,Stinky,Lovey,Loudey and Bitey,which makes the man life a lot more diffucult,with his job and having to keep to penguins in his house without anyone around his apartment area finding out because it is illegal,although he starts to feel love for the penguins especially when it makes his son and his daughter like him a lot more.
Killer Joe is a mediocre movie with a decent storyline that definitely didn't deliver as well as it could have and a mostly average cast.There was definitely a good story here that could have made for an enjoyable crime thriller,but I think it made too many mistakes in order to do so.Matthew McConaughey is without a doubt the movies highlight and I would definitely have given this a lower rating if he wasn't in it,he delivers his lines in pure passion,and the last fifteen minutes was without a doubt some very professional acting from him,it's just a pity the rest of the cast couldn't deliver their dialogue with even half as much interest as McConaughey did.The best scenes are when we are reminded that this is a thriller,which there aren't enough of,but when we see it they are fairly intense and also quite gory,they definitely needed more of these parts because it was a bit too heavy on dialogue between characters that went on much longer than was really necessary.Killer Joe certainly has its moments and a very inspired performance from McConuaghey,but its mostly a mediocre ninety minutes that you would be better off avoiding. A man hires a dangerous hit man to kill his mother in order to collect the insurance,but the situation is a lot more complicated that he originally thought.

The Bone Collector is a great movie with a very exciting storyline that will keep you watching all the way through and very strong performances from both Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie.I find this movie very underrated,critics said it was a failed attempt at trying to be suspenseful,I completely disagree,I thought it did well at being thrilling but still carrying a strong story at the same time,and it's much better than some other thrillers i've recently seen.I haven't read the book,but after watching this movie I really would like to read it after watching this,because it is very clever at has a great twist.If you enjoy thrillers and murder mysteries you should enjoy the Bone Collector.Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington),a disabled forensics expert helps out the police to bring them on the trail of a serial killer in Manhatten.
Gremlins is a terrific movie with a great story,cast and characters,all made into a brilliant movie with a great script from Chris Columbus.Gremlins is without a doubt one of my favorite movies to watch with the family,although it probably isn't very much of a family movie,there are some very creepy,dark scenes in it,but I still watched it many times with family members of all ages.The movies rated PG but I wouldn't be surprised if it was rated 12.However,the gremlins are some very memorable characters,especially Gizmo,and that what makes it fun from the whole family to watch.A man buys his son,Billy,an usual creature you would not find in a pet store known as a gremlin for Christmas.The creature,which they name Gizmo,comes with some simple rules,the most important rule is to never feed it after midnight.Billy accidentally gives Gizmo water,which is another important rule,and he multiplies into several other gremlins.All the other gremlins expect for Gizmo eat after midnight and turn into dangerous creatures wreaking havoc around the town at Christmas eve,its up to Billy,with some help from his girlfriend Kste,his dog Barney and Gizmo,to put at stop to this.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a great movie with a pretty well developed storyline and a very impressive cast.The movie is definitely in not better than the Curse of the Black Pearl,and fans will probably be disappointed but it's still an enjoyable sequel and you won't be wishing you never saw.Johnny Depp is just as good as before as Captain Jack Sparrow,he is a very funny and unique character and without a doubt what made this franchise so popular.I didn't really feel like Orlando Bloom or Keira Knigtley's hearts were in their performances as much this time around but it didn't bother too much,but they definitely weren't as positive or energetic this time around.I did enjoy Bill Nighy as Davy Jones very much,I thought he was a very good and original addition to the series and he put in a great and sometimes frightening performance.Fans of the first Pirates of the Caribbean will definitely be disappointed,but Dead Man's Chest is still action packed and funny enough to be very enjoyable.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) heads on a journey with his crew to find Davy Jones heart to avoid becoming his slave, but he soon discovers he has many competition looking for the very same thing.
When Harry Met Sally is a brilliant movie with a very well written storyline and a very talented comedic cast.The movie is a very unique romantic comedy,probably my favourite one because the characters relationship is so realistic and they behave like real men and women instead of just a cliché romance film couple.The chemistry between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is outstanding and certainly the best part of this movie,Crystal's character is nothing like any male character you've seen in any romantic comedy before,he says things you'd never expect to hear in a movie but they are very true,also Meg Ryan's character is well developed and not just second best to Crystal's character,they wrote this movie so that both characters had equal importance and neither had more character development than the other.The movie certainly withstands the test of time and will for years to come because a relationship between a couple has always stayed the same and this movie is the most real towards that relationship.When Harry Met Sally is a great movie that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good romantic comedy,in my opinion,it's the best there is. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) first meet on a road trip to New York,they have a terrible time and don't meet each other again five years later.They keep running into each other and decide to become friends,although they fear they myth want to be more than just friends.

WALL-E is a great movie with another very well-developed and heartwarming storyline from Pixar and a very lovable title character.However,I do find this movie to be very overrated,it largely considered to be one of the greatest Pixar movies,it's probably one of my least favourites,I didn't find the characters as lovable as Toy Story,Monsters Inc,Incredibles,etc.It is a really great family film,but I definitely don't think it's Pixar's best and I feel the story gets a bit too serious for a children's film at times.I also didn't like how they put so much live-action bits in this movie,the musical's WALL-E watches didn't really bother me,but they should have made Fred Willard's character animated,it was just creepy seeing him in an animated movie.WALL-E is a great movie that the whole family will enjoy and it's also educational,but it's not the most entertaining Pixar movie there is.A small robot stuck alone on Earth ends up on a spaceship where the remaining population of the world are and causes a lot of drama when a plant he brings is discovered.
Insidious is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.The movie is certainly not as scary as I thought it was going to be,mainly because many people were recommending it to me and telling me I would be at the edge of my seat all the way through,but to be honest,whenever something scary was going to happen the music and atmosphere let you know it was coming and made you feel too ready to be scared.I did really appreciate that this movie was filmed a lot like an old school horror,the music is very Hitchcock-like and it relies on it's characters a lot instead of just a spooky atmosphere,certainly unique for the horrors of today.Its not an outstanding scary movie,but it is still at times quite thrilling and I would recommend Insidious to anyone looking for a good horror to kill some time.

Patriot Games is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.This movie is the second Jack Ryan film,the first being the Hunt for Red October,but don't worry about having to watch the other one first,these movies are similar to James Bond,where you don't have to watch one before the other,because they all connect.The first movie had Jack Ryan being played by Alec Baldwin,who I didn't think was clever casting and did not suit the character,which is why I was so delighted that they got Harrison Ford to replace him,he suits the role so much more and is clearly much more experienced in playing characters like this.Patriot Games is action packed and very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or drama.When Jack Ryan accidentally gets tangled up in an attempted IRA assassination,they are now on the hunt for Ryan and his family.

Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.Its definitely not the finest Jack Ryan film to date,but it's not the worst either,and it is certainly an improvement to the previous film,the Sum of All Fears.Chris Pine delivered a great performance as a young Jack Ryan,this movie sets it up for a new franchise and I hope to see Pine a few more times,as well as Keira Knightley and Kevin Costner.Its a short,action packed movie and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or thriller. A young Jack Ryan must put a stop to a group of Russians looking to destroy the US economy.

The Wedding Singer is a good movie with a good storyline and a great comedic cast.It certainly isn't Adam Sandlers finest movie,but it's not his worst either,there are several funny scenes throughout but there are also a lot of misses.This is the first movie to star Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore,and from the very first scene you can see and almost feel the amazing chemistry between them and it is certainly the movies highlight.The thing that bothered me the most about this movie is that it is set in the eighties but rarely makes reference to it (other than the music),it makes a small reference every now and again,like a mention of Dallas,to remind us it's set in the eighties,but I think it should have made constant references instead of just a few at times to remind the audience.There are some great cameos and they are certainly some of the funniest parts,particularity Steve Buscemi and Jon Lovitz's scenes.The Wedding Singer is nothing outstanding but it is very enjoyable and I would recommend it as a short and sweet comedy to watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. A waitress catches the eye of a wedding circuit singer who is distraught after being dumped at the alter of his own wedding.Best Performance: Adam Sandler Worst Performance: Matthew GlaveIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Matrix Reloaded is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a good cast.I was certainly disappointed by this movie as I was really looking forward to seeing the continuing adventures of Neo and his crew,and it was not even close to the entertainment the first one was,but the movie still definitely has its moments.There are still several action packed scenes,but there weren't as much as the first and they didn't feel as unique as they use to,which was a big problem with this movie,for me anyway.Keanu Reeves still delivers a great performance,I've given out about his acting in the past,and I still think he's a lifeless and uninspired actor,but he suits Neo so much and he continues to prove that in this movie,and of course Laurence Fishburne delivers another excellent performance as Morpheus.The Matrix Reloaded is certainly a disappointing sequel but I would still recommend it to fans of the first,and the ending with definitely make you anxious to see the third.Neo assumes commands of his powers as Zion falls under siege to the Machine Army.Only 72 hours separate the last human enslave from Sentinels programmed to destroy mankindBest Performance: Laurence Fishburne Worst Performance: Jada Pinkett SmithIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Fast and Furious 6 is a brilliant movie with a really well thought out and developed storyline and like the other movies,a very inspired cast.I didn't like it as much as Fast and Furious 5,but it is my second favourite in the franchise,after six movies their still going strong and are only improving with the cast and story.Dwayne Johnson is fantastic in this movie and I think he is one of the biggest reasons this one and the fifth are so great,he plays an even bigger role in this one and joins Dominic,Brian and the rest of the gang.The ending was probably the best part,I won't spoil it for anyone but it gave great potential for what will probably be a great seventh Fast and Furious,and for as long as Vin Diesel,Paul Walker and the rest of the cast agree to do them,i'll want to see more.Fans of the other Fast and Furious movies will be very pleased.Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) gets the help from Dominic (Vin Diesel) and Brian's (Paul Walker) crew to help track down a man who commands in several countries.
The Producers is a decent movie with an enjoyable storyline with a great cast that mostly play characters that they aren't suited for.Many,many lines are the exact same as the original Producers and I've seen the musical on stage before,which I found a lot more enjoyable than this because the songs are just simply more fun on stage.My favourite in this movie was certainly Will Ferrell,he is without a doubt one of my favourite comedy actors and he could have saved this movie if he was in it longer.I really did not enjoy Matthew Broderick as Leo Bloom,it was hard when you had to compare him to the fantastic performance from Gene Wilder in the original,but he also didn't seem interested in his lines,Nathan Lane and Uma Thurman did however deliver great performances as Max Bialystock and Ulla.The Producers is nothing close to outstanding,but you still may enjoy it if you're looking for a good musical,the songs are very catchy and memorable. A crooked Broadway producer co-opts a timid accountant to help him stage a play that is certain to flop.Best Performance: Will Ferrell Worst Performance: Matthew BroderickIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast.I haven't been a huge fan of some of the previous films I've seen by Wes Anderson,I understand that he is a very creative and unique film maker,but his directing style is just a little too weird for me,but it didn't bother me with this movie,it is just hilarious,looney and it never would have been this much fun had it not been for Wes Andersons very talented mind,it's certainly my favourite film I've seen from him to date and I will have to check out some more of his work.The cast is absolutely superb,with many of Andersons usual cast members as well as some new faces,but none of them manage to take the spotlight away from Ralph Fiennes,Mr Gustave is a very different character who I found absolutely charming,his dialogue was outstanding and I've never been so taken away by Fiennes as an actor before,certainly one of his finest characters and I couldn't imagine anyone else in this role,his dialogue with newcomer Tony Revolori was spectacular and one of the movies highlights,they worked together so well.I felt like the movie certainly could have been longer,it is very quick and fun which certainly wasn't an issue,but another forty minutes of this wouldn't have been a problem either.A very fun ride that never stops being interesting,there is certainly nothing like the Grand Budapest Hotel and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or adventure film. The adventures of a hotel concierge and his lobby boy as they take part in a battle for a family fortune after the robbery of a very rare painting.

Kingsman: The Secret Service is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast.It is a very fun ride,completely enjoyable from start to finish,jam packed with great action sequences,sincere hilarity and outstanding characters.The movie is very original,there truly isn't,nor do I think there ever will be,a film quite like it.Its certainly a parody of the spy genre but in a very different way,it's not quite like Naked Gun or Austin Powers,it's more of a tribute to old fashioned spy films like the Roger Moore Bonds.The cast is fantastic,and as this is a Matthew Vaughn (easily one of the most talented directors in Hollywood) film,there are many actors in unexpected roles,Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson have never done anything like this before,Firth is the slick,skillful super spy and Jackson is the villain who also provides a lot of comic relief,you wouldn't expect to see them in these roles,but they completely own it.Matthew Vaughn also likes getting very small actors in the main role,and he made a good choice with Taron Egerton,he is a very talented young actor who suited the role of Eggsy perfectly,and I hope to see more of him in the future.Hilarious,action packed and very,very different,Kingsman brought a smile to my face throughout and am so happy a film this insane exists,and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy. A spy organisation called Kingsman recruits a young man with little skill but a lot of promise,meanwhile,an evil genius plots to take over the world with a new smart phone.

Friends with Benefits is a good movie with a pretty well developed storyline and a fantastic comedic cast.I thought this would be exactly like No Strings Attached,and I really hated that movie so I wasn't going to bother watching this,but my friends told me it was much different and better,and while I didn't believe them I gave this a chance and I'm happy I did,it is much better and it isn't similar at all to No Strings Attached other than the set up of two friends having casual relations.I cared about these characters a lot and wanted them to get together,there was really great chemistry between Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake,and there are also hilarious cameos from great comedy actors such as Woody Harrelson,Andy Samberg.Emma Stone,Rashida Jones,Jason Segel,among others.My favourite part of the movie was Richard Jenkins,he delivered a great performance and the emotional addition of him struggling with Alzheimer's was a good idea and very sweet,I cared about him more than anyone else.It isn't anything outstanding,but it's funny and certainly a better than usual romantic comedy that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good one. Two friends who despise romance decide to add a bit of love making to their friendship without any complications.Best Performance: Richard Jenkins Worst Performance: Patricia Clarkson If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Fast And The Furious is a great movie with a pretty good storyline and a cast that stay interested in their characters from start to finish,and some great car chasing scenes.This movie is the first Fast And Furious movie,and it is still going today,it is a very hit and miss film series,but the fifth is definitely the best one yet,and everyone has very high hopes for the sixth.Vin Diesel is the breakout character in this,he plays his character Dominic with great passion from start to finish,its hard to believe they did the second and third without him (with the exception of a brief appearance in Tokyo Drift).Fans of action movies and cars will get a great kick out of this movie.An undercover cop gets involved with a gang of street racers in LA in order to bust a hijacking ring,but he soon becomes close friends with the racers.
North by Northwest is a brilliant movie with an extremely well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is over two hours long but it feels a lot shorter because it is filled with adventure and thrills from start to finish,there wasn't any stage were I felt like it was moving too slowly.Cary Grants performance was outstanding and one of his finest performances of his entire career,his love interest Eva Marie Saint is also a fantastic actress.Alfred Hitchcock does an excellent job directing this movie,it does contain many elements of a Hitchcock film and it is very much a thriller,but it is very different from movies like Dial M for Murder or Rear Window,it is probably one of his most unique films.An absolute classic that still holds up today,North by Northwest is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good adventure movie or thriller.

Phone Booth is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and breathtaking performance's from Colin Farrell,Forest Whitaker,Radha Mitchell and especially Kiefer Sutherland,I know we only hear him and can't see him,but his creepy voice was done so well and it was really convincing,I didn't even know it was him until the end credits,and I was very impressed with that.I was also really impressed that this movie was so thrilling all the way through,even though the entire movie is just Colin Farrell in a phone booth,I found it very impressive that it managed to be so entertaining.Fans of thrillers will really enjoy this movie.Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is forced to remain in a phone booth by a mysterious man talking to him on the phone that knows everything about him,and while shoot him the minute he walks out of the phone booth.
Alice in Wonderland is a really great movie with a very well developed storyline and a good voice cast as well.The movie is very quick and enjoyable,it isn't even ninety minutes long so it is not very time consuming,but it's a Disney classic that will be greatly remembered for many years to come.It is beautifully animated and still holds up very well even today,it is really colourful and I just got a very relaxed feeling as I watched it,it totally took me away from the real world,there are many unforgettable characters in this and it is certainly the best adaptation of this children's book.Fun for the whole family and a must see for animation lovers,I would recommend Alice in Wonderland to anyone looking for a good family film.

Once Upon A Time In America is a brilliant movie with a fantastic story line,an incredibly well acted cast and great characters.The movie was on television the other night,so I decided to watch it,so IA looked it up on this,and it said its two hours and nineteen minutes long,the one I was watching was definitely much longer,it went on for at least more than three hours,it must have been a directors cut or something.Robert De Niro did a brilliant job as usual,and so did James Woods.This is my first time seeing James Woods in a proper role,I had only previously seen him in cameo roles and the many voice overs he has done,IO never realised he is actually a fantastic actor who knows exactly what he is doing.The story of David Aaronson (Robert De Niro) who returns to Manhatten thirty years later to confront his past.We learn what happened thirty years ago,the rise and fall of Davids mafia,and what brought him back.
Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a brilliant movie with a very stupid storyline that is just so funny that it's almost impossible not to love,especially when the cast is the lovable Monty Python crew,Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Eric Idle,Michael Palin,Terry Jones,Terry Gilliam all do a fantastic job in this movie as usual,their characters are hilarious and everything about this movie is so entertaining.A lot of people would say Life of Brian,but I think this is the best Monty Python movie,there are just so much memorable scenes and quotes in this movie (knights of the round table,the killer rabbit,knights who say ni,etc),all the Python movies are hilarious,but I think this one is the funniest,hands down.Fans of Monty Python and people who just have good taste in comedy will love this movie and like myself will be able to watch it again and again and laugh just as much each time.King Arthur heads off on a journey with his knights to Camelot,but when he decides not to go to Camelot because 'it is a silly place',they go and seek the Holy Grail,but a lot of obstacles get in their way.
Zombieland is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a great and inspired cast and terrific characters.The cast of the movie are all extremely interested in their characters from start to finish,especially Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee.My favourite part of the entire movie was Bill Murray's cameo,and it wouldn't have bothered me if he was a main character in this movie,the writers clearly loved his work,and I've seen a lot of his movies,so I got all the references.Possibly the greatest movie cameo of all time.There is currently a series based on the movie,but I have yet to watch it,I don't think it looks that good,because I just cant picture these characters being played by anyone else.I don think it really needs one,but if a sequel is ever made,I will definitely see it.Columbus (Jesse Elsenberg) lives in a world that is ruined by zombies,he goes by his own rules to survive them as he trys to make it to Ohio,but makes some really friends along the way.
Knocked Up is a fantastic movie with a great storyline,a fantastic cast and some great characters,the movie is laugh out loud enjoyment from start to finish.The movie ha a lot of heart to it,as it shows Seth Rogensa character maturing as he prepares for being a father.I found the most enjoyable characters in the movie where Pete and Debbie,played by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann,two actors I always enjoy,and am looking forward to seeing there spin off movie,This Is 40.Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) gets a girl pregnant and trys to do his best to be supportive and to prove he could be a good father,but he is a bit caught up with his best friends at the same time.
Spider-Man 3 is a very mediocre movie with a a rather poorly written storyline compared to the previous two installments and a good cast that sadly just don't seem as inspired the third time around.The movies plot is all over the place,as we follow three different villains,and Peter Parker himself,which were easily the worst scenes to watch because Tobey Maguire just didn't seem like he wanted to do this movie,and it saddened me to see someone who brought so much joy to my childhood with the first two Spider-Man movies sink so low.None of the villains really did it for me,the Sandman was a good character but he was just thrown in to the script and what they did with him (ie making him have an involved in Uncle Ben's death) felt very forced,Topher Grace was awful casting as Venom,a really interesting villain that was sadly destroyed by his acting,I enjoyed James Francos scenes as the new Green Goblin the most but mainly because it brought me back to the previous movies.Spider-Man is my favourite superhero and I love every movie with him in it other than this one,but this is certainly a huge exception,Spider-Man 3 is a very disappointing final installments for the trilogy and you would be better off avoiding it. As he deals with new enemies and conflict with former friends,Spider-Man discovers a black entity that makes him behave very differently. Best Performance: J.K.

Max Payne is an awful,below average movie with a horribly written storyline that has little character development and gives the audience no reason to care about its characters.I know it is suppose to be a huge disappointment for fans of the video game franchise,but I haven't played the Max Payne games so I am just looking at this as a movie,but I understand why fans of a very successful and popular video game series would be disappointed with a movie that turned out very boring,I also felt like the movie was trying to remind the audience too often that it's based on a game because so many scenes looked like a game,which dosen't end up looking very good in a live action film.I like Mark Wahlberg,but his portrayal of Max Payne was just a very irritating performance and I'm sure fans of the games didn't appreciate his acting in this either.Despite some very well filmed action sequences,Max Payne is a boring movie with a bad plot and dull performances that I wouldn't recommend to anybody. Max Payne is a cop with Vengeance on his mind after his wife and child are brutally murdered by an unknown killer.Best Performance: Beau Bridges Worst Performance: Mark WahlbergIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Last Action Hero is a mediocre movie with an interesting and unique storyline and a cast that all sadly didn't work out as well as it should have. The concept of the movie seemed like a lot of fun, and while I will admit there were many parts that brought me genuine joy, there simply wasn't enough of it. The best parts was when the humour was very over the top and strange, such as Schwarzenegger playing himself in one scene and the animated cat, but there simply wasn't enough of this and it took itself too seriously at times for such a ridiculous film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is certainly the movies highlight, he has proved before with movies like Twins that he can do comedy, and his performance in this is no exception, his character made me laugh the most, as he was basically mocking the films he has done the most of, action, the child in the lead role, however, is very unlikeable. It has its moments, but the Last Action Hero had much more potential than what it delivers, because of this disappointment and its overlong run time, I simply can't recommend it. After being given a golden movie ticket, a young boy is sucked in to the universe of his favourite action film franchise.

Old School is a very funny movie with a great and different story line and a fantastic cast.Will Ferrell is great in this movie like he always is.Todd Phillips made this movie,long before The Hangover,and fans should really enjoy it,and pretty much everyone in their twenties loves the Hangover.I didn't like how they killed off Blue,I thought it was a dark turn that wasn't need,but other than that,Old School is a fun and light hearted comedy.Fans of both Will Ferrell and Todd Phillips should enjoy Old School,but not as much as some of their better known work.Three men sick of their adult life and all its challenges decide to relive their college days with students that are currently attending.
Role Models is a good movie with an enjoyable storyline and a great comedic cast.I did enjoy the movie, it had plenty of very funny scenes, but plenty of scenes that wern't do funny as well.I was honestly disappointed by this movie ,the cast was very promising, especially Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott,two hilarious actors together in what seemed like such a great set up, but it really just didn't live up to my expectations.Seann William Scott's character was definitely my favourite and I also really liked and Bobb'e J.Thompson's character was also one of the funniest.There are certainly several funny moments but also some not so funny moments,however , I would recommend Role Models to anyone looking for a fun comedy.Two irresponsible salesmen are priced to act as unlikely role models for two wayward kids.
Snatch is a brilliant movie with a really good and very original storyline and very talented cast.There wasn't very much to dislike about Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,but the stuff that was,Guy Ritchie improved on that with this.Jason Statham is great in this as usual,but the best performance and the best character in this movie had to go to Brad Pitt,his character was very different compared to his usual performances,and he was surprisingly really good at it,he did a great job with the 'not really English,not really irish accent' and his character was really funny,although impossible to understand at times.If you enjoy other films from Guy Ritchie's other films,you will definitely enjoy Snatch.Unscrupulous boxing promoters,violent bookmakers,a Russian gangster and incompetent amateur robbers fight to track down a priceless stolen diamond.
Singin' In The Rain is a fantastic movie that is quite funny,with great music and a nice story to it.Its largely considered one of the greatest films ever made and is well deserved with this honour.But it would not have gone anywhere without the fantastic acting of Gene Kelly,who would be my favourite actor of this era.But he doesn't deserve all the credit,Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds also did a fantastic job.The music is brilliant,especially Singin' In The Rain and Good' Mornin.Two big stars,Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are having a difficult time making a transition to sound.Don decides to start his first movie with sound along with his good friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor),and he met after saving him from his crazed fans,Katty Selden (Debbie Reynolds),who start to fall for each other.But the audience wants Don and Lina to be together.
Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End is a good movie with a great storyline although the plot does feel all over the place at times,it is without a doubt the worst of the franchise, but the cast make it better,especially Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.The movie was clearly originally suppose to be the final Pirates of the Caribbean,sand it is for most of the main cast members, including Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley,and the reason I felt like the plot was messy is because it seemed like they were trying too hard to wrap up the franchise instead of focusing on a new and original story,and they brought a lot back from the first and second one as well,Bill Nighy did a great job as Davy Jones in Dead Mans Chest but I really don't think it was necessary giving him such a main role in this movie.It certainly will disappoint fans,but At Worlds End is still a funny and action packed pirates adventure.As they intend on sailing past their maps,the pirate crew come across some people and locations they hoped they'd never see again for one big battle.
RV: Runaway Vacation is an awful movie with a terribly written storyline and a mostly good cast that deserved so much better than this.From the very first scene of the movie I was thinking it was going to be fun,Robin Williams was simply playing with his child and clearly improvising his lines,and it made me feel like this was going to be very enjoyable,and then every single scene after that was a disaster.The humour is ridiculous and not once (excluding the very first scene) did I laugh,it was too childish for anyone over the age of seven,and there is literally nothing funny in it for adults to enjoy.It sickens me that the late great Robin Williams is in this movie,because not even his likable personality could save it,Cheryl Hines and Jeff Daniels are two other great actors that made a huge mistake when they signed on to do this movie.Lacking a very little amount of fun that you would obviously want in a family movie and generally unlikeable characters,I would recommend RV: Runaway Vacation to absolutely nobody. Bob Munro (Robin Williams) and his dysfunctional family rent an RV for a road trip to the Colorado Rockies,where they have to contend with a bizarre community of campers.Best Performance: Robin Williams Worst Performance: Kristen ChenowethIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Kingpin is a funny movie with some laugh out loud scenes,a well thought out storyline and some pretty good actors,but I feel the movie goes on a bit,being two hours long and most animated films would only be an hour and a half,and find a lot of the humor to be a bit dry,not the Farrelly brothers finest work.A former bowler named Roy who hasn't bowled for over twenty years meets Ishmael,who is a natural bowler,Roy wants to get him to bowl for some professional games but it is hard to get him to take part because Ishmael is part of an Amish community,Roy eventually gets to Ishmael when pretends to be Amish himself.
Deck the Halls is a below average film with a storyline that dosen't really go anywhere and while it myth interest children under the age of seven,everyone else would be smart enough to understand this movie is terribly written and just not funny.While there is good chemistry between Mathew Broderick and Danny DeVito,two comedy actors I really enjoy, it dosen't make up for the poor dialogue and the complete lack of Christmas magic.I would not recommend Deck the Halls to anyone,certainly not as a movie to watch with the family at Christmas time,avoid this movie.A family man's peaceful Christmas plans with his family are ruined when their new neighbours intend on their Christmas lights to be literally visible from space.
Star Trek is a brilliant movie with a really well put together storyline that is action packed but at the same time focuses a lot on the characters as we meet the original Star Trek crew but at a much younger age.JJ Abrams did a fantastic job making this movie,the cast all match their characters perfectly,Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto both pulled off a fantastic performance as Kirk and Spock,but my favourite character in this was Scotty,I always found this character kind of boring,but Simon Pegg brought a lot of life and comedy in to the character,like he does in every movie he's in.I also loved seeing Leonard Nimoy in this,they put him in perfectly without him stealing too much scenes from the new cast (like in Star Trek Generations) but also had him in it enough that you didn't wish he had more screen time,he was perfectly put in this movie and the fans will without a doubt be pleased to see the man who really made this franchise famous.Fans of Star Trek will definitely be pleased with this movie a lot more than some previous film efforts,and at the same time people who aren't fans can still enjoy it without being confused.Explores Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock's (Zachary Quinto) early years as part of the Enterprise,during which they and the rest of the crew are hunted by a vengeful Romulan time traveler.
You,Me and Dupree is a very funny movie with a great cast and a good storyline.This movie isn't very well rated,especially on Rotten Tomatos where it only has 21%,I think its very underrated because I found some parts it the movie very funny with some cringe moments,like the part with the fire,that had me laughing out loud.Some moments in it reminded me of the Meet The Parents series,which I liked because I find them very funny.I really liked the films cast,especially Matt Dillon,Owen Wilson and Seth Rogen,I find them all great.Newlyweds,Molly (Kate Hudson) and Carl (Matt Dillon),a settling in there new house in the suburbs until Carl finds out that his best man,Dupree (Owen Wilson) is down on his luck and sleeping in a bar every night.Without Mollys permission,Carl lets Dupree move in with them.Dupree promises he will move out as soon as he gets a new job,which doesn't seem to be happening and Dupree overstays his welcome.
Adaptation is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. This film is very unusual, the way it is laid out, the way we are introduced to and follow the main characters and even the reason it got made is weird (look it up on the trivia). Charlie Kaufman was putting his entire career at risk when he wrote this script, as he was suppose to adapt a book in to a movie, but was struggling so much that he instead decided to write a script about him struggling to adapt a book in to a movie, and I think that is much better than how an actual Orchid Thief film would have turned out. Nicolas Cage delivers one of the finest performances in his career, it says in the trivia that he ignored all his acting instincts and did exactly as director Spike Jonze told him to, and this can be seen throughout the entire movie, there is always something very safe and fake about Cage's acting in the majority of his performances, but he is over the top and very sincere in both of his roles in this. Mind boggling, dramatic and even at times quite funny, I would recommend Adaptation to anyone looking for a good drama. A stressed screenwriter finds an unusual way to tackle writers block while attempting to turn a non-fiction book in to a film script.

Happy Gilmore is a good movie with a decent storyline and a good comedic cast.Its certainly not an outstanding comedy and not one I would be able to watch again and again,but it is enjoyable for a once off and it does have several funny scenes,most if then coming from the first half hour of the movie.Adam Sandler is certainly a lot of fun to watch in this and is really enthusiastic and full of energy,it's one if his best comedies to date.Happy Gilmore is not outstanding and it's very hit and miss at times,but it is enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good and short comedy.To save his grandmothers old house,a hockey player who never made it big takes his skill to a golf competition.Best Performance: Adam Sandler Worst Performance: Christopher McDonald If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Black Hawk Down is a great movie with a very well developed storyline that felt very real and accurate to kind type of things that happen during a war,and because I felt that it was very intense and really put you in to this serious situation,the movie is almost two and a half hours long but it dosen't feel that long,its action packed all the way through.I felt that there was a bit too much action,not that I didn't enjoy it,but we could have gotten to know a bit more about the characters,Josh Hartnett,Ewan McGregor and many others put in very inspired performances and I would have liked to have gotten to know a lot more about their life.I was very impressed with Ridley Scott,he has directed several different genres,but I never thought he could direct a war film,but he did a really impressive job.I would highly recommend Black Hawk Down to all fans of war films.A large group of US soldiers are sent to Somalia to capture two warlords but are trapped by the people of Somalia that carry many weapons.
Skyfall is a terrific movie with a fantastic storyline,a great cast,characters and plenty of action.Its a huge improvement from the previous Bond,Quantum Of Solace,which many fans found to be very disappointing,Skyfall lives up to Bonds like Dr No and Casino Royale and in my opinion is one of the best Bonds yet.Many people say that Daniel Craig is the worst Bond,but I think hes one of the best,definitely better than Roger Moore,Timothy Dalton and George Lazenby,hes just as good as Pierce Brosnan,however no one will replace Sean Connery as the best Bond,but still Daniel Craig has signed on for at least two more Bonds,mayne more,so lets see what he can do.MI6 comes under attack and Bond must prove his loyalty to M and find the people who are up to this.However,after Bond is accidentally shot,he loses some of his skills and must get them back.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a good movie with a decent storyline,that's basically the same set up as the previous two instalments,and a great cast.The movie is obviously nothing brilliant,but it's just a very enjoyable action movie,these movies get a lot of bad credit,but if people just watch them as they're meant to be,a brainless action movie,instead of overthinking the movies sometimes ridiculous premise,they will find it very enjoyable.I thought Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was a great actress in this movie,she is attractive but can also really act and I liked her a lot more than Megan Fox,she has good potential and I hope her acting career continues.Its certainly not better than the first Transformers,but I find it much better than the second.Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a fun and enjoyable movie that fans of the previous Transformers will most likely enjoy,and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action movie. The Transformers race against the Decepticons when a hidden spacecraft is discovered on the moon. Best Performance: Shia LaBeouf Worst Performance: Alan Tudyk If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Pitch Black is a good movie with a good storyline and a very talented cast that suit their characters very well.While his acting is certainly nothing fantastic,I always really like Vin Diesel in films,his characters always suit his manly personality perfectly and Riddick is no exception,he is a very interesting character that develops well throughout this movie.The movie is also action packed from start to finish,and though the long action sequences too take you away from the story several times,there really enjoyable and shouldn't be a huge issue anyone who enjoys action films.Pitch Black is certainly not an outstanding movie and it's pretty forgetful,but you'll enjoy the ride and I would recommend watching it for fun if your a fan of sci-fi or action movies.A ship that transports criminals crash on a planet filled with dangerous creatures,and must work together to survive before it is possible to leave this planet.
Aliens is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast.The movie is a sequel to Alien and with it being released seven years after the first it was very anticipated,so it wasn't an easy task for James Cameron to try and make a sequel that is just as good as Ridley Scott's film,but Cameron did an outstanding job and I think,and I'm sure many people will agree,that this movie is even better.It is more intense and exciting than Alien,its much more fast paced and action packed,the previous movie can be very slow at times but this movie really keeps you at the edge of your seat all the way through.Sigourney Weaver is outstanding as usual,she was great in the original but I think she has improved and matured even more as an actor within the seven years.Aliens is both action packed and terrifying,I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or sci-fi. Ripley leads a force to the planet where she first faced the alien,only to find a whole colony.Best Performance: Sigourney Weaver Worst Performance: Paul ReiserIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is,in my opinion,without a doubt the best movie in the Mission: Impossible series so far.I think what really helped improve this one from the previous three was that Ethan Hunt had a team,as much as I love Tom Cruise,I think it was better seeing him working with other great actors such as Jeremy Renner,Paula Patton and Simon Pegg,there was great chemistry between the four actors.The movie is of course action packed from start to finish and also very thrilling,the scene were Ethan is climbing up the Burj Khalifa tower is so intense and hard to watch, impressively directed by the great Brad Bird.Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great action or thriller. When their organisation is presumed to have bombed the Kremlin,Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his new team must work together to clear their name. Best Performance: Tom Cruise Worst Performance: Josh HollowayIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Clueless is a fantastic movie with a good story line,which is a common teen movie story,but the movies comedic cast and hilarious characters make it more fun for all ages.Alicia Silverstone plays the lead character,she is very funny in the movie and also extremely attractive.My favourite part of the movie is Paul Rudd's character Josh,I have never seen a movie with him in it that I didn't like,and his characters are always very funny and down to earth,like I imagine he is.I think the whole family can enjoy this movie and I was extremely surprised with how much I enjoyed it.Cher (Alicia Silverstone) lives a high-profile life living with her rich father,and spends most of her time with her friends and putting people together,but Cher realises its time for her to find a boyfriend of her own.
Seven Pounds is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. This film is very deep and compelling,it really makes you think about your own life and how you've treated others in the past, I found myself questioning if I was a good person, and you know you're watching a really good movie when they make you think something as serious as that. The casting of Will Smith is perfect, there aren't many people that could pull off a character like this, as he is very flawed and at many times unlikeable, but because of Smith's charming and likable personality, we support this character, despite the bad turns he makes and even the harsh things he says. The audience is not sure of the characters motives for the majority of the film, which I really loved, because movies like this usually will spoon feed the audience immediately what the character is doing and why he is doing it, but for in this it is quite confusing, and it keeps us more interested in the story. It is almost like a poem, it always has a message to bring us but we aren't too sure what that message really is until the end, but you'll only find that message if you're looking at it beyond what's right in front of you. At times it is feel good, and other times it is very depressing, but the whole time it is a clever and unique film, and I would highly recommend Seven Pounds to anyone looking for a good drama. A man who is hiding a dark secret decides to deliver acts of immense kindness to seven people who really need it.

Con Air is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.It's certainly not an outstanding piece of film,but the reason why I'm rating it so well is simply because I find this movie very fun to watch,it's a very well made action movie that is quite intense at times and a straight forward story.The cast is, admittedly, hard to take seriously at times, Nicolas Cage's character was a bit too overly dramatic at times and some of his dialogue just sounded ridiculous coming out of his mouth,but I wouldn't have preferred anyone else in this part. The highlight of the movie is certainly John Malkovich, he really brings class and sophistication to this movie with a very dramatic and somewhat frightening performance that is much more believable that any other actor in this. Its simply a fun action movie that may take itself too seriously,but I enjoyed Con Air for what it's worth and would recommend it if you ever see it on television and are looking for a good action movie to kill some time. Chaos ensues after prisoners hijack a plane transporting convicts to a maximum security facility.Best Performance: John Malkovich Worst Performance: Colm Meaney If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Scent of a Woman is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.The story is very easy to follow,but it's the dialogue and the performances that make it so much more interesting and an absolute joy to watch.Al Pacino's performance was absolutely magnificent,an Academy Award dosen't lie,he really became his character,I was completely convinced that he was actually blind and I forgot all about his roles in movies such as the Godfather and Scarface,because they are nothing like this.Chris O'Donnell also delivered a great performance in one of his earliest roles,there is great chemistry between him and Pacino,and they clearly enjoyed working together.Scent of a Woman is packed with great character development and great performances,I would recommend it to all moviegoers. An unlikely friendship develops between a shy college student and a retired blind army colonel.If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Citizen Kane is a brilliant movie with an extremely well written storyline with an outstanding cast that all follow through with their performances.Orson Welles obviously made this movie the beautiful piece of film making it is,as the star,director,writer and producer,and his performance is of course the best of the whole movie.The movie was also a very interesting "biography" inside the life of Charles Foster Kane,he is a fictional character but Orson Welles performance really brings him to life,although he is apparently loosely based on a real person.All in all,Citizen Kane is a fantastic movie that will forever be remembered as one of the greatest movies ever made,and surely should not be missed by any moviegoers.After the death of a well known publishing tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles),a group of news reporters struggle to find out why his last word was 'rosebud'.
Get Smart is a very enjoyable movie with a well written storyline and a great comedic cast. It is certainly a lot fun with some great slapstick and cringe comedy, but it had much more potential than what it delivered. This movie easily could have triggered a new spy comedy franchise, similar to the Naked Gun or Austin Powers, but it simply wasn't as funny or memorable as it could have been. However, I do think that a sequel should still be made, I think they can see the few mistakes they made in this one which should be easy to improve on, and we'll get to see Steve Carell really shine in a Frank Drebin-type role. The cast is certainly the highlight, Steve Carell dominates it in the main role, his character is one we knew he could play, a bit more stupid than Michael Scott, but smarter than Brick Tamland, and seeing him in a big budget movie like this certainly brought a smile to my face, he is joined by an excellent supporting cast that includes Anne Hathaway, Alan Arkin and Dwayne Johnson, as well as many terrific cameos. It could have been better, but Get Smart is still a very fun movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or adventure film. An inept secret agent teams up with a female spy to hunt for a group of terrorists.Best Performance: Steve Carell Worst Performance: Ken Davitian If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
White Chicks is a decent movie,obviously the story is nothing brilliant or different,but there still is a good performance from the Wayans Brothers,and this is definitely,in my opinion,there best movie,none of there movies are inspired and a lot of there jokes can be very tasteless,but I think White Chicks offers some very funny stuff with none of the sick scenes,like in the Scary Movie franchise,that isn't funny or even watchable.Two FBI agents try there best to protect two rich twins who are under a plot for kidnapping,the agents disguise as them while leaving the real ones in there hotel rooms.
Unforgiven is a fantastic movie with a very well written and well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.The movie is very professionally directed by the one and only Clint Eastwood,who also delivers a great performance,along with incredible actors such as Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman,who won an Academy Award for this movie,and it's no surprise why.Eastwood has of course starred and directed several westerns in the past,but this is very unique to them,it has a lit more heart,emotion and also a lot more character development than you would expect from an average western.Unforgiven is a great movie that I would recommend to all moviegoers,especially anyone looking for a good western or drama. A retired assassin decides to take on one last job with some help from two other men.

The Fighter is a brilliant movie with a terrific storyline,a great cast and some great characters.The cast of the movie was perfect and all matched there characters brilliantly,with breathtaking performances from Mark Wahlberg,Christian Bale and Amy Adams.I really enjoyed Mark Wahlbergs performance and think he deserved at least a nomination,Christian Bale won an award and Amy Adams was nominated,Mark Wahlberg was the main actor and definitely deserved at least a nomination for his performance.There have been talks about a sequel to this movie,I'm not sure if it is really sequel material,but if one is made I will see it.A look at the early years of a boxer,Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg),whose brother Dicky (Christian Bale)trained and helped him make it to the top.
Lethal Weapon 2 is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a very good cast.The movie is just as good as the first Lethal Weapon.On terms of action and storyline, the first Lethal Weapon is certainly better,but with humour, Lethal Weapon 2 is much funnier.The chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover seemed much better this time around,they obviously got to know each other after the first,also the edition of Joe Pesci was a great decision,he is both a great actor and a very funny one too.Lethal Weapon 2 is filled with action and comedy and fans of the first shouldn't be disappointed.Martin and Roger are hired to take care of an accountant who's life is at risk,however this job also puts their own lives at risk.
Saturday Night Fever is a good movie with a well written storyline although there really isn't very much conflict throughout the movie,and an average cast.The plot is certainly nothing too exciting but it is certainly the dance scenes that make this movie enjoyable,I'm usually not a fan of watching people dance,but John Travolta is certainly an exception and this movie is the best example of what are professional dance he really is,and his dance scenes are without a doubt unforgettable scenes and the movies highlight.As for the casts performances,I honestly think its the weakest part of the movie,I was that bothered about the plot,but I don't think anyone really delivered a top notch performance,not even Travolta,his performance is certainly the best in this movie,but he was still very new to acting at this time and he was nowhere near professional yet.The worst performance was certainly Karen Lynn Gorney,who played Stephanie,I didn't believe her for a second,she started off seeming like a upper class girl,but as soon as she started talking she was not one bit believable,and especially when she was upset,she could not do a fake cry.All in all,Saturday Night Fever is an enjoyable movie,it's filled with flaws but the dance scenes are the main thing in this movie,and they are the best parts.Tony Manero (John Travolta),a young man living in Brooklyn,is trying to find himself as he is growing up,he gets a low payed job,but keeps a positive attitude while seeing his friends every night and going to his favourite dance club.If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
2 Fast 2 Furious is a good movie with a very thought out storyline and a decent cast.It is the first of many sequels to The Fast And The Furious but this time around it is only Paul Walker.Brian O'Conner was suppose to be the star in the first one,but Vin Diesel ends up stealing the show,and is absence from this doesn't help the movie out.I did like how Paul Walker got the spotlight he deserves this time however,because there is no actor in this good enough to steal the show,I know Ludicrous is a big star,but hes not a very good actor.Fans of the original will be disappointed,but can still enjoy this sequel,but there are much fewer car chases.Brian O'Connor must investigate and find a local drug-lord with some help with an old friend from college or else he will be put into jail for letting Dominic escape from them in the first Fast and Furious.
Her is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast.It is a very deep look at technology and the effects it could have on our future,I feel like the type of relationship Joaquín Phoenix's character has with this device could actually happening in the near future and I was shocked with how much it actually frightened me,because this movie dosen't try to do that,it tries to be sweet and romantic with these two characters, which it does do a great job at,but at times I really thought about the fact that he was communicating with an electronic device,and it surprisingly isn't too far fetched from the world we live in today.The dialogue between Theodore and Samantha is extremely well written,Spike Jonze did a great job developing these characters very emotional,albeit strange,relationship and he totally earned his Academy Award.I think this movie definitely could have benefited with more scenes of Theodore going on dates with real women,one of the biggest reasons why he fell in love with Samantha was because he couldn't connect with any woman that he tried dating,but the movie simply didn't show this enough,I think we could have seen him go on at least two more dates,just so it could elaborate more on why he was falling in love with this computer in the first place.A very unique and heartwarming story that can be a bit intense at times,Her is a delightfully unique movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or romance. Struggling to find real human connection since his wife left him,Theodore (Joaquín Phoenix) starts to fall in love with an operating system that is able to communicate with him.

The Hobbit: the Battle of the Five Armies is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.Fans of the Hobbit trilogy and the overall Middle Earth franchise should be pleased with this finale,it wraps up Bilbo's journey and says goodbye to all these beloved characters in a very sweet and pleasing way.Admittedly, it wasn't the same emotional send off that Return of the King was,Peter Jackson really took his time writing and developing that ending but this one felt a little rushed,I think it definitely could have been a bit longer but it is generally a pleasing finale.The performances are all fantastic,Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen shining in the lead roles as usual,but we follow many other great characters and I was certainly more interested in Thorin this time around than I ever was previously.The CGI was my only big problem with this movie,it is definitely used more than it ever was in previous Hobbit installments,and while it does look great,it obviously would have looked better if they used as much live action as they could,but there are certainly some shots were it is all done by CGI and it is very obvious.The Hobbit: the Battle of the Five Armies may have a few flaws,but it is mostly a very pleasing finale to the Middle Earth franchise and I would recommend it to all fans of the series. To stop the Lonely Mountains from falling in to the wrong hands,the elves, dwarfs and Orcs must prepare for battle as Bilbo's journey reaches an end.

Panic Room is a great movie with a very well written storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is an above average thriller filled with some very intense scenes.Jodie Foster delivers a fantastic performance,I felt it was a very realistic performance that wasn't in anyway exaggerated or under exaggerated,It was really legit to how a single mother would react if there were criminals in her home,and a realistic effect on the character,both from the writers and the actor,adds adds very much to the effect if the movie.The movie is exciting almost from the very beginning and I don't think it stops or gets in any way boring throughout.Panic Room is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good thriller.A mother and daughter are trapped in their new homes safe room when a gang of thieves enter the house.Best Performance: Jodie Foster Worst Performance: Kristen StewartIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Goonies is a great movie with a very well developed storyline with a young but very talented cast and a smart script with plenty of very clever and witty scenes.The movie is certainly one of the greatest and best known family films ever made,and rightly so,it's hilarious no matter what age you are,there are jokes for both kids and adults,that and an intriguing story is all you really need to make a great family film,sadly most people forget about that.Most of the films cast are still today very big actors,most notably Josh Brolin and Sean Astin,and if you are a fan of there actors then I would definitely say you check this movie out to take a fun and interesting look at their early beginnings as actors.The Goonies is a very enjoyable movie that I would highly recommend as a film for the whole family to watch.In search of treasure,two brothers and their friends brave an underground cavern,fraught with danger.
Crocodile Dundee is a great movie with a good storyline,a great cast and plenty of very funny scenes.There is nothing about this movie that really amazed and the humor is nothing different and nothing I didn't see before,but it still is very enjoyable and I thought Paul Hogan did a great performance and makes Crocodile Dundee a very likable character.A female reporter from New York goes to Australia to find a crocodile hunter who survived an outstanding occurrence with a crocodile,and takes the Australian crocodile hunter to New York,which he finds very hard getting use to,but is falling for the reporter.
The Muppets is a fantastic film that brings back the classical Muppets brilliantly,I would definitely say it would appeal to long time fans like me but also to young people who never heard of them until now,I have to say that I had forgotten how much I loved the Muppets until I saw this film,such fun and lovable characters,I love how they make fun of themselves throughout the movie,with great musical numbers (especially Lifes A Happy Song and Man Or Muppet) and a great new edition of Walter,the Muppets number one fan who is himself a true Muppet,I can imagine a sequel is in the works.When Walter,Gary (Jason Segal) and Mary (Amy Adams) go to Hollywood,Walter,who is a huge Muppet fan,visits the Muppets old run down studio,and a wealthy man,Tex Richman is looking to shut the studio down the find oil underneath the building,the only way they can stop him is unless The Muppets can make $10,000,000,Walter tells Kermit The Frog and he trys to get the old gang back together to out on a telethon and make the money.
Noah is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.It is an action packed movie filled with some very intense performances,it was certainly an interesting way of teaching the story of Noah's Ark in a modernised way that will keep today's generation interested.Russell Crowe as Noah was practically perfect casting,the minute I heard he was playing him I knew it was a good decision and I wasn't disappointed in his performance,I also was impressed by the acting from Jennifer Connelly,Emma Watson,Anthony Hopkins and Douglas Booth.The movie certainly has its flaws,I felt the plot was slow at times and it certainly dragged out a little bit,but I also think we should have been given a bit more time in the beginning to know the characters so we could care for them more once they are in danger,also I think it would have looked so much better if the animals were real rather than clearly animated.Exciting and intense,Noah is a beautiful movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good adventure film or drama. Noah is challenged with the task of gathering two of every animal in to a giant ark before a massive flood ensues. Best Performance: Russell Crowe Worst Performance: Dakota Goyo If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Jack And Jill is a terrible movie and possibly the worst movie of Adam Sandler's career,I don't know what he was thinking when he decided to do this movie.He acts like any other character he's played as Jack,but Jill is an awful character and getting him to play the woman was just wrong,he talks more like a gay man when he play's Jill that he does a woman.I did however enjoy Al Pacino's role and Johnny Depp's cameo appearance,but those two great actor's don't make up for what a terrible movie this is.I only saw it because my friend's were going seeing it and they invited me,but I really wish I didn't waste my money on this.If your a fan of comedies,or you just like good movies,I would not recommend Jack And Jill.Jack dread's every year when his twin sister Jill comes up for Thanksgiving,he try's to get rid of her visit's for good by finding a man for her,but it proves diffucult.When he trys to get Al Pacino to be on a cappuccino commercial he is working on,Al Pacino becomes obsessed with Jill so Jack lets her stay to get the actor on his new commercial.
National Treasure is a decent movie with a very good,albeit very unrealistic,storyline,but a cast that seems to just be doing it for the pay check.I've never liked Nicolas Cage,and him being the main character in this movie definitely didn't help me with enjoying this movie,everyone time I watch him trying to act,it feels like Ross from Friends trying to act like a different character,but he just acts the same all the time,at least David Schwimmer doesn't try to do action movies,because I just don't feel like it suits actors like them,because they just have a strange,awkward personality.National Treasure is a movie that people will enjoy as a family movie,but you will be less than thrilled if you watch it expecting a good action and adventure movie.Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) works with a group of people work together to steal to Declaration Of Independence which will lead them to an unknown treasure and clear his family name.
This Is 40 is a brilliant movie with a great story line,a really great cast and funny characters.It is a great spin off to Knocked Up,revolving around who I thought where the funniest characters in Knocked Up,Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann),and they where brilliant as the main characters in this movie.However,I was disappointed that there was no appearance from Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl,I thought they would have at least made an appearance at the birthday party with there daughter that should be five years old now.Debbie and Pete are feeling strange mood swings preparing for their 40th birthday,while Pete is trying to make money with his record label,Debbie is losing money at her clothes shop,while also dealing with their two daughters who are growing up fast.
Kiki's Delivery Service is a good movie with a very nice and simple storyline and some beautiful animation.It certainly not Hayao Miyazaki's finest film,its a lot more childish and has no violence or strange and unusual characters like you would see in his other films,but its still a very enjoyable movie.The voice cast in the movie is perfect,my favourite character without a doubt being Jiji,Phil Hartman did a perfect job voicing this sarcastic cat,I really enjoyed his voice roles on the Simpsons,and he did a really great job in this as well,he wassd my favourite part of the film and I wish he was in it more.Kiki's Delivery Service is not as interesting or exciting as Hayao Miyazaki's other work,but its still a great movie for the whole family to enjoy.Tells the story of Kiki,a young witch whose job delivering bread is threathened when she loses her powers.
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.While it certainly isn't a massive improvement from the first Fantastic Four,I did think this one was better,it had a storyline that was more enjoyable to follow and it also had a lot more light humour than the previous one did.The effects are very good,particularly the Silver Surfer,but I was a bit annoyed at times when they took a very cartoony approach,for example,Mr. Fantastic on the dance floor or Sue making her pimple invisible.My favourite part of the whole movie is Stan Lee's cameo,he always does great cameos in Marvel films,but this one is still today my favourite,I won't spoil it for anyone but it is hilarious.Not an outstanding movie but a good sequel,Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is fun and I would recommend it as a family film or something to watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. Just coming up to Reed and Sue's wedding day,the Fantastic Four must face an old enemy and two new ones that could be the end of the universe as we know it.

The Lion King is a fantastic movie and still today remains one of the greatest animated movies ever,the cast is brilliant,the characters are brilliant,the humor is brilliant and the animation and music is fantastic,Im reviewing the movie now because I saw it in 3D yesterday,I didn't expect the movie to be brilliant in a 3D format because its a hand drawn cartoon and it wasn't made for 3D,but it was actually fantastic and better 3D than for example : Kung Fu Panda 2.A young lion cub Simba(Matthew Broderick) runs away from home after he thinks he accidentally killed his father Mufasa (James Earl Jones).although it was actually his Uncle Scar who killed his father on purpose and tried to kill Simba so he could be the king of Pride Rock,Simba feels guilty and runs away from home where he meets Timon and Pumba (my favorites)who teach him to never worry and Simba lives a care free life with them for years,but he must save his hometown and several years later he will find out why.
The Fugitive is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a very professional and dramatic cast.The movie is intense and action packed all the way through and also very exciting.As far as performances go ,this is without a doubt one of Harrison Ford's finest performances and without a doubt Tommy Lee Jones best performance,he really stole the spotlight from Ford in this movie,an Academy Award dosen't lie.The character development for both Ford and Jones characters is also top notch,especially for action movie standards.The movie is filled with action but never gets too carried away or drags out ,which I liked because it bothers when they take you away from the story too much.The Fugitive is a great movie that I would recommends to all moviegoers,especially if you're a fan of action,adventure or the two main actors. A doctor goes on the run after a court finds him guilty of murdering his wife.
The Last Samurai is a fantastic movie with a really inspired and very well developed storyline and a very impressive cast.As usual,Tom Cruise's performance is magnificent,he does a fantastic job playing an American officer finding his inner peace and his heart is in this character all the way through.Ken Watanabe was nominated for an Academy Award for this movie,which I found surprising,his performance was good but it was nothing breathtaking,he did deserve a nomination,but I don't get how he did and Tom Cruise wasn't even nominated.The movie has a good story that is interesting all the way through,even for the two hours and a half it goes on for.The Last Samurai is a must see for fans of historic and samurai movies.Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise),an American officer,finds his inner warrior being unleashed by the legendary Japanese samurai warriors he was suppose to be against.
Mystic River is a great movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast that all deliver very impressive performances.The movie is very professionally directed by the great Clint Eastwood,who brought three very different actors to play these very interesting characters that we follow as their lives drastically change throughout,the chapter development is fantastic,the people we see at the beginning of the movie are nothing like the people they become at the end.Sean Penn and Tim Robbins both won an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for Supporting Role,and that's no surprise because they are both outstanding in this,Penn is so emotional and really becomes his character,there are scenes were he is roaring and even crying and it all feels so real,and Robbins is almost unrecognisable as his character,his clothes and especially his voice make it hard to believe its really him.Mystic River is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or mystery. Three friends don't see each other for years after a tragic incident,but they all reunite when one of the members daughter is murdered,and there are several suspects.

Tomorrow Never Dies is a good movie with a good cast,good storyline and plenty of action and suspense to keep this movie alive.Its not the best James Bond movie,but its not the worst either,but it certainly isn't Pierce Brosnans best Bond movie,who would currently be my favourite actor who's played Bond,although there's no Bond I don't like,Sean Connery,Roger Moore and Daniel Craig are also all great.When I saw the opening credits and saw Teri Hatcher came up,I was happy to see she was in it,because I've always liked her and find her very attractive.I was disappointed that she wasn't as main in it as I thought shed be,I thought shed be the main Bond girl in this movie,but that role actually went to Michelle Yeoh,I thought Teri Hatcher was much better,as an actress,her character and looks.James Bond returns and must stop a man named Elliot Carver,who is trying to cause war between the Uk and China just so he can obtain exclusive global news coverage.
Airplane 2:The Squel is a good funny movie to keep you enjoyed and laughing from start to finish.While it is not as good as the original Airplane,its still a funny movie,maybe not a sequel you would consider fresh,the problem with this is it borrows and recycles a lot of jokes from the original movie,these kind of things wouldn't have happened if it where written by Jim Abrahams,David Zucker and Jerry Zucker,they would have made plenty of new jokes that they liked and a storyline that didn't remind you that its a sequel,like the Naked Gun sequels,which are fairly fresh sequels.The new writer was clearly watching the original and rewriting the bits he liked.Many of the same actors were in it,which I was happy with because I was worried it would be an entirely different cast,but Leslie Nielsen is missing,and he is the highlight of the first one,he is just hilarious.A shuttle heading it to space with several passengers is effected by a faulty computer that causes it to head straight to the sun.Once again its up to Ted Striker to save the day and win back Elaine Dickinson.
The Nightmare Before Christmas is a terrific movie with a great story,some amazing characters and a nice Christmas theme that make it a very enjoyable movie to watch during the Christmas holidays.I would say you would have to be a little older however,at least older than seven,as this movie can be very dark and might frighten a younger audience,as there is a strange mix of Christmas and Halloween and some of the characters are very strange,but as you are older you can understand the mix of themes and enjoy the movie.I am not a huge fan of Tim Burton,I find his movies very dark and creepy,I don't like his remake of Christmas stories,like Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and Alice In Wonnderland,but when he contributes to the script,he usually adds some heart that makes it enjoyable,the last two movies I mentioned are just dark versions of light hearted stories.The Nightmare Before Christmas,the story and the characters,was all made by Tim Burton,and that makes the heart involved in this movie,and I would say the greatest movie Tim Burton was part of is this.Jack Skellington is tired of celebrating Halloween every year and when he stumbles upon a world that celebrates a holiday he has never heard of called Christmas,he decides to take over the holiday along with his gang from Halloween town.
Puss In Boots is a terrific film with a great storyline,great cast,great animation and very funny,I enjoyed seeing what Puss In Boots life was like before he teamed up with Shrek and Donkey,I enjoyed the cast particularly,Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots,of course,Salma Hayak as Pussy-Soft Paws and Zack Galifanakis as Humpty Dumpty.The story of Puss In Boots before he met Shrek and Donkey,back in his hometown where he was framed for a crime he didn't commit and must clear his name,while also searching for 3 magic beans along with his friend Humpty Alexander Dumpty and there partner in crime,Pussy Softpaws,in order to get some golden eggs.
Lakeview Terrace is a very mediocre movie with a dull storyline and an overall uninspired cast.Samuel L. Jackson does a great job and will always be an outstanding actor,but he still wasn't enough to make this movie decent,the only scenes that I really liked were when we got to see his character working for the LAPD,which we saw very little of.Kerry Washington did the best she could with the character she was given,sadly it was a boring character that lacked any interesting personality traits,but I found Patrick Wilson's character very annoying,he wouldn't stick up to Jackson's character and couldn't defend his own household and I found the character unlikeable.Lakeview Terrace is a really slow and mediocre movie that I think people would be better off avoiding.A racist veteran LAPD cop starts a violent campaign of intimidation and harassment against his new neighbours because of their interracial relationship. Best Performance: Samuel L. Jackson Worst Performance: Patrick WilsonIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
300 is a brilliant movie with an extremely well developed story and an amazing cast that bring very strong and powerful performances to their characters.Obviously the best part of the movie his Gerard Butler's performance as Leonidas,he is completely brilliant in this movie and gives a strong performance from start to finish,I haven't seen any other movie with Butler where his acting is as impressive as he is in this.I will definitely go see the sequel,300: Rise of an Empire,but I don't feel it will be the same without Gerard Butler.Fans of action movies,violence and historic movies (for example,Gladiator) will definitely enjoy 300,and the many lines in this movie that are very memorable.A fictionalised retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae set in the year 480 B.C. as King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) leads a team of three hundred men in an attack against the Persians.
The Silence of the Lambs is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It is a pure thriller and likely one of the best ever made, it doesn't just rely on being creepy, but also on strong performances which I don't think thrillers do often enough. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins's performances are absolutely outstanding, Foster is a very likable and believable police officer, and Anthony Hopkins completely becomes his character, Hannibal Lecter didn't seem like an easy role to do, but he did it so naturally, with no hesitation. This film won five Academy Awards and is only the third film to win the Big Five, which it completely deserved, it isn't a movie that you would expect to win Best Picture, but I am very happy it did. Dramatic, terrifying at times and without a doubt, film gold, I would recommend Silence of the Lambs to anyone looking for a good thriller or drama. A young FBI agent must meet with a psychopathic serial killer in order to catch one who is still on the loose. Best Performance: Anthony Hopkins Worst Performance: Anthony Heald If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Live and Let Die is a good movie with a very well written storyline and a great cast.It certainly isn't the best James Bond movie,but it's not the worst either.It is the first Bond to star Roger Moore in the main role,and while i like him as Bond in general,he isn't as great the first time around,he certainly improves as in later movies though.The movie certainly has its flaws,but it is action packed and also has several bits of humour throughout,which were certainly the most enjoyable parts.My favourite part of the film was certainly the villain Mr. Big,he was a great Bond villain and the actor really embraced the character.Live and Let Die is an enjoyable movie that James Bond fans will like but won't love.James Bond uncovers a plan by a drugs kingpin to get the world addicted to heroin.Best Performance: Yaphet Kotto Worst Performance: Clifton JamesIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Man on Fire is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant cast.I had to see this movie when I found out Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken were in it,their both unbelievably good actors that always put a tone of heart into their performances.I only had two problems with this movie,first is that Christopher Walken wasn't in it enough,his character should have had a much more important role,you wouldn't want to waist the kind of talent he has,and I also didn't like how they subtitled certain times when the person was speaking English,I know they did to show how important that sentence was,but if your listening to the movie there isn't any need for that,I just found it irritating.The movie is action packed towards the second half,and its also very violent,I thought it was brilliant,but you shouldn't watch it if your sensitive to that kind of stuff.I would highly recommend Man on Fire to all fans of Denzel Washington and Tony Scott.Joyhn Creasy (Denzel Washington),a CIA assassin turned bodyguard teams up with a crusading journalist to take on a Mexican kidnapping ring to save the girl he was hired to protect.
Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay is a good movie with a decent but predictable storyline that was clearly only set up for the comedy aspect,but a great comedic cast.I certainly did not enjoy it as much as the first Harold and Kumar,it just wasn't as funny and the jokes and the story wern't as original,and a lot of it was very cheesy and cliché,something that was gladly absent from the first.John Cho and Kal Penn did a great job,they both play off each other really well,and Neil Patrick Harris is great playing himself as usual.What I disliked the most was the title because they aren't in Guantanamo Bay for most of the movie.Fans of the original should still check it out,but you will be disappointed.Harold and Kumar land in Guantanamo Bay after getting caught with marijuana on a plane to Amsterdam.
The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a brilliant movie with a very inspired and different storyline and a really inspired cast.The music in the movie is outstanding,all the songs are really catchy and will stay in your head long after you finish watching it.The cast is all fantastic,but the best is without a doubt Tim Curry,he delivers his performance as Dr. Frank-N- Furter with so much heart and is definitely the most frightening part of the movie,Susan Sarandon is also very good as her character gets stranger throughout and I was surprised how attractive I found her.The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a must see for all fans of both comedy and musical.A transvestite scientist is trying to create a perfect man,while he holds a newly engaged couple who's car breaks down near his castle captive.
Spirited Away is a fantastic move with a brilliant and really unique storyline with tones of fun and imaginative characters.It is definitely my favourite film made by Hayao Miyazaki,and that's saying a lot because this writer and director has made so much brilliant anime films,but this is without a doubt his best,it even won an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature,and rightfully so,this movie has a lot of heart and is beautifully animated.The movie is rated PG,but I definitely wouldn't advise parents letting their children watch it if they're younger than at least seven,I watched this at a very young age when it first came out on DVD and I was very frightened by all the strange creatures,but watching it today,I can really appreciate it for the great film it really is.I would highly recommend Spirited Away to all animation fans.Chihiro is trapped in a world ruled by gods,where she must work there to save herself and her family that have been transformed into pigs.
Brave is a great movie movie with a great storyline,cast characters,humor and action.It myth not be exactly the kind of movie that you would expect from Pixar,but I still thought it was great and better than other Pixar movies such as A Bugs Life,Cars,Ratatouille and Wall-E (not that I don't like these movies,there all great,Pixar is just brilliant).It was nice to see an original movie from Pixar,seeing that the last two years we had Toy Story 3 and Cars 2.Pixar have a really great future for films planned,with plenty of original projects but also plenty of sequels to previous successes planned,there future looks bright.A young adult named Merida is the oldest daughter of her parents,the king and queen of Scotland.They are trying to find a prince for Merida for the day she becomes the princess,however Merida is being pushed around by her mother,she is not interested in becoming princess and just wants her freedom,she finds a way to make this come true.
Lara Croft Tomb Rauder: the Cradle of Life is a decent movie with a good storyline and a mediocre cast.Like the first,it's simply another adventure movie that may have plenty of great action sequences,but it lacks the amount of depth we've seen in adventures like Indiana Jones or Star Wars,they put in a lot of time and dialogue to make sure the audience really cares for its characters and supports them throughout their journey, something that the Lara Croft series simply didn't focus on enough.This movie is, however,an improvement from its predecessor,it's certainly not a massive one,but I did find this more enjoyable,I was sucked in to the story a lot more and Angelina Jolie seemed more confident and pure in her performance,there is no denying that she was perfect casting for the role,it's just a shame that this series wasn't as good as it could have been,she easily could have became the female Indiana Jones.Its certainly nothing outstanding and its quite forgetful,but Lara Croft Tomb Raider: the Cradle of Life can make for a quick and fun watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. Archaeologist Lara Croft must track down a mad bioweapons genius who threatens to unleash a deadly plague.Best Performance: Angelina Jolie Worst Performance: Ciarán HindsIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Campaign is a hilarious movie with a very clever storyline and a very talented and comedic cast that do a terrific job.When I first heard that Will Ferrell and Zach Galifanakis did a movie together,I had to see it,but then I heard it was disappointing so I delayed seeing.I decided to rent it,and I didn't see what the problem was,I though the movie was hilarious,there was a few misses but very few,and similar to Step Brothers and the Hangover,it has so much lines that are very quotable,also the two actors worked really well together.I really enjoyed Dylan McDermott,Sarah Baker,Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow,the casting for each character was all very well suited.If your a fan of both Will Ferrell and Zach Galifanakis comedies you will definitely love the Campaign.Long running congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) finally gets some competition from Marty Huggins (Zach Galifanakis),a man who may take over his career.They start a serious campaign against each other.
Mary Poppins is a good movie with a well written storyline and a talented cast.It is certainly an absolute classic and one of Disney's most famous movies,but it is definitely much more fun for kids than it is adults.I think it would have been much more enjoyable if it didn't drag itself out so much,it is two hours and twenty minutes long and I think it would have been better if it was just an hour and a half,the story isn't interesting enough or in need of a lot of development to be this long.Julie Andrews does an outstanding performance as the title character,and it's very impressive that this was her film debut,she came across as so experienced and even got an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.The music is definitely the highlight of the movie,it's filled with one great musical number after another.The movie definitely drags out,but Mary Poppins is still a fun movie that I would recommend as a family movie and to fans of musicals.The search for London banker George Banks to find a perfect nanny for his two naughty children brings the magical Mary Poppins into their lives.Best Performance:Julie Andrews Worst Performance:Glynis JohnsIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Fred Claus is a good movie with an enjoyable storyline and a good cast.Its a very fun Christmas movie that really gets you in to the Christmas spirit,it's fun for the whole family because enough funny scenes for that all ages will laugh at.Vince Vaughn have an enjoyable performances as Santa Claus's brother,but the best performance had to be Paul Giamatti as Father Christmas himself,I didn't like the idea of him paying such a well known character,I just didn't think he would suit him,but he did do a great job,I was very impressed with him.Fred Claus never comes to a perfect Christmas movie,but it's a lot of fun for the whole family. When Fred (Vince Vaughn) asks him brother,who happens to be Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) for $50,000,Santa makes his brother,who he hasn't seen in years,come work at the North Pole with the elves before Christmas to deserve the money he's asking for.
The Godfather is an absolutely incredible movie,I cant see anything not to like about this movie,it is just so good.The story is fantastic and,although it is three hours long,the time flies by very fast,but you must pay attention to it,you will get confused if you look away o=for a few minutes and get distracted by something else.The cast is pitch perfect and the characters are some of the greatest in cinema history,and Marlon Brando deserved his Academy Award without a doubt,although Al Pacino was more of the leading role.The movie is number 2 on IMDb's Top 250,I honestly think it should be number one,I like Shawshank Redemption,but The Godfather is better.The story of how Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) took over his fathers Vito Corleone's (Marlon Brando) business and gradually becomes just like his father.
Step Brothers is a fantastic and hilarious comedy movie with fantastic roles from Will Ferrell and John C Reilly as the immature,forty year old step brothers.Hopefully,a sequel will be made shortly,like Will Ferrell said,he will make one as soon as hes finished with the Anchorman sequel.which been that two great Will Ferrell movies are getting sequels,let hope this man doesn't disappoint,but I'm sure he wont,because his characters are hilarious.Nancy Huff (Mary Steenbrurgen) and Robert Duback (Richard Jenkins) fall in love and get married very quickly.There two sons,Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) and Dale Doback (John C Reilly) are not happy about this and don't get along at the beginning,but when Dale punches Brennans brother Derek,the two get along well and decide to plan a future in music with each other.
Life of Brian is a fantastic movie with a surprisingly different and extremely risky storyline from the Monty Python crew and the six main cast members do a terrific job with all the wacky characters they play.Its without a doubt one of my favourite comedies,there's very few parts in this movie that don't make me laugh.The Holy Grail is Monty Python's best work,but Life of Brian is very close.I love all the hilarious random scenes,like when Brian falls into a alien spaceship,and it stuff like this that is reason why I love Monty Python,and 'Always Look On the Bright Side of Life' is one of my favourite movie songs of all time,it always cheers me up if i'm in a bad mood.Fans of Monty Python won't be disappointed by Life of Brian.Revolves around the life of Brian (Graham Chapman),a boy who was born the same night as Jesus Christ in a nearby stable and is mistaken for being the real messiah.
The Bucket List is a great movie with a well written storyline and a fantastic cast. It is a very character driven storyline that relies on good performances and chemistry from its two leads, and you couldn't have gotten any better than Morgan Freeeman and Jack Nicholson, you can tell that the two of them are real life friends and their on screen chemistry is outstanding. The movies main problem is that it simply isn't emotional enough, there are of course many sweet and heartearming scenes, but I actually feel it needed more, it should have developed these characters more and given us more sympathy for them, so that the thought of them dying eventually becomes a dreadful thing, and once it happens we are driven to tears. With it's two leads and emotional story this easily could have been an Oscar contender, but the fact that the story was a bit too rushed (being only 90 minutes long) and also the fact that there is a lot of comic relief, took it away from any big awards. It's certainly not perfect, but the Bucket List is a sweet and well acted film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama. Two men that only have a short time left to live head off on a trip to complete all the things they want to do before they pass away. Best Performance: Jack Nicholson Worst Performance: Sean HayesIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Unknown is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast.The movie is a great thriller that keeps you at the edge of your seat as you follow Liam Neeson as he tries to find out what is going on and why no one remembers who he is.The movie is certainly exciting and action packed but it does have its flaws,mainly the dialogue was my problem,at times the dialogue was just very lazily written and you could tell from the way the actors said it that they didn't like the line either.Unknown is a very exciting movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good thriller.After Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) wakes up from a coma after a car crash,no one renders who he is and discovers a man has stolen his identity and has even convinced his wife.He tries to find out what is going on and out a stop to this.

The Tourist is not a very good movie,their is definitely a good cast,but they don't seem to get interested in the characters their playing at all,from start to finish,there isn't any chemistry between Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie,and its seem pretty clear that this movie was clearly only a bit of extra money to them.I will admit that the twist to this movie was clever and very unexpected,but that just wasn't enough to make up for how boring the majority of the movie really was.Elise (Angelina Jolie) meets a tourist at a train station (Johnny Depp) to make people think that he is a man that owes a very big amount of money in taxes.
Larry Crowne is a good albeit mediocre movie with a decent storyline and a talented cast.The movie is certainly nothing outstanding,but it is an average romantic comedy,it certainly has some funny and sweet moments but it also has several parts that are hit and miss.I think the fact that actors as good as Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts were in this really helped with making this movie more watchable,because there clearly wasn't much to work with in the script but Hanks and Roberts brought the characters to life as much as they could.I also found some of the characters quite annoying,I didn't like any of the bikers that Hanks became friends with and most of the people that were in his class,although I did find Malcolm Barrett's performance really funny and would have liked to have seen more from his character,and I really liked Bryan Cranston's performance,although his character was suppose to be unlikeable,I was unable to dislike him because of Cranstons really likable personality.Larry Crowne isn't worth it to but or rent on DVD,but it is worth the watch if it is ever on TV and you have some time to kill. A man who is made redundant enrols on a public speaking course at a college and falls for his tutor.Best Performance: Julia Roberts Worst Performance: Wilmer ValderramaIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Wanted is a great movie with a well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is action packed and very intense from start to finish,the story and the characters are very unique and not quite like any action movie i've seen previously,I loved the slow motion shots that are used quite regularly throughout the movie and is the best example that it is also directed in a very unique way.James McAvoy does a great job in the lead role,I didn't think it would be easy to keep the audience interested in your character, especially when Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman are in supporting roles,but he is genuinely that good of an actor that he was interesting enough to keep my attention.Action packed and very enjoyable,I would recommend Wanted to anyone looking for a good crime or action film. A man survives an assassination attempt only to discover he's destined to join a band of mystical killers.Best Performance: James McAvoy Worst Perfornance: Lorna ScottIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Ghostbusters is a fantastic movie with an outstanding story line,an amazing cast of comedy actors,who will forever be comedy legends,and some of the greatest characters ever made.I love everything about this movie and I have nothing to complain about,the theme song is probably the best movie song of all time,and the scene with the Stay Puft marshmallow man is one of my favorite movie scenes.I love Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd,and this is definitely my favorite movie for both of them,the sequel is not as good,but still a very fresh sequel,Bill Murray,listen to Dan,please just do Ghostbusters 3,it has to be made.Three unemployed men start a ghost busting business after an unusual paranormal activity occurs at their local library,and more strange things occur as the business continues.
Jackie Brown is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline like all Quentin Tarantino's movies and a very talented cast.I certainly didn't enjoy it as much as Tarantino's previous work,Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction,it wasn't as violent,action packed or as exciting as them and I was a bit disappointed by it,but it still is a really good movie.This focuses a lot more on characters and dialogue,which didn't bother me because I really liked these characters and the dialogue was very well written.The cast are all fantastic,Pam Grier and Robert Forster both did a fantastic job,but the best performances had to be Samuel L Jackson and Robert De Niro,their both some of my favourite actors,they always get really interested in their characters,and this is no exception.Fans of Quentin Tarantino will be disappointed by Jackie Brown,but its still a very good,character driven movie.Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) gets involved with an arms dealer and the police force after a few mistakes she made in the past that brought her into jail.
The Bourne Supremacy is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.Matt Damon is back and as great as ever in his second outing as Jason Bourne,and his acting is very inspired and you don't feel like he did this sequel for the paycheck any bit.Fans of the first movie,Bourne Identity,certainly won't be disappointed,it's just as good,if not better.Idenity had a lot of scenes that were very calm and consisted of pretty lengthy dialogue,this didn't bother me but I liked that this movie was pretty much action and suspense all the way through,it kept me excited and at the edge of my seat.My only problem with Supremacy in comparison to Identity is that Bourne is not as likable,there are several scenes,particularly towards the end,where he comes across as a simply bad person,which at times was difficult since we are suppose to support this character,but it wasn't a huge issue.Action packed and intense,the Bourne Supremacy is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or thriller. Jason Bourne is once again forced to take up his former life as a trained assassin when a CIA operation goes wrong.

Let's Be Cops is a terrible movie with a really poorly written storyline and a decent cast that sadly had no way of making this enjoyable.The two main characters are unlikeable from the moment you meet them and you don't care about them or anything they're doing for the whole movie.It is also just not funny,some parts were enjoyable but absolutely nothing had me properly laughing,I think Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. are both good comedy actors,particularity on New Girl,but they just could not improve on this brutal script.Rob Riggle and Andy Garcia are the movies highlight,it was great to see someone deliver some comedy that actually worked and some good dramatic acting,but they both deserved so much better than this.The movie is also about a half an hour too long,you really don't care about these characters at this point but the story just keeps going,it's only 100 minutes but I honestly thought it was passed 2 hours,I don't think I had ever felt this bored watching a comedy.Little laughs and unlikeable characters,I regret paying money to see this movie and I highly recommend you don't. After getting mistaken for real police officers when wearing a costume,two friends decide to keep up the charade.

50/50 is fantastic movie with a very well written storyline with a great cast that are very good at being both funny and emotional.The movie is at times very emotional and also at times very funny,it was definitely a perfect blend,most of the comedy in this came from Seth Rogen's character,he was definitely the comic relief and even at the most serious times his character was able to make me laugh.Joseph Gordon Levitt delivers a very impressive performance,without a doubt one of his finest,he really got in to his character.I would recommend 50/50 to anyone looking for a comedy,but as long as you expect drama and not just laughter from start to finish.When he discovers he has cancer and has a 50/50 chance of living,Adam (Joseph Gordon Levitt) begins a mid life crisis as he struggles with to coup with the disease.
Casino is a fantastic movie with a very long and detailed storyline that stretches out to nearly three hours but it never stops being interesting and enjoyable.The cast of this movie is all brilliant and inspired,Robert De Niro,Sharon Stone and of course Joe Pesci all deliver very impressive performance,James Woods is also very good in this movie as usual but I was disappointed that he wasn't really in it that much,I thought he would have a much more important role in the movie because i've always found his acting very impressive.My only problem with the movie really is that it could have been less detailed and also,my same problem with Goodfellas,is the fact that they get different characters narrating,it should all revolve around one characters point of view so we can hear their story instead of different peoples point of views.It should have all been Robert De Niro's point of view and not changing it to Joe Pesci at times and some other characters as well.A must see for fans of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro movies.Story of Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) as they begin running a casino business and let their greed get the best of them.
Elysium is a fantastic movie with a great and different storyline and a really talented cast.This movie is the second film from District 9 writer and director Neil Blomkamp,and while Elysium definitely won't end up being as big as District 9,its still a very impressive movie and Matt Damon,Alice Braga and Jodie Foster all delivery very inspired performances,the character and the overall movie was very different for Damon and I was very impressed with him.The biggest problem I had with the movie was that at times they made the camera seem like one person was just running around with a camera in a Cloverfield sort of way,I found this annoying and very pointless and is was not needed.I highly recommend all fans of Matt Damon,Neil Blomkamp and sci-fi see Elysium.With only five days left to live,Max (Matt Damon) makes a plan to escape from the run down planet Earth and make it to Elysium,where only the wealthy live,and bring peace for his planet.
Captain Phillips is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.I don't know how Tom Hanks didn't at least get an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role,he was outstanding as Captain Richard Phillips,a very different character from what he ha played in the past,and he also puts on a great Yankee/Irish accent.The most impressive performance in this movie has to be Barkhad Abdi (who did get a nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role),he is a very new actor,this being his film debut,and judging from how amazing his performance in this movie was,he has a great career ahead of him,anyone who can manage to steal the show from Tom Hanks (I never thought I would say that) is obviously a very good actor.The film is very dramatic and Paul Greengrass does an outstanding job directing,I wasn't sure someone who's best known for the Bourne films could direct a dramatic film based on a true story,but he did a great job.Captain Phillips is a great movie that I would recommend to all moviegoers,especially if you're looking for a good drama and thriller.Based on the true story of Richard Phillips,who was the captain of a ship that was hijacked by Somali pirates,the first hijacked ship in over two hundred years.
Wayne's World 2 is a great movie with a well written storyline and a great comedic cast.If you are a big fan of the first Wayne's World,don't expect this one to be just as good,but it still is enjoyable and has many funny scenes.The cast were still as positive as the first and seemed like they were still having a lot of fun together,however,I didn't like how they rehashed a few jokes from the first,mostly coming from the two main characters,they picked a couple of lines that worked out well the first time and repeated them,which I found lazy and was certainly my biggest problem with that movie,but most if the new jokes were very funny and entertaining.Fans of the first Wayne's World will definitely be disappointed,but Wayne's World 2 is still definitely worth the watch.When he can't decide what he wants to do with his life,Wayne decide to put on a big concert with several popular music bands to get big.Best Performance: Mike Myers Worst Performance: Ralph BrownIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Need for Speed is a great movie with a very enjoyable storyline and a very talented cast.The story is certainly nothing new or original,and the trailers don't make it seem like its going to be any different to the Fast and Furious movies but it is very enjoyable and dosen't feel like a carbon copy of previous car related films.What made this movie for me was its extremely confident cast,I am a huge fan of Aaron Paul,because of Breaking Bad of course,and I didn't think he would be able to deliver the same level of great acting as he does in Breaking Bad,but,while Tobey Marshall is certainly not Jesse Pinkman,he still delivers an outstanding performance,he clearly has a great movie career ahead of him and this is his first film since Breaking Bad finished,and there's no doubt he has more great performances ahead of him.I also really enjoyed Imogen Potts and Dominic Copper's performance,these are two actors I've heard of,but haven't seen in anything previously,but after seeing them in this I look forward to seeing them in more films.After he is let out of prison,Tobey Marshall sets out to seek revenge against the man who framed him for the death of his friend.

Goldfinger is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a talented cast. It's certainly not a perfect movie, it has many flaws and also has the same cheesy dialogue that all the Bond films suffered with in the 1960's and 1970's, but it's still a very enjoyable movie with some of the most memorable scenes in Bond history, such as the laser scene and of course the villain himself, Goldfinger. Sean Connery is at the top of his game in this movie, portraying Bond with pure confidence and class, I never felt he was the greatest Bond, but from watching this I can see why many others do. Action packed and a ton of fun, Goldfinger is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. 007 is assigned to investigate the evil empire of Auric Goldfinger and discover what they are up to.

The Lorax is a funny,enjoyable movie for the whole family to watch and enjoy,with a great message to it delivered with great animation from Illumination Entertainment,a great new animation studio making some great movies with some more planned that sound great.This movie also had a terrific cast,particularly great roles from Danny DeVito as The Lorax and Ed Helms as The Once-ler,two very funny comedy actors.Also some great roles delivered by Zac Efron,Taylor Swift and Betty White.A boy named Ted (Zac Efron) searches for a way to grow a tree to win a girl called Audrey (Taylor Swift) in a world where there are no tree,grass or animals.He gets his grandmother (Betty White) to show him where to find The Once-ler (Ed Helms) to tell him how.
The Expendables 2 is a brilliant movie with a good storyline and a top notch cast.Its managed to do what action movies rarely do,make a sequel that improves from the first.I enjoyed the first Expendables,but this one was much more action packed,also,by biggest problem with the first Expenndables is that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis only had one brief cameo,which was probably one of the best part of the movie,and it was re\ally disappointing they didn't stay for the rest of the movie,they clearly noticed this and made them main characters in this,and to make it even better they added Chuck Norris.I was disappointed Jet Li wasn't in it very much because he's really good in the first,but Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham are still great in it.If you enjoyed the first Expendables,you'll love this one.When the gang reunite for what seems like an easy job,they seek revenge after one of their men is unexpectedly killed.
American Gangster is a fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline and a very talented cast.Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe both matched their characters perfectly,which I was surprised with because they both didn't seem like characters they were use to playing,it also was a very different movie for Ridley Scott,and he did a very impressive job with it.The character development in this movie is practically perfect,you mostly follow Russel Crowe and Denzel Washington's characters,and I didn't feel like they left out a lot of information and really took their time letting use get to know these characters.I would highly recommend American Gangster to all fans of gangster crime films.Set during the seventies,Richie Roberts (Russel Crowe) will stop at nothing to bring down the massive drug business of the dangerous and highly wanted Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington).
The U.S. Office is a brilliant television series with terrific writing and an outstanding comedic cast. If you're a fan of the U.K. Office, this is quite different, it is much more fast paced and the characters and humour is significantly different, but it didn't take me long to get use to this style as it is simply so funny and enjoyable. All the cast potray their characters perfectly, Steve Carell is obviously the star as Michael Scott, but I also love Dwight, Jim, Pam, Andy, Kevin, Erin, Darryl, Angela, Stanly, Creed, Phllyis, the list goes on and though Michael is the best part of the show, he couldn't have done it without them. The series does go down a bit after the seventh season when Carell leaves, but not significantly, the rest of the cast do their best to fill the missing gap without Michael, and though it is certainly not the same, they still do a great job. The last episode is one of the most emotional finales of a television series I've ever seen, it works out perfectly and is the Office finale that the fans wanted and deserved. Hilarious and even at times quite sweet, the Office is a great ride filled with so much lovable characters, I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy series. A documentary crew follow the daily work lives of a small paper company in Scranton, Dunder Mifflin.

Tango & Cash is a good movie with a decent storyline and a cast that clearly had a lot of fun making this movie.It is nothing spectacular,there are several good action scenes and some very funny parts as well.The highlight of the movie was without a doubt the chemistry between Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell,the two were clearly friendly with each other and were looking forward to making the movie together.It was interesting to see Teri Hatcher in one of her earliest roles,but it was very obvious that she was very new to acting and did deliver a very good performance,but she has gone on to prove that she really is a great actress,this movie just isn't a good example.Tango and Cash is a quick and fun movie,it's not great but I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent action or comedy.Ray Tango (Sylvester Stallone) and Gabriel Cash (Kurt Russell) are the best cops in LA but when they're framed for murder,the pair must work together to clear their names and bring down those responsible.Best Performance: Kurt Russell Worst Performance: Teri HatcherIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Rear Window is a fantastic,very memorable movie with a great script,story,cast and characters.It is largely considered one of the greatest movies ever made,and thats no surprise with all the thrill,suspense and mystery that keeps you watching and wondering.But this movie wouldn't be the same if it wasn't for terrific directing from Alfred Hitchcock,and terrific acting from brilliant actors such as James Stewart and Gene Kelly,some of the best actors of there decade.Lb 'Jeff' Jefferies (James Stewart),a photographer who badly broke his leg and is in a wheelchair,is stuck in his apartment all day with nothing better to do than to spy on his neighbors.Himself and his love interest Lisa Carol Fremont (Gene Kelly) think they may have heard a man killing her wife,they decide to investigate.
Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is a great movie with a fantastic and well thought out story line,a brilliant cast and amazing characters.Its the fourth installment in the Indiana Jones series,and its currently the worst,without a doubt,but its still very good and a happy return to the franchise.I only have two problems with this movie,obviously I don't like the infamous 'nuked fridge' scene,and I also don't like Shia LaBeouf,I got very worried towards the end when he was about to put on Indiana Jones hat,luckily Harrison Ford took it off him,Harrison Ford is the only man I want to see playing Indiana Jones,I don't want to see any Mutt Williams movies.Indiana Jones is back when he gets involved in a Soviet plot to uncover the Crystal Skulls.
Hard Eight is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast.The storyline is not extremely interesting or exciting,it all relies on writing and performances ,two things which I think this movie succeeds very well at,if the characters dialogue wasn't so well written and the actors failed to deliver natural performances then this movie surely would have failed,but it did very well on both grounds.The best performance has to go to Phillip Baker Hall,his character was very unique compared to anyone I've seen in any other movie and was certainly given the best lines,Sydney is a very memorable character.I don't have much complaints about this movie,I'm giving it an eight because I didn't think it was outstanding,but it knows what it wanted to be and certainly succeeded at that.It has great characters and very natural performances,I would recommend Hard Eight to anyone looking for a good drama or crime film.

GoldenEye is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.This movie is the first James Bond film starring Pierce Brosnan,arguably one of the best Bonds,and he proves from the very first scene that he is definitely suited for the role.The movie is action packed and thrilling from start to finish,Sean Bean is a great and quite terrifying villain and Izabella Scorupco is a really great Bond girl,her character development and acting is very high standards compared to some previous love interests of Bond,it usually only matters on their looks but she was very attractive and a very good actress as well,the only performance I didn't appreciate was Alan Cumming,he was clearly there for comic relief but I didn't find him funny and his characters catchphrase ("I am invincible") was irritating.GoldenEye is a great movie that fans of Bond,action or thrillers will definitely enjoy. James Bond tries to discover who is behind the destruction of a space weapon center.Best Performance: Pierce Brosnan Worst Performance: Alan CummingIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Conan the Barbarian is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a talented cast.It's action sequences are fantastic and it is filmed very beautifully.,it didn't seem to have a huge special effects budget so they used as many real locations as they could and they picked some really great areas that suited the tone of the movie perfectly.Arnold Schwarzenegger was a great choice for Conan,he had the right build and his accent and macho personality suited very much.The biggest problem is mainly that it takes itself way too seriously,there is little to no comic relief the lighten the mood,it is simply a dramatic movie from start to finish.Action packed and still holds up very well today.i would recommend Conan the Barbarian to anyone looking for a good action. A powerful barbarian sets off to avenge his deceased parents.

Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier is a decent movie,it isn't awful but it is the worst Star Trek movie,and it shows that directing really isn't William Shatner's thing,he obviously decided since Leonard Nimoy directed the previous two Star Trek movies,but he didn't do nearly as good as Nimoy.The movies story seemed very promising,but it ended being very little story and a lot of not very entertaining action sequences.The only thing that really made this movie enjoyable was,like usual for Star Trek,the cast is brilliant,and I also was surprised with how much I enjoyed the ending.I don't think that the Final Frontier is awful but it's without a doubt the worst Star Trek and fans of the franchise will be very disappointing.Captain Kirk must take on Spock's half brother Sybock,who seizes the Enterprise to travel to space's final frontier to find the Almighty.
American History X is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.The movie is very compelling from start to finish as we follow Edward Norton's character,who starts off as a Nazi supporting racist,he was completely unlikeable,but there was always hope that he would change.The movie is definitely hard to watch at times,particularity the scenes in prison are very graphic and emotional,the movie is rated R for a reason,no parents should allow their kids to watch this.The only aspect of the movie that really bothered me was the transition from colour and black and white throughout the movie,I understood why they were doing it (black and white when he was in a dark place) but I didn't really appreciate it or thought it was necessary.American History X is a great movie that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good crime or drama. A neo-Nazi begins to see the error of his ways in jail,only to find that his brother is following the same violent path.Best Performance: Edward Norton Worst Performance: Elliot GouldIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
How I Met Your Mother is a brilliant television series with a very well developed and detailed storyline that spreads out in to nine seasons and an outstanding comedic cast.The character development is outstanding,we learn so much about Ted (Josh Radnor),Robin (Cobie Smulders),Barney (Neil Patrick Harris),Lily (Allyson Hannigan) and Marshall (Jason Segel) throughout the course of nine years,you learn to love these characters very early on in the series and hope for the best for all of them as we watch their future progress,the show came out a year after the final season of Friends,and it was certainly a great replacement.The series last season is certainly the worst of the nine,I'm not going to lie,it made some risky choices that might not have worked out as well as the writers thought,I'm not sure how I feel about the last episode,it contradicted a lot of character development and had an unanswered question,after nine seasons,you would expect everything to be wrapped up.It will hit your funny bone as well as your heart,How I Met Your Mother is a fantastic series that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great comedy series. Follows the story of Ted Moseby,as he tells his two kids the story of his life leading up to the day he met their mother.

21 Jump Street is a brilliant movie with a well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. It is filled with pure and sincere laughs from start to finish, certainly one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time, mostly made brilliant with the terrific chemistry between leads Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, you could tell that they got along very well on the set and enjoyed working together. The movie was also quite heartwarming at times and the characters developed surprisingly well, those are two significant things that make a movie great, as we symphatize with the characters more, but comedies like this usually don't bother with it, I was very impressed that this movie did. Absoluteky hilarious and very enjoyable, I would highly recommend 21 Jump Street to anyone looking for a good comedy New police officers Schmidt and Jenko are sent on an investigation to a high school to find and catch a group of people involved in a drug ring occurring in the school.Best Performance: Jonah Hill Worst Performance: Jake Johnson If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Shallow Hal is a good movie with a well written storyline and a great comedic cast.The movie is written and directed by the Farrelly brothers,who have made some outstanding comedies,and while this may not be some of their best work,it is still filled with loads of hilarious scenes that you'd know while watching that they wrote it.Jack Black is certainly the best part of this movie,he was really interested and confident about his character and it certainly showed on screen,he also had great chemistry with both Gwyneth Paltrow and Jason Alexander.I thought that the jokes about Paltrows character being really fat but the audience seeing her as skinny gets really old after a while,but it just keeps gong until the end of the movie,which was certainly the weakest part of the movie,it's funny for a bit,but seeing a woman with a great figure manage to break a chair or eat a two person milkshake on her own just gets old pretty fast.Shallow Hal certainly has flaws,but it is funny and unique and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick and fun comedy.When looks obsessed Hal is hypnotised in to recognising only the inner beauty of women he soon falls for Rosemary,a very obese woman,but he only sees the beauty in her.Best Performance: Jack Black Worst Performance: Susan WardIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Behind Enemy Lines is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a talented cast.It is very enjoyable,although I think the main thing it wanted to be was a war film,which it didn't particularly succeed at,they're suppose to have very dramatic moments and some really intense scenes that make us feel like the main character is in genuine danger and could die at any moment,there wasn't much of that in this,it has a lot of comic relief,which I will admit was pretty funny but it really took away from being a good drama.I don't think Owen Wilson was great casting for the lead role and they didn't give us a reason to really care for his character before he is put in great danger.However,Gene Hackman certainly saved this movie and is the main reason why my rating isn't lower,he delivers a really dramatic and inspired performance and his dialogue was the closest thing to making this feel like a proper war movie.Its not a great War film but it is action packed and has some good moments,I would recommend Behind Enemy Lines if you ever see it on television,but don't go out of your way to watch it. The US navy must rescue one of their own when he is shot down over enemy territory.Best Performance: Gene Hackman Worst Performance: Vladimir MashkovIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Ray is a great movie with a good storyline and a brilliant cast. There are many elements of mediocrity to this movie, but they are all mostly saved very powerful acting from Jamie Foxx, who delivers a magnificent performance as Ray Charles, he is completely in character all the way through and if you read the trivia you will see all the very impressive preparation he did for this film. The movies biggest problem is that it isn't very well written, the story is quite messy and it transitions from different periods in Ray's life in a very unbalanced manner. I also didn't particularly like how it ended, it just stops in the middle of Ray Charles career, tells us what he did with the rest of his life, and then just randomly throws in another scene that was unnecessary and was only used to give us more sympathy for the title character, which definitely wasn't needed as we had already fallen in love and supported this character previously. Ray could easily have been a brutal film, but because of very powerful performances from all the main cast and some very beautiful directing, it is instead a movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or biography film. Follows the life and career of blind musician Ray Charles who rose to fame during the 1950's because of his terrific singing and piano skills.

The Guard is a great movie with an enjoyable story and a fantastic cast.The movie is a pure Irish comedy,I'm not sure if I've said this before on this site but I live in Ireland,I am Irish,and this type if humour is the kind Irish people love,particularly a cop that has no care for his job.Although I think getting high profile actors like Brendan Gleeson and Don Cheadle is what made the movie much more popular and well known,and really opened up Irish comedy to much more people outside of Ireland,which I was very impressed with.The movie is definitely hilarious and there will be many scenes that will keep you laughing,if you love comedy,then I would highly recommend the Guard.A feisty Irish policeman and an high class American FBI agent work together to roll up an International drug gang.
Blood Work is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.I certainly have come to expect from Clint Eastwood than this,it's nowhere near his finest work,but the movie is still a good crime film,it is quite slow for a long period of the movie,but once everything comes together it is very intense.Clint Eastwood's performance was great and I'm sure he had a field day playing that character,I also appreciated the acting from Wanda De Jesus and Tina Lifford,also Jeff Daniels character was great as comic relief for a very serious movie,although I didn't like any of Angelica Huston's scenes,she just didn't suit her character.The twist towards the end is very good and unexpected,it was certainly the movies highlight,once it happens it seems kind of obvious but you will likely never realise it until it happens.Not Clint Eastwood's finest film,but it's still very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime film or drama.

The Terminator is a great movie with a terrific,action packed story from start to finish and a good cast.The movie is very well known,still today,and all that credit has to go to Arnold Schwarzenegger,who plays a breathtaking performance as the Terminator himself from start to finish,his performance is brilliant,and no one else could have done a better job.A robotic assassin from the future comes to kill Sarah Connor,who's son will grow up to lead humanity in a war against machines,its up to Kyle Reese to protect Sarah. -DILLON HARRIS
The Heartbreak Kid is a good movie with some very funny scenes,as well as some cringe moments,its not terrific from what you'd expect from the Farelly brothers (Dumb And Dumber,There's Something About Mary),but its this a watchable movie,its just not the Farelly brothers or Ben Stillers finest moment.I said before that I thought Me,Myself And Irene was the Farelly worse,but I would say it was better than this,but both of them are definitely not the brothers worse movies.I preferred Me,Myself And Urene because I just generally prefer Jim Carrey to Ben Stiller,Dumb And Dumber definitely being my favourite thing hes ever done.Eddie (Ben Stiller) is upset at his ex-wife's wedding on valentines day.He meets a girl named Lila (Malin Akerman).They fall in love and Eddie asks Lila to marry him after three weeks.But,at the honeymoon,Eddie feels hes made a mistake.
X-Men: The Last Stand is a decent movie with an alright storyline and a great cast.This movie is without a doubt a disappointment and the weakest moment in the X-Men series to date,it made so many risky decisions for the characters,and none of them end up being good ones and were very unsuccessful with fans,Bryan Singer had no involvement in this movie,and it is noticeable from start to finish.The acting is a little weak in this movie as well,not because they're genuinely bad actors,which they're not,but they clearly just weren't inspired by this mediocre script,it also dosen't try hard enough to make you care about its characters,particularity Cyclops.Fans of X-Men will definitely be disappointed,and I would only recommend watching it if you see it on television and have time to kill,or if you're like me and want to follow the film series. The X-Men face a new threat,the development of an enforced cure for mutants.Best Performance: Ian McKellen Worst Performance: James Marsden If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Man is a below average comedy movie with a predictable storyline with two good main cast members that don't end up doing well because of a huge lack of chemistry.There definitely were a few funny moments in this movie,but definitely not enough to make this a comedy I could watch again.I really like Samuel L Jackson,and he is definitely the best part of this movie,his character didn't bother me but Eugene Levys character had just as much, if not more, screen time,and his character was very irritating which would be the main part this movie was not very enjoyable.If your looking for a fun comedy for a laugh all the way through,the Man should definitely be avoided.A tough undercover cop uses an innocent salesman in his bid to expose an international arms dealer
The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant movie with a fantastic and inspired story line,based off a short story by Stephen King and a terrific and truly inspired cast,their isn't very much not to like about this movie.It is currently number one on the IMDb Top 250,I definitely don't think it deserves to be number one,the Godfather is better,but I do think it deserves to be high up on the list.Tim Robbins is great in this movie,but Morgan Freeman is the really star.Anyone who likes crime dramas and prison break movies will love this movieAndy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two lifetimes in prison when he is framed who killing his wife and her secret lover.He is miserable but soon makes a good friend in the wise Red (Morgan Freeman).
American Pie is a fairly good movie,with good humor and a funny storyline,its a total teenage movie but its better than average ones.The story lines sort of stupid and the characters are extremely immature for there age,but thats what makes it so funny and definitely better than the sequels.After there friend loses his virginity,for friends all promise to lose there virginity before they graduate,with the prom coming up,its the perfect opportunity for them,but it proves more difficult than they thought.-DILLON HARRIS
Sex Drive is a decent movie with some funny scenes and some good cast members but its definitely nothing great,its not hilarious and nothing I've never seen before.It reminded me a lot of the American Pie movie and I could definitely imagine this being one of those sequels.However the cast wasn't great,I did enjoy Seth Greens appearance,who I am a big fan of,and I also liked James Marsden performance because he seemed into that role,unlike most of the cast,and I didn't even realise until the credits that it was him.Ian (Josh Zuckerman) is a desperate virgin and meets a girl on the internet who he goes cross-country to meet her and lose his virginity.However,he starts to feel like he might be in love with his best friend Felicia (Amanda Crew).
Hugo is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.The movie looks absolutely beautiful and it is no surprise it won Academy Awards for achievements such as visual effects and art direction.Its brilliantly directed by one of the greatest directors of all time,Martin Scorsese,but don't expect to be seeing a movie that's anything like Goodfellas or the Departed,it is nothing like anything Scorsese has made previously,it's not his finest film but it's certainly his most unique.There really isn't anything quite like Hugo,I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or adventure.

Remember The Titans is a great movie with a very good story line,a fantastic cast and inspired characters.The movie is very inspirational,especially with Denzel Washingtons incredible acting and would teach any racist person a lesson they need to learn,you judge people on their personality,not by the color of their skin.The actors are all very impressive in this,and there are also plenty of scene's to laugh at and can be very funny at times,although the movie is suppose to be dramatic,you will find yourself laughing several times.Herman Boone (Denzel Washington)begins coaching a football team called the Titans,he musts white people and African-American's together,as the town is very racist and Boone wants the bring the races together.
In Bruges is a great movie with a terrific story line,an outstanding cast,great characters,some very funny scenes and plenty of violence.Martin McDonagh does a great job with this movie as usual and Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleesons performances are incredibly good.If you enjoyed this movie,I would definitely recommend you see Martin McDonaghs most recent film,Seven Psychopaths,also starring Colin Farrell in the main role,you will definitely love it if you loved In Bruges.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are sent to Bruges in Belgium after an illegal job goes wrong.But Ray wants nothing more than to get away from Bruges.
The Pink Panther is a hilarious movie with a great story,mystery and a talented cast,particularly Steve Martin and Kevin Kline.I've loved this movie since childhood and I've seen it a million times,and each time I see it,it keeps me laughing.Its extremely underrated by critics,and that goes as well for the sequel,there both hilarious,and I wish they ended up making a much of these as they did with the original Black Edwards franchise.Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin) and his partner Gilbert Porton (Jean Reno) work together to find who stole The Pink Panther diamond and murdered its owner.Clousea isn't very bright and causes a lot of trouble with the case,and trys to hook up with the murdered mans wife,Xania (Beyonce Knowles).
American Hustle is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast that all deliver magnificent performances.Every actor delivers a performance unlike any role they've aged in the past,you won't believe that Irving Rosenfeld is played by Christian Bale,he went through a massive transformation,he clearly put on so many pounds for this character which shows how dedicated he is,amazing and unique performances were also delivered by Amy Adams,Bradley Cooper,Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner.I also really appreciated they they put Louis CK in this movie,I'm a huge fan of his stand up and his series Louie,he is one if the funniest people on the planet and he clearly got the improvise a lot of his lines because a lot of the things he says are completely his humour.American Hustle is an outstanding movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great crime drama. An FBI agent forces a con man and his wife to get involved with the mafia in order for him to solve his case.

28 Days Later is a good movie with a great story line and a very talented cast.However,I admit I was honestly very disappointed by the movie,I was expecting it to be a scary movie where I would be looking away a lot and I would be interested from start to finish,but I honestly found it boring a lot of the time and even scary bits were still dry and not anything that would give me nightmares,and still liked the movie but it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be and I was very disappointed by how little it scared me.A small amount of survivors come together twenty eight days after a deadly virus has hit the UK and try to find a place where they can live peacefully.
Catch Me If You Can is an amazing movie with a terrific story line,a great cast,plenty of action,comedy,drama and even some very surprising heart involved in the movie,I was very surprised with Carl Hanrattys sincerity towards Frank Abagnale Jr.,it is an amazing,and hard to be believe,but true story.The cast of the movie is brilliant,especially Leonardo DiCaprio,Tom Hanks,Christopher Walken,Martin Sheen and Amy Adams,in my opinion,they all seemed very interest in there roles.The true story of how Frank Abagnale Jr.(Leonardo DiCaprio) forged millions of dollars worth of checks as he faked his name and pretends to be a pilot,doctor and other important occupations.
The Hobbit is a fantastic movie with an amazing storyline,great cast,terrific characters and some great action and humor,bringing us some more very impressive work from Peter Jackson.It isn't as good as the Lord Of The Rings trilogy,but prequels never usually are,but it stills tells a great before story,and its better than other prequels,such as Star Wars.The original cast,such as Ian McKellen,are brilliant and manage to look younger,even though they are actually much older now,and the new actors do a terrific job,such as Martin Freeman,an English actor who's starred in some terrific British television series,but has never had a role as big as Bilbo Baggins,but manages to stay cool about this amazing role he got.Taking place 60 years before Frodo heads off on his journey,Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) heads on an unexpected adventure with a group of dwarfs so that they can get back there stolen mountain from a dragon,the dwarfs are lead by Gandalf (Ian McKellen).
Donnie Darko is a good movie with a great and unique storyline that is very creepy and filled with weird and unusual.I thought it was enjoyable,but it certainly isn't my kind of film,a lot of the dialogue was really unusual and the characters,especially Donnie's,personality is often depressing,I can definitely see why some would love this movie but it isn't something I would want to watch again and again.The best part of this movie was without a doubt Jake Gyllenhaul,he is a very talented actor and he got to show it off with movie in the main role,and delivered a very strange but also inspired performance.While I found Donnnie Darko genre mix very unusual,I still think a lot of people could enjoy it,I recommend it to fans of both mystery and sci-fi.Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaul) is forced by a human sized rabbit to commit many unusual crimes in the twenty eighth days hr claims are left before the end of the world.
Scream is a great movie with a really clever storyline,with a good twist and also a great cast.Going into this movie I thought it would be really scary and I would possibly get nightmares from it,but it certainly wasn't,I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be or not,but a lot of this movie was really funny,and the overall story of the film was a lot of fun to watch as well.I really enjoyed Courteney Cox's performance as Gale Weathers,it was very different than anything else I've seen her in,and it actually took me awhile to realize it was her,I also really liked Matthew Lillard's performance.Fans of really scary horror movies will be disappointed,but people who don't like them too scary,a like a bit of comic relief should enjoy this.As a killer in a mask begins killing off teen angers,Sidney (Neve Campbell) and her friends use the rules and cliché of horror movies to survive.
Monsters University is a fantastic movie with a terrific storyline,a very impressive voice cast and such lovable characters.I was kind of worried about this movie since I heard of it,I have such a fond memory of Monsters Inc from my childhood,and I was afraid Pixar were going to mess it up.It wasn't perfect and wasn't better than Monsters Inc (but I didn't expect it to be) but I was very pleased and their was nothing about the origin of Mike,Sully or Randall that I wasn't impressed with,although I do feel that Randall's story could have been a bit more dramatic,because he is much too evil in Monsters Inc but his back story to be that plain,but the whole story of how Sully and Mike meet and finally become friends is perfect,I love these two characters very much and I was very pleased.Its not Pixars best movie,but its just as heartwarming and funny as some of their best and has humor for the whole family to enjoy.I would definitely like to see another prequel from the studio another Monsters Inc would be great,Pixar know how to make prequels.Story of Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan as they attend Monsters University with high hopes of becoming scarer's.The two don't get along at first,but must work together t make it to the top.
Green Zone is a good movie with a well written storyline,a good cast that are put in to roles that don't particularity suit them,but they still do a decent job.I thought the set up for he movie was really good and it started off very exciting,but after awhile the story got weak and continued to get weaker.As for the cast,I think Miller was a character that did not really suit Matt Damon,and war movies are not for him (I know he's the title character in Saving Private Ryan,but he isn't a very main character),although he does do the best can.I thought Greg Kinnear's character didn't suit him at all,he is very much a comedy actor and this movie is very serious,it wasn't a good casting decision,also in all his scenes with Damon all I could think of was Stuck On You.Green Zone certainly has its flaws,but as a thriller and war movie it can still be enjoyable and it isn't too long either,certainly worth the watch.A US Army Officer is sent to Iraq in 2003 to find weapons of mass destruction,but he then stumbles upon a political conspiracy.Best Performance: Matt Damon Worst Performance: Greg KinnearIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Scrooged is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic comedic cast.This is certainly not a cliché Christmas Carol remake that usually follows the same basic storyline,Scrooged is a very original version of the classic Charles Dickens story that is hilarious mostly because of a fantastic and inspired performance from Bill Murray as he plays a character that does feel very much like the Murray equivalent of Scrooge.I loved this movies take on the Three Ghosts of Christmas Eve,they were very different from previous versions,they were played by very comedic actors that were very much able to work with Murray and possibly improvised several lines which was absolutely hilarious. Scrooged is a modern day Christmas classic that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or a nice movie to watch during the holidays. A selfish TV executive,who will stop at nothing to further his career,is visited by three ghosts to learn his lesson before Christmas arrives,as his television network prepare for live broadcast of Charles Dicken's A Christmas Carol.Best Performance: Bill Murray Worst Performance: Bobcat GoldthwaitIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Due Date is a hilarious movie with a great story line,a terrific cast and brilliant characters.I found the movie to be extremely overrated by critics,I think it had plenty of laughs while still bringing plenty of heart,and Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis made a hilarious pair,and Ethan's dog Sonny just made things better.Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) must travel across the country with Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis),who is trying to become an actor,along with his dog,in order to make it home to his pregnant wife before the baby arrives.-DILLON HARRIS
The Internship is an alright movie with a pretty stupid storyline and an overall uninspired cast.I did appreciate Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson,Rosa Byrne and especially Will Ferrell's cameo,but the rest of the cast were all very unlikeable,and throughout the entire movie I was hoping Will Ferrell would come back,and thinking about what a much better movie Wedding Crashers is.I didn't even really want to see this movie,but my friends were going seeing it so I decided to go with,I probably would have rented it when it came out on DVD,but after seeing it,Ia certainly don't want to see it again.There are certainly a lot of funny bits in this movie,but its not enough to make up for a movie that's much longer than it should be and all the scenes that just poke fun at how old Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are.I wouldn't recommend it.When two best friends lose their job,they sign up as interns at Google with hopes of working there full time,the only thing is,they know nothing about how the search engine works.
Johnny English is a great movie with a fun storyline,great cast and characters,with some very funny and cringe worthy scenes and a great spy spoof to it as well.I've always enjoyed Rowan Atkinson,his characters are always hilarious,and while Johnny English isn't close to Mr Bean or Blackadder,he still delivers and outstanding,laugh out loud performance.After an unexpected attack on M15,Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) becomes the only spy in Britain and its up to him to crack the case. -8/10 -DILLON HARRIS
Along Came Polly is a good movie with a good,however very simple and predictable story,but it still is fairly enjoyable,with some fairly funny scenes,but its not a laugh out loud comedy and nothing is extremely funny.I enjoyed Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston,but I do think that they weren't a believable couple.I also enjoyed Philip Seymour Hoffman,in a role that was very different from what you would usually see him in,and I enjoyed Hank Azaria's role,who is an actor I always enjoy,mainly because of his work on The Simpsons,and that he is very good at impressions.Reuben (Ben Stiller) is recently married to the girl of his dreams,Lisa (Debra Messing),who who is already dishonest on the first day of there Honeymoon.Reuben goes back home and meets a girl he knew a long time ago,Polly (Jennifer Aniston),who he begins to fall in love with.
Godzilla is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.I think it is definitely the beginning of a great franchise,but this movie had a few flaws that definitely bothered me.A huge problem what that the dialogue was a that very lazy,especially from Ken Watanabe's character,he is a great actor so the problem is not him,it was the awful dialogue his character was given,he says basically every line in this movie with no passion because the lines he was given are ridiculous.My biggest problem however was Bryan Cranston (spoiler ahead),in the trailers he is made out to be the main character,it fact I thought of this movie more as a Bryan Cranston movie with Godzilla than a Godzilla movie with Bryan Cranston,because that's really how the trailers made it seem,and I was looking forward to see him become the main character of a new big franchise after Breaking Bad,but the trailers were a complete lie,because his character dies in the first twenty minutes,and we are left to follow Aaron Taylor Johnson for the rest of the movie,who is good but you just don't care about his character as much as you do for Cranston,and the fact he died really bothered me for the whole movie.Other than that,Godzilla and the other monsters look fantastic,the effects are ground breaking,you won't believe he isn't real for a second.The monster fights are outstanding and are certainly the best part of the movie.It certainly has it flaws,but Godzilla is still a fun and action packed summer movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action and adventure film. The world and it's very existence is threatened by giant monsters attacking several cities,and Godzilla is the only one who can stop them. Best Performance: Bryan Cranston Worst Performance: Ken WatanabeIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Vanilla Sky is a brilliant movie with a really well written and extremely well developed storyline with a very talented cast who clearly understood the script to this very confusing and beyond strange movie,take my word,the moment it ends,you are going to feel very weird.I've always loved Tom Cruise as an actor,but this is nothing like he's done in the past and he offers a very impressive performance,I also really liked Cameron Diaz,Penelope Cruz,Jason Lee and Kurt Russell,they are deliver very unique characters that gets even more strange as the movie continues.Vanilla Sky is filled with twists and turns that will keep you watching in confusion all the way through,you will find out what's going on in the end,and you wont be mad you kept watching.David Aames (Tom Cruise)is a very successful playboy who's truly living the dream,but after his jealous ex-girlfriend destroys his face in a car accident,David finds his life changing before his eyes.
Monty Pythons Meaning Of Life is a terrific movie,although it is not as good as the three films,And Now For Something Completely Different,Monty Python And The Holy Grail and Life Of Brian.But it still is a brilliant and hilarious movie,my favorite sketch definitely being the song at the beginning about birth and the Grim Reaper scene.The Monty Python gang,Graham Chapman,Eric Idle,Michael Palin,John Cleese,Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam return in there fourth and final film taking us threw life broken up into separate parts,birth,middle age and death leading up to the answer to the question everyone asks,whats the meaning of life?.
Land of the Lost is a good movie with an enjoyable storyline that is filled with lots of fun imagination.The comedy is certainly a mediocre one,and not the kind of gold we expect from Will Ferrell,but there are plenty of very funny scenes on this movie that make it a very watchable movie.The best part of the movie was definitely the on screen chemistry between Will Ferrel,Anna Friel and Danny McBride,I didn't, however enjoy Jorma Taccone as Chaka,he should have only been there for one seen,because he wasn't funny for an entire movie.While it certainly isn't an outstanding comedy or even close to one of Will Ferrell's finest,but Land if the Lost is certainly good enough to check out for a few laughs. A scientist sets out to prove time travel exists and ends up trapped in a world of Dinosaurs with two new friends.
What Lies Beneath is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very impressive cast.The movie is a bit slow to begin with,and at times I was confused with where the story was going,but once the plot comes together and when the audience is aware of what is going on it becomes very horrifying and also very realistic,there is paranormal activity in this movie but there is also some real life horror that I found even more frightening,also Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Fords characters seemed like such normal people to me and not just cliché horror movie characters that it really added to what made this movie feel real.There is also great chemistry between Pfeiffer and Ford which was an important part to make these characters believable,and it's beautifully directed by my favourite director Robert Zemeckis. What Lies Beneath is a very intense movie with some great twists that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good thriller or horror. A housewife believes her new home is haunted by the spirit of a murdered neighbour,but they soon find out the truth lies closer to home.Best Performance: Michelle Pfeiffer Worst Performance: Diane ScarwidIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Minority Report is brilliant movie with an incredible story line that is very unique and has a very clever twist to it that I didn't see coming at all,but I won't say what it is to anyone who has not scene this yet.The cast of the movie is fantastic,Tom Cruise delivers an amazing performance,as usual,I know he is probably very weird in real life,but this mans acting skills are incredible,I haven't seen anything with him in it that I don't like.Colin Farrell also does a great job in this movie,I knew he was in it but I didn't realize till about a half an hour later that it was him because he does a great job of hiding his Irish accent,something he rarely does in his movie,but he did an impressive job.Fans of sci-fi and Tom Cruise will love this movie.A police force that have three psychics that convict criminals before they convict the murder discover that the main chief of the force will commit a murder within 36 hours.
Don Jon is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant comedic cast that can also be dramatic at times.This film is the directorial debut of Joseph Gordon Levitt,he did a great job and I hope that he makes more movies in the future,it had a lot of heart which I really didn't expect because of its storyline but it was surprisingly sweet as well as very funny.Other cast members such as Scarlett Johansson,Julianne Moore and Tony Danza did a great job,none of them play characters that are anything like what they've done previously.Unique and very funny,Don Jon is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or romance. A man with an obsession with pornography tries to get over it as he begins a relationship with a woman he feels he really loves.

The Men Who Stare at Goats is a great movie with a really well developed and extremely unique and unusual storyline and a fantastic cast that all play characters that are different to what you would usually see them in.The best performance has to be George Clooney's, I'm seen him in several comedies but thus is the first time that I genuinely found him to be the funniest character in the movie,Ewan McGregor,Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey also deliver great performances. Fans of both war and comedy movies should definitely check out the Men Who Stare at Goats.A journalist may have found the story of a lifetime when he meets a man who was part of the US Army who claims he has been professionally trained to gain super powers.
A Time to Kill is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.It is a very dramatic movie that feels very real and I found it hard to watch at times,not because it was really violent or graphic because it wasn't it was just because the situation these characters were in was an awful thing that really could happen and I felt like at times it was a lot to take in,particularity Matthew McConaghey's very deep speech towards the end.The performances are simply outstanding and were the main reason I found it hard to watch,their characters reactions were so realistic and they felt so human,I particularity found Samuel L Jackson hard to watch,he was so impressive playing this dedicated father,but it was so depressing and emotional watching him try to deal with what happened to his daughter.A Time to Kill is a fantastic movie that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great crime film or drama.When his daughter is abused by rednecks,a dedicated father takes revenge.Now on trial for murder,his lawyer is his only hopeBest Performance: Samuel L Jackson Worst Performance: Ashley JuddIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,or Borat,as most people would call it,is a great movie with a hilarious story from start to finish and a brilliantly inspired performance from Sacha Baron Cohen,playing one of his Ali G Show characters.Borat is now his best known characters because of this movie,I constantly hear people,poorly,impersonating him,and lets hope he continues to make more movies with funny and memorable characters.Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) heads to America to film a documentary of the country,but finds it hard to get use to things there,being very different from his home country Kazakhstan.
Punch-Drunk Love is a mediocre movie with a messy storyline and a decent cast.I was really looking forward to seeing this because everyone tells me it's a career changing movie for Adam Sandler,and while I will admit it is nothing like what he has done before,I don't see whats so good about this movie,the camera work looks really cheap and I don't find most of the scenes very funny,as well as that,they try to tell a love story while doing a really comedic one at the same time,and when I felt like the movie was coming to an end it felt like neither of those stories were properly wrapped up.Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance was great and he was certainly the highlight of this movie,I didn't know he was in this and when I saw him it was an absolute breath of fresh air,Sandlers character was funny at times but I was mostly just annoyed by him.Punch-Drunk Love is considered brilliant to many people,but honestly I don't what it is that makes it so good,it is unique but not in a way you'd want it to be,and I honestly wouldn't recommend it. A man is starting a love life he never thought he'd have,while he is also being blackmailed by a telephone service he rang one night.

Million Dollar Baby is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an amazing cast that deliver all around superb performances.The movie is a very dramatic one,and as the film continues it becomes very depressing.The characters are very well written,they are so human like and feel extremely realistic,they don't deliver any lines that make it so obvious that they are written.But that credit dosen't just go to the writers,big credit also goes to,of course,the actors,Clint Eastwood,Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman all deliver brilliant performances,and it's no surprise that Swank and Freeman received Academy Awards for their performances.Another very impressive actor in this movie is Jay Baruchel,an actor who I've only previously seen in comedies,and while I like him in the comedies I've seen him in,I never thought he could be good in a drama like this with the cast he stars with,but he actually did a great job,he clearly understood his character and got really interested in his personality,which then gave him a great performance.Million Dollar Baby is a great movie that I would recommend to all moviegoers.A very determined female boxer works with a professional but cranky trainer to become a professional.
Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home is a very enjoyable movie with a simple storyline and,like there always is in Star Trek,a brilliant cast.It's certainly not the best Star Trek movie,and it's definitely the least exciting,there isn't an awful lot of spaceships and aliens in this movie,but it did feel like we got some time to really know these characters in a much less serious scenario.What I liked the best about this movie was that they fit a lot of comedy in it,Star Trek dosen't try to be funny a lot of the time,but this movie showed they do have a sense of humor.Fans of Star Trek won't be getting a big action-packed science fiction movie,but they will get a sweet and funny story,and you'll probably surprised with how much you enjoy itKirk and his crew boldly go back in time in search of the only thing that can save Earth in the distant future,humpback whales.
The Big Lebowski is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. With it's very goofy set up and even its characters, you wouldn't expect very big performances from the cast, but they all deliver superb acting, they were all taking a huge risk with this very unusual film, and they ended up making a good choice. My favourite scenes are definitely any one between Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, the chemistry between the two of them is terrific, they both play very unique characters, nothing like any of their previous roles. It's definitely longer than it needs to be, it's nearly too hours long, and with the story being as ridiculous as it is, this can get a little bit tiring after a while, but it is mostly entertaining and hilarious throughout. Very different and packs in plenty of laughs, I would recommend the Big Lebowski to anyone looking for a good comedy. A man must cope with being mistaken from a millionaire who owes a lot of money, and receives the help of his bowling buddies to seek revenge. Best Performance: Jeff Bridges Worst Performance: Tara ReidIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Paul is a hilarious movie with a great storyline and great sci-fi spoof,with two brilliant writers and actors,Simon Pegg and Nick Frost,with everything they did together always turning out hilarious,there main great pieces of work being Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz.Two nerds hoping to publish a comic they created at Comic Con,Graeme (Simon Pegg),who illustrates the comics and Clive (Nick Frost),tour Area 51 in a caravan to get a true feel of alien existence.They stumble upon a real alien,Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen),who is on the run from the FBI.Graeme and Clive help to return him to his ship to return home before he is caught,along with Ruth (Kristen Wiig),who Graeme is falling for.
The Expendables is a fantastic movie with a good storyline and a very strong cast that know how to act in an action movie.The movie is action packed from start to finish,and some scenes are so brutal you'd want to look away from it,a very impressive job from Sylvester Stallone.The cast of the movie is incredible,Sylvester Stallone,Jason Statham,Jet Li and even Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger make a cameo appearance,but I was disappointed they didn't stay longer because their characters strong personality was very promising.I would highly recommend the Expendables to all action movie fans,it won't disappoint.Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone),a CIA operative starts a team to take down an evil dictator and an even worse CIA agent that has betrayed his country,they also must save the dictators daughter from being killed.
How The Grinch Stole Christmas is a fantastic Christmas classic from the genius mind of Dr Seuss,with a touch of Looney Tunes magic from Chuck Jones,this is one of my all time favorite Christmas classics an one that I always have to watch at Christmas time.In a town named WhoVille lives a monster called TAhe Grinch,all the people of WhoVille are getting ready for Christmas,but The Grinch has a heart two sizes too small and Christmas is his least favorite time of year,so he decides,along with his dog,to steal all the presents,Christmas trees and food from every house in WhoVille.-DILLON HARRIS
My Left Foot: The Story of Christy Brown is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very impressive cast.I thought this movie would be incredible but in wasn't nearly as good as I expected.I found it very boring at times,but Daniel Day-Lewis really made this movie what it is,his acting is incredible and inspired and he deserved the Academy Award for his performance,but I don't think Brenda Fricker did,I didn't find her performance that impressive.The movie did tell us the story of Christy Brown perfectly and put us in his position all the way through,but I am Irish,and I thought this movie would make me feel very proud of my country,other than Daniel Day-Lewis,it didn't really.If you enjoy dramatic biography movies and Daniel Day-Lewis,this movie certainly is a must see,but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I thought it would.Adaption of Christy Brown's autobiography of how he overcame cerebral palsy to become an artist and author.
Rope is a fantastic movie,which is no surprise from an Alfred Hutchcock film,and a fantastic.The movie is short and sweet but it does offer as much thrills as it can in eighty minutes,and I found it amazing how they could do it all it such short time and with it all taking place in one room.Its not his finest performance,but James Stewart never fails,and his performance of Rupert Cadell was well done and professionally acted from start to finish.Two young college students kill a close friend after they are convinced that inferior people don't belong in this world,they hold a dinner party to see if anyone picks up the clues that they have murdered someone.
Braveheart is an absolute fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline that contains both a lot of action and a lot of heart,with very strong,powerful and inspired performances.Even for people who aren't from Scotland,this movie gives you great pride from the country you came from,it is all beautifully made and William Wallace is without a doubt Mel Gibson's finest performance,and his most impressive movie as a director.I also loved Brendan Gleeson in this movie,he isn't a very important character,but he is such a good actor and gave me so much pride for the country I come from,Ireland.Braveheart is a highly recommend movie for all moviegoers,those five Academy Awards don't lie.After his wife is sentenced to death by an English soldier,William Wallace leads a group of Scottish warriors to battle against the English for their countries freedom.
The Social Network is a good movie with an impressive telling of a true story of the trouble Mark Zuckerberg,with a very impressive cast that stay true to the roles they are playing,my favourite actor in this movie being Andrew Garfield,whos performance of Eduardo Saverin was outstanding,in my own opinion,but I would also give credit for impressive acting to Jesse Elsenberg and Armie Hammer for playing two people,the Winklevoss twins.The story of how Harvard University student Mark Wahlberg (Jesse Elsenberg) created a social networking site that would soon become known as Facebook and make him the youngest billionaire ever,but he cant make that much without making a few enemies.
Unbreakable is an outstanding movie with a very well developed storyline,a really talented cast and very impressive character development.People have given M. Night Shayamalan guilt in the past for being a terrible movie maker,but you must give credit where credit is due,because when he makes a good movie it's a very good movie.Bruce Willis's performance is fantastic,certainly nothing like any character he's played before,but Samuel L. Jackson's performance is certainly the best,it's an extremely unique character that once again is nothing like any character Jackson has ever played,his characters are always usually loud and curse an awful lot,he is best known for those characters and I love him for it,but in this movie he showed that he can be so much more than does characters when he wants,this character was so interesting and strange and Jackson suited him perfectly.Similar to the Sixth Sense,the movie has several very unexpected twists that will mess with your head when you find out but will also make you wonder why you didn't realise this earlier.Unbreakable is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great drama or mystery. After a disastrous train crash leaving almost every passenger dead,the one survivor discovers that nothing can hurt him,he seeks help from a comic book collector to find out if he is truly a real life superhero.

Body of Lies is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast that deliver very dramatic performances.I find this movie very underrated,after watching it I thought it would have gotten several Academy Award nominations,but it has none,and no other big film awards or nominations either.The movie is beautifully directed by Ridley Scott,the movie is very real and that's what makes it so intense,it terrified me watching this knowing that all these events are very plausible,and it kept me at the edge of my seat all the way through.The best performances are definitely from Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Strong,their characters personalities are nothing like anyone they had played in previous films and their impressive acting added to the intensity immensely,I liked Russell Crowe as well but he wasn't in it enough,although it did make sense for his character to not be around often.Body of Lies is an intense and dramatic movie that I find very underrated and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great thriller or drama. A CIA agent attempts to track down the leader of a Jordanian terrorist cell by inventing a fictitious rival.Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio Worst Performance: Golshifteh FarahaniIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Three Stooges is a brilliant,hilarious movie,its just a laugh out loud comedy from start to finish with a great storyline,characters and cast.The movie will take you back to the old days if you are a dedicated fan of the original Three Stooges,but it will also entertain kids of all ages who aren't familiar with these characters,with some up to date stuff so the kids don't get confused,such as i-Phones and Jersey Shore.Its exactly the kind of movie you would expect from the Farrelly brothers,there movie this reminds me the most of is Dumb And Dumber,which reminds of Laurel And Hardy if they where alive today,and this movie is basically what The Three Stooges would be like alive today.And surely if they can bring back The Three Stooges,they can bring back Dumb And Dumber,lets hope a sequel gets made sooner than later.Moe,Larry and Curly head on an adventure to make $830,000 to save there orphanage where they have lived all there life.They meet a girl named Lydia (the beautiful Sofia Vegara),who says she'll give them the money if they kill her husband,who she pretends is very sick and wants to end it all,but she actually wants him gone because she is having an affair with his best friend.
Coming To America is a brilliant,hilarious movie with a great story,characters and cast.Eddie Murphy did a fantastic job as Prince Akeem,Clarence the hairdresser and the Sexy Chocolate guy,who where all very funny.I also thought Arsenio Hall and James Earl Jones did a fantastic job,and altogether makes for a great movie with a great cast.Definitely some of Eddie Murphys better work.Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) is tired of always being pampered.When he turns 21,he decides to head to New York to find his own princess instead of getting his father King Jaffe Joffer (Jammes Earl Jones) to find one suited for him.
I Love You Man is a fantastic movie with a great story line,a brilliant cast and hilarious characters.I really found nothing to dislike about any of the cast members,Paul Rudd and Jason Segel are both some of my favourite actors,Rashida Jones,Jon Favreau,JK Simmons and Andy Samberg are all hilarious in their roles,and the original Incredible Hulk,Loe Ferigno,also plays a very good roles as himself in the movie.The story to the movie is plain and simple,but the cast makes the best of it.Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) is getting married,but doesn't have any close friends,he must find someone to be his best man before his wedding day,luckily he meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segel),and the two become quick close friends.
Rush Hour 3 is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific comedic cast.The movie certainly isn't as good as the first two Rush Hours but still a very funny film and of course action packed.Like the previous two,Chris Tucker is without a doubt the highlight,it is very rare in all three movies when a scene where he does most of the taking isn't hilarious,the scene with the nun communicating French to Tuckers character had me in stitches and is without a doubt one of my favourite scenes of all three movies.Rush Hour 3 is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or action,and fans of the first two Rush Hours will most likely enjoy. The two mismatched policemen must hunt down Triad gangsters in Paris who are attempting to kidnap a French woman.Best Performance: Chris Tucker Worst Performance: Hiroyuki SanadaIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Pee-wee's Big Adventure is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great comedic cast.The movie is not heartwarming or has anything like character development or an intriguing story,it is simply a funny comedy,and honestly,that's all it really needs to be,it's certainly not one of my favourite movies but I didn't go beyond five minutes without something making me laugh.This movie is the directorial debut of Tim Burton,and he did a great job,he has gone on to prove that he is a great and very unique director,and this very unusual movie was given to the right person to film it.Funny,short and sweet,I would recommend Pee-wee's Big Adventure to anyone looking for a good comedy if they have some time to kill. Pee-Wee Herman sets off across America in pursuit of his stolen bike and gets embroiled in a bizarre adventure.Best Performance: Paul Reubens Worst Performance: Alice NunnIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Pretty Woman is a decent movie with a pretty simple,cliché story line,but there is a good cast.The movie is a chick flick,but they usually have some kind of conflict,Pretty Woman is just two hours of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts going to different places with each other and showing off how in love they are,although I did think both these actors gave their best to this simple,plain movie,and they definitely had good chemistry on set,and if it wasn't for their impressive acting,I would be giving this movie a much lower rating than 6.Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) falls in love with a prostitute (Julia Roberts) he meets at Beverly Hills and begins spoiling her with his wealth.
Walk the Line is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast and great character development that really brings the real life story of Johnny Cash to life.Joaquin Phoenix delivers an outstanding performance as the man himself,Johnny Cash,it is really hard to believe that it's him,especially with such a beautiful singing voice,and that goes double for Reese Witherspoon,I'm never been a huge fan of her as an actress,but her performance as June Carter is absolutely outstanding,an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role dosen't lie,her singing voice is also beautiful,even more impressive than Phoenix's,I honestly didn't believe they sung all on their own but the trivia days they did completely,which really surprises but also shows how dedicated their performances are.Fans of Johnny Cash,drama and biography films definitely won't want to miss Walk the Line.Tells the life story of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix),as we see the beginnings of his challenging and stressful music career as the fame begins to go over his head and he begins to fall for his music partner June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and starts having an affair with her.
Lost In Translation is a good,emotional movie with a heartwarming storyline.It shows us that that Bill Murray is able to act outside of comedy,and he does it brilliantly.I also appreciated Scarlet Johannsens work,this movie being the first one I've seen of her and I suppose it would one of her first,if not her first,major role in a movie.I found the ending to be sad and bit of a disappointment for what I felt was going to happen with this couple,but it was a good ending because it was realistic,and that what the whole movie was,it wasn't a big movie with an unusual storyline and special effects.Bob Harris (Bill Murray),a movie star who's high point of his career ended a long time ago,is feeling depressed while filming for a Whiskey commercial in Japan.Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson),is also depressed because she is recently married and is feeling neglected by her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi).When Bob and Charlotte meet up though,there depression goes away as the two start an unexpected relationship,and start to forget about the things bringing them down.
Bridesmaids is a fantastic movie with a very well written storyline with a tone of very funny scenes and an outstanding comedic cast.The films storyline is certainly nothing original but a cast that were clearly very interested in this script and very likable characters make this movie very enjoyable.Kristen Wiig,Maya Rudolph,Rosa Byrne,Chris O'Dowd among many others offer great performances in this film,but the breakthrough character of this movie is without a doubt Melissa McCarthy,her character is simply hilarious,and is certainly the most quotable,everything she says or does is simply gold.Bridesmaids is a hilarious movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy.After her best friend gets engaged,Annie (Kristen Wiig) is given the difficult task of being Lillian's (Maya Rudolph) maid of honour,but the other bridesmaids prove to be her biggest concern in organising the wedding,especially Helen (Rosa Byrne).
Iron Man is a brilliant with a very well written storyline and an outstanding cast.Iron Man is just a brilliant superhero and I couldn't imagine anyone doing any better as billionaire Tony Stark than Robert Downey Jr.,who is a great actor at being both dramatic at times and hilarious at times,he suits the character and it's a great example of perfect casting.Stark is definitely one of Marvels funnier characters and do movie delivers some great action sequences as well as dome hilarious scenes.Iron Man is a great movie that I would recommend to all Marvel fans.Billionaire Tony Starks life changes after he is kidnapped by terrorists and builds a robot which he uses to escape the terrorists,the machine is able to fly and shoot bullets.He builds a better version which he then decides to use to fight evil and calls himself Iron Man.Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr. Worst Performance: Jon Favreau If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline,a terrific cast like their always is in Star Wars and fantastic and extremely lovable characters.This movie is definitely not as good as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back,but I was still very pleased with this finale and it was a great send off for these characters,especially for Darth Vader.I think the main problem is that it got a bit too cute and lost a lot of the darkness from the previous films,mainly with the Ewoks,although they really were adorable.Fans of the original Star Wars trilogy won't like it as much as the previous two,but will still very pleased with this fitting finale.In his final adventure against the Empire,Luke must save Han Solo and the rest of the crew from Jabba the Hutt,destroy the second Death Star and face the fact his father Anakin Skywalker has been taken over by Darth Vader.
22 Jump Street is a fantastic movie with a very well written storyline and an outstanding comedic cast.The movie is such an impressive comedy sequel,probably one of the most impressive ones to date,it improves in many ways on its predecessor,which is something the majority of sequels usually fail to do,it is very rare that a sequel is released that is genuinely better than the original,but this one really is.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are back,and their combined chemistry is once again one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie and what really makes it so fun.The storyline is basically the same as the first,but the movie and it's characters are completely aware of that and make jokes about it constantly,they are certainly some of the funniest parts of the movie,and the scenes during the credits had me laughing non stop.22 Jump Street is a really enjoyable movie that fans of the first one and fans of comedy in general will definitely be impressed with. Jenko and Schmidt are sent undercover to a college to investigate another drug ring and catch the people who are involved. Best Performance: Jonah Hill Worst Performance: Jillian BellIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Hook is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie gave me great joy and wonder all the way through,Robin Williams was perfect casting as Peter Pan as he has a childlike sensibility but can also deliver more dramatic acting when it is needed,Dustin Hoffman also did a great job as Captain Hook,it seemed like a strange choice to me but he really became the character,this is certainly the best acting I've seen in a Peter Pan film.Steven Spielberg did a great job making this movie,the sets are absolutely beautiful,if it was made just a few years later this would have been mostly special effects,but luckily it didn't and this movie is all props and real locations which makes it look some much better and you can see the hard work everyone put in to this film.The only casting choice I didn't appreciate was Julia Roberts,I think she's a brilliant actress but she just didn't seem interested in playing Tinkerbell and didn't get sucked in to the childlike wonder of this film like everyone else clearly did.Very underrated film,I don't see why it gets treated so harshly,I loved Hook from start to finish and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. After his kids are taken away by Captain Hook,Peter Banning must return to Neverland and become Peter Pan once again in order to save his children. Best Perfornance: Robin Williams Worst Performance: Julia RobertsIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Number 23 is a brutal movie with a really poorly written storyline that dosen't know whether it's a thriller or a horror and a very unprofessional (apart from Carrey) cast.Jim Carrey is the only relief in this movie and I would definitely be giving this a lower rating if it wasn't for his surprisingly dedicated performance,he deserved so much better than this,I don't think he should stick to comedies,he has proved many times in the past that he can do dramatic roles,but I hope he just picks better scripts when he hopefully does dramas in the future.Other than him,the rest of the cast didn't seem like they even knew what was going on in this movie,every line they delivered seemed like they were reading off a piece of paper for the first time,they were simply not able to follow the script,but it's understandable because the script was really confusing and messy.It has some thrilling twists but the movie isn't engaging enough for anyone to care,I wouldn't recommend the Number 23 to anyone. A mans life starts to echo that of a main character in a book his wife bought him for his birthday.Best Performance: Jim Carrey Worst Performance: Virginia MadsenIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Hot Shots is a good movie with a good story line,a great cast and plenty of hilarious scenes.Its from one of the writers of Airplane and Naked Gun,but this movie certainly doesn't have as memorable or funny scenes,and no lines that you will find yourself quoting for the rest of your life.But its still a decent funny movie,better than Top Gun,the movie it parodies,I'm never been a big fan of Top Gun because its just very boring and extremely cheesy.I did get a good kick out of seeing Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer,starring alongside each other long before Two And A Half Men,I find Jon Cryer very funny,and is the only reason why I still watch the new Two And A Half Men episodes.Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) must save a mission that has been sabotaged by weapon manufacturers.
Poltergeist is a fantastic movie with a clever and creepy storyline and a very talented cast.The movie has a perfect balance of being very scary,but at the same time very entertaining,which is great because there are a lot of movies that are so scary that you cant enjoy the movie very much because your too scared,but there is a perfect mix in this,and I wouldn't have expected anymore when the script is written by Steven Spielberg.I really enjoyed Jobeth Williams in this movie she is a very good actress,and I also found her very attractive.A family's house gets haunted by several ghost who posses their daughter,the parents must why a way to stop the strange things occurring in their house.
Breaking Bad is a magnificent,outstanding and completely original television series that is filled with fantastic character development,action and an endless amount of highly intense and un-forgetful scenes .The series starts off fairly promising,and then as it continues it just gets better,over the course of five years,it never a goes downhill,and there isn't a single bad episode in the whole series.I think people were skeptical when the series first came around about the the dad from Malcolm in the Middle starring in a drama,but Bryan Cranston delivers an exhilarating performance in this,Walter White is nothing like Hal and thus proves that Cranston's range is amazing and he truly is a great actor,the change in Walter over the course of these five seasons proves that.But Cranston shouldn't have all the credit,no actor in this show comes across as unprofessional,but the outstanding actors have to be Anna Gunn,Aaron Paul,Dean Norris,RJ Mitte,Betsy Brandt,Bob Odenkirk,Jonathan Banks,Giancarlo Esposito,Charles Baker,Matt Jones,Jesse Plemons and Krysten Ritter are all some of the series best characters and incredible actors and they all deserve so much credit for making this's series so great,and of course,Vince Gilligan,for his incredible writing and directing skills,this show would be nothing without him.My favourite characters of the entire series are without a doubt Jesse and Mike,their personality are something that really appeals to me,and their development over the course of the series is very pleasing,I loved Walter as well,but I never felt like I could relate to him,not that I would want to.All in all,Breaking Bad is a fantastic series,it never disappoints and I would recommend it to everyone.Walter White (Bryan Cranston),a highly intelligent high school professor,joins the crystal meth business using his amazing skills in science to create a high quality and addictive product,after he learns he has lung cancer and wants to make enough money for his family to use when he's gone.
The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is a great movie with a pretty good storyline and a brilliant comedic cast and unique characters.I watched the movie because I really like Steve Carell and Jim Carrey,this definitely wasn't the comedy gold I was hoping it would be,but I did find it really enjoyable and very funny at times,definitely underrated by critics.I also really appreciated Olivia Wilde,Steve Buscemi,James Gandolfini(may he Rest In Peace) and Alan Arkin's performances.It was definitely two very different characters for Steve Carell and Jim Carrey,they wern't as likable as their characters usually are,but I still enjoyed both of them,because their characters were suppose to be like this and they played them like that very well.The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is certainly not a perfect comedy,but its better than average,and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun comedy.Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carell) and his assistant Anton Marvelton's (Steve Buscemi) magic shows become very unpopular after a new unique magician,Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) comes along.They decide to do more risky stunts for publicity.
Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back is a fantastic movie with a brilliant storyline even better than A New Hope.The cast are just as good as they were before,they are all clearly very talented actors,and their characters are all so likable,we are introduced to some new characters in this,Lando Calrissian,Boba Fett,etc,but the most noteworthy is Yoda,without a doubt my favourite Star Wars character,with Darth Vader coming in at a close second.He is voiced by the very talented Frank Oz,I love the voice he gives Yoda (similar to his Muppet character Fozzie Bear and Grover from Sesame Street) and I especially love the way he speaks backwards,I find Yoda to be the most likable character of this trilogy.This movie is without a doubt a must see for all science fiction fans,the amazing performances and the shocking twist will not be a single waste of time.Luke must complete his Jedi training in Dagobah with Master Yoda while the Empire has returned after the destruction of the Death Star and Darth Vader's only intention is to find Luke.
Star Trek 3: The Search For Spock is a pretty good movie with a decent storyline but a very strong cast.It's definitely not the worst in the Star Trek film series,but it's not the best either.It doesn't live up to it's predecessor,Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan,but it's still a lot better than Star Trek: The Motion Picture.The Search For Spock still has a lot of great action sequences and although it's missing Leonard Nimoy for most of the movie,it's still delivers very strong performances from the other cast members,William Shatner is as good as ever in this movie as Cpatain James T. Kirk.While I feel huge Star Trek fans will be disappointed with the Search For Spockk,they will still get a good kick out of him and wont be entirely unimpressed.Captain Kirk (William Shatner) heads off with his crew on the Enterprise to the Genesis planet to save Spock (Leonard Nimoy,who also directs),who may still be alive.
Date Night is a good movie with a pretty well developed storyline that was in all honesty a lot more promising than the movie ended up,but its still very funny and action packed at times.The movies cast is fantastic and there are a lot of fun cameos throughout,the ones that really stick out in my head are Mark Wahlberg,James Franco,Mila Kunis,J.B. Smoove and Will i Am.I really like both Steve Carell and Tina Fey and thought the idea of them working together seemed like comedy gold,it certainly wasn't but the two of them still made for a fun movie.All in all,I would recommend Date Night to anyone looking for a short and sweet comedy to watch.Hoping for a romantic night out,a bored married couple mistakenly become targets for the mob after pretending to be a different couple to get a table at a popular restaurant.
The NeverEnding Story is a good movie with a great storyline and a lot of fun and imaginative characters.I find this movie very creepy at times for a family film,as a child it really creeped me out,and watching it today I still think it's very strange at times,most children will probably enjoy it but I think that protective parents should definitely watch this movie on their own before letting their kids watch it.The movie is a lot of fun and I love all the colorful animation and the characters,especially Falkor,I always wanted one of them when I was a child and I still think it would be awesome to have one today.It is a good family movie with a nice fairytale theme,but it can get creepy at times,especially towards the end,but if your children aren't very sensitive then its a movie for the whole family to enjoy.A lonely boy is transported to the magic land of Fantasia by a book,a land created by the dreams of people on Earth,and it is upto him to save this world from 'The Nothing'.
Dr Strangelove (OR How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb) is a fantastic,classic movie that is still well remembered today.It was written and directed by Stanley Kubrick,an amazing film director.The movies script is fantastic,its clever and also hilarious at times,and I find it amazing that something from 1964 can still make people laugh so hard,and probably one of the greatest end of a movie ever.The best of this movie is,of course,Peter Sellers,his characters in this are without a doubt the finest in his career.He's obviously best known for playing Dr. Strangelove in this movie,but he isn't actually in this that much,I thought his best character in this movie was Lionel Mandrake,this character was the funniest and also very creepy,I loved this character and it's without a doubt my favourite Peter Sellers performance.This movie is a must see for fans of classic comedies and war movies.When a psychotic general sets off a deadly bomb,a war room go insane trying to do their best to stop this bomb from happening.
The Blind Side is a terrific movie with a terrific storyline,cast,characters,drama and even a fair bit of comedy to make this movie a well deserved winner.Sandra Bullocks performance is absolutely amazing in this movie,almost too good to be true,the way you know an actor is good is if you don't feel like the actor is who they really are (like Heath Ledger as The Joker),and I found it very hard to believe that Leigh Anne Tuohy was actually Sandra Bullock,her accent was perfect and so believable,to think this was the same year she starred in All About Steve.A homeless boy named Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron),or as most people call him Big Mike,moves in with a wealthy family who he grows very close to as they encourage him to do well in school and to live his dream for American Football.
Cheaper by the Dozen is a good movie with a well written storyline and a talented cast.The movie is nothing hilarious or outstanding,but is certainly very fun and enjoyable,it's a good family film that contains enough jokes for both children and adults.Steve Martin is without a doubt the movies highlight and the person that holds it together from being a complete mess,although the entire child cast are actually quite good and are all of very high standards for their age.Cheaper by the Dozen is nothing fantastic,but it's still a fun ride and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. While his wife is gone to New York,Tom Baker (Steve Martin) must take care of their twelve children all on his own.

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast that are all too familiar with their characters at this stage in the series,which responds with outstanding and natural performances.I don't think it's the best of the Harry Potter films,but everyone of them is very good and this one is no exception,it continues to be both magical,enjoyable,at times quite intense and ongoing and very impressive character development for all the important characters.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a great movie that fans of the previous Potter films will definitely love. With Hogwarts under threat,Harry investigates Voldermorts past and learns the disturbing truth of his origins.Best Performance: Daniel Radcliffe Worst Performance: Evanna LynchIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Equalizer is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It ended up a lot better than I expected, I'll watch anything with Denzel Washington, but this appeared very cliché and typical from its trailers, offering nothing interesting or new material for moviegoers. While it may not have the most original set up and storyline, it makes up for it with a dazzling performance from Washington and Antoine Fuqua's cool and slick directing style, this saves it from being a boring movie. It's a very good franchise vehicle for Washington, he owns this role, his character has many flaws which manage to make the character more likable and help us symphatize with him more, but there is still a lot to learn about Robert McCall which future sequels could answer. It has its flaws, but the Equalizer mostly makes up for it by being a generally enjoyable movie, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or thriller. A man who decides to put his dark past behind him must jump back in to action to save a young girl who is under the control of Russian gangsters. Best Performance: Denzel Washington Worst Performance: Bill Pullman If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Gone Girl is an incredible movie with an extremely well written storyline and an absolutely outstanding cast.The movie is easily one of the greatest thrillers I have ever seen,some scenes are truly terrifying,mostly because all of the events in this movie could happen in real life.Ben Affleck does a fantastic job and this movie is easily a career highlight for him,and although these movies are nothing alike,it does give me new hope for him playing Batman.But I think the best performance was without a doubt Rosamund Pike,her character easily had the best dialogue,but she didn't seem like an easy character to play,but she delivered her performance perfectly,she was creepy,disturbing and many other horrible words that I can't say because it will ruin the movie,I really hope this will change Pike's career for the better,she really deserves it.Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris,two actors who I would previously only associate with comedy,actually pull off genuinely great dramatic performances,I really hope to see them in more dramas in the future,also a scene that involves Harris's character,which I won't but you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it,is certainly the movies highlight .Unpredictable,thrilling, mysterious and filled with twists,David Fincher and everyone involved in this deserve a huge path on the back for making what is possibly the best movie of 2014,I haven't given a movie ten out of ten in a long time,but Gone Girl deserves it,a must see. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is suspected of killing his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) after she mysteriously disappears although several evidence in their house suggest she was killed.

Dragnet is a good movie with a well written storyline and a great comedic cast.Its certainly not an outstanding comedy that made me laugh so frequently that I want to see it again,but it was fun while it lasted and it certainly had some good moments.It was weird seeing Dan Aykroyd in the serious role and Tom Hanks as a comic relief,because back then Hanks was not an A-list actor,but it really seemed strange to me that there was a time when Dan Aykroyd was bigger than Tom Hanks.Despiite feeling like these roles would have made sense the other way around,they both did great jobs,some of Aykroyds intellectual dialogue seemed very tricky,but he delivered it in pure confidence,Hanks character was very funny and there was great chemistry between both actors.Its nothing outstanding but still an enjoyable hour and forty minutes,I would recommend Dragnet as a good comedy to watch if you ever see it on television. A straight laced LAPD cop and his easy going new partner try to bust a criminal conspiracy.Best Performance: Tom Hanks Worst Performance: Bruce GrayIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Man With Two Brains is a great movie with a good storyline,cast,characters and some very funny scenes that keep you watching.Its a bit different from the usual films you see Steve Martin in if your a fan,like me,its like a romantic horror comedy.Steve Martin did a terrific job both writing and acting in the movie and Dr. Hfuhruhurr is very funny,I especially like the parts where he gets mad because no one can pronounce his name,if he was talking to me now he wouldn't be happy with me,because I certainly cant.Dr.Michael Hfuhruhurr (Steve Martin) is a doctor who studies and is fascinated with brains,and he meets the love of his life,Dolores Benedict (Kathleen Turner).However,he falls in love with a brain and wants to kill his wife and put the brain in her.
Coraline is a great movie with a clever and creepy story line,an impressive voice cast and brilliant characters.If you are a fan of the book,you will more than likely be disappointed by this movie,the book is a lot better,and a lot more scarier as well when you have the images in your head,rather than watching the animation in this.Still,this movie is very creepy for PG,and I strongly recommend protective parents,or parents with sensitive children avoid this movie,it is the kind of movie I would imagine a young child getting nightmares over.I really didn't appreciate the characters put in that weren't in the book,especially Wybie,if you read the book,you will definitely be wondering why he was born.Fans of the book will be disappointed,but will still appreciate the effort in this movie,and fans of clay-animation and creepy movies similar to Tim Burtons work,you will enjoy this movie.When she moves to a boring new home,Coraline Jones trys to find different ways to entertain herself.She discovers a door in the house that leads to another world,where her parents make a better effort with her,but it isn't all as great as it seems.
Diamonds Are Forever is a good movie with good action,good storyline,humor and a good cast.Its definitely not the best James Bond movie or even Sean Connerys greatest Bond film,but its still a decent film.Sean Connery is still largely considered the greatest Bond ever,passing out his later Bonds such as Roger Moore,Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig.I personally think that Pierce Brosnan is the greatest Bond,I always liked him and I actually know a woman who lives near me whos first cousins with Brosnan,I didn't believe it until see showed a picture of him and her when he was in his teens,and hes aged very well.However,I do understand why Sean Connery would be considered the best because he brought us some terrific Bonds,such as Dr No,but Diamonds Are Forever wouldn't be at the top of that list.A investigation on diamond smuggling leads James Bond (Sean Connery) and his partner Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) to Las Vegas,where Bond discovers a plan by his nemesis,Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
Rocky 2 is a great movie with a good and well developed storyline from Sylvester Stallone and a strong cast.I like how the movie takes place right where the first Rocky left off,but at times it kind of felt like a complete copy of the first one,he's training once again to fight Apollo Creed,but it didn't bother me too much because the main thing that I thought made the movie enjoyable was the development in Rocky and Adrian's relationship and his intense training.It made not be as good as the first Rocky but the cast still put all their heart in their performances.Fans of the first Rocky will be disappointed but will still enjoy Rocky 2 very much.Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone),the boxing underdog,is challenged to a rematch by the world heavyweight champion,Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers).
Dirty Harry is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It is a very enjoyable crime film that contains both thrilling scenes and also some stellar action sequences, it has a nice mix of both and neither feel overused. The role of Harry Callahan was perfect for Clint Eastwood, it was the right character for him, gave him the chance to stretch his acting skills a lot more and break free from doing westerns, it is one of his most memorable performances and it is clear throughout that he really connected with this character. Very well acted and quite thrilling, Dirty Harry is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good crime film or thriller. A maverick cop attempts to bring a cold blooded serial killer to justice before he kills again.Best Performance: Clint Eastwood Worst Performance: Harry GuardinoIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Beverly Hills Cop is a fantastic movie with a well developed storyline,a great comedic cast and good characters.It probably isn't his best,but its without a doubt one of Eddie Murphy's best roles,he's a very on and off actor,but when he makes a good movie,its really good.Sylvester Stallone was originally going to play Axel Foley,I'm happy that didn't happen,Eddie Murphy's too perfect.The sequels aren't as good,but I find them very underrated,there still pretty good,and I hope a fourth one someday,I don't like the idea of a TV series with Brandon T Jackson and Eddie Murphy's character only being recurring.Fans of Eddie Murphy and crime movies with a lot of comedy will love this movie.Axel Foley,a cop working in Detroit,heads off to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder off his close friend.
An Officer and a Gentleman is a great movie with a simple storyline that is very easy to follow but still very enjoyable,a very talented cast and a really beautiful soundtrack.I really enjoyed the love story in this movie between Richard Gere and Debra Winger,it was very realistic and unlike most romantic movies,they didn't make it too sweet,they kept it a serious and dramatic relationship that had a lot of problems instead of making them just be in love with each other for the entire movie.The movie certainly deserved both Academy Awards,Louis Gossett Jr gave a fantastic performance and Up Where We Belong is a really nice song.I would recommend An Officer and a Gentleman to fans of both romance and war movies,it dosen't focus too much on one,it focuses enough on both perfectly and one of the sweetest endings i've ever seen in a movie.Zack Mayo (Richard Gere),an uptight man training to be a navy pilot finds maturity through the love of Paula Pokrifki (Debra Winger).
Ghost Town is a good movie with an alright storyline and a great comedic cast.The movie is nowhere near to a perfect comedy,there are plenty of hit and miss,but Ricky Gervais's humour and personality makes it very enjoyable and I also really liked Greg Kinnear's character.Its nowhere near to anything like The Office or Extras,but the parts in this movie that do work out do it very well and the move is a short movie that you can get a good chuckle out of.Its not Gervias's finest work,but Ghost Town is a sweet and funny movie.Bertram Pincus (Ricky Gervais),a grumpy dentist,suffers a near death experience and consequently discovers he can speak to the dead.
Men In Black 2 is a brilliant movie with a great story,some very funny moments and great actors.I don't think it deserves to be rated as bad as it has,but I do agree that it isn't as good as the first,or even the third,Men In Black.But I still think its brilliant because I love all three and I would have to give this one credit for giving Frank The Pug a very main role,because he is one of my favourite Men In Black characters.A deadly alien terrorist might destroy the planet along with her partner (Johnny Knoxville).Agent J (Will Smith) is still with the MIBs with his new partner,Frank The Pug.However Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) is no longer part of the Men In Black and is the only person that has the information to stop the terrorist,so J and Frank have to find him and bring his memory back before its too late.
Dinner For Schmucks is a good movie with a funny story line,great cast and plenty of hilarious characters,the movie delivers plenty of laughs from start to finish,obviously it isn't a fantastic movie,and nothing inspired,but its a fun movie to watch with friends and you will be laughing.I really enjoyed Steve Carell's performance,his character Bary was hilarious,and I enjoyed Paul Rudd as well as I always liked him as an actor.Tim (Paul Rudd) is a rising businessman trying to make his way to the top,in order to do so he must bring an idiot to a big dinner party for his bosses to make fun of,he finds the perfect guest,Barry (Steve Carell).
Pearl Harbor is a terrific movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.I really don't understand why this movie gets so much hate,it's a good story and despite the historical inaccuracies,I think it stays true to the events in the way that the characters behave and the drama that develops throughout.Many people complained about the love story,saying that it was unnecessary,but I completely disagree,the development of these three characters and the love and rivalry that occurs makes their story a lot more personal, it is definitely what kept me watching for the whole three hours,it was sweet,romantic and tragic,and I don't think the tragedy at the end would have been any bit as upsetting without this conflict that was shown previously.Ben Affleck,Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett all deliver great performances,they really became these characters and were living in the moment for each scene,there was great chemistry between all three,and despite some of their lines being very cheesy,they certainly didn't deserve Razzie nominations.Where the movie does fall flat is the fact that it tried to be the Titantic of war movies,I get that it was a huge movie at the time and Michael Bay was trying to make his own version of it,but trying to be like another film is never a good mind set for filmmaking and that is certainly a significant part of why many people criticized this movie.It may have a few flaws,but I still had a great time watching Pearl Harbor and certainly didn't consider it a waste of three hours,and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or war film. Follows the lives of two best friends as they enter the war as pilots and both start to fall for the same woman.

A Million Ways to Die in the West is a great movie with a very well written storyline and an outstanding comedic cast.This movie is getting g a lot of negative reviews that I don't think it deserves,it may not be Seth MacFarlanes finest work,but he took on a risky project that I think he did a great job with,his directing was very impressive and the western area looks beautiful.I think Seth MacFarlane did a great job acting in this movie as well,it's his first film where he plays a character that he dosen't voice,and I think he came across as very confident and hope this isn't the last live action film role.The movie has a very talented cast including Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson who play characters that are nothing like what they've done before,and there are also some outstanding cameos in this movie too that I won't spoil.A Million Ways to Die in the West is very enjoyable and very funny movie that fans of Seth MacFarlanes previous work (Family Guy,American Dad,Ted) and comedy westerns will definitely enjoy. A man who is terrified of everything about living in the Wild West must face his fears when a vicious gunslinger arrives to town to get his wife back and battle the man who has been seeing.Best Performance: Charlize Theron Worst Performance: Gilbert GottfriedIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Stardust is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.It certainly wasn't the fun fantasy movie I was expecting it to be,it did look beautiful and I won't deny that many scenes were very enjoyable visually,but it simply wasn't as good as it could have been,although I know many people will disagree seeing that this has a 7.7 rating.The performances that stood out the most for me were the supporting roles and the cameos,Robert de Niro was terrific as he takes a turn at being the comic relief,Michelle Pfeiffer shines as Lamia,Ricky Gervais's cameo was a highlight for me,and Ian McKellen's narration was superb.I was really not taken with the lead roles,I know that Matthew Vaughn likes putting small actors in the lead,with a host of very well known faces to support them,but Charlie Cox and Claire Danes,for me,just didn't shine in any way,their characters were cliché,boring and with all the unique characters surrounding them I just kept losing more interest in their love story.Stardust is certainly not outstanding and has many faults,but its a fun fantasy and adventure that is worth a watch if you ever see it on television. A young man makes a promise to his loved one that he will retrieve a fallen star by entering a magical land,but his adventure is not as straight forward as it may have originally seemed. Best Performance: Robert de Niro Worst Performance: Charlie CoxIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Inception is a fantastic movie with an extremely well written and well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.The movie was clearly Christopher Nolan's passion project,you can tell he put all his heart in to writing and directing this film.The movie is certainly at times hard to follow,it can get very confusing,and I actually watched it a second time the following day just so I could fully understand it.The movies concept of entering in to peoples dreams was so interesting and I feel like we were only seeing a small part of the many exciting things that happened to Leonardo DiCaprio's character,I would love to see more but it dosen't seem like a movie they would ever do a prequel to.Inception is an outstanding and very unique movie that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great adventure or thriller. A thief who can enter the subconscious of his targets and steal ideas embarks on his final mission.Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio Worst Performance: Tom BerengerIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace is a great movie with a fine storyline from George Lucas,a brilliant cast and fantastic characters.A lot of Star Wars fans despise this movie and the rest of the Star Wars prequel trilogy,but I think its only because their comparing it to the original trilogy too much,I think there all very enjoyable movies and there much better than a lot of the bad sci-fis being made today.I do have a few problems with this movie,mainly Jar Jar Binks,like everyone else,I didn't care any bit for this character,he's just irritating and was obviously created by Lucas only for the younger audience,also I really liked Darth Maul's character and thought we could have seen a bit more from him.I liked most of the cast,Liam Neeson,Ewan McGregor and Samuel L Jackson being the best performances in my opinion,and I love Yoda,he is my favourite Star Wars character and his role in the prequels reminds me just how awesome he is,and any seen with C3P0 and R2D2 brings me joy.Whether you think it looks good or not,if your a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy,you have yo at least check out the prequel trilogy.Two Jedi Knights who have escaped from a hostile blockade meet a boy named Anakin Skywalker who they believe will bring balance to the force.
Shrek 2 is a fantastic film with a very well developed and original storyline,an outstanding voice cast and enchanting characters.It is a really impressive sequel,it continues the story of these characters in a great way and introduces a lot of new characters that make this movie even more hilarious and entertaining for family members of all ages, most importantly Puss In Boots.The movie has so much memorable lines and a really good soundtrack.Shrek 2 is a sequel that improves on an already great film,there really isn't much I can complain about,except maybe they got the characters to sing already popular songs too much, other than that it is a tone of fun for the while family and fans of the first will certainly not be disappointed.Immediately after their honeymoon,Shrek,Fiona and Donkey are sent to Far Far Away so Shrek can meet her parents.Things get out of hand when Fiona's father discovers that her daughter married an ogre.
To Catch A Thief is a brilliant classic movie with a terrific story line,a great cast and characters,and plenty of thrills,nothing you wouldn't expect from Alfred Hitchcock,one of the greatest directors of all time.Its definitely not his finest work,or even he scariest,but nothing he has done is bad,that is impossible,two of his main actors,Cary Grant and Grace Kelly,star in this,and this is Grace Kellys final film with Alfred Hitchcock,she will always be a great and very attractive actress,and I will always appreciate her work.John Robie (Cary Grant) is suspected of being the Jewel thief going around his town,but John hasn't robbed anything in fifteen years and must prove his innocence.
Men In Black is one of my favorite movies as a child,a true classic that showed us that Will Smith was more than just a Fresh Prince,Frank The Pug was always my favorite because a pug is the kind of dog I have now.I decided to watch the movie since the third one has came out,which I definitely will be seeing although I don't think it will live up to the original,the second one certainly didn't.A man is brought into a private group that defend people from aliens,along with help from the good aliens,and erase the memories of people who find out about there existence.Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) find themselves dealing with some serious intergalactic terrorists.
Face/Off is an outstanding movie with a breathtaking and intense storyline and magnificent performances all around.The two lead actors,John Travolta and Nicolas Cage,are amazing in this movie,they are two actors that I find very hit and miss,especially Nicolas Cage,an actor that I had never been really impressed with in the past,but I will forever respect both of these actors for their acting in this,they managed to pull off playing two different characters really well and stay through to the others personality,this didn't seem like something that would be easy to do,but Travolta and Cage pulled it off perfectly.I didn't see anything not to like about this movie and I don't know how it's not on the IMDb Top 250,it is a must see for fans of action and crime movies.Sean Archer (John Travolta) must stop a bomb set up by Caston Troy (Nicolas Cage),a terrorist who killed his son,by switching faces with him by a surgical operation,but he is put into prison and Caston disguised as Sean destroys every piece of evidence that they switched faces,so Sean must find a way to escape and prove who he really is.
Something's Gotta Give is a very mediocre movie with a very average storyline,but a talented cast.Its just a very plain and simple romantic comedy,Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton do their best with this boring script but they just aren't enough to make it very enjoyable.The movie was so predictable as well,I know you don't expect romantic comedies to be filled with twists,but I literally knew exactly what was going to happen in practically every scene.Somethings Gotta Give has it moments,but it's mostly just a mediocre romantic comedy that you would be better off avoiding. An ageing executive finds himself a trophy girlfriend,but when he meets her mother,a love triangle soon ensues.Best Performance: Jack Nicholson Worst Performance: Keanu Reeves If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Gullivers Travel is a decent family movie,it isn't hillarios,and it isn't very memorable,but it still fairly average family entertainment.I think it wouldn't have been a good as it was without Jack Black and Jason Segel,two actors I really like who made the movie for me.I thought the funniest parts was when Gulliver was pretending movies where stuff that happened to him.A man named Gulliver crosses the Bermuda Triangle while on a boat and is stuck in a world filled with little people.They treat him as a king because of him being the tallest man they have ever seen.-DILLON HARRIS
Pacific Rim is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.The film is without a doubt one that sci-fi fans will be pleased with,it's filled with giant robots fighting giant monsters,it is done so well but it also feels inspired,it dosen't feel like they made those scenes for the purpose of making money but because it was something they genuinely were interested in creating.If the action wasn't enough,this movie still manages to give terrific character development,something you certainly wouldn't expect from a movie like this,but you do really get the know the humans and to feel emotion for them,this movie gets extra points for doing that successfully while still focusing on action and high quality effects,because you would rarely see both of those things done well in this type of movie.The cast is outstanding,Idris Elba is certainly the most experienced actor,but I also really like Charlie Hunnam and Charlie Day,an actor best known for Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Horrible Bosses,I never expected to see him in a movie like this,but he did a great job and his character was certainly the funniest.Pacific Rim is an outstanding movie (that I really hope they make a sequel to),Guillermo del Toro was clearly inspired to make this movie,I would never expect a movie with robots and monsters to be so good in a point of view of character development and story,but this really was and I would highly recommend it to all moviegoers.When an attack on giant monsters threatens the end of the world,some giant robotic machines as big as the monsters ran by professionals is the only way to put a stop to them.Best Performance: Idris Elba Worst Performance: Burn GormanIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Robocop is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a very talented cast.Its a remake of the 1987 classic,and it is of course not as good,because movies don't get remade unless they were originally great,and a remake is just trying to strike the same goal the original movie did,and I'm pretty sure Hollywood has not succeeded in a critical stand point with that yet,but this movie is certainly one of the most enjoyable ones I've seen in a while,it helps that it isn't just a shot to shot remake of the original Robocop,and it is certainly better than the brutal sequels that followed the original.The best performances were certainly Samuel L. Jackson and Gary Oldman,Jackson probably had fifteen minutes of screen time altogether but every scene he had was terrific,I also really liked seeing Oldman's personality change throughout the movie.I wasn't very fond of Joel Kinnaman as RoboCop but I did like that they gave a relatively unknown actor a chance to play the part.Robocop is nothing outstanding,but as far as remakes go it is very enjoyable and I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or sci-fi and fans of the original should check it out. After a police officer is critically injured,a company named OmniCorp turn him in to a half man,half robot to fight crime. Best Performance: Samuel L. Jackson Worst Performance: Jay BaruchelIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Parental Guidance is a good movie with a funny,easy to watch story with plenty of very funny scenes that will have people of all ages laughing,mainly any scene with Billy Crystal,who is a great actor and clearly loves being one.The movie can be rather childish,but there still are plenty of scenes that will have a grown up audience laughing while the children myth not understand it.Artie Decker (Billy Crystal) is fired from his job as a sports announcer and his wife Diane (Bette Midler) tells him they have to mind there grandchildren for a week while there parents are away,and Artie finds to chance at a new job as an announcer.
South Park: Bigger,Longer & Uncut is a brilliant movie with a terrific storyline that really is bigger than anything else that was ever on the show (well not including the Imaginationland episodes) and a ton of scenes that will have you laughing out loud.The movie also has loads of great music numbers in it,i've seen this movie hundreds of times and these songs never stop being catchy,and Blame Canada should have won the Academy Award for Best Music,it's a much more memorable song than You'll Be In My Heart from Tarzan,but Trey Parker and Matt Stone later made The Book Of Mormon,a big Broadway musical that won a ton of awards.Fans of the television series will definitely not be disappointed by this movie.Stan,Kyle,Cartman and Kenny cause a lot of chaos when they go see the Terrence and Phillip movie and teach all the children off South Park some bad words.The parents of South Park work together to catch and kill Terrence and Phillip for making this movie,the boys must work together to save there favourite television actors.
Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle is a great movie with a stupid but hilarious storyline and a very comedic cast that clearly know comedy.The movie misses a few times,but it mostly hits and a lot of scenes in this movie are laugh out loud.My favourite character in this movie is without a doubt Kumar,but I also really enjoyed Neil Patrick Harris's performance,he did a really good job at mocking himself and I really enjoyed the Doogie Howser M.D. references.Fans of movies like American Pie,Porky's,etc,will really love this movie.Harold and Kumar are two best friends with promising careers,but are too distracted with a passion for getting high.They set off on a journey to White Castle to cure their munchies,the only problem is they don't know where it is.
The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring is an amazing movie with a great story,that was so epic they had to break it up in to three very long movies,that are so enjoyable,with an incredible cast and terrific characters.Peter Jackson is a very detailed writer and director,and he seems to avoid missing any detail in his movies,maybe a bit too much however,his movies are extremely detailed,and some scenes can be so detailed that they can get boring,but it still shows what a dedicated director he is,and how professional one man can be.A hobbit from The Shire,Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood)heads of on a journey along with many companions to destroy the Ring,that makes people insanely obsessed just by the look of it.
Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a brilliant movie with a very clever and different storyline and a very inspired cast.It is the first movie i've seen that was made by Guy Ritchie,and it gave me a great first impression,he clearly loves making films and his filmaking is very unique,I look forward to seeing his other films.The entire cast of this film are brilliant and put great heart into their roles.I was very impressed with Jason Statham,this being his film debut,but my favourite role in the movie was Vinnie Jones as Big Chris,he was a very strong character who was still able to love his son and I really liked his personality.I would highly recommend LocK,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to fans of crime films.A card game being held in London joins many people together in order to get their hands on money,weed and two antique shotguns.
Terminator 2: Judgement Day is a brilliant movie with a really well developed story line,fantastic cast and great characters.The movie is a sequel to the Terminator,and it is a totally fresh sequel,its even more action and Arnold Schwarzenegger's role in this movie is better than the first one,because he has more of a good guy character.I liked the T- 1000,but he didn't do a job as good as Arnold as a Terminator,these machines are suppose to show no kind of emotions or personality,but he did a lot,Arnold does a brilliant job of showing no emotion,even when he speaks,probably because of his accent,there will definitely never be a better Terminator.Fans of the original will definitely be pleased with this sequel.The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) returns,but this time he is programmed to protect John Connor from being killed by the T-1000,a machine programmed to kill him,several years before the war against the machines.
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a brilliant movie with a really well developed a really different storyline with a very talented cast that all match their characters very well.Robert Downey Jr,Michelle Monaghan and Val Kilmer all delivered performances that were both hilarious both also dramatic when they needed to be.Robert Downey Jr is definitely one of the best actors for movies that have a mixture of humour and drama,he fits those kind of characters extremely well,also his narrating in this movie was hilarious , one of the funniest parts, especially the constant breaking of the fourth wall.Fans of action and comedy will live Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. A small time crook and a prickly private eye investigate a string of LA murders
Oblivion is a great movie with a very impressive and different story line and a very professional cast.Tom Cruise's acting is,as usual,terrific,as well as Morgan Freeman,Olga Kurylenko is also a terrific actress,and very attractive,she hasn't been in an awful lot of movies yet but judging from what I've seen her in,Quantam Of Solace,Seven Psychpaths (briefly) and this,she seems like a terrific actress.The movie is filled with very unexpected twists,and at times it really reminded me of an episode of the Twilight Zone.If your a fan of sci-fi,Tom Cruise,and even the Twilight Zone,I would you go see Oblivion.Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is sent out to find the remaining resources left in a now empty Earth,but he soon learns some things about his old life.
The Searchers is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and an impressive cast.It is certainly one of the best westerns of the fifties and some of John Wayne's best work,but I have to admit it is very overrated by filmmakers,there have been much better westerns since this,and I really don't find it as influential as several other people think it is.John Wayne delivers a great performance,one of the best of his career,but he needed to be more emotional,he was put through and lot of tuff times relating to his family,but he never seems very upset about it,they needed to make him more human and less of a cliché western character.Certainly a game changer for westerns,with a stellar script,I would recommend the Searchers to anyone looking for a good western or drama. A Civil War veteran returns home to find his family massacred and his niece kidnapped.He sets out on a journey to find the people who did it. Best Performance: John Wayne Worst Performance: Ken CurtisIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Departed is a brilliant movie with a really well written storyline,an extremely great cast that all offer original performances and great character development.Martin Scorsese is without a doubt one of the finest directors of all time,and it really shows in movies like this,because he gets actors that in the past have been clearly mediocre,for example,Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin,and make them seem just as professional as Jack Nicolson or Martin Sheen,Mark Wahlberg has certainly never came across as such a professional actor in any other movie,but he's so good in this that he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.Bjg credit also goes to the two main characters Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio,that characters were brilliant and the build up to the scene where the characters finally meet is very impressive,but I think the best performance in this movie goes to Jack Nicholson,his character was slightly frightening and it's more of a character you'd expect someone like Robert De Niro and Al Pacino to play,so I was very impressed that he clearly showed he can pull off these kind of characters very well.Fans of Martin Scorsese films will not want to miss The Departed.After two cops working for both the police force and an Irish mob gang learn they are in the presence of a rat,they race to track down one another.
Witness is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast.It is a very enjoyable drama which contains elements of both crime and romance that manage to balance out very nicely in this despite how different the tones of the romantic scenes and the crime scenes are.Harrison Ford delivers one of the best performances of his career in this movie,I'm a huge fan of him,but he honestly isn't someone who would take my breath away with his acting skills and someone that I think deserves an Oscar,but he easily could have received one for this movie,he takes a break from his big franchise roles to play a much smaller and more human character,and this makes for very sincere acting.I feel like it definitely needed more scenes between John and Rachel,there is plenty,but I felt that in the last thirty minutes it started revolving around it much less and I would have liked to see it develop some more.Dramatic and very well acted,I would recommend Witness to anyone looking for a good crime film or romance. A tuff cop is hired to guard two murder witnesses,a gentle Amish mother and her son,from the killers out to silence them.Best Performance: Harrison Ford Worst Performance: Alexander GodunovIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Burbs is a decent movie,its not the best movie I've ever seen but its not the worst either.I thought the storyline was very weak and judging from the movies poster,I thought it would be a lot more exciting.Aside from Tom Hanks and Carrie Fisher,the cast are widely unknown,I never heard of any of them apart from that woman that went on to voice the mom in American Dad.I would this anywhere near some of Tom Hanks greatest movies,such as Forrest Gump,Saving Private Ryan,etc.Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) is very protective over his neighborhood,and when new people move in next door to him,he must find out all he knows about him to make sure his neighborhood will be safe.
The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers is a great movie with an amazing second part to this epic story that had to be broken up in to three movies,with incredible characters and an terrific cast.However,out of all three,I find this to be the least exciting,mainly because it is right in the middle of the whole story,it doesn't begin anything and it also doesn't end,but its still very good,I just thought The Fellowship Of The Ring and especially The Return Of The King where much more exciting.Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are headed closer to there destination along with the help of Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis),who really only wants to ring to himself,and is completely obsessed.
The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King is a fantastic movie with an amazing story,terrific cast,great characters,amazing effects that wraps up the Lord Of The Rings trilogy perfectly,one of the best trilogies ever made,Peter Jackson puts so much work into all of his movies and is so inspired in what he does.The characters of the series are amazing,my favorites being Frodo,Gandalf and of course Gollum and Smeagol,they make the movie for me,everything he says is gold.Frodo and Sam are nearly finished there nine month journey,they have reached Mount Doom with the Ring,but Gollum gets in the way and convinces Frodo that Sam wants to ring for himself.Meanwhile,Gandalf leads the World of Men against Saurons army.
Gladiator is a fantastic movie with a storyline that stays exciting and fresh from start to finish and a cast that stay into their characters all the way through.The movie is a total flashback to the movie's of the fifties and sixties,like Ben Hur,and for the entire movie I was not convinced it was only made thirteen years ago,and I also wasn't convinced it was directed by Ridley Scott,a director who made movies such as Alien and Blade Runner,and I was shocked he could make a movie like this.It is without a doubt Russel Crowe's finest performance as he plays Maximus with great heart.Fans of history movies about gladiators,the Roman empire,etc,will definitely love Gladiator.After having a falling out with his new emperor,Maximus (Russel Crowe) is forced to become a gladiator and ends up becoming impossible to defeat,fighting with the anger of his family's death.
Dial M for Murder is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast and terrific character development.The movie is very thrilling,and that is obviously no surprise from an Alfred Hitchcock film,but this is without a doubt some of his best work.The character of Tony Wendice,played by Ray Milland,is very creepy in a somewhat likable way,we learn how he planned out a very detailed idea to have his wife killed,it is genuinely terrifying how much he thought it out and it really did seem like the perfect murder.Mary Wendice,played by the brilliant and beautiful Grace Kelly,is also a very interesting character and I loved seeing her personality change severely over the course of the movie.Dial M for Murder is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good thriller or crime. A man arranges to have his wife killed,fearing she will leave him.Best Performance: Ray Milland Worst Performance: Anthony DawsonIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Notorious is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a really inspired cast.If your expecting the usual Hitchcock film,don't,it is in no way scary or frightening but it does offer really good character development and outstanding performances.Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman both delivered very impressive performances,it's definitely not either if their best films,but I don't think they ever delivered a poor performance.It isn't Alfred Hitchcock's finest film,but Notorious is still a very well made film,mostly because of the string performances.The daughter of a convicted traitor is enlisted by the CIA to help foil a Nazi plot
Mad Max 2 is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.Similar to the first Mad Max,the film has very little character development,but the main reason why both movies are so fun is because their action packed from start to finish and very violent.Mel Gibson does deliver a great performance as Mad Max,and improves from the original, he clearly matured as an actor within the gap of these two films and it shows as he delivers a more dramatic performance.Fans of the first Mad Max certainly won't be disappointed,I personally think the first one is better but it's still a fresh sequel,and I would also recommend it as a very enjoyable action movie. Mad Max (Mel Gibson) crosses a post apocalyptic wasteland to fight for a small community against gasoline raiders.
Jaws is a fantastic movie with an amazing storyline,great cast,characters,script and a movie that will always be remembered.Its the very first Blockbuster ever,and more importantly its the directorial debut of Steven Spielberg,possibly the greatest director ever,who went on to direct Indiana Jones,Saving Private Ryan,Jurassic Park,among many other terrific movies.He made this debut more than 37 years ago,and hes still working in films today.A dangerous shark is terrorizing a beach and has killed several people who went into the water.Its up to three men living near the beach to head out to sea and get rid of the shark once and for all.
Dallas Buyers Club is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is certainly depressing and emotional as we are taken on a very serious journey with Ron Woodroof.It's based on a true story and both Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto convey a sense of real people,even with the weird and unique characters they played,and they both very much deserved the Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Supporting Role.Acting and story is certainly the main factor of this movie,there isn't a huge budget,which is what impressed me the most with these actors taking a huge risk doing this very different film.Unique and dramatic,Dallas Buyers Club is an outstanding movie that will surely withstand the test of time,I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or biography. After being diagnosed with HIV,Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) works against the system to help patients with the disease get the medication they need.

Last Vegas is a great movie with a very enjoyable storyline that isn't anything I haven't seen before, but made so much better with a very professional and impressive cast.I was very impressed with Michael Douglas,Robert De Niro,Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline doing a movie like this,it was a very risky career turn for them,nothing like what they've done in the last,and I think they did a fantastic and hilarious job.The movie is filled with hilarious scenes from start to finish but also has a lot of heart,mainly involving the sincere friendship between these four men.If your a fan of comedies similar to the Hangover or if your a fan of any member of this cast,Last Vegas surely shouldn't be missed.When one of them is getting married to a woman much younger than him,four old men head to Las Vegas to give him one last weekend of bachelor freedom,but the men's obsession with trying to act younger than they are and find young women gets in the way.
Blade Runner is a great movie with a fantastic,sometimes confusing and very different story line,with a very good cast and great characters,with an outstanding performance from Harrison Ford and great work from legendary director Ridley Scott.This movie has a strange history,it did not go down well with critics,but as time went on,it became more understood and got the respect it deserved,also there are many different endings to this movie.If you are looking for a movie packed with action,I wouldn't recommend Blade Runner,but if your looking for a movie with suspense,with a good build up,I would.Han Solo and Indiana Jones aside,Rick Deckard is one of Harrison Fords greatest performances.Rick Deckard,a blade runner in the year 2019,must track down four replicants who stole a ship and have returned to Earth to find there maker,its up to Rick to retire them.
Meet The Parents is a brilliant movie with a terrific storyline,cast,characters,plenty of cringe moments and some very funny scenes that make this such a great movie,and some of Ben Stillers finest.There where two more sequels so far,Meet The Fockers and Little Fockers,a lot of critics feel they didn't live up to the original,but I think there all great and that they continue to make more.Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is going to meet his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) parents.He is prepared for her sisters wedding and just know her parents will like him,however he didn't expect her to have a father like Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro),and things don't go exactly as planned for Greg.
Madagascar 3: Europes Most Wanted is a great movie with a terrific storyline,humor,cast and characters.I found it to be as good,or possibly better than the first two,it could be better but I haven't seen them in a good while to say so.I've always enjoyed the movies cast,especially Ben Stiller and Sacha Baron Cohen,Stiller because I think hes an amazing actor and Cohen because he is so funny.I wouldn't say that I'm much of a fan of these movies,but if they continue to make more,ill continue to watch.The gang get away from Africa and are now finding there way back to New York,they manage to find a way home by joining a traveling circus headed to there destination.
The Green Mile is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast that all match their characters perfectly.Tom Hanks is definitely the best performance in this movie,every movie is just better when he's in it.A lot of people love Michael Clarke Duncan in this movie,may he rest in peace,but I didn't find his character that lovable,I know throughout the movie he is very kind and sweet,but I couldn't forget what he did at the beginning of the movie that put him into prison,the fact that we see it happening is probably the reason I couldn't,but this is still without a doubt Michael Clarke Duncan's finest performance and he will be a huge loss to film,he was an incredible actor.Fans of movies like the Shawshank Redemption will definitely love The Green Mile.Follows the life of Paul Edgecomb (Tom Cruise),a guard who works on death row,which they prefer to call the green mile.Paul deals with a difficult situation when John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is put into prison,a criminal with a heart of gold and a very unusual gift.
The Shining is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline with a great cast.The movie is very frightening,several scenes that don't even have anything frightening are still scary just because you know its building up to something and the atmosphere is unusual.Jack Nicholson delivers a thrilling performance,certainly one of his most unique characters,he was certainly a perfect casting decision as we watch him go from a innocent writer and family man to a completely deranged lunatic,and Nicholson plays both perfectly,I never pictured him as an actor that could be frightening,but after watching this I know he is very good at it.The Shining is a terrifying movie that I would highly recommend to fans of horror and Stanley Kubrick's films.A novelist takes his family to an empty hotel to find peace to write,but the isolation turns him in to a bloodthirsty maniac.
Slumdog Millionaire is a fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline and an impressive cast.I never thought tghis movie seemed very promising,but I decided to watch it since it won the Academy Award for Best Picture,and it totally deserved it,it was such an impressive movie.Overall the movie won eight Academy Awards,and it deserved every single on of them,the directing,the script,the cinematography,the music and the overall film was really beautiful.Slumdog Millionaire isn't perfect,but I would highly recommend it to all moviegoers.Jamal (Dev Patel) is on his way to winning all the money on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? He uses the memories from his dark past to get the answers.
The Flintstones is a decent movie with a surprisingly clever story line,but only a alright cast,and most of them don't really relate to the characters their playing.If you grew up with the Flintstones,like myself,you will definitely be disappointed with this movie.I felt the only member of the cast who stayed true to his character was John Goodman,he sounded and behaved just like Fred Flintstone from the classic animated series.I didn't appreciate Rick Moranis,who sounded nothing like the original Barney Rubble,and I especially disliked Rosie O'Donnel,Betty Rubble is one of the most attractive cartoon characters ever,and then they get one of the ugliest characters in Hollywood to play her,that was a bad casting decision.I also didn't like Halle Berry,she was just thrown in to amuse the dads watching this with their kids,and her name literally being Sharon Stone was not at all funny.When Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) gives Barney (Rick Moranis) money so he can adopt a child,Barney gives Fred the opportunity of getting the job he has always wanted.
Blood Diamond is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.The movie is a very dramatic movie and at times it's also very emotional.Leonardo DiCaprio has a big job in this movie as he is one of the only actors that is extremely recognizable,he had no other well known actors with him,and it is without a doubt of the finest performances of his career,with this characters personality and heavy accent,it is hard to believe it really is DiCaprio,also Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly deliver some of their finest performances.That being said,this very unknown cast still deliver amazing performances and certainly did not come across as inexperienced.Blood Diamond is a great movie that I would recommend to all moviegoers.A man who finds a rare gem teams up with a mercenary smuggler in the hope of saving his family.
Mrs Doubtfire is a great movie with a heartwarming and hilarious story line,a great cast and some very funny scenes that will have the whole family laughing,mostly because Robin Williams is hilarious,and brilliant at impressions,and gives a terrific and believable performance as the pretend nanny Mrs Doubtfire.Robin Williams does an outstanding job as both of the characters he plays in this movie,it says in the trivia that he was given the right to improvise many of his scenes,and it definitely shows and is what makes it so funny.He also has some very emotional scenes that show that he is also such a great serious actor,particularly the scenes where he is giving out about how he wants to spend more time with his children,he is so dramatic and believable,Williams is certainly one of the best actors there is,his range is terrific.Mrs Doubtfire is laugh out loud and heartwarming from start to finish and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good movie for the while family to enjoy. Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is recently divorced from Miranda (Sally Field),who wont allow him see his children,so he disguises as a nanny,Mrs Doubtfire,using his brothers impressive make up skills,in order to spend time with them while Mirandas working.Best Performance:Robin Williams Worst Performance:Harvey Fierstein If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Titanic is a great movie with a very well developed storyline,a fantastic cast and some brilliant character development.James Cameron did an absolutely outstanding job directing this movie,it certainly isn't his best work but it is stunning,the scenery and cinematography is beautiful.The cast is also great,but of course most of the credit has to go to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet,their chemistry is amazing and also the character development for both Jack and Rose is great.Its not the best movie ever,but for being over three hours long it actually goes by very quickly,I would recommend Titanic to anyone looking for a good drama or romance.Follows the love life between two people who meet on the luxurious Titanic. Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio Worst Performance: Frances FisherIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
M*A*S*H* is a terrific movie with a great storyline,a fantastic and talented cast,plenty of hilarious scenes and some serious drama.The movie has made a terrific legacy for itself,a series of the same name was made two years later,and it ran for eleven years.I think the show is a lot better,its much funnier,more light hearted and much less violence.The cast of this movie is terrific,I think the best actor was Elliot Gould,because I found his character Trapper John McIntyre to be the funniest and stood out the most out of all of them,I also enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Tom Skerritt.A staff working in a field hospital during a Korean War use there humor and laughter to make them forget about the violence and horror of the war they are facing.
The Godfather Part 3 is a great movie with a very good storyline,although it feels a bit convoluted at times,and a very talented cast,except for Sofia Coppola,that girl just wasn't born to act.The movie is without a doubt the worst of the Godfather trilogy,the plot and the dialog just isn't as clever or as inspired.I think it mainly wasn't as enjoyable because Vito Corleone wasn't in it,because he was really the star of the first two (played by Marlon Brando in the first,and Robert De Niro in the second) and Michael felt out of character for the movie because he was suppose to be a changed ma.I also didn't really enjoy Andy Garcia,his acting was good,but I felt like he was taking Michaels place,similar to what Michael did in the first one,and I didn't like the idea of that.However,I still enjoyed this movie,Al Pacino puts in a great performance and it looks just as beautiful as the other two,and the end did leave me in tears,it was disappointing.You would definitely enjoy it a lot more if you didn't see the other two.The Godfather Part 3 isn't the work of art the other two were,but its still a movie I would highly recommend.Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) confesses his sins while trying to legitimize his business to keep his family safe as he is getting old.
1O1 Dalmatians is a great movie with a really enjoyable and heartwarming storyline and some lovely colorful characters that always take me back to my childhood.I watched this movie many times when I was younger,and even seeing it today I still love all these characters,the music and also Rod Taylor's voice as Pongo.Its very short,not even an hour and a half long,so its a nice movie to watch if you don't feel very patient to watch anything that stretches out too much.The movie is a must see for anyone who loves classic Disney animated movies,and if you don't then there must be something wrong with you.Cruella De Vil robs 99 dalmatian puppies to make them into fur coats,now its up to the puppies parents to save them with some help from some other friendly animals in their town.
Heat is a great movie with a really well-developed and smart storyline written by Michael Mann and a brilliant cast that all bring very strong performances to this movie.What makes this movie so good is obviously Al Pacino and Robert De Niro,two actors that are brilliant in everything they do,and their performances in this movie are very inspired.I was surprised with how long this movie was,because I didn't think they could drag out a simple story for almost three hours,but it dosen't feel that long at all,it's action packed and exciting all the way through.Fans of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro will definitely enjoy this movie.When a bank robber (De Niro) leaves a clue behind on his last crime,he begins to feel the heat of the law on his track.Meanwhile,the main detective on this case (Pacino) has problems with his wife because she feels all he cares about is his job.
X-Men 2 is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline,a very talented cast and of of course great charactersl.This movie is a very impressive sequel,.it improves in so many ways on the first X-Men,a movie that was already fantastic to begin with,but this sequel is definitely better.The performances also improve,actors Hugh Jackman,Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen come across as a lot more familiar and confident playing their characters this time around.X-Men 2 is a great movie that fans of the first X-Men will be very impressed with and would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or sci-fi. The X-Men are forced to team up with their arch enemy to combat a warmongering general.Best Performance: Hugh Jackman Worst Performance: Alan Cumming If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Terminator Salvation is a pretty awful movie,its definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen but its so uninspired with both cast and story that it cant even come close to as good as its predecessors.Christian Bale makes the best with his role,but he was clearly only doing it for money,but he does as good as he can as an actor with the terrible script.I really did not like Sam Worthington's performance,I found his entire performance really stupid and,I wont spoil anything,but his personality doesn't match what his character was at all.Fans of the previous Terminator should definitely avoid this movie.Hopefully,Arnold Schwarzenegger will return for the fifth installment,like he promised,and Christian Bale and Sam Worthington wont.John Connor (Christian Bale) must protect his father Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) from being killed by a Terminator or he will never be born.
30 Minutes or Less is a good movie with a well written storyline and a great comedic cast.The script is nothing outstanding and there were certainly no parts that had me laughing out loud,but the movie definitely benefited from a good cast that seemed to get on very well together.Jesse Eisenberg did a good job,he's a great actor and really managed to work his way around a mediocre script,the scenes between him and Aziz Ansari are definitely the movies highlights,but I did expect more from him and Ruben Fleischer since it was their first film together since the hilarious Zombieland.Its certainly not a comedy I would highly recommend,but 30 Minutes or Less is a short (running for under 90 minutes) and has many funny moments that definitely make it worth a watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. A pizza boy finds himself swept up in a heist when he is kidnapped and blackmailed in to robbing a bank.Best Performance: Jesse Eisenberg Worst Performance: Nick SwardsonIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Total Recall is a great movie with a good story line and a terrific cast.The story to the movie is very strange and very different,not a story line that anyone could come up with,it can get kind of confusing,but not too confusing,nothing like Inception basically,but if your like me you will find certain parts of the movie hard to follow.Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a fantastic performance as Douglas Quaid,in one of his greatest roles,apart from The Terminator that is.Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) keeps having nightmares about him on Mars and goes to a place called Recall to find out why he is having these dreams.Recall works too well however and he learns a lot about his life,and that his name myth not be Douglas Quaid at all.
Saving Mr Banks is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic and very talented cast.I found this true story very interesting,I was not aware of it before this movie that it took that many years for Walt Disney to make Mary Poppins and it was certainly a difficult path in his career.While at first the author PL Travers,played by the brilliant Emma Thompson,is shown as a very ignorant woman that won't let Disney,played by the very likable casting of Tom Hanks,turn her book in to a movie,but after seeing what inspired her to make the book and following her childhood,I actually understood why she didn't like all the music,animation and casting that was done to Mary Poppins.For die hard Disney fans it is a must see,and I would also highly recommend Saving Mr Banks to anyone looking for a good drama or biography film. After meeting with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks),who is looking to turn her book in to a movie because of a promise he made with his children,P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) reflects on her childhood and works with Disney to make sure the movie pleases her. Best Performance: Emma Thompson Worst Performance: Andy McPheeIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Devil Wears Prada is a good movie with a well written storyline and a terrific cast.I really thought this was going to be extremely mediocre but I just decided to watch it when I saw it on television and there was nothing else on,and it was surprisingly much better than I expected,Anne Hathaway delivered a great performance and was really able to make you care about her character,also Meryl Streep was very good of course,her character is mean but somewhat likable in a strange way and was nothing like any character she has played previously.Its certainly nothing outstanding,but Devil Wears Prada is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good romantic comedy if you ever see it on television. An aspiring journalist lands a sought after job at a fashion magazine,but her tuff new boss puts her in her place.Best Performance: Anne Hathaway Worst Performance: Simon BakerIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Horton Hears a Who! is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a terrific voice cast.The animation in this movie is absolutely beautiful,unique and it really brings Dr. Seuss's art style to life the way I think he would have wanted it to had he been around to see it,it's colourful and wacky,the way you would want an animated movie based on a Dr. Seuss book to look.I loved Jim Carrey's voice work as Horton the elephant,he clearly got to improvise some of his lines as well which I really liked and his voice definitely suited the character,I also liked Steve Carell and Seth Rogen,I am a huge fan of all three of these comedy actors.A quick and very fun movie,Horton Hears a Who is very enjoyable and imaginative and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good animation or family movie. After an elephant discovers an entire town is living on a flower,he tries to bring it to a safe place,however his jungle neighbours go against him.

Star Trek: First Contact is a great movie with a really well developed storyline that will both fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation and fans of sci-fi in general.It is the first standalone movie for the Next Generation crew,and it is much better than their first movie,Generations,that crossed them over with a few members of the original Star Trek crew,it was much better seeing this crew on their own instead of throwing in William Shatner.Like all Star Treks,the cast is fantastic,but there was just something extra special about this one,them seemed much ore positive than usual,they clearly knew it was a great script.Fans of Star Trek and just fans of sci-fi,because it has enough in it not to confuse people who aren't aware of Star Trek,will be very pleased with First Contact.Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must battle against his old enemy the Borg,as they try to change history for the worse.
The Watch is a better than average comedy with a pretty stupid storyline ,but a very strong comedic cast make up for that. I felt this movie had so much more potential,the idea of Ben Stiller,Jonah Hill,Vince Vaughn and Richard Ayoade starting a neighborhood watch together and fighting against aliens sounded like something that could have been a really funny movie.However,I did think there were plenty of funny parts in this movie but nothing really that you would laugh twice at but I did find the dialogue between these four actors very enjoyable.I would recommend the Watch to anyone looking for a quick comedy but just don't expect to be laughing out loud.When his friend is murdered,Evan (Ben Stiller) starts a neighborhood to catch the culprit,but they soon find it myth be more than just a human being.
Bruce Almighty is a brilliant movie with a really well developed storyline and a fantastic comedic cast. The film is very fun from start to finish and a very unique comedy, there really isn't anything quite like it. If you're a fan of Jim Carrey you will certainly love this, seeing him being given the powers of God is a hliarious as it sounds and seeing Morgan Freeman as the actual God is equally satisfying. It's filled with memorable quotes and many big laughs, Bruce Almighty is a very funny movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy. After questioning his faith in God ,Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is visited by God (Morgan Freeman) Himself and gives Bruce all the responsibility He has the go threw.Best Performance: Jim Carrey Worst Performance: Nora DunnIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Bourne Identity is a brilliant movie with a really well developed and action packed storyline and a really impressive performance from Matt Damon.He played his character,Jason Bourne,with great heart all the way through and his timing is fantastic,its no surprise that they kept making more of these.The movie has great action and a very impressive build up,and the ending was not disappointing,and I found it very unexpected.Fans of action movies with some good mystery will definitely enjoy the Bourne Identity.Jason Bourne,a man with amnesia,tries to piece together his identity which he has absolutely no memory of,while evading his pursuers.
Gravity is a good movie with a great storyline and a talented cast.The movie is without a doubt one of the most stunning and realistic movies ever made,but I was still disappointed by it,it was just too hyped up for me.I thought that at times the movie relied much more on effects rather than story,which is always a problem,and also the movie was way too short,with a length of only an hour and thirty minutes,a movie like this could have been longer than two hours,there is so much more in space that this movie could have explored,I'm not saying it should have shown aliens or anything because it isn't that type of movie,but we could have seen some beautiful shots of other planets and galaxies,it would have looked beautiful and would have added so much more to effect of the movie.Sandra Bullock does deliver a beautiful performance however and is certainly the highlight of the movie,she delivers a very dramatic and emotional performance and it's movies like these that show why she is one of the most successful actors in Hollywood at the moment.I do think Gravity is overrated,but it's still very beautiful and enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or sci-fi.Two astronauts work together to survive and keep calm after they get stranded in space.Best Performance: Sandra Bullock Worst Performance: George ClooneyIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Paranormal Activity 4 is an OK movie with a decent plot and some surprising twists.However it is still very dull and I suppose more of a movie you'll enjoy if you've seen the other three.Im not a fan of this franchise,I only saw this one and the first one,and I'm not really a fan of scary movies in general,I only went to see this because some friends where going seeing it,it isn't something that I would want to see if I saw it on a cinema list.However,it can still be entertaining,there aren't many scary parts,but when there are,they are scary,there are many scenes when you think something scary is gonna happen,but nothing does.In one scene we are just staring at a blank quiet room for about 5 minutes,you think somethings gonna happen and your ready for it,and nothing does.A boy named Robbie moves in with his neighbors after his mother goes missing.Eventually,the daughter becomes very suspicious of Robbie and finds many clues to something unbelievable about the child and his mother.
Zoolander is a great comedy film with some very funny actors and a great script.My favourite is of course,Derek Zoolander himself,Ben Stiller,he is one of my all time favourite comedy actors and I loved the way he played Zoolander and the way he made him talk.Other great actors in the film include Owen Wilson as Habsel,Christine Taylor as Matilda,Will Ferrell as Mugatu and Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein.A fashion model,Derek Zoolander is at the end of his career and is brainwashed to kill the governor of Malaysia by the head of a rival fashion company,Mugatu.-DILLON HARRIS
The Hurt Locker is a great movie with a very dramatic and intense storyline and a very talented cast that follows through with the films seriousness with outstanding performances.I have never really liked Jeremy Renner in previous movies he has starred in and feel like hes just been trying to be part of lots of big movie franchises (Marvel's Avengers,Mission Impossible,Bourne,etc.),but after watching him in this and in The Town I do see that he really can act,although I much preferred Anthony Mackie's performance,he was able to be both very serious but also very funny at times,and I definitely thought his performance was the best.However,I really don't think this movie deserved Best Picture in at the 82nd Academy Awards,and I feel it only won because everyone decided to go against Avatar,I think that Avatar,The Blind Side,Up or Inglorious Basterds would have been much better choices to win.However,the Hurt Locker is a great movie and if you enjoy serious war dramas you will enjoy this.A group of men in the army must head out to Iraq where they must try and stop every timed bomb they find and be careful around anyone who talks to them,as they may be an enemy.
The Artist is a great movie with a very well written storyline and an impressive cast.The movie is very unique for today's standards,its a silent movie,which of course are never made anymore,and it was interesting seeing the fall of silent films once the talkies came in,I know these characters are fictional but I'm sure certain aspects are quite legit to what really happened.The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2011,up against some great contenders (Moneyball,The Help,Hugo,etc.) and I honestly don't think it should have won,the film is certainly unique but I don't think any performance apart from Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo are very impressive and also the dialogue in the movie is nothing outstanding.The dog Uggie also deserves some huge credit,not only is he adorable but he's also a very talented dog actor,there's a scene where a character is attempting suicide and when Uggie starts barking trying to get him to stop it looks so genuine,I didn't feel like he was just trained to do that.The Artist is an enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great drama or romance. A silent film star falls in love with a young dancer,but the advent of talking pictures changes their careers.Best Performance: Jean Dujardin Worst Performance: Malcolm McDowellIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Pinoochio is a fantastic animated movie,its heartwarming with beautiful music and a lovable cast of characters,the animation of the movie was definitely an outstanding movie for its time,especially the scene with Montro the whale trying to eat everything,the way all the waves look is truly mazing and still looks incredible today.A puppet maker named Geppetto who lives alone with his cat and fish wishes for his puppet to become a real boy,overnight the wish comes true from a magic fairy,but he isn't officially a real boy yet until he can prove that he can be,he has conscience named Jiminy Cricket keeping an eye on him and every time he lies his nose grows,but this doesn't stop Pinoochio from being fooled.
Terms of Endearment is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast that all deliver beautiful performances.The movie has brilliant character development,we learn so much about all the main characters throughout the movie,although I did feel like we could have gotten to learn more about Jack Nicholson's character,his character wasn't the most important,but his performance was outstanding so much so that he (along with Shirley MacLaine) won an Academy Award for his performance,definitely deserved more time.The movie is also very sweet and emotional and I am not afraid to admit that the ending had me in tears,certainly one of the most upsetting moments in film history.Terns of Endearment is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama. A woman flees from her suffocating mother and try's to manage life with two kids and a failing marriage.Best Performance: Jack Nicholson Worst Performance: Troy BishopIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Ladykillers is an absolutely terrible movie with a very stupid storyline that insults the original 1955 classic rather than remakes.I was so shocked with how brutal this was,Tom Hanks starring in a movie with the Coen brothers that is a remake of a very famous comedy sounds like gold,but its awful,I don't understand why Academy Award winning people would do this,it also seemed promising that J.K. Simmons is in it,I usually enjoy his performances.Tom Hanks did do a good performance,but it didn't make up for the fact that this movie was just not funny and it had him working with people like Marlon Wayans,they just don't belong in the same movie together.This movie is a complete mess that is sort of hard to forget,I only would give it a one,but since ATom Hanks did do his best,i'm giving it a two,but I would recommend to nobody.A crooked college professor borrows his landlady's basement but when she gets suspicious his gang try to silence her.
Observe and Report is a decent movie with a good storyline and a great comedic cast.It certainly isn't a perfect or even great comedy but it is still very watchable and has plenty of genuinely funny scenes.This movie came out around the same time as Paul Blart: Mall Cop and a lot of people complained about how similar they are,while,they are both about mall cops,this movie is way better and is not very similar to the other movie,this has a lot of black comedy and it dosen't try to make you feel sorry for the character constantly,also Seth Rogen is a much more likable main role than Kevin James is.It certainly isn't a great or outstanding comedy,and nowhere near some of Rogen's best work,but Observe and Report is still quite funny at times,and is worth the worth if you're looking for a quick comedy.A delusional mall cop tries to solve the case of a mystery flasher who stalks his mall and the girl he likesBest Performance: Seth Rogen Worst Performance: Michael PenaIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Austin Powers in Goldmember is a great movie with a good storyline line a top notch cast and of course fantastic characters.I certainly don't think it offers as much entertainment as the previous film,the Spy who Shagged Me Did,although I do prefer it to the first.I felt this one repeated jokes from the second one too many times,but parts when it didn't are mostly hilarious.The films cast is the finest of all three,one if the most memorable scenes is when they get high profile actors to play ye characters (Tom Cruise as Austin,Kevin Spacey as Dr Evil,etc.),I was very impressed with the actors they got to make quick cameos,it was short but very funny.Mike Myers is certainly no problem in this movie,the third time around and he is still clearly interested and enjoying playing these characters,and I truly love seeing him as Austin Powers,Dr Evil,among others,his range of characters and voices is comedy gold.Fans of the last two Austin Powers movies should certainly enjoy Goldmember.In order to save his father (Michael Caine),Austin (Mike Myers) must travel back to the 70's and defeat the evil Goldmember (Mike Myers) and of course his arch nemesis Dr Evil (Mike Myers).
A Few Good Men is a fantastic movie with a great storyline and a really talented cast that all play characters very different to the kind they usually play.The best performance in my opinion had to go to Tom Cruise,he always plays his roles with so much heart,and his character,Daniel Kaffe,was sometimes very serious and also very funny and sarcastic,which is the kind of character Cruise has always been able to play,someone with a very mixed personality.My only really problem with the movie was Jack Nicholson wasn't in it enough,when you get a big star like this in your movie,you need to give them as much screen time as you possibly can.I would highly recommend A Few Good Men to everyone who enjoys Tom Cruise,Demi Moore and Jack Nicholson.A positive lawyer working for the Marines defends two men who are accused of murder.
Mission: Impossible 2 is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a talented cast.It is certainly nothing outstanding,but it is simply an enjoyable action movie with some great intense scenes and a story that is both fun and easy to follow.It is certainly the worst Mission Impossible to date,every other one brings some originality and a unique take on action films but I feel like this followed the same basic formula used in most action movies and didn't try to go beyond that,it certainly played it safe.Tom Cruise is without a doubt the person that holds this movie together and what makes it good,his acting is fantastic as usual and he plays Ethan Hunt once again with great charisma.Its nothing outstanding but is it certainly enjoyable,I would recommend Mission Impossible 2 to anyone looking for a good action movie if you ever see it on television. Ethan Hunt is sent on his next big mission where he must find and also destroy a genetically modidified disease.Best Perfornance: Tom Cruise Worst Performance: Richard Roxburgh If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Safe House is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a very impressive cast.Throughout the movie I really enjoyed the action sequences and the performances,particularly Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds,who worked very well together.Howvever,I kept feeling like there was something missing,something that was making me not enjoy this movie as much as I could have,eventually it hit me,that it's simply not compelling enough,the characters are taken in to this big adventure way too quickly and the audience aren't given enough time before hand to get to know them,and because of this we are left feeling little affection or care for them as they are taken on this journey.I felt there were definitely scenes filmed that would have helped with character development but it felt quite obvious to me that it was poorly edited,because there were certain scenes missing that I couldn't put my finger around why they wern't there,then it hit me that the editor made a few big mistakes,for this type of story it certainly could have been at least twenty minutes longer.Though it has its flaws,Safe House is still a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or crime film if you ever see it on television.A seasoned CIA agent must go rogue while an idealistic rookie tries to figure out the truth.Best Performance: Denzel Washington Worst Performance: Nora ArnezederIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
European Vacation is a good movie with a well developed storyline a good comedic cast.I was certainly disappointed by this movie,because after seeing the first one,I thought seeing the Griswolds going to Europe would just be even more fun,but it wasn't,but this movie still is filled with some very funny scenes.Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are still in good form in this movie,and they are certainly the highlight,they are filled with positive energy and there is great chemistry between the two of them.I found Audrey,who is played by a different actor than she was in the first,was extremely annoying and certainly the worst part,she didn't make me laugh once.European Vacation is certainly disappointing,but fans of the first should still definitely enjoy.After entering a game show,the Griswolds win a trip to Europe,but while they're there one problem after another comes along.Best Performance: Chevy Chase Worst Performance: Dana HillIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Office Space is a hilarious movie with a great storyline,a fantastic cast and some very enjoyable and goofy characters.Im never been an huge fan of Mike Judge,I don't find King Of The Hill and Beavis And Butt-Head funny,but I really enjoyed what he did in this,his humour and writing is very funny and clever.Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is sick and tired of working at the office and stops dedicaing himself to his job,and more to his girlfriend Joanna (Jennifer Aniston),and Peter and his friends decide to rebel against their bosses.-DILLON HARRIS
The Five Year Engagement is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic comedic cast.The movie is filled with loads of really funny scenes,but still manges to keep an interesting and complicated love story,you really care for these characters and want to keep following them on their journey,a lot of people say it is overlong but I think the two hours was necessary for this story.There was great chemistry between Jason Segel and Emily Blunt,but my favourite characters in this are the supporting ones,every scene with Chris Pratt was hilarious,also Alsion Brie,Mindy Kaling,Kevin Hart,Brian Posehn and Randall Park all had me in stitches with the weird and wacky characters they played.The Five Year Engagement is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good romantic comedy. A happy couple are all set to walk down the aisle together,but unexpected events keep delaying them.Best Performance: Chris Pratt Worst Performance: Chris ParnellIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Hand That Rocks Cradle is a very mediocre movie with a promising storyline that just ends up not being very interesting and an uninspired cast.The movie is considered a thriller,but there wasn't one time in this film that I felt in anyway thrilled or excited by what was going on,at times when things did get dramatic,it was just too predictable to feel any thrills.Rebecca De Mornay delivers an interesting performance and she is certainly the movies highlight,but it would have been more enjoyable if there was a bit of mystery behind her character instead of spoon feeding the audience every single thing she does.The Hand That Rocks The Cradle is undeniably boring and filled with plot holes,I think everyone would be better off avoiding this one. A doctors wife goes looking for revenge after her husband commits suicide amid accusations of abuse from some of his patients.Best Performance: Rebecca De Mornay Worst Performance: Annabella SciorraIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Psycho is an absolutely fantastic movie with an extremely well developed storyline and a very talented cast.Alfred Hitchcock has not done a bad movie,and all of them are very thrilling,but this is certainly one of his best.The shower scene is one of the greatest movie sequences of all time hands down,and it is also so unexpected,we follow Janet Leigh for about the first thirty minutes of the movie,and she gets killed,you do not see it coming whatsoever,and you'd think that the movie would fall apart after killing off the main character,but it only gets better,and the twists only continue.Its an absolute classic and filled with mystery and thrills from start to finish,Psycho is a must see for all moviegoers. A woman drives out to a motel to escape her boss after stealing $40,000 from him.But she chooses the wrong motel,where she meets the rather unusual owner.Best Performance: Anthony Perkins Worst Performance: Vera MilesIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Cast Away is a fantastic movie with an extremely well written and well developed storyline and a very talented cast (mainly just one cast member).I was very impressed with atom Hanks in this film,he proved that he can be a good actor even without have other actors around him,for the majority of this film he is the only person on screen,as we watch him stranded on an island as he loses his mind,Hanks stays dramatic and convincing all the way through.I was so impressed that the films script actually got me to feel for a football,Tom Hanks character starts communicating with a ball he calls Wilson because of it's brand,and after a while this character becomes "his friend " and it is only this man really has,and because of that I actually felt emotion for this lifeless ball,I was so impressed with the writers,Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for managing to do this.Cast Away is an outstanding drama that I would recommend to all moviegoers.An obsessive executive for a delivery company finds himself stranded on a desert island after his flight ends in disaster.
Its A Wonderful Life is a brilliant movie with a terrific,heartwarming and emotional story line and a great cast that will keep you watching all the way through,with the best performance of course being from legendary actor James Stewart.It is largely considered one of the greatest Christmas movies ever,although for the first half of the movie it isn't even Christmas,but its still great,its not a Christmas movie thats filled with love all the way through,the story is kind of dark with a very serious topic involved.George Bailey (James Stewart) is contemplating suicide on Christmas Eve,so an angel comes and shows George what the world would be like if he was never born.
Kiss the Girls is a great movie with a very well written storyline with a good cast.Morgan Freeman delivers a great performance,as usual,as Alex Cross,its a very different role,certainly not the type of character he usually plays.The movie is a very good thriller,I usually don't find thrillers scary,but this movie is at times quite terrifying and creates a very realistic feel in to the dark life of a detective.My only real problem with the movie is Ashley Judd,I don't know if she is overall a good actor because this is the only film I have seen her in,but she is not good in it,I don't if she just didn't suit her character or if she just can't act,but I didn't believe her,I felt there was no life in her performance and she was just saying her lines.All in all,Kiss the Girls is a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to fans of crime and mystery films.A forensic psychologist tries to snare a killer of young girls,helped by the only woman to flee him.
RIPD is a good movie with a decent but weird storyline and good performances.I don't think this film deserved all the negative criticism it received,it definitely isn't brilliant,but I thought it was very funny at times and overall an enjoyable film.It had that same kind of Men In Black theme to it that I enjoyed,definitely not as much but I still found it very fun.The main thing I really didn't like was getting Jeff Bridges character disguised as a young blonde women,it was very disturbing,especially with an actor as talented and well known as him.RIPD definitely misses a lot,but I found it enjoyable and would recommend it as a fun action movie to anyone over the age of twelve.Nick (Ryan Reynolds),a recently murdered police officer,is murdered and is forced to return to Earth as part of the RIPD,along with a longtime dead cowboy Roy (Jeff Bridges) who helps Nick take his killer Hayes (Kevin Bacon) down.
Edward Scissorhands is a fantastic movie with a terrific story,a great cast and an unforgettable characters.Its the very first movie that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton did together,twenty years later and they still are.I still say its one of their finest.Im not always a fan of Tim Burton,he can be very hit and miss,and a lot of his movies are too strange and dark,but I really enjoy this movie and really like Edward Scissorhands's personality,this is definitely one of my favourite movies he directed.An unusual man comes off of the mansion he lives in and shows himself to the world,Edward (Johnny Depp) has scissors for hands and cant do many simple tasks,he moves with a friendly family,and he falls in love with their teenage daughter.
Fright Night is a good movie with a well written storyline and a great cast that are able to jump from comedy to horror in different scenes.I normally don't like horror comedies because they usually try too hard to be both scary and funny and they end up failing at both,but this film managed to maintain both of them very well,there were scenes that had me laughing and also just as many scenes that had me in fear.I enjoyed Anton Yelchin's performance and he had great chemistry with Imoogen Poots as well,but my favourite performances are from Colin Farrell and David Tennant,they are the main reasons this worked out as a horror and comedy,because Farrell was genuinely,and quite surprisingly, terrifying as a vampire,he was dark and nothing like any character he had ever played previously,and David Tennant brought in most of the laughs,his character was hilarious even when he was suppose to be serious and was certainly given the best lines.Its nothing outstanding,but Fright Night works out pretty well as both a horror and comedy and I would recommend it to anyone looking for either of those if you have some time to kill. A teenager discovers he is living next door to a vampire and calls on a Las Vegas musician for help. Best Performance: David Tennant Worst Performance: Christopher Mintz-Plasse If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Paranormal Activity is a decent with an alright storyline that doesn't really go anywhere for the first hour but you keep watching because you know something big is coming.But I was very disappointed with the outcome,I only got scared for about. three seconds towards the end.Although I will admit the two main actors in this are very impressive,they did a great job of pretending that everything was really happen to them as the boyfriend films it all.But the movie just wasn't the horror thrill I expected it to be because so many people made it out to be.Paranormal Activity is definitely overrated and if your looking for a really scary horror,definitely avoid this.A young couple recently moved in to a new home have no problems with their life or relationship.Not until a strange activity starts controlling their house.
Desperate Housewives is a brilliant series,I have followed the show for years and just went into the page to review the last episode,but I decided to review the show as well since I realized I never reviewed it before,I will miss this show dearly,it had a terrific,attractive cast,the show was very funny and always kept you wondering.My favorites were Susan and Mike Delfino,a brilliant couple that where well able to solve there problems,Teri Hatcher is a brilliant actress.An area called Wisteria Lane,seems to always have something going on,and four women who are best friends,Bree Van De Kamp,Gaby Sollis,Lynette Scavo and Susan Delfino always get in someway involved.-10/10.
Sideways is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.For a film that is basically a road trip comedy,it is a lot more clever than you would expect,the characters are very lifelike,the performances really don't feel like acting,it just feels like very normal people,the dialogue is very deep and sincere,just don't expect this to be anything like the usual stupid road trip comedies that are usually made,this is much,much better.I feel like this was really written from the heart and was an absolute delight to make,the story and characters is very simple,but it's really the things that these two leads say and the great chemistry between them that make if such a clever movie and in a way I think it really paved the way for future comedy dramas such as Forty Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up.Cleverly written and unique,Sideways is a delightful movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or drama. Two men having a mid life crisis take a week long road trip through California,just as one is about to take a trip down the aisle.Best Performance: Paul Giamatti Worst Performance: Marylouise BurkeIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
10 Things I Hate About You is a good movie with a decent storyline that is reasonably cliché but the films cast and script is good enough that you can see past the cheesy story and enjoy this movie.The characters and the humor is very different to what you would usually see in a romantic comedy,but it isn't too different for people who enjoy them the way they are not to enjoy,which makes this a very good couples film,because the humor will make bought men and women laugh.Heath Ledger brings a very inspired performance,a bit too good for a movie like this,he lived and breathed every moment of this character and I was very impressed with him, I also really enjoyed Julia Stiles and Joseph Gorden Levitt.While it still is at times a very clichéd romantic comedy,10 Things I Hate About You has enough good humor and unique characters to be much better than average. Cameron (Joseph Gorden Levitt) try's to find a student in his new school to date Kat (Julia Stiles) so that he can date her sister.He makes a deal with Patrick (Heath Ledger) to dare her,but then starts to really fall for Kat.
Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me is a simply hilarious movie created by Mike Myers who also plays some of the movies major characters such as Austin Powers,Dr Evil and Fat Bastard (who sounds just like Mike Myers future voice role,Shrek).Its one of my all time favourite comedy films.it had me laughing all the way through and Ithink it is the best of the three films.It should definitely have a better rating on this.Austin Powers must travel back in time to stop his nemesis Dr Evil from taking his mojo while hes frozen in time.He meets a lady from the 60s who he falls for,meanwhile,Dr Evil is having his own trouble with his son Scott (Seth Green) who he doesn't love because hes not as evil as him,so he creates a smaller version of himself to love like a son,called Mini-Me.
Young Frankenstein is a fantastic film with a very fun and cleverly parodied spoof of classic Frankenstein films that is directed very impressively by Mel Brooks and is a pitch perfect resemblance of how those films actually looked.The cast is very inspired and all play really funny and unique characters,obviously the best performance is from the great Gene Wilder,this man just knows how to act,but in a serious and comedic way,and the other cast members all do a great job as well,the two that really stand out for me are Peter Boyle and Gene Hackman's cameo.I don't think it's Mel Brooks or Gene Wilder's best film,but all fans of classic comedy will really appreciate it,and fans of classic monster films will appreciate its very impressive parody.Dr Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is assigned to recreate his grandfathers well known experiment,something he has being trying to avoid for many years.
Iron Man 3 is a fantastic movie with a terrific story line,a brilliant cast and great characters.Robert Downey Jr is as great as ever,straight after the events of the Avengers,and there are a lot of mentions of the movie that kind of point out about the Avengers 2.It probably isn't as good as the first Iron Man,but I enjoyed it more than the second Iron Man.I really enjoyed how Gwyneth Paltrow got a much more main role than she she did in the first two,and got a bit more character development.But the main reason this movie is so great is obviously Robert Downey Jr,and I really don't want to see anyone else play Tony Stark.Fans of Iron Man will definitely be impressed with this movie.Tony Stark's starts getting a lot of anxiety after the events of the Avengers,and it doesn't get much better when his biggest foe yet,the Manderin,comes along and causes a lot of terrorism.
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a terrific movie,one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made and a must watch during the holidays that the whole family will enjoy,the movie is a huge laugh from start to finish,with a great story line,fantastic characters,a hilarious cast,which keeps the whole movie extremely enjoyable,but it wouldn't be anywhere without Chevy Chase.Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) wants to have the perfect,big family Christmas with his entire family,including his parents and his wives parents,but things don't go exactly as planned when his Clarks cousin Eddie,along with his family, drops by unexpectedly to spend Christmas with them.
The Grey is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast.The movie is really intense all the way through,it dosen't start off slow it basically gets right to the adventure as we see a group of men try to survive in the freezing cold wilderness after a plane crash.We also get to see the characters develop a lot,although the only character I really cared about was Liam Neeson's,his character was really interesting and was very secretive,I didn't care much for the rest of the characters and when any of them was killed off it didn't bother me,I only cared about Neeson's character Ottway and seeing him get home to his wife.Any scenes where the wolves attack are the most thrilling,the actors reactions are very realistic as to how someone would really react to a wolf attacking them.I was annoyed with the last scene of the film,just because after learning so much about Neeson's character we don't get any closure and that really bothered me.The Grey has its flaws,but I would still definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure or thriller. Survivors of a plane crash in the Alaskan wilderness must battle against winter weather and the areas hungry wolves.Best Performance: Liam Neeson Worst Performance: Frank GrilloIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Superman 3 is a terrible movie with a very poorly written storyline that is brutally directed with a less than inspired cast.The acting is beyond cheesy, it was in the first two as well,but in an enjoyable way,this time around however it was extremely cheesy in a way that was just very irritating.One of the things that excited me the most about seeing this movie was that Richard Pryor was in it,because he is hilarious,both as a stand up comedian and an actor,but they didn't really make any use out if his comic talent in this,his character was very plain and really could have been played by anyone.Christopher Reeve is also clearly lost interest in playing Superman,probably because of how cheesy the dialogue was and that his character dosen't make any important contribution to the story until about the last twenty minutes.Superman 3 is a brutal movie that I would not recommend to anyone,it's boring and filled with very little enthusiasm,even if you've seen the first two,I would definitely say avoid it. Ross Webster has big plans for economic control and uses a computer genius to help him do so,while Superman must defeat his alter ego.
The Theory of Everything is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an absolutely outstanding cast. The film is dramatic, emotional and completely enticing from start to finish. It is mostly carried by the groundbreaking performances of Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, they clearly did every bit of research and preparation they possibly could to prepare for these roles. Redmayne's Academy Award win is definitely deserved, it is almost impossible to believe when you watch him on screen that he is simply an actor, that he does not have ALS, he transforms completely in to Stephen Hawking and no one could have played this role any better. Filled with emotion and intense dialogue, the Theory of Everything is an absolutely outstanding film that I would recommend to all moviegoers. Follows the life and struggles of Stephen and Jane Hawking as they marry and raise children while the renowned physicist's Lou Gehrigs disease becomes increasingly worse.

A Perfect Murder is a decent movie with a clever storyline that should have ended up being much better.I thought that since it was based on an Alfred Hitchcock movie,and with Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow in the lead roles,it was going to be a great,exciting thriller,but I was very disappointed,i've never seen Dial M For Murder,but I know it must be so much better than this.I was still very pleased with Michael Douglas,who did do a very impressive and creepy performance,but the rest of this cast felt very uninspired,and didn't help with the little amount of suspense in this movie.Fans of crime and thriller's should probably avoid this movie,its not awful,but its certainly not scary.A cold blooded commodities trader (Michael Douglas) on the verge of losing his fortune,hires a man (Viggo Mortensen) who is sleeping with his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow0 to kill her for a large amount of money in return.
Taken is a fantastic movie with an outstanding,brilliant performance from legendary actor Liam Neeson,its a action thrilled movie with a great storyline.The movie is surprisingly short,I though it would have been a lot longer judging from its story,I thought it would have been at least two hours,but the length didn't bother me because it shows that a movie doesn't have to be long to e great.Taken 2 will be released in October and I look forward to seeing it.An overprotective single father is heartbroken when his daughter is going to Paris with her friend for a few months.His daughter promises to ring him every night.He cant get threw to her on the phone once she gets there,and when he finally does,he finds out that her daughter and her friend got taken to be sold into prostitution.He travels across Europe and relies on his old skills to find her.
Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny is a great movie with a really fun storyline and great performances from both Jack Black and Kyle Gass.This movie was a box office bomb when it came out,and I don't see why,I thought this movie was very enjoyable,it was really funny and had unbelievably good music numbers,and I thought Tenacious D would have a big enough fan base for this movie to make some decent money.I'm not a fan of the band,and I thought I wouldn't enjoy it unless I was,but I really did,and I also learned that Jack Black is actually a fantastic singer,and the rock off scene with David Grohl as Satan is something I will never forget.Fans of the band will definitely enjoy this movie and fans of Jack Black comedies will also.Two men interested in becoming rock stars head off on a quest to find a guitar pick that is actually Satin's tooth in order to become big.
Spellbound is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a really impressive cast that all play their characters with great heart and passion.It definitely wasn't what I was expecting it to be,mostly because its directed by Alfred Hitchcock,its suppose to be a thriller but I wasn't very thrilled,I thought the story was really good,but it just wasn't that exciting,and a story like that sounds like they could have made it a lot more mysterious and strange.The best part of the movie was without a doubt the music,which it won an Academy Award for and it really deserved it,the music is truly outstanding and you will have it stuck in your head long after he movie ends.Fans f Alfred Hitchcock shouldn't expect a lot of thrills from Spellbound,but Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck still make it enjoyable.A female psychiatrist falls in love with her amnesiac patient although she is aware he may be a killer.
Semi-Pro is a good movie with a decent storyline and a great comedic cast.While I will admit it is not a fantastic or outstanding comedy movie,it is still enjoyable and dosen't deserve the harsh reviews it received,I thought there were several very funny scenes,it certainly isn't Will Ferrell's finest film but it's not terrible.I also appreciated several other very funny actors in this movie,Will Arnett,Andy Richter and André Benjamin were very funny and I really enjoyed the scenes with Woody Harrelson,Maura Tierney and Rob Corddry,they were so ridiculous but that's what made it so funny.Semi-Pro is nothing outstanding,but it's an enjoyable comedy that I would recommend to anyone looking for a quick comedy to kill some time.

Sherlock Holmes is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.I certainly think that Robert Downey Jr was an odd choice to play Sherlock Holmes,he did do a good job but I think that even he was aware that the choice was unusual,but he brought a lot of comedic value to the movie and was very funny,although it did make me feel like it was more of a parody of the Sherlock Holmes series more so than a real movie at times,but he did bring and new and interesting personality to the character.I think a more unusual decision however was getting Guy Ritchie to direct this movie,I don't think his directing style suited something like this one bit,and while it still turned out pretty good,he definitely was not the perfect choice to direct this movie.I did think that Jude Law did a really great job as John Watson,he suited the character really well while still bringing his own original take on him.Sherlock Holmes is a good movie that is very watchable and has several very funny scenes and I would recommend it as a good action and crime film.The legendary detective must solve the case of a serial killer who appears to have risen from the dead.Best Performance: Jude Law Worst Performance: Rachel McAdamsIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Men In Black 3 is a great movie with a great well thought out storyline,great actors and very funny.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Joes are back as Agent J and K and still protecting the galaxy from alien life forces and erasing peoples memories.Josh Brolin did a great job as the young Agent K.Boris The Animal has escaped from a prison up on the moon,a criminal who Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) arrested after K shot off Boris's arm back in the 1960s after a series of murders done by this alien.Boris manages to travel back in time and kill K before he loses his arm.He causes a huge effect in the present and Agent J (Will Smith) goes back in time to 1969 to kill Boris before he kills K,with a little help from a younger,more lively K (Josh Brolin).
Kingdom of Hearts is an alright movie with a decent storyline that does get kind of old and boring after a while and a an average cast.My main problem was that it went on much too long and Orlando Bloom was so uninspired in this movie,and it really felt like he was lying for the whole thing.However,Ridley Scott did do a very beautiful job directing this movie,and there were many performances that did their best,but it just wasn't exciting enough for such a long runtime.I think Kingdom of Heaven could appeal to a younger audience,but people who understand what makes a movie great will see the problems with this movie.Balian (Orlando Bloom),a young blacksmith,swaps hammer for swords as he becomes the leader and defender of Jerusalem.
District 9 is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and some great performances.The movie is an outstanding sci-fi and very unique,most science fiction films obviously exaggerate what would happen if aliens came to our planet,but this movie felt very realistic to me,I felt like this is actually what would happen.The aliens in this movie are beautifully animated as well,and I really like how it just felt like they were there,most sci-fi films will be showing off aliens extremely and showing how amazing the effects are,but in this it just looked liked the aliens just there while they were filming,not added in afterwards,it just looked so natural.There are no well known actors in this movie but every actor delivers a very intense and impressive performance.District 9 is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good sci-fi or action. A large group of aliens are stranded and badly treated in South Africa,when the aliens are moved to a detention camp,things turn violent.Best Performance: Sharlto Copley Worst Performance: John SumnerIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
O Brother,Where Art Thou? is a good movie with a very different storyline that is very funny but some jokes go on for much too long without being very funny in the first place.The cast was very inspired,especially George Clooney in what is probably his most unusual performance,his character definitely was given the scenes that I at least found the funniest.The Coen brothers are great writers,but I just don't think they are very good comedy writers,they definitely weren't born to write comedy,they seem to write what they would find funny,but not stuff that everyone would laugh at,the jokes are at times very hard to understand or just made out to be a lot more funny than they actually are.I definitely a lot of comedy fans would enjoy O Brother Where Art Thou? but you probably won't be laughing at everything all the way through.Three convicts escape from prison and set off to collect some hidden loot before it gets flooded by a new dam.
Quantum of Solace is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant cast.I will admit it's not the finest Bond film and is a disappointment compared to the previous film,Casino Royale,but I think this movie dosen't get enough credit,it still has some great action sequences and an overall very thrilling storyline.A lot of people will disagree with me,but I think Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet,he plays the character with such dedication and his Bond films are a lot more gritty than previous 007's.Olga Kurylenko is personally one of my favourite Bond girls,she is a very talented and attractive actress,her character had a lot of independence and a strong personality,which Bond girls rarely have,and you also felt like she didn't need him with her to keep her safe.Quantum of Solace isn't the best Bond,but it's not the worst either and I think fans of the previous films will definitely enjoy,as well as anyone looking for a good action or thriller. James Bond heads to Bolivia to take down a suspicious organisation.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Curse of the Black Pearl is a unbelievably great movie with a extremely well developed storyline that is interesting,exciting,action packed,and,because of Jack Sparrow,really funny.The movie looks beautiful and is very well done.The cast is all fantastic,Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly put so much heart into their performances,but this movie would probably have no sequels if it wern't for Johnny Depp,he is a fantastic actor and he is absolutely brilliant as Captain Jack Sparrow,everything he says is gold,it was perfect casting.I also really enjoyed Mackenzie Crook,I really enjoyed him as Gareth in the Office,and he was one of the funniest characters in this as well.I would highly recommend Pirates of the Caribbean to all fans of both pirate movies and the popular Disneyland attraction. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with wanted pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to save the governors daughter,Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) from a gang of pirates that are cursed by their ship,the Black Pearl.
Captain America: The First Avenger is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline that i'm sure stays true to the character.I really enjoyed the movie but its certainly not my favourite Marvel movie,I like Captain America's character but nowhere near as much as IA like Iron Man,Spider-Man,Hulk and Thor,I just don't find his character as interesting or as likable as them.Also there isn't as much comedy as there is in most Marvel movies,especially Spider-Man and Iron Man.Other than that though,Captain America is very enjoyable,action packed and a very strong cast and I would recommend it to all Marvel fans.Steve Rogers (Chris Evans),a small weak man is transformed into Captain America to fight for his country during the second World War.
Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a great movie with a fantastic and inspired story line,a great cast,with some great,emotional drama,and a bit of comedy in there too.Its definitely Jim Carreys most inspired performance,where we really get to see him as a serious actor,instead of loud and crazy,but I do prefer him as characters such as Llyod Christmas,Ace Ventura and Truman Burbank.I definitely think Eternal Sunshine is overrated,I don't think it should be 76 on IMDb's Top 250,but it still is a great,enjoyable and different movie.Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) is so depressed on valentines day after his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) breaks up with him that he decides to erase his entire memory of her.
Muppets Most Wanted is a brilliant movie with a very well written storyline filled with even more outstanding musical numbers and a great cast.The movie is certainly not a disappointment compared to the previous Muppets,it's just as good and it gives the Muppets the spotlight this time around instead of Jason Segel and Amy Adams,who don't appear in this film,and that's what I really wanted,to see Kermit and the gang at the center of attention.The music in the movie is great,my favourite song would have to be the sequel song,the Muppets regularly break the fourth wall and this song was a pure example of how far they go.The human cast is also outstanding,it's packed with great cameos but the main characters,played by Ricky Gervais,Tina Fey and Ty Burrell are all absolutely hilarious and they all played characters that were a different but good turn for them,and Fey and Burrell deliver great Russian and French accents.I'm happy that the movie didn't feel like a direct sequel to the previous film and they made it a completely different story,which is the best decision for Muppet movies (Great Muppet Caper,Muppet Christmas Carol,etc.) and I really hope they continue making Muppet movies every few years,seeing these characters make me so happy.Fans of the Muppets,new and longtime,should definitely love Muppets Most Wanted and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good musical or family film.While the Muppets head on a world tour,Kermit is put in to jail after being mistaken for a criminal,Constantine,while he pretends to be Kermit and joins them on their world tour along with their new agent Dominic (Ricky Gervais) in order to rob museums around the world.Best Performance: Ty Burrell Worst Performance: Salma HayekIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Oz The Great And Powerful is a great movie with a very well thought out story line,a great cast and timeless characters,if you are a fan of The Wizard Of Oz,you will be pleased with this well told story of how Oz came to make everyone believe he was a wizard.My biggest problem with the movie is James Franco,I do like him and thought he did a good job,but I don't think Oz suited his nice guy personality,I think the original people offered the role,Johnny Depp and Robert Downey Jr,would have been better because it suited characters they have played before better,and I think the only reason James Franco got the role is because he worked with Sam Raimi before in the first three Spider-Man movies.The story of how Oz (James Franco) discovered Oz and tricked the entire town in to thinking he is a really wizard.
The Guilt Trip is a decent movie with a an alright plot although a lot of parts forget about a plot and are just there for laughs.I couldn't help but enjoy this though because I really like Seth Rogen,I think he is a very funny and talented actor who has been making very clever and original comedy lately (This is the End being a perfect example) and while the Guilt Trip is certainly not one of them,I just enjoyed him and how well he worked with Barbra Streisand.A lot of people did not like Streisand in this,I definitely didn't think she was perfect and her character was at times irritating more so than funny,but she did her best and the role definitely suited her.The movie did forget its plot about a half an hour in,but it all comes together in the end and in a way that I found very sweet and also realistic,the relationship between Joyce and Andy is a very realistic one for a mother and son,and I think Streisand and Rogen,both being someones mother and someones son,knew that.The Guilt Trip is in no way a perfect comedy,and I wouldn't recommend renting it,but of you see it on TV I would say check it out,its not a long movie and you won't regret the hour and a half of watching it.As he heads on a road trip across the country with his mother to get a company to invest in his new product,Andrew Brewster (Seth Rogen) decides to locate a man his mother Joyce (Barbra Streisand) was in love with before she met his now deceased father.
Superman is a good movie with a great storyline,a good cast and terrific characters.The movie is very dated,the effects are cheesy and it wouldn't compete today with moves such as Dark Knight and Avengers,but it is still enjoyable and a great movie for its time,and it did make me excited for Man Of Steel,coming out in a few months time.If your a big fan of Superman,I would recommend you watch it,and the sequel,but don't bother with the third or the fourth.An orphan sent to Earth by his parents,grows up to become Clark Kent by his non-biological parents,but soon discovers he has superpowers,and uses them for good,and becomes Superman.
Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding class that all deliver some of their most unique and professional performances.Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are both certainly delivering some of their best characters to date,the chemistry between them is incredible and the dark gritty characters suits them perfectly.The best part of the movie is certainly the music,the songs are very catchy and very well choreographed,I never would have placed any of the actors in this film as good singers but they show in this film that they certainly can sing.Sweeney Todd is a very entertaining movie that I would recommend to all fans of Tim Burton films and musicals,it also makes a good horror but there is nothing in this that is extremely frightening.Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) sets up a barbershop in London with the intention of gruesome revenge.
The Matrix is a fantastic movie with an outstanding story line,its unbelievable how The Wackowski Brothers (now the Wackowski Siblings) thought up this movie,its extremely different and strange,nothing just anyone could and would come up with.Its the story why I love this movie,I am not a huge fan of the cast,especially Keanu Reeves,I like a lot of movies hes in,Neo is a fantastic character,and I also really like Ted Logan,but I don't like him as actor,I feel like he just reads his lines with no passion.Tom Cruise,Leonardo DiCaprio and Will Smith where all approached to play Neo before Keanu Reeves,and I think they would have done a much better job,there all terrific actors,especially Will Smith,and they would have played Neo with passion.I like Neo because hes a great character,not because of the actor who played him.Neo learns the truth about reality,and he is taken into the real world,outside of the Matrix,where everyone sees things as they want to see them.
Invictus is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It is a very powerful film with an inspirational message and a very inspired cast. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon both deliver outstanding performances, they are both actors that, while I always enjoy seeing them in movies, they tend to always play very similar characters, safe roles that they are use to playing, but they both play very different roles in this, and their voices are unrecognisable. The role of Nelson Mandela is one of Morgan Freeman's greatest performances, he completely owns this film, he delivers his dialogue with great passion and you could tell he did research in to Mandela to prepare. Powerful performances and an inspiring true story, I would recommend Invictus to anyone looking for a good drama or history film. President Nelson Mandela tries to unite a segregated South Africa by championing the national rugby team.

Wall Street is a good movie with a good storyline and a great cast,a terrific performance is delivered by Charlie Sheen in one of his first major movie roles,back in a time when he was a much more mature actor,but drugs or Chuck Lorre became a part of his life.The cast is great,and great performances where also delivered by Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen,but I don't get why Michael Douglas's name come first in the opening credits,because the movie all revolves around Bud Fox.Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) is a young stockbroker who is willing to anything to get himself to the top,but he makes some deals with people he will soon regret.
Kindergarten Cop is a below average movie with a storyline that never really gets fun or enjoyable and a cast that didn't seem very interested.This movie was an interesting turn for Arnold Schwarzengger,its nothing like what he's done in the past but its also something he would have been better off not doing,I don't think hes s bad comedy actor,he's proved for movies like Twins and Junior that he can do comedy,but this movie was trying to combine his action movie type acting and comedy acting together and the outcome was an unlikeable character.The comedy in this movie overall was not very funny,a few scenes are funny but only for a few seconds nothing memorable,a very main factor for laughs in this movie was hearing kids curse,which really isn't that funny.I wouldn't recommend Kindergarten Cop to either fans of comedy or action.A tough cop is forced to go undercover as a kindergarten teacher to track down a pair of key witnesses.
Robocop is a great with a good storyline that sometimes falls flat but is overall strong and different,the cast aren't brilliant,but all the highly exaggerated action and effects won't make their performances a huge problem.Peter Weller does do a good job,but thats only once he becomes Robocop,who is suppose to be motionless.The movie had some surprising heart,very likable characters and the effects were very impressive for a movie made in 1987.It probably won't turn out very good,but I look forward to seeing the remake next year,it will be interesting to see how it could look today,which much better effects available.Robocop certainly isn't perfect and you should definitely toss your brain out the window before you watch it,but its a must see for all action fans.Alex Murphy (Peter Weller),a police officer,is murdered by a gang of criminals,but borough back to life as a cyborg,known as Robocop,who fights crime and never sleeps,now looking to track down the criminals who killed him.
Dude,Where's My Car? is a mediocre movie with a very stupid storyline that is all over place and ends too quickly.I thought the movie would be similar to Harold and Kumar,the story sounds stupid but they make the best of it,that wasn't the case with this movie.I did think that Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott were very funny and clearly got on well with each other and they had me laughing a lot,especially the scene where their trying to tell each other what's written on their tattoos,but they just wern't enough to make up for the fact that the plot dosen't really go anywhere for about the first hour,and when it does its just ridiculous,and the several scenes in this movie that are a complete miss.There are some funny scenes,but I wouldn't recommend Dude Where's My Car? unless you are under thirteen because its just too ridiculous to really enjoy.Two potheads wake up from a night of partying and can't remember a thing.They have made a lot of mistakes the following night,but all they really care about is finding their car.
X-Men: Days of Future Past is a brilliant movie with an extremely well developed storyline with an outstanding cast and characters.The movie is by far the best X-Men in the series so far,and I am certainly not the only person that thinks this,it brings the original X-Men cast with the prequel cast,and also contains the element of time travel,which is something I always love in films.So many fantastic actors reprise their roles,like Hugh Jackman,Patrick Stewart,Ian McKellen,Jennifer Lawrence,James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender,and there are also several surprise cameos that I won't spoil,and some new characters as well,including an outstanding performance from Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage as one of the films villains.I really enjoyed the addition of Evan Peters (best known for playing one great character after another in American Horror Story) as Quicksilver,the scene where we see how he uses his powers is outstanding and so beautifully filmed,I hope we see him in future X-Men films and although I can't say this for certain yet,I think he will be a better Quicksilver than Aaron Taylor-Johnson (who will be playing him next year in Avengers: Age of Ultron),because I think Peters was just perfect casting,he has a weird personality that suited the character and I can't imagine anyone improving on this character.The movie leaves a clean slate for future X-Men films for both the original and prequel cast and erases some big mistakes that were made in previous films.X-Men: Days of Future Past is an outstanding movie that fans of the previous films will definitely love. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) travels back in time and teams up with Charles Xavier (James McAvoy),Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and Beast (Nicholas Hoult) to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from doing something that has a huge effect on the future of mutants.Best Performance: Hugh Jackman Worst Performance: Halle BerryIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Thor: the Dark World is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline with a very impressive cast.It certainly not as good as what Marvel has given us recently,it's no Avengers or Iron a Man 3,but fans of the first Thor will definitely not be disappointed,it's a very enjoyable and action packed movie that answers all the questions from the first Thor that were left unanswered when he returns in the Avengers.Chris Hemsworth,Natalie Portman,Tom Hiddleston and the rest of the cast are back and as good as before,and also really enjoyed the few scenes Chris O'Dowd had.I enjoyed Loki in it and was happy they didn't end up making him the main villain,also the twist at the end was outstanding and incredibly unexpected.Thor: the Dark World is a must see for all Marvel and Thor fans.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) can finally return to Earth when he is faced with an alien enemy looking to destroy Earth,only Thor can put a stop to him,while also rekindling his relationship with Jane (Natalie Portman).
The Village is an alright movie with a surprisingly good story,a solid cast,but not very likable characters.If you want to watch a good horror,and you see this movie at a rental store,or on Netflix or something like that,don't purchase it,the trailers for this movie is advertised completely incorrectly,it is not scary,no scenes will have you jumping off your seats,but the twist to this was very well thought out.A small,isolated village must never cross through an area they call The Towns,where monsters live that will never enter the village,unless a villager goes through there first,but some people find it hard to resist the temptation.
Kick-Ass is a great movie with a good story line,a great cast and fantastic characters.The movie is a very good parody of superhero movies and comic books,and I'm surprised something like it hadn't been done earlier.I really enjoyed Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy,a role very different for him,and I'm surprised how much I enjoyed him,because I usually don't like him as an actor,but I thought his character in this was very funny and played him with great passion.I looked forward to seeing Kick Ass 2 in June,which will star Jim Carrey,he never did a sequel,apart from Ace Ventura,and now hes in a sequel even though he wasn't in the original version.Dave Lizewski becomes a superhero,Kick Ass,even though he has no skill or powers,he gets some help from Big Daddy and Hit Girl,who become a team.
Groundhog Day is a terrific movie with a very well written storyline and a fantastic comedic cast. It is a really unique comedy film, there really isn't anything else quite like it, the concept was really interesting, seeing a man repeat the same day over and over again, and it is thoroughly entertaining. Bill Murray delivers a terrific performance, he has a lot of very funny parts, but he also gets to show a more dramatic side, something the world had seen little of from Murray at this stage in his career, particularly his scenes with Andie MacDowell are very well acted and their chemistry together was superb. Funny and very sweet, I would recommend Groundhog Day to anyone looking for a good comedy. After a weatherman heads to a small village for Groundhog Day, he finds himself forced to live the same day over and over again.

Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a brilliant movie with a lovely story line and a great cast,not to mention plenty of laugh out loud scenes.The whole movie is a delight from start to finish,with a great script and largely inspired performance from Jason Segel,I also really enjoyed Mila Kunis,Russel Brand,Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd,he doesn't have a huge role but every part he is in is hilarious,like he always is.I found some of the songs stuck in my head after watching this movie,which I didn't expect,especially 'Inside Of You' and the Dracula song.Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) heads to Hawaii to forget about his recent break up with Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell),but she ends up being at the same hotel with her new boyfriend Aldous Snow (Russel Brand).
Wedding Crashers is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic comedic cast.I am not a huge fan of either Vince Vaughn or Owen Wilson,they are very hit and miss actors,but they both strike gold in their performances in this and there is great chemistry between them,and this also features several other great actors such as Rachel McAdams,Christopher Walken,Isla Fisher,Bradley Cooper in one of his first big roles,and an unforgettable cameo from the briliiant Will Ferrell that was without a doubt the highlight of the movie.There are a few hit and miss jokes and the movie is certainly longer than it needs to be,but Wedding Crashers is still a very fun and enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy. John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) specialize in crashing weddings as a way of picking up girls.Things have been going great for them for many years,until one unexpectedly falls in love with someone.Best Performance: Vince Vaughn Worst Perfornance: Keir O'DonnellIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Planet of the Apes is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.The movie is beautifully directed and still holds up even after all these years,the apes make up is incredible and very realistic.I find the movie quite terrifying,I don't know why but it feels so real to me,I feel like this could really happen some day,probably because apes are very intelligent and the closest species to human.The twist at the end is outstanding,I knew what was going to happen (because of constant parodies of the final scene) and I was still swept away by how intense the scene was,certainly frightening and Charlton Heston's dramatic acting is outstanding.Planet of the Apes is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great adventure or science fiction. A group of astronauts crash land on a planet were apes are the dominant species.Best Performance: Charlton Heston Worst Performance: Robert GunnerIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
127 Hours is a fantastic movie,a true winner and inspirational story based on the true story of Aron Rolston who cut of his arm to save his own life.Thed movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the moment his arm gets stuck on the boulder and you can barely look when he starts to cut his hand.Some scenes in this movie made me laugh,unexpectedly because I though it was going to be a very serious movie,the funniest part I felt,was when Aron starts fantasizing about Scooby Doo and when he has an interview with himself.James Franco is brilliant as Aron Rolston.Based on a true story,a hiker named Aron Rolston goes on a hike near Moab,gets his hand stuck under a boulder,he could hope to get saved although he didn't tell anyone where he was going,and he is so low down from the mountain that no matter how loud he screams no one will hear him.With a very little amount of water left and presumably will be dead soon,he makes a camera talking about his last few days,but he comes up with a plan,risk cutting off his own hand with his pocket knife to save himself.
Bill And Teds Excellent Adventure is a terrific movie with some very funny scenes,a great storyline,a great cast and some terrific characters that make it very enjoyable from start to finish.It is a great movie,and went on to make a sequel,Bill And Teds Bogus Journey,which isn't as good as this one but still a good sequel.There are currently talks for a third movie,which I think would be interesting but I'm not sure how it would work,Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter have signed on to reprise the characters ,but they are much older now and look nothing like the way they did back then.Still though,I am open to the idea and currently will go see it.Two dumb teenagers use a time machine for a historical presentation so they don't fail there history exam.
Black Swan is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.Natalie Portman's performance was outstanding,it is nothing like any character she has played previously and she definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.The movie is very thrilling and is also a great mystery,you will be very confused at times by what is going on and it is also mentally terrifying,so if you're sensitive to that type of thing you should probably avoid this,it is clear from start to finish that it is directed by the very talented and unique Darren Aronofsky.Black Swan is a a breath of fresh air and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or thriller.A ballerina must overcome many obstacles in order to take the lead in Swan Lake.Best Perfornance: Natalie Portman Worst Performance: Benjamin Millepeid If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
True Lies is a great movie with a very exciting and energetic storyline and fantastic performances from both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis,she actually won a Golden Globe for her performance in this movie,with she deserved,she did a very impressive performance and she was also surprisingly very attractive.The movie is a typical one for Arnold Schwarzenegger,its not his best but its also not his worst,it is a character you would expect him to play but he does a very good job of it.Fans of both action and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies will get a good kick out of True Lies.Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger),a secret agent who has hidden his job from his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) for fifteen years,must confess his secret while dealing with terrorists and suspecting his wife may be having an affair.
X-Men is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast and characters.The movie is action packed but still manages to focus a lot on its characters and not get too carried away with special effects.The cast all suit their characters perfectly,the movie is great for fans of the comics and for newcomers,which is what I really like to see in a comic book movie.This film is the career starter for Hugh Jackman,a great actor who got a big break in this movie,and it was perfect casting,he is great as Logan/Wolverine and I couldn't imagine him being played by anyone else.X-Men is a frat movie that fans and newcomers will enjoy,I would recommend to anyone looking for a great action or sci-fi.Superman mutants lead by Dr Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart),battle against the evil Magneto (Ian McKellen) and his organisation,and set out to prove mutants are innocent people and should be treated equally.Best Performance: Hugh Jackman Worst Performance: Bruce DavisonIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Ace Ventura When Nature Calls is a good,funny movie,but doesn't live up to the original movie,it would probably be a lot better if it didn't have Ace Ventura Pet Detective to compare to.Jim Carrey usually saves these movies with his high energy and comedy,I felt to same way about Me,Myself and Irene,they just would not be the same without Jim Carrey,because he is one of my favorite actors and never fails to make me laugh.Currently the only sequel Jim Carrey has ever done.Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) comes out of retirement to help find a missing white bat who is the symbol of an African tribe.He finds himself in more trouble than he expected.
Princess Mononoke is a brilliant movie with a fantastic story,nothing like any movie I've seen before,the animation of the movie is also brilliant and is still today considered one of Hayao Miyazaki's (the Walt Disney of Japan) finest work.I don't know if there is an English version of this movie,but the one I was watching was only subtitled,at first I was considering changing the channel because I didn't think id be interested,but it started off so promising,and I decided the subtitles isn't a very big deal.A hunter is bitten by a demon and is now cursed.He must leave his village and find a cure,and he ends up getting involved in a war between the demons and the gods.
Good Will Hunting is a fantastic movie with a great storyline and a very inspired cast.The script is very well written and developed by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck,they should definitely write another movie together some day.All the performances in this are truly breathtaking,but the best performance has to go to Robin Williams,he is a very funny actor but he is also an outstanding dramatic actor,he showed this in movies like Dead Poets Society and Good Morning Vietnam,but he proved without any doubt that he is just as good being serous as he is funny,and even won an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance.There was great chemistry between Damon and Williams in there scenes together and those parts are without a doubt the movies highlights.Well written and superbly acted,I would recommend Good Will Hunting to anyone looking for a good drama. A janitor currently who dosen't want to change anything about his life,is discovered by a professor in the college he cleans at.He ends up having a special gift for mathematics,but refuses to do anything with this gift.He gets help from a psychologist to find out what his problem is.Best Performance: Robin Williams Worst Performance: Cole HauserIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Dead Poets Society is a brilliant movie with a well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It is a very powerful and inspirational film with very sweet and true messages that apply to the lives of everyone, to seize the day, make your life extraordinary and to follow your dreams. Robin Williams is of course the movies highlight, he plays the inspirational teacher John Keating, easily one of the greatest characters ever written for a film, Willliams gets the opportunity to deliver all types of acting he is great at here, he has dramatic scenes, comedic ones, he gets to do impressions, he showcases all of his talents with Keating while still delivering a pure and heartwarming performance, as well as terrific chemistry between himself and the younger cast members. Heartwarming, dramatic and very powerful, I would highly recommend Dead Poets Society to anyone looking for a good drama. At an exclusive prep school, the arrival of an unconventional English teacher changes the lives of a group of young students with his wise and positive outlook on life.

The Running Man is a good movie with an average story,but still a very strong performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger,an actor that can make anything he's in enjoyable.The movie has a lot of great action sequences,but it relies way too much on action and not enough on story,something I find to be the most important part of a movie,the movie begins with a promising story,but once Ben is sent onto the show,it's just him fighting against people for about an hour twenty minutes.Schwarzenegger had a lot of very clever lines in this movie,but I really didn't like when he said 'i'll be back', it was a very stupid nod to Terminator,and the way Arnold said was very fake,because he knew it was a reference.Fans of Arnold Schwarzenegger will enjoy his performance and his clever one liners,but there is a huge absence of story in this movie.An innocent man is forced to take part in a TV game show in which gadget wielding killers will hunt him down on the streets of LA.
Rush Hour 2 is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a great comedic cast.I personally think fans of the first Rush Hour will not be disappointed,don't expect it to be much better,but it's just as good as the first.In certain aspects it has improved,the chemistry between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker seemed a lot more genuine this time around rather than just acting and Chan's comedy acting has improved,in the first one you could tell English wasn't his first language and he didn't seem use to delivering comedic lines either,but he clearly got use to it after doing movies like the first Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon and really is use to acting in comedies now.As it is with the first,Chris Tucker is the highlight,a lot of his lines are clearly improvised and that's what makes so many of his scenes so funny.Rush Hour 2 is a very enjoyable movie that fans of the first will be impressed with and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or action. The LA cop and martial arts expert reunite once more to investigate an explosion at Hong Kong's US embassy.Best Performance: Chris Tucker Worst Performance: Ziyi ZhangIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Yes Man is a good movie with a decent storyline that is funny and clever and a good comedic cast.The movie is nowhere near comedy gold but when you got an actor as funny and talented as Jim Carrey in the lead role then you no you can't fail.The most memorable scenes in this movie definitely come from Carrey,and I also enjoyed Zooey Deschanel,Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterson's characters.The idea of him saying yes to everything is funny for awhile but starts to get a bit tiring,Carrey strong and energetic personality definitely keeps what should be a very mediocre comedy much more enjoyable.If your a big fan of Jim Carrey,I would recommend watching Yes Man but don't expect it to be another Dumb and Dumber or Truman Show because then you will be disappointed.A depressed bankers life takes a turn for the better after he decides to say yes to everything for a year.
Time Bandits is a good movie with a very enjoyable,different and different storyline and a good cast.The movie had plenty of very funny scenes,but I felt like there were several misses as well.I was disappointed the movie didn't have any Monty Python-like humour that I was expecting,since the movie was written by Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin and stars John Cleese,the humour was very much like the comedies they have made together before this film.I would have liked to see a lot more if Sean Connery and John Cleese's character,they aren't in it an awful lot and I found their characters and Palin's the funniest,other than the dwarfs,although it was hard to keep laughing at little people wanting to steal things for a two hour film.Time Bandits has plenty of funny scenes and I would recommend it to fans of Terry Gilliam films and as a fun film to watch with the family. A bunch of rebel dwarfs kidnap a young boy to join them for a madcap adventure across time in search of treasure.
Legend is a below average movie.The storyline is promising,but not at all what you'd expect.I am a huge fan of Tom Cruise and I also like a lot of movies Ridley Scott made,but I didn't really like this one at all.It was a very early movie for both of them,and its definitely not a movie that Cruise would star in if it was made today.It isn't necessarily a long movie but if you're like me you will still get very bored.The movie is rated PG,but it is very dark and creepy and I definitely wouldn't recommend you show any child under the age of ten this movie.Fans of very dark fairy tale and fantasy may enjoy Legend,but anyone who watched this because they like Tom Cruise or Ridley Scott movies wont appreciate it.Jack (Tom Cruise) is deeply in love with a woman who is kidnapped by the Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry,with the only impressive performance in this movie) to be his wife for eternity,its up to Jack save his true love.
Scary Movie 2 is an alright movie.The story isn't great and its pretty much just joke after joke,there's a lot of hit and miss,but there can be some funny parts and I would say the second one is the best of all four,its a watchable trilogy,its not hilarious,but watching one just makes me want to watch more,and I will be seeing the fifth one next year.I don't like movies like Epic Movie,Disaster Movie and Meet The Spartans,there awful and just not funny,but Scary Movie has more heart and better jokes,I wont any more versions of the those parody films,but I will continue to watch Scary Movie.Four teens go and stay at a haunted house after being tricked by there college professor,and very strange things occur around the house.
Transcendence is a decent movie with a well developed storyline and a very talented cast.It is certainly not what it could have been,the storyline was really promising and it was clearly believed to be a big success with the great cast that starred,but it really wasn't that interesting and it was quite slow.Christopher Nolan was in talks to direct this for a while and I think he would have done a much better job,he would have cleaned up the script a bit more before he started filming and would have made this in to the taught provoking science fiction that it really wanted to be (however Nolan dropped out to do Interstellar instead which was certainly a good decision).The whole crew definitely taught that this script was very intelligent and that is was going to blow people's minds,I could tell from start to finish that this was the movie is what trying to be,but sadly wasn't very successful at that.The acting is great and there certainly are some good moments,but Transcendence just isn't interesting enough to recommend as either a drama or Sci- Fi,maybe if you see it on television and you have some time to kill,but don't go out of your way to see it.

Enchanted is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a great cast.Amy Adams and James Marsden are certainly the best in this movie,they both played characters that were nothing like any characters they played previously and it seemed like a risky career choice to be playing real life versions of a fairy take prince and princess,but it didn't effect their career in any way and they did a fantastic job.The movie pokes fun at several Disney animation films throughout that are really funny and that the whole family would get.My favourite part about this movie was the music,every sing was stuck in my head until the next song came along and it's no surprise three of the sings were nominated for Academy Awards,the best song definitely being "That's How You Know".Enchanted is a very enjoyable movie that I would highly recommend as a family film. A girl living in a fairy tale world's life is turned upside when an Evil Queen transports her to New York City.Her future prince comes to save her,but she begins to like the real world and the people she meets there.

Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade is a brilliant movie with a great storyline,cast,action and characters which makes this Indiana Jones adventure arguably his best.Still,a lot of people think that Raiders Of The Lost Ark is the best of the four,but m,any people do think that this is the best of them all,me being one of them.My favourite Indiana Jones is The Last Crusade,then Raiders Of The Lost Ark,then The Temple Of Doom and finally The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull.While The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull was a disappointment for the fact that there was such a long wait for it,it still was a fairly good movie,but if Steven Spielberg and George Lucas continue to make more,don't pass the main role onto Shia LeBeouf,Harrison Ford is the only man we want to see wearing that hat.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) embarks on an adventure with his father Henry Jones (Sean Connery) in search of the legendary myth of the holy grail.
Monty Pythons And Now For Something Completely Different is a hilarious movie filled with completely random sketches,especially the animated bits,which I also find to be some of the funniest bits.I find the Monty Python crew to be some of the funniest people on earth,especially John Cleese,Graham Chapman and Michael Palin.My favourite parts are,the worlds funniest joke,the dirty fork scene,the killer cars and the lumberjack song.I find the Holy Grail and Life Of Brian better though,but Monty Python never let me down.The Monty python crew,Graham Chapman,Eric Idle,Michael Palin,John Cleese,Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam provide use with one random sketch after another in their first feature film based on sketches and characters from Monty Pythons Flying Circus.
Speed is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a talented cast.The movie is a pure action film,it is also for the most part very thrilling,it's a great watch once off but I don't think it's too memorable.Its one of Sandra Bullocks first big roles,an actress who would go on to prove she is immensely talented,she really stole the show in this movie,but it's not that hard when most of your screen time is with Keanu Reeves.I also really liked Dennis Hopper,he is a terrifying villain,there were certain aspects about his personality that were very realistic which is what made him such a scary villain.Speed is a good movie to watch once off,it's short and sweet and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or thriller.

Liar Liar is a brilliant movie with a very original and well written storyline with a great cast that are able to be both very funny and serious in this movie.Jim Carrey is outstanding in this movie,he is without a doubt one of my favourite comedy actors, and while I don't think this is one of his best movies,his character is still absolutely hilarious,especially when he can't lie,and also surprisingly heartwarming and charming.Liar Liar is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to all fans of Jim Carrey, and to anyone looking for a great laugh,because this movie is funny all the way through.After his son makes a wish on his fifth birthday that his couldn't lie for a whole day,Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey),a successful but selfish lawyer,is put in to a very awkward situation when he must go through a full day of work without being able to tell a single lie.
Road Trip is a good movie with a decent storyline that is certainly a cliché college movie but a lovable cast and enjoyable characters make it more watchable that most immature college movies.Its nothing close to a fantastic comedy and certainly not Todd Phillips finest work,but there are still plenty of funny scenes to make this a short fun movie to watch,preferably with friends.The best part of the movie was definitely Breckin Meyer and Seann William Scott,I always enjoy these two,even when I see a movie with them that i'm not particularly enjoying,they make it more bearable,and they both worked really well with each other in this.If your taste in comedy is fussy,I wouldn't recommend Road Trip,but if you want a short movie to have a good few laughs at,it will definitely deliver.Four college students set of on a road trip to stop their buddy's girlfriend from receiving an explicit home made video tape of her unfaithful boyfriend in action.
The Day The Earth Stood Still is a great original sci-fi stands tall as a science fiction movie that was made long before Star Trek or Star Wars.The cast is impressive,a great storyline,drama and imagination.I do honestly find it to be slightly overrated but its still a fairly enjoyable movie,and of course its much better than the god awful 2008 remake where Klaatu is replaced from Michael Reenie to Keanu Reeves,hopefully Hollywood wont try and remake this movie again,however it is very possible.An alien from another visits Earth and forces everyone to live peacefully or be destroyed. -DILLON HARRIS
Rain Man is a fantastic movie with a sweet and heartwarming storyline and a brilliant cast that is very well able to do emotional performances.Normally when I watch a movie with Tom Cruise,he always steals the show for me,he is a great actor,but this time Dustin Hoffman did it,his performance as Raymond Babbit is outstanding,he stays into his character from start to finish,and he definitely deserved his Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role,and this movie in general deserved Best Picture.If you enjoyed Dustin Hoffman in other films,or you just like a good drama,you will definitely love Rain Man.After the death of his father,Charlie Babbit (Tom Cruise) discovers he has an older brother,Raymond (Dustin Hoffman),who has special needs.Charlie takes Raymond away to LA to get to know his brother,but finds him very difficult to take care of.
Moneyball is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.The movie is very well written and the writers clearly knew a lot about baseball.The performances are without a doubt the movies highlight,most of the cast clearly were very interested in playing their characters and in definitely shows.Brad Pitt does a fantastic job as usual and definitely one of his greatest performances in a while.Its also a very honorable mention that Jonah Hill is on this movie,it was his first time taking on a serious role and showing that he can still be likable without being funny,and he definitely proved that,going on to do other drama films while still doing comedies as well,Hill is without a doubt one of the most talented actors in a Hollywood at the moment,his range is amazing and like look forward to seeing him in more unique roles.Moneyball is a great movie that I would recommend to all moviegoers,especially fans of sports dramas.A baseball coach tries a new system to attempt to get his team to the finals.Best Performance: Brad Pitt Worst Performance: Chris PrattIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Land Before Time is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific voice cast that really suit their characters personality.The movie is very short,only being about an hour and ten minutes long,so if you're looking for a quick but enjoyable family film then I would definitely recommend this.It says in the trivia that a lot of scenes were removed because they seemed too dramatic for children,I think they should have kept these scenes because it would have developed the characters some more and make the movie longer,it's upto the parents to decide whether it's alright for their kids to watch it or not.You will fall in love with these characters very early on and support them throughout,they are very sweet and lovable.The Land Before Time is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good family film or animation.

Jack Reacher is a great movie with a good story line,a terrific cast,and plenty of action and even some funny scenes.The role of Jack Reacher was very different for Tom Cruise,the movie is fairly similar,but usually his characters are genuinely nice,but Reacher was a very mean and offensive character,who was very suspicious and probably should have been arrested many times.Rosamund Pike also did an impressive job as Helen,the lawyer defending the main case in the movie.Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) digs deeply in to a case revolving around a military sniper who shot and killed five innocent people.
Live Free Or Die Hard,or Die Hard 4.0,as they call it in my country (Ireland) is a fantastic movie with an outstanding,action packed story line and a brilliant cast,I never really liked Justin Long,but I did enjoy him in this.Its definitely the best Die Hard sequel yet,its not as good as the first Die Hard,but I thought it was better than Die Hard 2 and Die Hard With A Vengeance,I look forward to seeing A Good Day To Die Hard,but I don't think that will be an improvement on this.John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back and is taking on a terrorist organization taking down all the United States electricity,John gets some elp from computer nerd Matthew Farrell (Justin Long).
Forrest Gump is a magnificent movie with an extremely well developed storyline,an outstanding cast and absolutely terrific character development.The movie is without a doubt one of my favourite films of all time,it is a very inspiring film to anyone trying to get in to this business,there are so many memorable scenes and quotes.Tom Hanks performance is probably his finest,which is really saying a lot,he really becomes his character beyond the point that you feel like he is acting.So much happens in this movie but it manages to never feel scattered or rushed,which seemed hard to pull off when we follow a mans childhood,love life,time in Vietnam,etc.,in the space of only two hours and twenty minutes.Forrest Gump is a brilliant movie and there really isn't anything else like it,I would recommend it to all moviegoers. An unworldly man is present at a series of historic events of the 20th century,without ever quite realising.Best Performance: Tom Hanks Worst Performance: Peter DobsonIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Ted is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a great comedic cast.If you're a fan of Seth MacFarlane shows such as Family Guy or American Dad,you'll definitely enjoy this,but it has its own originality too,it's not just a live action version of Family Guy,it's a very unique comedy.Ted is a very funny and very offensive character,but he is also lovable,,very similar to Peter Griffin.The cast is absolutely terrific,Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis really suited the roles of John and Lori and there was great chemistry between them.I also enjoyed Joel McHale,Giovanni Ribisi and Patrick Warburtons roles.Ted is a very funny and unique movie that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great comedy. A man who grew up with a real talking teddy bear by his side after a Christmas wish is forced to give up his best friend in order to commit to his new life with his girlfriend.

The Hobbit: the Desolation of Smaug is a fantastic movie with a really well written storyline that is beautifully directed by Peter Jackson with a brilliant cast.I really enjoyed the first Hobbit, but I think this movie improves immensely,there weren't any scenes that I felt went on much longer than they needed too and there was much more intense scenes and action packed moments, it definitely gets much closer to the standards of The Lord of the Rings.I think the cast also improves, Martin Freeman does an outstanding performance as Bilbo Baggins, I think since on this we see a darker side to Bilbo because of his possession of the Ring and because of that we got to see just how great an actor Martin Freeman really is.Benedict. Cumberbatch is absolutely brilliant as the voice and motion capture of Smaug ,his voice is frightening and certainly the highlight of the whole movie.If your a fan of the first Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings franchise in general then you will not be disappointed by the Desolation of Smaug.As Bilbo (Martin Freeman) becomes more sand more insane with his possession of the Ring,himself,Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the dwarfs continue their quest as they come across more danger.
X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a decent movie with a very mediocre story,an alright cast,apart from Hugh Jackman,who is great as usual and his performance as Wolverine is the best part of this movie.The movie will definitely disappoint X-Men fans,especially those who are fans of Wolverine,the story is very cliché and doesn't really have any quality stuff that make a prequel enjoyable.Will i Am wasn't a clever decision to cast as John Wraith,and he probably wasn't the first choice because he clearly cant act.The movie,similar to X-Men: The Last Stand,relies more on action than a good story.Hopefully The Wolverine coming out this year will be better.The story of the early life of Logan (Hugh Jackman) as he discovers he is a mutant and eventually becomes known as Wolverine and joins the X-Men.
The Avengers is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a magnificent cast.This movie is certainly what all Marvel fans have been waiting for,it's been building up since Iron Man came out in 2008,and despite all this hype it actually didn't end up being even a little bit disappointing.Cast members reprising their roles continue to shine,such as Robert Downey Jr. and Samuel L. Jackson,but even the new members deliver great performances,such as Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo,he is without a doubt the best Bruce Banner to date,I did like Edward Norton and was saddened to hear he would appear in this,but Ruffalo ended doing an even better job and I hope to see him do a solo Hulk movie soon.It looks absolutely beautiful and Joss Whedon was the right choice to direct ,it's very long but if you're a fan of these characters it will fly by,it seemed like a bit of a messy concept bringing them all together and trying to focus on each character individually,it would have been hard to make it work,but Marvel did it right.An amazing ride from start to finish,the Avengers is the movie superhero fans have been waiting for,and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or adventure. Iron Man,Captain America,Thor,the Hulk and Black Widow are brought together by Nick Fury to form a gang to protect the world from Thors brother Loki.

The Santa Clause is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a good cast.I love watching this movie and the other two installments every Christmas,I enjoy them for the nostalgia purpose as I watched it constantly as a child at Christmas and it reminds me of a time when I believed in Santa Claus,and it also gets me in to the Christmas cheer.Tim Allen is without a doubt my favourite portrayal of Father Christmas,he suits the role of a man who is forced to be become Santa and really has no idea what he's suppose to do perfectly,Scott Calvin is a sweet and lovable character and I couldn't imagine anyone other than Allen playing him.The Santa Clause is a very enjoyable movie that I would definitely recommend for a family to watch at Christmas time. After trying on Santa's suit after an incident on Christmas Eve,Scott Calvin is forced to become the new Father Christmas.

Star Trek 6: The Undiscoverd Country is a great movie and a very pleasing finale for the original Star Trek crew.It's not better than Wrath Of Khan or the Voyage Home in my opinion but it's still a very good farewell to Kirk,Spock and the rest of the crew.It is certainly a huge improvement from the previous movie,the Final Frontier,I went into this movie with a negative attitude after watching that one,but I was very pleased,it had a great storyline that was developed very well and the always great cast are as good as ever in this adventure,and I got a bit upset during the final scene,it was a brilliant farewell.Fans of Star Trek will be very pleased with this final farewell to the original Star Trek crew.The Klingon Empire sue for peace,but the Enterprise is accused of an act of war against them,it's up to Spock to prove Kirk's innocence.
Now You See Me is a brilliant movie with a really well developed storyline and a very talented cast that all work very well together.The movie was very exciting and completely unpredictable,all the characters were strange and suspicious and the twist at the end was completely unexpected.The performance I liked the best in the movie is without a doubt Morgan Freeman,the entire cast did a great job but he really just stole the show,like he normally does.I liked seeing Jessie Elsenberg and Woody Harrelson together again after the great job they both did in Zombieland,and Isla Fisher and Dave Franco just add to a very professional and magical group.But the best character development had to be Mark Ruffalo's character,I won't spoil it for anyone but it was very well developed.Now You See Me is filled with excitement and twists and turns all the way through,and while I do feel like something was missing,I would still recommend to all looking for a good crime film.An agent working for the FBI investigates a case involving a group of four magicians that managed to rob a bank in France all while performing a show in America.However,it is impossible to get his hands on this team.
The Last Stand is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.The movie is certainly nothing outstanding and it's not very memorable either,but it's just a fun ride and fans of action movies will most likely enjoy.Arnold Schwarzenegger is definitely the highlight of this movie and having a real action star definitely helped make the movie better,I also really liked Johnny Knoxville,I know I complained in previous reviews about the comic relief character in action movies,but I really liked it in this,this character was genuinely funny.I think the movie didn't do a great job when it was trying to be emotional,particularity with the character of Jerry Bailey,I won't spoil anything but they made him have this connection with Schwarzenegger for about thirty seconds and then later on we are expected to really care about this character when he is in danger,which I really didn't.The Last Stand is nowhere near perfect,but it's very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action movie. After a leader of a drug cartel escapes the law he heads towards the Mexican border,however a very experienced sheriff is expecting his arrival.

Tropic Thunder is a hilarious movie with a great story line,a terrific cast that play their roles perfectly,and brilliant characters.My favourite character in the whole movie is Tom Cruise as Les Grossman,he is hilarious and nothing like any role he has played before,a spin-off movie for Grossman is planned,and I hope it gets made,because he was too funny to not have his own movie,like Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann in Knocked Up,those characters needed their own movie.I think this is Ben Stillers best directing work to date,it was very well done with a perfect combination of both comedy and action,and Robert Downey Jr was a perfect touch.I would highly recommend Tropic Thunder to all fans of both comedy and action.A group of actors starring in a movie called Tropic Thunder must not break character as they run in to some real danger near by their filming location as their main actor is kidnapped.
World Trade Center is a very mediocre movie with a decent storyline that is mostly ruined by an uninspired cast. This movie got pretty favourable reviews when it was first released, but I think that is only because it was made so soon after the September 11 attacks, it was giving people pride in watching a movie like this. Watching it today, however, it is clear that it is not a well made movie, the story tries too hard, too often to be uplifting and the actors don't try hard enough, it definitely would have been better if you had stronger actors than Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena, who deliver all their lines very poorly and show little emotion. 9/11 was a tragic event, one that will never be forgotten and will always be remembered as an very emotional event for both America and the rest of the world, people no longer felt safe and secure in their own towns, and the many deaths that happened that day are simply terrible, it's upsetting just to think about, which is why I find it very disrespectful that a film about it was even made so soon after the events. World Trade Center is a very poor film that I wouldn't recommend to anybody. Two policemen crushed by rubble from the falling towers desperately cling to life and pray for rescue.

Jennifer's Body is a pretty bad movie with a really over the top and overall unenjoyable storyline and very uninspired performances,clearly only done for a paycheck.I felt like the movie was only written to make a sexy but creepy version of Megan Fox,and they succeed with making her very attractive in a weird way,and also with Amanda Seyfried,their both very attractive actresses,but Jennifers Body is suppose to be a comedy and a horror,and I feel it failed miserably on both levels,I wasn't frightened once,nothing happens unexpectedly or suddenly,and nothing made me laugh even a small bit.If you have a huge obsession with Megan Fox,you will enjoy her in this,but if your looking to be scared or to laugh,definitely don't watch Jennifer's Body.Jennifer (Megan Fox),a young and attractive teenage cheerleader becomes possessed and starts killing the males of her town,its up to her best friend Needy (Amanda Seyfried) to put a stop to her.
Zodiac is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant cast.The movie is thrilling all the way through,as we go from detectives and journalists investigating the Zodiac killer to actually seeing the criminal in the act.The scenes where you see the Zodiac killer are very terrifying,to know that these events really happened,it also adds to the effect that we never see his face.I wasn't too fond of the music in this movie,a lot of the time it was very happy and upbeat,which didn't suit the tone of the dark and serious subject matter,there definitely should have been more thrilling music.I really enjoyed seeing all these characters lives drastically change around them,but they continue to investigate the Zodiac killer,particularity Jake Gyllenhaal,his life changes immensely over the course of many years,but no matter how much things change his number one priority is still finding out who the killer is.Zodiac is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good mystery or thriller. A newspaper cartoonist becomes obsessed with trying to identify the notorious Zodiac killer.Best Performance: Jake Gyllenhaal Worst Performance: Chloe SevignyIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Santa Clause 2 is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a good cast.Tim Allen is back once again as Scott Calvin/Santa Claus and despite the eight year gap between this movie and the first Santa Clause,he steps right back in to this role very naturally,as if he never stopped playing him,and I think those few years gave him time to improve as an actor and do an even better job this time around,he is given a lot of emotional scenes,particularly between him and his love interest,and he shines in these parts,he's in practically every scene as he also plays the villain and it dosen't get annoying to see him constantly for most of the movie.I preferred this to the first one and I know people will disagree with me,but the original is very straight forward,in this there is a lot more adventure and there's a more joyous Christmas feel to it,I love all three Santa Clause movies as they were a big part of my childhood at Christmas time,but this one is certainly my favourite.Its obviously not perfect,but the Santa Clause 2 is entertaining and funny for the whole family and I would recommend it if you're looking for a good Christmas movie. Despite some very successful years as Santa Claus,Scott Calvin may have to give it all up unless he can find a woman to be his Mrs Claus.

The Adventures Of Tintin is a fantastic movie,the animation is beautiful and greatly detailed,great voice cast,and made by two of some of the greatest directors in the world,Steven Spielberg (Jaws,Indiana Jones,E.T.,Jarassic Park,Schindlers List and Sving Private Ryan) and Peter Jackson (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy and King Kong),the two said,depending on the films success,they would make more,and hope hope it does because the feel of this film could become just as big a trilogy as Indiana Jones and Lord Of The Rings.When Tintin and his pet dog Snowy buy a rare unicorn boat piece,many people keep offering to give him money if they could have it but he says it isn't for sale,he then discovers these people will go through anything to get it,Tintin and Snowy investigate to find out why people want,on his way he meets Captain Haddock and his journey takes him through to different continents.
Vacation is a great movie with a good story a very funny and comedic cast.The movie is absolutely hilarious all the way through,and most of that credit goes to Chevy Chase,who's performance as Clark Griswold is inspired and extremely funny all the way through.I watched this movie because I love watching Christmas Vacation every year at Christmas time,but don't expect this to be as innocent,its much ruder than Christmas vacation,there's a lot of nudity and plenty of bad language,just don't expect it to be a family movie you can watch with a younger audience,although fans of other Harold Ramis films,like Ghostbusters and Chaddyshack,should love Vacation.Clark Griswald (Chevy Chase) heads off on a long drive with his family to Walley World,determined to have the perfect family vacation,but things don't go exactly as planned.
Analyze This is a very good movie with terrific performances from both Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal.Iny my opinion,particularly Billy Crystal,who I always found to be a hilarious actor in movies like When Harry Met Sally and his voice role as Mike Wozowski in Monsters Inc, he can be very funny and also very serious in the same role,meanwhile you have the terrific Robert De Niro playing his usual gangster role.Dr Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) is a happy men who is very successful with his occupation as a psychiatrist,hes got a great son,a successful father,and is getting married to Laura MacNamara (Lisa Kudrow).But his life in turned around after mobster Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) is finding Bens words very helpful and joins him on his honeymoon with Laura.
The Hangover Part Three is a fantastic movie with a surprisingly thrilling storyline that is a lot more serious and dark than the previous installments.It definitely wasn't as good as the first,but I thought it was a huge improvement from the second,mainly because it didn't follow the same formula as the previous two,I don't understand why the movie got negative reviews,I was very pleased and thought it was a brilliant farewell to these characters I've loved since 2009,they wrapped up a lot of loose ends and I really loved that.The cast are as good as ever,and I think the best performance goes to John Goodman,his character was scary and very intimidating,an almost Oscar worthy performance.Fans of the previous two Hangover's will definitely be happy with this final farewell,but if your like me,your gonna wish there was more,id be happy with another three movies,thats how much I love these characters.When Doug is kidnapped by a man who Leslie Chow stole gold from,Phil,Stu and Alan must find Chow in order to save Doug's life.
Jack is a decent movie with a good storyline and a great cast.The script at times felt like it was trying too hard to be both a comedy and a drama,by having one scene with really goofy humour and the next being really depressing,and it made the movie feel messy because neither the comedy or the drama was subtle.I certainly expected a lot more from a movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola,one of the greatest directors of all time who has given us classics such as the Godfather and Apocalypse Now,this movie was not something you'd expect him to make.I wasn't surprised to see Robin Williams in the title role,he really suited his character because he always has had a childlike sensibility,and was certainly the movies highlight,the best part was his emotional speech at the end.It upsets me that they got Robin Williams and Bill Cosby to be in several scenes together but didn't let them improvise any of their lines,they are both comedy legends and allowing them to do this would have been so perfect,but sadly they only got to go by the script.Jack has some funny moments and for Robin Williams sake you should check it out if it's ever on television and you have some time to kill. Since this is the first Robin Williams film I have reviewed since his death I'd just like to address it.He is one of the greatest actors of both comedy and drama,which he has proved with the awards he's won such as an Oscar and Golden Globes.Every role he ever did he gave it all of his heart,you could see it in his eyes and in the way he spoke,he loved his job.The world lost a true legend that day,but he will never be forgotten.His memory will live on.Forever.Rest in Peace Robin Williams. A ten year old boy who ages four times quicker than an average human being,finally convinces his overprotective parents to let him go to school,however,he has trouble fitting in because of his unusual condition.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a fantastic movie with a really intense and brilliantly written and developed storyline with a cast that follow through with their performances just as well as they did in the first Hunger Games.Its just as good as the first movie,its certainly more intense and filled with plenty of twists and turns.Phillip Seymour Hoffman joins the cast in this,and I really enjoyed him,its different to the characters i've seen him play in the past and he did a great job.But obviously the star of this movie is Jennifer Lawrence,she is an extremely talented actress and also very beautiful,and I think her performance in this is even better than the first Hunger Games,it felt more professional and experienced.Fans of the first Hunger Games will not be disappointed by Catching Fire.After their actions in the 74th annual Hunger Games,Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are forced to take part in the 75th Hunger Games along with winners of different districts from previous years.
Hancock is a decent movie with a well written storyline and an impressive cast. It's certainly a fun action movie that has a lot of very funny parts, as well as a terrific performance from Will Smith, who takes on a role nothing like what he has done previously. It's an enjoyable movie, but it has many, many flaws, the biggest one is that the main character is not very likable for the majority of the movie, I know it's on purpose for the most part, but seeing him throw a kid up in to the sky and flinging a whale in to a boat was way too much and it wasn't necessary if you want us to support this character. Also the movies main villains don't show up until about fifty minutes in and don't start doing anything until about the last twenty, which is a significant problem, especially for a superhero movie, where a villain is one of the most important parts. There are several other problems, the cheesy effects, the anti-climactic ending, the lame twist, the lack of comedy from Jason Bateman's character, this movie easily could have been an 8, but because of all these major mistakes, I had to go down to 6. It's nowhere near perfect, but Hancock is still quite enjoyable and it might make for a good watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. After a down on his luck superhero named Hancock saves a man's life, this man feels he owes it to him to make Hancock in to the real superhero he should be.

Full Metal Jacket is a terrific movie with a fantastic story line,an outstanding,yet somehow not well known,cast and inspired characters,exactly what you would expect from the great Stanley Kubrick.My favourite part of the movie was R.Lee Ermey's performance as the the General Hartman,he doesn't stay in it for a very long time,only about the first forty minutes of the movie,but he plays his character with all heart and soul from start,with a loud and very strict personality,I really enjoyed him in the movie,and if his voice sounds familiar to you,he's the voice of Sarge from Toy Story.The story of how a group of people go through their life as part of the Marines,from training,to Vietnam,to the battle field.
Gangster Squad is a great movie with a clever storyline and a very talented cast.I really enjoyed Josh Brolin,Ryan Gosling,Giovanni Ribisi and especially Emma Stone,a very talented and attractive actress,she's gorgeous and does a great performance in this movie.The only performance I didn't enjoy was Sean Penn,his character was annoying and his acting was just uninspired,they could have made him much more intimidating,he just felt like a parody of a mob boss,even though he was suppose to be serious.Enjoyed this movie and I don't think it deserved all the negative reviews it got,I thought it was very refreshing,because gangster movies are rarely made lately,and fans of gangster films should enjoy Gangster Squad.John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) starts a crew called the 'gangster squad' who will not rest until they find and arrest Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn).
Jurassic Park is a brilliant movie with a great storyline,characters,cast,thrills and suspense.The film was directed by Steven Spielberg,I,like many movie buffs,am a huge fan of him.No movie this man has directed,wrote or produced has disappointed me (some exceptions but,whatever).This movie is brilliant and there where two other installments,The Lost World:Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3,they where nowhere as good as the original,but,Steven Spielberg is currently in talks for a fourth Jurassic Park,and it seems very likely that there will be one by 2014.I will definitely go see one,I don't wanna give my hopes up but I for some reason feel it will be better than the second and third,lets hope so.A man takes a preview of a new theme park with his family that he is positive to sponsor.The theme park involves real cloned dinosaurs,trapped in cages.But after a power breakdown,the dinosaurs escape,and no one is safe.
Your Highness is a great movie with a fun spoof on fantasy adventure films that brings great comedic performances from Danny McBride,Natalie Portman,James Franco and Zooey Deschanel.I find this movie very underrated,it wasn't very well reviewed and was a box office bomb,but still go by my own opinion that this is a very enjoyable movie that was a very fun mix of movies like Pineapple Express with effects and characters like Lord of the Rings.The main cast members, who are all American, really pulled off keeping an English accent for the whole movie,I was really impressed by this and didn't think they would manage.My favourite character is definitely Natalie Portman's,it was a very different role for her, her character was funny and also a very independent woman,also very attractive,as Natalie a Portman always is.I would love to see a sequel to this movie but it is unlikely because of how it did financially and critically,but it ended with such a good set up for a sequel.It certainly isn't a perfect comedy,and it definitely would have been better if they got Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg involved in some way, but Your Highness is still much better than average and I would definitely recommend it to fans of movies like Pineapple Express and Superbad.When a spin to prince's wife is kidnapped on their wedding day,he sets out to save her with his lazy and careless younger brother.
Out of the Furnace is a great movie with a really well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is very slow and drags out a lot,but this didn't particularly bother me,I actually enjoyed that it was slow and really took its time,something that normally bothers me with some films,it really just wanted to develop a story and make use feel as if these characters are real,and did a great job.The character development in this film is outstanding,we really get to know there people and really feel for them and their problems,most of the development is in Christian Bale and Casey Affleck's characters,but the other characters all develop reasonably well,the character development is definitely the movies best feature.My biggest problem with the movie is that I don't feel like they really use this amazing cast to full effect,the cast is outstanding,severally of them being Academy Award nominated or winning actors,and I felt like the director didn't really take advantage of that,we have clearly seen for several movies that Christian Bale is a much better actor than he is in this movie,not that he isn't good,I just felt like he wasn't as interested in this character as he usually is,and the director is to blame for that.Out of the Furnace is a very dramatic movie that includes a great cast and outstanding character development,it's not a brilliant movie,but it's definitely worth a watch.After his brother mysteriously disappears after fighting a gang for money,Russell Baze (Christian Bale) decides to take the law in to his own hands to find his brother when the police aren't coming through fast enough.
Batman Begins is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant cast.Before this movie fans started losing faith in Batman after the disastrous Batman Forever with Val Kilmer,followed by another major disappointment,Batman & Robin with George Clooney,but Christopher Nolan saved this franchise,he made the Batman universe much more realistic and darker,the villains are terrifying,even more so because they could actually be real (unlike villains such as Mr. Freeze or Poison Ivy).Christian Bale really suited Bruce Wayne,you could tell from start to finish that he was dedicated and wanted to play this character,but he isn't the only great actor in this movie,we also have great performances from people such as Michael Caine,Liam Neeson,Ken Watanabe,Cillian Murphy,Morgan Freeman,Katie Holmes and Gary Oldman,the cast and characters are outstanding and yet none of them felt like they were done too little or too much.The start of a terrific trilogy that only improves,Batman Begins is a terrific movie that I would recommend to all fans of the franchise and to anyone looking for a good action or adventure movie. After a traumatic childhood and some intense training,Bruce Wayne is ready to fight crime on the dangerous streets of Gotham City in disguise as Batman. Best Performance: Christian Bale Worst Performance: Gus Lewis If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Superbad is an unbelievable movie with a really good storyline,a very talented cast and hilarious characters created by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg.Its possibly Seth Rogen's greatest film,all his movies are very funny,but Superbad will leave you in pain with laughter.Jonah Hill and Michael Cera both do a great job in this movie,but my favourite part of the movie is Christopher Mintz-Plasse and the two cops,played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader,Fogell,aka McLovin,is probably the funniest character in the movie,and the two cops are a perfect addition to the movie,they both had that kind of Chief Wiggum attitude,which I found so funny,because you would wonder what ever inspired people like this to become police officers.Fans of Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill movies will love Superbad for what it is,a good and really funny movie,with some surprising heart.Seth (Jonah Hill),Evan (Michael Cera) and Fogell (Christopher Mintz- Plasse) try to buy alcohol using a fake ID in order to bring it to a party and possibly lose their virginity,but getting their hands on some alcohol proves a lot more difficult that they expected.
Die Hard is an absolutely fantastic action film with a great cast,a great storyline,and good humor,especially from Bruce Willis's character John McClaine and from the films villain Hans Gruber,played by Alan Rickman.I'm a big fan of Bruce Willis and obviously this is his greatest and most well known role,and it would have to be with all its sequels.I like how they have a small Christmas setting to it,even though the movie came out in July,and how,even the movie is more than two hours long,it all takes place in one night.Its up to John McClaine to save to day from terrorists who are holding people hostage in an LA office,while having a desire to win his wife and kids back.
World War Z is a fantastic movie with a very well written storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie was a very interesting turn for Brad Pitt,he hasn't done a movie like this in the past and while the story did sound really cliché,getting a great cast like this is what makes it much more enjoyable and the point that the zombie apocalypse story has been used several times before isn't a huge issue when actors as talented as Brad Pitt are in the main role.My only real problem with the movie is that it really avoids being violent,whenever you see a character get attacked by a zombie,you see very little or no blood,and the zombies design aren't very gruesome, which I thought lost the effect of the movie being scary,they probably had very little violence to keep the 15A rating.World War Z is a very enjoyable and action packed movie that I would recommend to all fans of action and adventure films. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt),a United Nations employee is enlisted with a group to protect people from a zombie pandemic that is spreading quick.
I Love You Phillip Morris is a good movie with a pretty good story line and an impressive cast,and if your like me you'll be wildly confused that this is actually based on a true story.I have nothing against homosexuality,but I honestly found some of the things we see Jim Carrey doing in this movie very disturbing,not that I'm against it,it was just an unusual thing to see him doing,especially for the fact that he has been married to some very attractive women.I also found it an unusual character for Carrey because I found him unlikeable,he was up to a lot of different crimes and proved very heartless to his loved ones at times,and this was strange,as his characters are usually crazy and hilarious,and extremely lovable.All in all,I Love You Phillip Morris is a better than average comedy that I would recommend to fans of Jim Carrey,and also to people who like dark comedy.When Steven Russel (Jim Carrey) realises he is gay,he starts to live a high profile life with his new boyfriend,but he must become a con man to afford it.He is found out and put into prison,where he meets Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor).
Finding Nemo is a fantastic movie,is humor able,emotional,the cast is great,the characters are great and the storyline is great,the movies a blast from start to finish,it touching to see how far a father will go for the love of his son.A clown-fish named Melvin (Albert Brooks),lost his wife and more than 400 kids one day when a shark comes by his area,only one of his kids are left and he decides to call him Nemo.A few years later its time for Nemos first day at school,but after what happened to his wife and kids,Melvin is very overprotective over Nemo in case something could happen to him.Although Melvin was right to be worried because Nemos new teacher takes the class to an area where fisherman can be seen,Melvin goes to check if Nemos OK and Nemos swims very far out and a fisherman crabs him before he knows.Nemo wakes up later in a tank in a dentist,with several other fishes that are sick of living in a tank and with the help of Nemo plan an escape.Melvin is worried sick and with the help of a female fish who suffers from long term memory lost named Dory (voiced by Ellen Degenerees),they head on a journey threw the big sea to make there destination to P.Sherman 42 Wallaby Way,Sydney,and along the way they encounter sharks,jellyfish and turtles,but they'll make there way through it all as long as they 'just keep swimming'.
Inglorious Basterds is an amazing movie with a terrific storyline,action,violence,cast and characters to one fantastic and very different movie.Quentin Tarantino brings us a terrific script and direction which shows just how brilliant he is at what he does.They also picked a great cast for this movie,especially Brad Pitts amazing role as Lt.Aldo Raine.Some other terrific acting was given by Christoph Waltz,Melanie Laurent,Michael Fassbender,Diane Kruger and Martin Wuttke.There where also some terrific cameo appearances from people such as Rod Taylor and Mike Myers,who I am a very big fan of.In Nazi occupied France,a plan is all coming together for a group working hard to kill the Nazis.The plan is working out perfectly when all the Nazis are attending a theater premiere,and the theater owner has the same plans made.
Death to Smoochy is a mediocre movie with a promising storyline that simply wasn't done as well as it could have,and a terrific cast that sadly weren't enough to save this.The premise seemed very clever and unique,and having Danny Devito directing,Edward Norton as the protagonist and Robin Williams as the antagonist seemed like such a sure fire hit,but it was just disappointing on so many levels.It went on much longer than it needed to,being almost two hours,it definitely should have been quicker and also more light hearted,it was very dark at times and simply took itself too seriously in several scenes,which I found unnecessary for this type of movie.The ending scene was without a doubt the highlight for me,it was very well filmed and looked absolutely beautiful,Williams and Nortons dancing was stellar,and it almost convinced me that I enjoyed the entire movie,which I found a little annoying because I was feeling a bit reluctant to give this movie a five because of how much I loved that scene,it certainly warmed my heart and if the rest of the movie was more like that scene,I'd be giving this a better review.Has some funny moments and an inspired cast,but Death to Smoochy dosen't deliver the fun and laughs that were necessary for me to recommend it,and I think you would be better off avoiding it. A corrupt TV clown who was been sacked for taking bribes,swears vengeance on his replacement.Best Performance: Robin Williams Worst Performance: Pam FerrisIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Righteous Kill is a better than average movie with a decent storyline that is certainly a lot more promising that it turned out and a great cast.I was really excited to watch this movie,the story sounded so original and thrilling,and with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in the leads I thought it was definitely going to be great,and while it was certainly not awful,it was very disappointing.De Niro and Pacino's performance a good,but it was enough to making up for the screenplay that has a lot less thrills and excitement that I thought and is at times very predictable.I felt like the cast only did this for money because I find it unlikely that they genuinely thought it was a great script,however,the cast is definitely the reason why I am not giving this movie a lower score,because their professional acting made some really poorly written scenes much more bearable.Righteous Kill is not an awful film,it certainly is watchable,but unless you just want to see every film with Robert De Niro or Al Pacino,you're better off avoiding this one.Two New York cops investigate a series of murders where the victims are criminals who have escaped justice.If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Meet Dave is a below average movie with a ridiculous storyline and a cast that clearly only agreed to this movie for some money.I like a lot of cast,Eddie Murphy,Elizabeth Banks,Ed Helms and Kevin Hart are all actors i've enjoyed in the past,but known of them were enough to make up for how stupid this movie was,how unlikeable the characters were and how there was literally no scene in this movie that I actually found properly funny,I did laugh at times,but there was nothing really hilarious,and I found the idea of little aliens controlling Eddie Murphy just creepy.Fans of Eddie Murphy or a parent that wants a movie to watch with the family should definitely avoid this movie,your not going to enjoy it if you have any taste in comedy.A diminutive captain controls a an sized humanoid spaceship on a quest to Earth with the rest of his tiny crew on a mission to drain Earth's oceans.
Lethal Weapon is a brilliant movie with a really enjoyable and intense storyline with a very impressive cast.There was very good on screen chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover,they were two very different characters put to work together in a very serious situation,and thats what makes it work out so well.I think it would have been better off if we didn't what happened to the girl at the beginning of the film and let us figure it out for ourselves,but it didn't other me too much.I would definitely recommend Lethal Weapon to all fans of action and crime films.Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson),an on the edge cop,teams up with a straight laced partner,Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover),to discover the truth behind the death of an old friend of Roger's daughter.
You've Got Mail is a below average film with a very dull storyline that never really gets interesting and an uninspired cast.Tom Hanks is without a doubt one of my favourite actors of all time but I just did not enjoy his performance in this film,I think he was extremely aware of how cliché and cheesy this movie is and that's why he wasn't putting in the great acting he is well capable of.As for Meg Ryan,I loved her When Harry Met Sally,but her character in this is just not likable and at times very irritating.I don't know why people consider this movie to be such a good romantic comedy,a really romance story between the two characters dosen't really develop properly until like the last half an hour and there isn't a single scene I found genuinely funny.You've Got Mail is a boring typical romantic comedy that I would not recommend to anyone. A man and woman develop a romantic online relationship,unaware that they are actually business rivals.
Short Circuit is a good movie with a good storyline and a decent but not fantastic cast.I watched the movie because my mom always talked about it as a fond movie she remembers as a child,but it definitely wouldn't hold up today,the effects and especially the acting is very cheesy,but its almost impossible not to fall in love with Number 5,he's a very funny and lovable character.I wasn't impressed with the cast,however,I did enjoy G.W. Bailey's performance,I really enjoyed his asshole that he proved from Police Academy that he can pull it off very well.Short Circuit is a very fun movie that the whole family can enjoy.After the fifth member of a group of robots is electrocuted,he forms human feelings and emotions,and escapes his organisation with no intention of returning.
Kill Bill: Volume 2 is a terrific movie with a great story,fantastic cast and characters,plenty of action and violence that make it a great conclusion to the two parts.However,I was slightly disappointed,the first part was a lot better,there was a lot less action and violence in this one and focuses much more on the story and on The Bride making her way to Bill,but it still is just as good,just not better.Quentin Tarantino has expressed interest in making a third part,at the moment it doesn't seem like he will,but I hope things change because I would definitely want to see this continue.The Bride (Uma Thurman) continues her quest to find and kill Bill,but she must get threw a lot more people to finally make her way to him,but she knows exactly what to do to finally seek her revenge.
Dumb and Dumber To is s great movie with a well written storyline and a terrific comedic cast.I was going to give this a seven instead of an eight,but because of the of the fact that it still delivers some huge laughs and the nostalgia of seeing Llyod and Harry again,I'm giving it an eight.Admittedly it is disappointing,I am a huge fan of the original Dumb and Dumber,and I was nervous about this from the start,but I was still laughing the whole way through and was definitely more impressed than a lot of people were.Despite a twenty year gap,Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels step back in to these roles very naturally,I was very impressed with their performances as they have done very different projects since then,and played many different characters,which just showed that they are such great actors as they reprise their roles as Llyod and Harry without it feeling forced or strange.The movie could easily get a nine if it wasn't for the final act,I was enjoying it immensely until then,they were perfectly balancing funny jokes while still following the story,but the last thirty minutes were certainly a let down were the story just begins to fall and the biggest laughs definitely come from the first hour and ten minutes of the film.I still think a third movie should be made,Carrey,Daniels and the Farrelly brothers clearly enjoyed making this and I think they could improve on a few of the mistakes made in this movie to do a Dumb and Dumber sequel to fans deserve,I'm not ready to say goodbye to these stupid but lovable characters.It is nowhere near as memorable as the original,but Dumb and Dumber To is still an enjoyable comedy that the fans should enjoy,but don't expect perfection. When Harry discovers he has a daughter,himself and Llyod set out on an adventure to find her so she can donate her kidney to Harry.

500 Days of Summer is a great movie with a very clever and surprisingly different story and very impressive performances from both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.I was very impressed with this movie,because I walked in to expecting it to be a cliché love story,but it really wasn't and it was also surprisingly very funny at times.I was also very impressed with the ending,I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it,but you will not see it coming,I Didn't want it to end like that,but I was impressed with it because it was totally unexpected,but it was very depressing because it's not how I wanted things to be for these two characters.Fans of romantic comedies that are actually good movies (When Harry Met Sally,As Good As It Gets,etc) will definitely appreciate 500 Days of Summer for being very unique and different.Two young lovers share a tumultuous 500 days as their relationship founders.
The Hunger Games is a great movie,with great action,storyline and actors.I was surprised with how much I liked it,because I thought it was just another movie based on a book trying to be as big as Harry Potter (like Twilight),but it really isn't.Before I left to go see I found on IMDb that it was 2 hours and a half,and I thought I was going to be very bored because movies that long,for example,Transformers and Titanic,really start to bore me,but the time flew with this movie.An annual event called The Hunger Games is beginning again,in which two people,a boy and a girl,are picked randomly for the event,it involves twelve districts and 23 people,and only one can survive.We follow Katniss Everdeen who takes part in the Hunger Games to save her sisters life,along with Peeta Mellark,a boy who has a huge crush on her.They do a lot of training,but are they ready for the real thing?
Mission Impopssible 3 is a great movie with a great cast,storyline,action,comedy and suspense,it keeps you watching all the way through.I've never been a huge fan of the Mission:Impossible series,but every time I watch any of them I really enjoy them and I found the plot to this one very smart and well thought out.Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise) is getting married to his love Julia (Michelle Monaghan),but he and his new team for the MIF have to track down a weapon dealer named Owen Davien (Phillip Seymour Hoffman),who has also murdered a share of people.Ethan must protect his wife from him,because he still doesn't know about MIF.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.I do think that the movies story feels all over the place for a while but eventually it all comes together very nicely.A put of people gave out that this movie had too many villains,similar to Spider-Man 3,but I think this movie put in a lot of villains in a much better way in this movie,it made sense and added more excitement to the story,rather than just feeling scattered like it did the other film,also the villains had connections in this,whereas in Spider-Man 3 no villain really had anything to do with one another.I think this movie improves so much on the first Amazing Spider-Man,it had more comedy,Andrew Garfield seems a lot more confident than he did in the first,and the Spider-Man universe expands and develops so much more,also getting Jamie Foxx to play Electro was a strange choice,but he ended being really good and also terrifying.Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a great movie that all Spider-Man fans will be very impressed with.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is faced with even more challenges after the head of Oscorp Harry Osborn is trying to track down Spider-Man,while a fan of the superhero,Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx),turns in to a deadly villain called Electro.Best Performance: Andrew Garfield Worst Performance: Paul GiamattiIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Unstoppable is a great movie with a very well developed storyline with a very talented cast.The film is very well directed by Tony Scott,this being his final film before his tragic death.The film is very intense after only about ten minutes in and after that it is extremely thrilling and exciting till the very end.Denzel Washington and Chris Pine both deliver great performances,they clearly got on well together and it showed from how interested they seemed in their characters.The movie is also filmed in a very original way that added to the effect of making the movie feel fast,and the actors never lose any energy or interest throughout.Unstoppable is a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or thriller .Two railway workers must try and stop a locomotive that's on course with a trainload of kids.
Mr And Mrs Smith is a good movie with great cast that started one of the most popular celebrity couples,Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.This film is obviously not Jennifer Anistons favourite because if it was never made,Brad Pitt would never have met Angelina Jolie.At an amazing coincidence,Vince Vaughn is also in in this film,and the next year he starred with Jennifer Aniston in The Break Up,they ended up dating after it,but ultimately didn't work out.Ever since Friends ended,Jennifer Aniston hasn't been lucky with films or romance.John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) have been married for years,but the two never told each other that they are assassins,the two are shocked to find they must kill each other,which causes big trouble in there marriage.
The Big Bang Theory is a terrific series,its insanely funny,the main reasons being how nerdy the characters are.Like everyone else,my favourite is without a doubt Sheldon Cooper (played by Jim Parsons),Sheldon is such a jerk and cant help but correct people and that what makes him so funny,another favourite of mine would be Raj,he is hilarious mainly because of him not able to make any effort to talk to women unless he has alcohol in him.Four nerds,trying to handle there job as doctors while handling the women in there lives,are also still able to keep up with there comic books as there weekly store.Leonard lives with Sheldon,who he finds very hard to live with while dating his neighbor across the way,Penny.Seldon is also dating a girl called Amy who is very like him.Howard,still lives with his mother and is engaged to a girl called Bernadette,and Raj,lives in an apartment on his own because he is unable to talk to women.
Big Mommas House is s fairly funny movie but it wont have you laughing out loud,but I still think its quite good and better than the sequels,I do like Big Mommas House 2 though but Big Mommas Like Father Like Son should have never been made.Martin Lawrence saves these movies with his brilliant portrayal as Malcolm Turner and the fake Big Momma.Martin Lawrence stars as Malcolm Turner,an Fbi agent who investigates on a case with his partner John (Paul Giamatti),by dressing up as a girls grandmother to get Sherry (Nia Long) to confess what she did,not knowing he's an FBI agent.However Malcolm starts to fall for Sherry and feels she is innocent.
Everything Must Go is a better than average movie with a pretty good story at this very depressing and is much more of a drama than a comedy,there are plenty of funny parts but it is not something you could consider a feel good comedy.Will Ferrell delivers a very impressive performance,it is nothing like what he has done in the past,if your a fan of him in movies liked Anchorman or Step Brothers,don't expect this to be another one of those,thats what I put the movie on expecting and it certainly wasn't,but I was impressed with his acting,it was very deep.I think the movie definitely needed more time to develop the other characters,we got to learn plenty about Nick,but we didn't get to know enough about the other characters he communicates with in this movie,also I would haver liked to see his ex-wife in at least one scene.If your a fan of very dramatic comedies then I would say check it out,but if your a fan of Will Ferrell for his usual goofy comedies,you won't enjoy this,however,if your interested in seeing him in different more unique roles,then you should check out Everything Must Go.An alcoholic sales exec decides to love on his front lawn when his job and marriage come to an end on the same day and he can't afford to own a house.
Independence Day is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a very talented cast.The effects in this film are outstanding and rightfully won an an Academy Award for Best Special Effects,some shots are a bit dated,but the majority still hold up today and this movie is without a doubt a milestone in film making history.Will Smith is definitely the movies highlight,his character is extremely likable and has many great lines,this movie is the start of his film career since the Fresh Prince of Bel Air finished,and it was a very promising performance and he has gone on to further prove he is a great actor.The movie does of course have its flaws,the main thing being that some of the characters are very stereotypical and I think some dialogue,particularly from Bill Pullman's character,is very cheesy,but it's very easy to look past this.Independence Day is a groundbreaking part of film history,and it's also very enjoyable,I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure or science fiction film. When aliens attack Earth it's up to a Maverick pilot to save the planet.

Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is a great movie with a well written storyline and a really great comedic cast.The movie is absolutely hilarious from start to finish,it wouldn't be on my list of favourite comedies,but it is a movie that whenever it is on TV I will watch and enjoy,and laugh at the exact same parts.This movie also has some very quotable lines,most of them coming from Ben Stiller's character White Goodman,who is without a doubt my favourite part of the movie,he was a very different character for Stiller and he played him very well.Dodgeball is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy. When his gym is in danger of closing down,Peter (Vince Vaughn) and some of his best customers and close friends enter in to a dodgeball tournament in order to win enough money to save his gym.

Lawless is a great movie with a well written and very well developed storyline,a very talented cast and very good character development.The movie is based on a true story,which I found to be a very interesting and fun way to learn about how people loved during the Great Depression,as we follow these men making great money with high quality moonshine.Shia LaBeouf,Jessica Chastain and Guy Pearce all bring fantastic performances,among many others ,but the best performance has to go to Tom Hardy,his character Forrest was the most likable and he pulls off a really great accent and was clearly inspired to play this character.I would highly recommend Lawless to fans of both crime and drama films.Set towards the end of the Great Depression,a gang of men producing high quality moonshine are out under huge pressure when many people want to get their hands on this product.
Horrible Bosses 2 is a brilliant movie with a well written storyline and an outstanding comedic cast.The first Horrible Bosses is certainly better,but this sequel this totally holds up and delivers many very entertaining and laugh out loud scenes.The three leads are still in great form the second time around and you can tell that Bateman,Sudekis and Day are all great friends,and they are joined by a star studded supporting cast that includes Christoph Waltz,Chris Pine,Jennifer Aniston,Jamie Foxx,Kevin Spacey and Breaking Bad's Jonathan Banks.Pine would have to be my favourite out of the supporting cast,his character had the best dialogue and he was surprisingly great at comedy.The movie thankfully dosen't follow the same premise as the first,which is something that a lot of comedy movies do and I was very grateful that they took a very different approach from the first.Packed with tons of laughs and a great cast,I would definitely recommend Horrible Bosses 2 to fans of the first and to anyone looking for a good comedy. After they fail to get an investment from a very successful business man,Nick,Kurt and Dale decide to kidnap his son to receive the money they need to run the business.

The Smurfs 2 is a decent movie with a storyline that feels very messy and for a long time dosen't really go anywhere.The cast,both live action and voice only,are great and sometimes just feel waisted by this movie,especially Neil Patrick Harris.I still really enjoyed Hank Azaria as Gargamel,I always enjoy him in everything he's in,but other than that,this movie is not enjoyable for any family member older than ten,its certainly not as good as the first Smurfs,which I felt had enough for adults to enjoy.The characters just didn't feel as 'alive' as they were in the first either,some of the main characters in the first are barely in it and the ones that are just don't have as much screen time,not Papa Smurf and Clumsy.I also enjoyed Brendan Gleeson,he was surprisingly funny,which I never expected from him.An older audiences will enjoy Hank Azaria and Brendan Gleeson,but other than that,the Smurfs is a childish and disappointing sequel.Smurfette is kidnapped by Gargamel's two new creations the Naughties in order to get a secret spell from her.Its up to Papa Smurf,Clumsy,Vainy,Grouchy and their friends from New York to save her.
Scooby Doo 2 Monsters Unleashed is a funny,light hearted family film that stays true to the Hanna Barbera series.Its one my favorite family films and one I remember fondly because I loved the series as a child and I enjoyed the way they combined different monsters from the series and put them into one big adventure for Scooby,Shaggy and the gang.I like it more than the first one,which I also enjoyed but feel it doesn't have much of what you would usually see in the series and don't like how they take a huge stab at Scrappy Doo.Scooby Doo and the gang face there biggest adventure yet as the costumes of monsters the mystery gang are brought to life after getting robbed by the Coolsville Museum Of Nstural History,the gang investigate while Shaggy and Scooby try to be better detectives and take there job more seriously,Velma falls for a history geek played by Seth Green and Fred keeps getting exploited by the media.
Pale Rider is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline with a very impressive cast.The movie stars and is directed by Clint Eastwood,who is no stranger to westerns,and his character isn't much different than the character he plays in the Dollars trilogy,but this movie has a lot more heart and is much more sweet than any western i've ever seen,i'm not saying that westerns should have more heart,but seeing some western characters with stronger emotions was refreshing and different.The movie is beautifully directed by Eastwood and the entire cast deliver strong performances.If your a fan of of westerns and Clint Eastwood then Pale Rider is a must see.A mysterious preacher is determined to stop ruthless landowners from stealing the land of a group of poor gold miners.
The Beach is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a talented cast.The movie certainly wasn't as intense or thrilling as I thought it would have been from reading a few plot summaries,but it was a very fun adventure film,it's not very memorable but it's good while it lasts.Leonardo DiCaprio was certainly the highlight of the movie,he is one of the best actors for starring in a movie with a mediocre storyline but making it much better by bringing his character to life as much as he possibly can and delivering a fantastic performance.The last thirty minutes of the movie is definitely the best,it's the most intense and has a pleasing ending.The Beach is an enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good adventure film. A traveller in Bangkok sets off to an idyllic beach community.But the real world intrudes on his paradise.Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio Worst Performance: Guillaume CanetIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Oceans Eleven is a great movie with a very well written storyline and an outstanding cast.The cast members were all clearly great friends off screen and they clearly loved working together on this movie.Every cast member also play very unique characters that are nothing like anyone they ever played before,which I really liked,their personalities are very different to any other movie they had done previously.The movie storyline is very impressive as we see this casino heist that was very well planned out,so much so that it's like the writers would manage to successfully rob a casino in real life.Oceans Eleven is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looming for a great crime movie.With some help from an old friend who assembles impressive team,Danny Ocean (George Clooney) attempts to rob three Las Vegas Casinos in one night. Best Performance: Brad Pitt Worst Performance: Scott CaanIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Shooter is a great movie with a very well developed and well written storyline and a very talented cast.The movie is action packed from start to finish and also very dramatic,I felt like it was more realistic than most action movies,the characters behaviour in this movie seems like they way real people would act if an event like this occurred,unlike most action movies where the characters usually have no fear and can make their way through anything,I felt this suited the tone of the movie very well and making it more realistic added to the drama.Mark Wahlberg delivers a fantastic performance Bob Swagger,I find him to be a very hit and miss actor but this time around I was very impressed with him,his characters usually have a clichéd "action movie star" personality but Swagger felt more life like and human.Shooter is a highly enjoyable action and drama movie and I would highly recommend it to fans of both genres.A former marksman currently living in a much more peaceful environment helps out when rumors spread that someone is trying to assassinate the president,but he is then framed for being the assassin,he looks to find out who it really is and why they would frame him,while is face is one of the most wanted and recognized across the USA.
Withnail & I is a fairly funny film with a bit of a dark setting,it's a well received comedy but its not really my kind of humor and I didn't really get a lot of the jokes in it.I watched it because I'm trying to watch a show I saw called The 50 Greatest Comedy Films,I'm trying to watch all the films on the list and Withnial & I made it in at 21.Two drug abusers,Withnail and Marwood (I),Withnail being educated and upper crust and Marwood having more of a visual outlook on life,escape from there unemployed,stay at Withnails uncle Montys cottage.Monty is a middle aged homosexual who begins to fall for Marwood.-DILLON HARRIS
Superman 2 is a great movie with a great story line,a great cast and of course fantastic characters.I know it isn't considered to be,but I thought this sequel improved on the first Superman,because the first one can be very cheesy at times,and they got rid of that,also the main villains are more intimidating and we also really get to see Superman as a hero in this.I found it to be a very fresh,and slightly improved sequel.Three criminals from the planet Kryptonite escape and are causing trouble around Earth.Superman is the only person who can possibly stop them,but he gave up his powers so he can be with Lois Lane.-DILLON HARRIS
Shame is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.The performances are fantastic and the screenplay is certainly nothing like any other film,but I really wasn't that interested in this.I get why it may be a clever look inside the world of a person suffering from addiction and depression,but I felt little sympathy for Fassbenders character and didn't even see the reason for why we were following his story in the first place,sure he was suffering from a serious addiction but I didn't see the need for it to be chronicled in a whole movie.However,Michael Fassbender was fantastic in the lead role and he was certainly given a character not quite like a person anyone else played before,which is why he deserved so much credit for his acting,because there really isn't any other movie or performance that he could have looked towards for inspiration,Carey Mulligan also did a great job,she isn't a huge actress yet but I'm hoping she will really hit it off someday because she's fantastic in any film I've seen her in,and these two actors are certainly the reason why I didn't give this movie a lower rating.Its definitely worth the watch if you see it on television,mainly because of the performances as the story is really nothing breathtaking,but Shame is definitely an enjoyable drama. A New Yorker suffering with a sex addiction is put under more stress when his sister suddenly turns up.Best Perfornance: Michael Fassbender Worst Performance: James Badge DaleIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Police Academy is a good movie with an average storyline and a good,comedic cast.Its certainly not a genius comedy,there's an awful lot of hit and miss,but jokes do work out well,they work out really well,and they almost make up for the amount of misses.I liked Steve Guttenberg's character,he mainly what makes this movie so enjoyable and I don't understand why they even carried on with the fhranchise without him.The humour in Police Academy is undeniably stupid,but its hard not to enjoy,if you enjoy goofy comedies,you'll probably get a good kick out of it.Follows the antics of inept police recruits,who enlist when the mayor of an American city waives entry requirements.
A Good Day To Die Hard is a good movie with a decent story line,a great cast and fantastic characters.Its without a doubt,the worst Die Hard so far,but I think that critics are exaggerating and its not as bad as their making it out to be.Im afraid these bad reviews will danger any sixth Die Hard ever happening,as disappointed as I was by this,I still want to see more,I think they can definitely improve on this.They will never be able to make another Die Hard,but they could at least make one as good as Die Hard 4.0,I want to see Bruce Willis playing John McClane till the day he dies.John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back,and goes to Russia to help his son Jack,who has been arrested for shooting someone to prevent a nuclear heist.
Madagascar is a great movie with a very enjoyable storyline with a talented and very energetic voice cast topped off with beautiful and colourful animation.The movie is filled with very funny scenes,plenty for both younger and older audiences to enjoy,also the characters are very lovable.While I do like the four main characters,they aren't the movies highlights, that is without a doubt King Julien,voiced brilliantly by Sacha Baron Cohen,and of course the penguins,almost everything these characters say is gold.Madagascar is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend for the whole family to enjoy.After Marty the zebra (voiced by Chris Rock) escapes from the New York Zoo,himself and his four best friends,Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller),Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melvin the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) end up stranded on the island of Madagascar.
Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult is a hilarious movie with a decent storyline and yet again another brilliant and comedic performance from Leslie Nielsen as Frank Drebin.Its definitely not as good as the outstanding first Naked Gun,one of the funniest comedies ever made in my opinion,but I thought it was an improvement from the first Naked Gun,I thought there was a lot more hilarious scenes in this one and I really enjoyed the scenes at the Academy Awards towards the end of the movie.Some people may disagree,but I think this Naked Gun is an improvement over the second one and fans of the first won't enjoy it as much,but they will laugh a lot.Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) must convince a gang that he is also a criminal in order to stop a bomb from being set off at the Academy Awards.
Rocky Balboa is a great movie with a very well developed storyline with a great cast.This movie was a very pleasing finale to the Rocky series and I certainly think it's the best of them other than the original.The second and third are are still good but the fourth and fifth were absolute disasters and extremely disappointing,this movie certainly made me forget about those unnecessary sequels.A lot of the main cast may not have returned for this but the ones that did do a great job,Sylvester Stallone and Burt Young had not played these characters for years and yet watching them in this it was as if they never stopped being Rocky and Paulie.Rocky Balboa is a great end to the Rocky franchise and fans of the previous films with definitely be pleased.The famous boxer comes out of retirement to take on the current heavyweight champion.Best Performance: Sylvester Stallone Worst Performance: Milo VentimigliaIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Snakes On A Plane is a pretty bad movie movie with a very predictable storyline that I thought seemed like an original idea,but the excitement of snakes attacking people on an airplane wear's off after about five minutes.The story thing that really made this movie likable was Samuel L. Jackson,who gave a very strong performance,I always loved him as an actor,but know matter how good he was,he just couldn't make up for how stupid the story and dialog was.I won't spoil it for anyone reading this who hasn't seen it,but the ending was definitely my least favourite part of the movie,it was extremely unrealistic and left some questions unanswered.If your a fan of action movies or if you want to watch a good thriller,I would not recommend Snakes On A Plane.Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson),a member of the FBI, must protect a bunch of people on an airplane that is being attacked by snacks that were released to kill him and a witness murder on a plane to LA.
The Usual Suspects is a brilliant movie with a really clever,different and extremely well developed storyline,with a really talented cast that all portrayed their characters perfectly.The best performance goes of course to Kevin Spacey,he delivered such a fantastic performance as Verbal,the character was both very likable and unlikeable in a very weird way,and the twist at the end which I will not spoil it extremely unexpected,you will not see it coming,he definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (although I do not see how his character was a 'supporting role',he had more lines than anyone else for sure).The Usual Suspects is both a well written and well acted film that will easily withstand the test of time,I would highly recommend it to all fans of both crime movies and thrillers.After a boat has been destroyed and killing many men,Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey) tells the tale from his point of view how the incident came together.
Arthur Christmas is a fantastic Christmas movie which I am sure will we well remembered in a few years time and will be considered a great yearly Christmas film that family's will continue to watch every Christmas ,the film is absolutely heartwarming,a great storyline,great characters and terrific animation,Aardman has done it again.Its Christmas eve,Santa and his two sons and a massive crew of elf's are finished delivering more than a billion presents to more than a billion houses to more than a billion kids around the world,but there's only one problem,Santas son,Arthur discovers that Sannta forgot about one child,the crew don't bother for the fact its only one,but Arthur is devastated and goes off with his grandfather,Santas father and there reindeer's to deliver the one present.
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a great movie with a very well developed storyline with a brilliant cast that all deliver very enjoyable performances.Jim Carrey delivers an outstanding performance,it certain isn't the highlight of his career but he does a great job as he plays several different characters that don't look,act or sound in anyway similar.The two oldest kids are also very impressive actors for their age and were very able to act alongside the big actors they starred with (Carrey,Meryl Streep,etc.).The make up used in this movie is absolutely brilliant and it's no surprise it ended up winning the Academy Award for Best Make Up.The movie would definitely be a great movie to watch with the whole family,the direction is similar to a Tim Burton film,but it's not too dark (I think Tim Burton's movies are usually too dark to be considered a family movie),there are a few scenes younger children myth find scary but it's nothing too frightening.A Series of Unfortunate Events is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend for the whole family to enjoy and to fans of Jim Carrey.After the death of their parents,three siblings move in with their distant cousin Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who is secretly trying to rob them of their parents fortune.Best Performance: Jim Carrey Worst Performance: Dustin HoffmanIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Alien is a brilliant movie with a really well developed,clever and unique storyline,a very inspired cast and outstanding effects,especially for a movie that was made in 1979.The movie is considered both a horror and a sci-fi,and although the actual alien is very frightening,there aren't any scenes that I thought really jumped out and frightened me,but I did really like the idea of a sci-fi that is much darker and grittier than usual.This movie is what made both Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott famous,and they both continue to star and direct very impressive films.If your a horror fan,I wouldn't really recommend Alien,but I would highly recommend it to all fans of sci-fi.Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her fellow spaceship crew must fight off a deadly alien stowaway.
Evan Almighty is a good movie with a very promising storyline that definitely could have been done better,and a good comedic cast.The movie is a spin-off to Bruce Almighty focusing on Steve Carell's character Evan Baxter,although in this the character is a lot more likable than Evan was previously.The script was certainly nothing outstanding and there was nothing extremely funny in this,but Carell did the best he could with this script and certainly improved on it,I also really enjoyed seeing Morgan Freeman reprise his role as God.Its nowhere near as good as Bruce Almighty and Jim Carrey's absence won't go unnoticed but Evan Almighty is still an enjoyable movie with some funny parts and also some surprisingly great special effects,I would recommend it to watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. A congressman looking to change the world for the better is assigned by God to build an ark and gather two of every animal.Best Performance: Steve Carell Worst Performance: John Michael Higgins If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Negotiator is a brilliant movie with a really well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.The movie is very intense,mainly because of the outstanding dramatic performances delivered by Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey,the films plot easily could have been given to any well known action star who would bring in the money but not a great performance,but instead they got Jackson and Spacey,who aren't necessarily action stars,and we get to enjoy this movie much more and feel even more for these characters.I was having trouble finding Jackson's character likable,which he was obviously suppose to be,but he held a bunch of people hostage in order to prove his own innocence,but was committing a crime in the meantime,although I did like seeing him use both personalities as he is great at being both a good and evil character.Action packed and very intense,I would definitely recommend the Negotiator to anyone looking for a good crime drama or action. A hostage negotiator who is framed for the murder of his partner decides to take some hostages of his own.Best Performance: Samuel L. Jackson Worst Performance: Regina Taylor If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Aladdin is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding voice cast. It is without a doubt one of my favourite Disney films, I loved it as a child and watching it today I still throughly enjoy it. The characters are great and the music is superb, I don't think I will ever forget the lyrics to Whole New World or Friend Like Me. The highlight of the entire movie is without a doubt the Genie, superbly voiced by Robin Williams, who was given the rare opportunity of improvising his lines in an animated film, and that made it turn out so well, the kind of crazy lines delivered by Genie never would have happened if they just got Williams to read from a script. Really fun and a true animated classic, I would recommend Aladdin to anyone looking for a good film for the whole family to enjoy. A young thief is given the opportunity to be with a princess he is in love with when he finds a magic lamp with a genie that will grant him three wishes.

The Polar Express is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific voice cast.This and Elf are one of the most recent films that I consider a Christmas classic and happily watch every December,it is beautifully directed and the animation is absolutely stunning,there's s lovely Christmsd feeling all the way through.Tom Hanks was terrific in this film and I didn't even know he voiced so many characters ,particularily Santa Claus and the Hobo,they didn't sound a bit like him,but the Conductor was without a doubt my favourite.I do think this movie would have looked a lot better if it was live action,all the sets could have been amazing and I will admit that Robert Zemeckis's animation style is a little creepy because it's so close to real,but I will accept the way he chose to make it as it still looks great and he is my favourite director.I would highly recommend Polar Express for the whole family to watch at Christmas time. A young boy who no longer believes in Santa Claus is given the opportunity to go on a train to the North Pole on Christmas Eve to meet the man himself.

Blades Of Glory is a fantastic comedy movie with a great story line,a brilliant cast and hilarious characters.Will Ferrell is obviously the funniest in this movie,like he is in every other movie he is in,he is always hilarious and a fantastic actor.I also really enjoyed Will Arnett and Amy Poehlers performances,ever since he hosted the golden globes,I felt strangely attracted to Poehler,mainly because he is just such a funny person.If you are a fan of Will Ferrell comedies.I would strongly recommend you see this.When two ice skaters are kicked out of their league,the two of them join together in pairs skating,competing against two very competitive siblings,who will do whatever to have to to win.
Ferris Buellers Day Off is a fantastic movie with great young actors and is the movie that really kicked off the career off Mathew Broderick,it wasn't his first movie but it was his first blockbuster movie that was a hit at the box office.Ferris Bueller,a young adult that just doesn't like school,pretends to his parents one morning that he is feeling sick so can miss a day from school and they c completely fall for,but his sister is two smart for him and knows that he is faking it.Ferris gets his friend Cameron to join him for his day off who really is feeling sick and gets his girlfriend out of school by pretending her grandmother died,but he is also not smart enough for his school principal Ed Rooney and he also takes a day off to find Ferris,although Ferris has tricked the rest of his school and they start a SAVE FERRIS campaign,while Ferris is having the time of his life with his friend and girlfriend in Camerons fathers Ferrari,which gets Cameron worried sick.
Mad Max is a great movie with a very enjoyable storyline and a good cast.This was the movie that really kicked off Mel Gibson's career and it really was a great start for him because it showed that he was able to be a dramatic and intense actor and also could really do action movies.The characters don't develop an awful lot in this movie but it won't bother you too much if your like me and you just got in to the action that was quite brutal and very intense.Fans of action movies will definitely enjoy Mad Max.A highway cop is fueled by revenge and sets out to kill the bikers that killed his family and his work partner.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a decent movie with a storyline that starts off very promising but continues to get weaker as the movie goes on.I wasn't impressed with this movies cast,other than Sean Connery,who is great in every movie he's in,but the rest of the cast were very unknown actors that were put up to the difficult task of playing extremely well known fictional characters,I did think Peta Wilson did a pretty job,but the other five members of the League were not ready for a movie this big,while I did like Jason Flemyng in Smoking Barrels and Snatch,his performance as Dr Jekyll was definitely my least favourite performance in this film,and when he transforms in to Mr Hyde was just creepy,I felt like they wanted to make him the "Incredible Hulk" type of the group and failed miserably.The movie does have a lot of action sequences which I did find enjoyable,and while the dialogue is cheesy at times I thought it worked our,mostly when Connery talks, because he can make any ridiculous line convincing.The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen does have some enjoyable moments,but a cast is important and most if the cast is very mediocre,in certain aspects,like the fun fantasy set up,it's worth a watch but I wouldn't highly recommend.A group of characters from famous novels team up on a top secret mission that's put good against evil.
Top Gun is a good movie with a decent storyline and a good cast.It was my first time seeing the movie,I since its so well known I expected it to be a lot better,Tom Cruise did deliver a great performance however,but this movie is so cheesy,there's constant singing to feel good songs and a cliché love story to it as well.I don't really like Val Kilmer as an actor,mainly because he was the worst Batman ever,but he delivered a pretty solid performance as Iceman.Students of a Us Fighting school compete against each other to be the best in there class,while one of the students,Maverick (Tom Cruise),dates the teacher,Charlie (Kelly McGillis).
Jumper is a decent movie with a good storyline and an alright cast.The movie is certainly nothing outstanding,there are a lots of good action sequences but none of them really matter that much when you don't take time to get your audience to really care about the characters.The movies unique story had some good potential however it just made too many bad decisions to end up being really good,the main character could have been very interesting had he been played by a good actor,Hayden Christensen has little to no passion in his performance,however,I did like the scenes where we got to explore his powers.Samuel L. Jackson was certainly the movies highlight,he brought some real acting and tried his best to make up for all the mediocre actors,he was clearly interested in his character.Jumper has its moments,but it's mostly just a mediocre sci-fi and action film and I think you would be better off avoiding it. A man who can teleport anywhere finds himself threatened by an organisation that tracks and kills his kind.Best Performance: Samuel L. Jackson Worst Performance: Jamie BellIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Transformers: Age of Extinction is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast.I know that many,many people are going to disagree with me here,but I am happy this franchise is still going and am happy with the changes that were made in this,at first I wasn't impressed with it continuing without Shia LaBeouf,but after all the controversy surrounding him in the last year,and the fact that Dark of the Moon was a complete mess,I thought these changes were necessary and Mark Wahlberg is much better suited for the action hero role.I still think the first Transformers is the finest in the series,but in think this tops Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon by far,I found myself caring for these characters much more than anyone in the previous two,and the cast was simply more talented,with great performances from people such as Wahlberg,Keksey Grammar and Stanley Tucci.There are definitely some very ridiculous aspects to this movie,such as the Dinobots,but I can look past these things and I don't try to look at this franchise as being anymore than what it is,a fun Michael Bay movie based on an animated series,he's an underrated director who definitely knows what he's doing.It is certainly longer than it needs to be,but it's a fun and action packed ride, and I would recommend Transformers: Age of Extinction to anyone looking for a good action or adventure,and fans of the previous movies that don't try to overlook it,should be impressed. The Autobots turn to a mechanic and his group of family and friends to protect them from a bounty hunter that is looking to kill off their entire race. Best Performance: Mark Wahlberg Worst Performance: T.J. Miller If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Other Guys is a fantastic movie with a great storyline,an impressive cast and hilarious characters.Its definitely a must see for Will Ferrell/Adam McKay fans like myself and the buddy cop team of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg was a terrific match.The movie has a lot of laugh out loud scenes,like all the beautiful women obsessed with Will Ferrell's character,and when the characters get tricked into seeing Jersey Boys.Id also like to mention a good idea I thought of when watching this movie,one of the best parts,in my opinion,in the scenes at the beginning with Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson as the two head police,I think this would make a great spin-off movie,obviously it would have to be a prequel,but the two actors are good enough to make that work,they clearly made a great team and a prequel showing how the two first met and became a team would be fantastic,people would definitely see it,I personally think.Fans Of Will Ferrell,and Mark Wahlberg in less serious roles should definitely watch The Other Guys.Two cops (Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell) that are always stuck with the parer work of the two head police (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson) finally get an opportunity to experience the kind of work they do everyday.
The Sixth Sense is a fantastic movie with an unbelievably great and extremely original storyline and a really talented cast.The movie is so well directed by M. Night Shamalan and the cast is so impressive,I always liked Bruce Willis,but I've only ever pictured him as a great action movie star,but he was great a being a very serious actor in this and his character's development was the best in this movie,I was also impressed immensely by Haley Joel Osment,children usually don't do a kind job in roles like this because their not experienced enough,but he did a very good job.The movie story is creepy and at times confusing,there are so much questions you don't think will be answered,but they do,and the answer is in no way obvious,my only problem with this movie is that they could have made it scarier.I would strongly recommend the Sixth Sense to anyone who enjoys mystery and thrillers.A child psychologist who is having his own issues as he is recently divorced,helps out a child as best he can who claims that he can see dead people.
Transformers is a great movie with a pretty good storyline and a decent cast.It is a bit long but the two and a half hours fly by.I enjoyed the action in the movie,although it did go on a bit too long many times,sometimes so much that you would forget whats happening,but it is very well directed by Michael Bay.I enjoyed Shia LaBeouf a lot in this,but,although she is very attractive,Megan Fox is not a very good actress,I feel like she just says her lines and she probably wouldn't have got in to acting if it wasn't for how good looking she is,I definitely think a better actress like Emma Stone or Amanda Seyfried could have put in a better performance as this character.The best part for me is without a doubt the robots themselves,Optimus Prime,Bumblebee and the rest of the Autobots and Decepticons are beautifully animated and the voice work is outstanding.While Transformers has many flaws,its still very enjoyable and I would recommend it to all fans of Michael Bay and the Transformers in general.A long fighting race of robots,the Autobots and the Decepticons,head to Earth and one young teenager might be able to fix things.
The Producers is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic comedic cast.The movie is a comedy classic that brings me joy and laughs every time I see it,I love the whole concept of the Producers and have enjoyed any version of it I've seen (remakes,theatre plays,etc.) but this one is of course the best as it is the original.The chemistry between Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel is great and their characters are hilarious,but their acting is genuinely good as well,Gene Wilder even got an Academy Award nomination,and rightfully so because every line he delivers is sincere and he clearly liked playing Leo Bloom.The music in the film is also great,I honestly get Springtime For Hitler stuck in my head way more commonly than I should.A classic that still holds up pretty well today,as does everything else Mel Brooks wrote,I would recommend the Producers to anyone looking for a great comedy. Two producers work together in order to make money off a play that will surely be a flop. Best Performance: Gene Wilder Worst Performance: Estelle WinwoodIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Third Man is a brilliant movie with an unbelievably well written script and really professionally filmed, also the cast is very impressive. The movie will be remembered forever as an art piece for filmmaker' sand I definitely think it is a must see for anyone that wants to get involved in making movies, it shows perfectly how you should start a finish a film and also develop your characters.My only problem with the movie is the music,it's suppose to be a thriller but the music is almost comedy like,it certainly did not contribute to the movies mysterious storyline and when you find out the plot twist the music doesn't help make it shocking.I would highly recommend the Third Man to all moviegoers.When detective Holly Martins heads to Vienna he ends up investigating the very mysterious murder of his close friend Harry Lime.
The Town is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.This is another great directing job from Ben Affleck,who proves once again without any doubt that he can direct movies,this is his second project after Gone Baby Gone and,besides being crime movies,they are quite different,this movie is much more adventurous and thrilling,the conflict between the characters and the situation they are in will certainly keep audiences at the edge of their seats.The case all deliver great performances,particularly Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall,who had great chemistry,as well as Jeremy Renner and Jon Hamm,who I found to be the two most interesting characters,Renner was unpredictable,while Hamm was willing to do anything in order to catch these criminals.It can be a bit slow at times,but the Town is still mostly intense and dramatic from start to finish,and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime film or thriller. While planning a complicated heist,a career criminal develops feelings for the victim of his latest robbery.Best Performance: Ben Affleck Worst Performance: Blake LivelyIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Forgotten is a brutal movie with a very unprofessionally written storyline and a decent cast that for some reason seemed to believe this was worth their while.I saw it on television and when I saw that Julianne Moore was in it and read the storyline I knew I had to watch it,but the movie ended up being completely ridiculous,every decision it made was the most exaggerated and unrealistic thing that could happen and the movie went from a mystery to a science fiction,which was unexpected but not in a good way.Julianne Moore is a great actress,but I couldn't take her performance seriously because this story was just too stupid.The Forgotten is an interesting movie,but it's just too ridiculous to enjoy or even consider watchable,I would recommend it to nobody. A mother is told her young son who died unexpectedly is actually a product of her imagination,upon meeting a man with a similar story they set out to uncover the truth.Best Performance: Julianne Moore Worst Performance: Linus Roache If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Wreck It Ralph is a fantastic movie with a brilliant storyline,a terrific voice cast and hilarious characters that you grow very attached to.The movie is very funny,with great heart and imagination.Its not as good,but its just as good as the Toy Story movies,I could see Wreck It Ralph being just as big,with sequels,theme park rides,merchandise,this is Walt Disney Animated Studios very own Toy Story,so they shouldn't waste what they got,more should definitely be made.The movie is also beautifully animated and caprtures what living inside sn arcade game would really be like.I would recommend Wreck It Ralph to all fans of Disney animation,it has enough for all ages of the family to enjoy.Set in a video game arcade,Ralph (voiced by John C.Reilly) is sick of being the bad guy of his game,so he leaves to prove that he is not a bad guy.
The Addams Family is a decent movie with an enjoyable story and a cast that match their characters well.Its definitely a very childish film that children will enjoy much more than the parents will,but there are still plenty of jokes that will make an older audience laugh.My favourite part of the movie is without a doubt Christopher Llyod's performance,I really like him as an actor in family films as he is usually the funniest character in the movie (Back to the Future being a perfect example) and he is without a doubt the character that made me laugh the most.My biggest problems with this movie is that they didn't use some of the other Addams Family characters (Lurch,Thing,Cousin It,etc) as much as they should have,and the final act of the movie is definitely the weakest as the humor gets way too childish and a lot less that will entertain adults.The Addams Family isn't the perfect family film,but it is enjoyable and I would definitely recommend it to a younger audience.Mortica (Angelica Huston) and Gomez (Raul Julia) Addams welcome long lost Uncle Fester to live in their home after as he returns from the Bermuda Triangle,but he isn't all he seems.
Mission: Impossible is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast. There is plenty of action that will keep you interested from start to finish,and it is at times very intense as well.Tom Cruise delivers a fantastic performance as Ethan Hunt,and its no surprise he's still playing him today,it's a great franchise and Cruise suits the character.The movie definitely has its flaws,I think the story can be a bit convoluted at times,the plot definitely had moments were it felt like it was all over the place,but it all comes together in the end and is overall a very enjoyable movie.Mission Impossible is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or thriller.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is framed for disloyalty of his organisation,he now must try and prove his innocence and that he is not a traitor to the US.Best Performance: Tom Cruise Worst Performance: Henry CzernyIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Dreamgirls is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.The films plot is very basic and easy to follow,but the cast is really what brings it to life,everyone delivers brilliant performances,Jennifer Hudson did a great job and definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role,as well as Jamie Foxx,who is always great,Beyoncé Knowles,I didn't expect her to be very good because she is mainly a singer and I've only seen her in comedies (Austin Powers,the Pink Panther) previously but she really was a very good dramatic actress.My favourite performance was Eddie Murphy,I thought he was only in this movie for comic relief,which he was for a while but eventually his character becomes very serious and he was acknowledged for his spectacular performance with a Golden Globe win and an Academy Award nomination,I wish he had continued to do more dramas after this movie but sadly he is still just doing comedy,I know him best for that but it would be nice to see him deliver some more serious performances every now and then because he proved in this he is very good at it.The music in this movie is also beautiful,particularly the song Listen,and a lot of the actors that I didn't expect to sing did and were very good.My only real problem with this movie is that it is a bit longer than it needs to be and can be s little boring at times,however,Dreamgirls is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or musical. A trio of soul singers are catapulted to fame when they become the backing vocalist for an established star.Best Performance: Eddie Murphy Worst Performance: John KrasinkiIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
First Blood is a great movie with a very well developed storyline with a great cast.The movie is a very quick and very fun action movie,it is very intense and extremely enjoyable.It is the first of the John Rambo movies,a very iconic movie character who is without a doubt one of Sylvester Stallone's most famous roles,after Rocky Balboa.Sylvester Stallone delivers a great performance,he's certainly not the best actor there is,but he was the prefect chose for Rambo,he really got interested in his character and became him,it suited his personality perfectly.First Blood is an action packed and dramatic movie that I would recommend to fans of Stallone and action movie,it is very quick but very exciting.A Vietnam war veteran is pushed too far by a small town sheriff and starts a one man war against his tormentors.If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou is an average movie with a pretty good story line and a great cast,but I found the characters to be very unlikeable and,like all of his movies,the direction from Wes Anderson is very weird,with a strange mix of colours.The main reason that didn't make me like this movie was Bill Murray in the lead role,because he is always hilarious and his acting in this is also very professional,and I enjoyed Owen Wilsons poerformance with Murray as sort of a father-son relationship.Other than that,I found this movie weird and didn't get the message at the end of the movie,it seemed like there was suppose to be one,but I couldn't understand it.When his friends is eaten by an unusual shark,Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) sets out with his crew to find and kill the shark.
National Treasure: Book of Secrets is a great movie with a very well developed storyline that I enjoyed much more than the first National Treasure and improved performances in the cast.I've mentioned before that I am not very fond of Nicolas Cage,and I didn't enjoy him in the first one,but for some reason,even though he plays the very same character,I enjoyed him this time around,his character was more brave this time around,.wheras in the first he came across as cocky.The story kept me much more interested this time around.If you enjoyed the first one then you will definitely enjoy National Treasure: Book of Secrets.Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) sets out on a daring quest to find the mythical City of Gold in order to protect his familys name.
V for Vendetta is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is intense and very thrilling all the way through with a very unique storyline that you've certainly never seen before.Natalie Portman delivers a very dramatic performance,I know these kind of movies don't win Oscars,but I'm surprised she wasn't at least nominated for an Academy Award,she deliver an outstanding performance.Hugo Weaving was also great in this movie as the title character V,I didn't even no it was him until the credits,you never see his face for the whole movie,but he also speaks in an English accent that sounds nothing like him.V for Vendetta is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or thriller. Set in a world in which the only opposition to a sinister future,because of Britain's despotic leader,is a masked avenger known as V.Best Performance: Natalie Portman Worst Performance: Stephen FryIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Saw 4 is a decent movie with a good storyline that make take some bad turns but is overall still enjoyable,but the cast dosen't follow through as much with the dialog they were given.The story as cast is certainly much more weaker.If you haven't seen Saw 3 and are planning on watching it I would suggest to stop reading now as I am about to spoil the ending.I think it was a big mistake to kill of Tobin Bell so early in the series,they shouldn't have done it until maybe the final film,because he still trying to throw in as much of him as they can throughout the movie,because they know the film wouldn't be the same without him,but all his flashback scenes felt very forced,I think Bell felt like he has done enough with his character and that there wasn't much more he could do with him,although he was still without a doubt the best actor in the whole film and I would probably would be giving this movie a four if his scenes wern;t in it.My biggest issue with the movie is that the focus a lot more on blood and gore instead of being genuinely scary,most scenes were just hard to watch more so than frightening.If you're looking to watch the whole series of films,then you should watch Saw 4,but if you're looking for a good horror,I wouldn't recommend it.The Jigsaw Killer is dead but detectives still manage to get caught up in his posthumous,grisly,murderous games.
Saw is a fantastic movie with a brilliant storyline and a great,however unknown,cast.The movie is definitely a horror,and its not one of those ones that look scary,but end up being disappointing,its frightening and nothing for sensitive people.Jigsaw is a brilliant character and will leave your with goosebumps all the way through and afterwards.The movie's build up is fantastic,I wont spoil what happens for anyone who hasn't seen it,but the movie is clearly building up to something,and once you finally get to it,you wont be disappointed.Hardcore horror fans will love Saw,but people who don't like movies too dark and violent should avoid this movie.Two men wake up in an unknown area being held hostage by 'Jigsaw' a serial killer who kidnaps people who question their own lives.The two men work together to escape and look back at why Jigsaw might want them dead.
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is very thrilling and a great mystery that will keep you watching and interested all the way through,Gary Oldman delivers a really dedicated performance and clearly wanted to play this character.The movie is filmed so professionally,it had a very realistic atmosphere that made me feel like it was actually based on a true story at times,because it's setting and dialogue all felt so real.Not too long with great character development and an interesting story,I would recommend Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to anyone looking for a good drama or mystery.

Crazy Stupid Love is a fantastic movie with a really well put together storyline with a very talented cast both in a dramatic and comedic way.I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie,I thought it was going to be a complete cliché romantic comedy and only wanted to watch it because I am a fan of Steve Carell and Emma Stone,but it was very much,much better than what you would usually suspect in a romantic comedy,its a lot more serious and has very little cliché and a lot of unique situations you wouldn't see in other movies and one very unexpected scenes.The moment I realized that this movie was really good was in the scene when we discover that twist,which I won't mention for those that have yet to see this movie,is discovered and all the other romantic situations are thrown together in to one scene,it was really interesting to see how much these characters messed up and that see really just blew me away,its hard to describe how clever this scene is,but you'll know if you see this movie.I would highly recommend Crazy Stupid Love to all fans of drama and comedy,and to fans of Steve Carell,in one of his finest performances,I always liked him,but never knew he could act so well in such a serious role.Cal (Steve Carell) seeks help from Jacob (Ryan Gosling) on how to pick up women when his wife leaves him after being married for many years.Jacob is a womanizer but soon thinks he may have found really love when he meets Hannah (Emma Stone).
Epic Movie is a horrible movie with an awful story line,a mostly horrible cast,filled with loads of awful movie references that aren't smart or funny,there mainly just offensive,I just know how these people are aloud to keep making movies,all they do is make fun of good movies,and use those stories to make their own movies.The only actors I liked in in are Kal Penn and Jayma Mays,Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willards roles where just disturbing,are the other actors probably didn't have to be paid much,because their not in a lot of movies,I do like Crispin Glover in Back To The Future,but his role as Willy Wonka is disturbing,creepy and messed up,and I wish I didn't know that guy was the same guy that played George McFly,I need that erased from my memory.It comes as no surprise that this is one of the worst movies of all time,if you didn't like this,I would not recommend Disaster Movie.Four people meet up at a Chocolate factory and stumble in to a wardrobe that takes them to Gnarnia,where one movie after another is parodied.
Stand By Me is a fantastic move with a really well developed storyline and a terrific cast.The movie is very heartfelt,sweet and also very funny at times,it is a great 'coming of age', film as these four boys slowly mature while they head off on a journey together in search of a dead body.The four boys were perfect casting,young children usually aren't great actors because their not experienced enough,but these four were and the dialog between the characters is brilliant,its very honest to how children at this age actually speak,the best performance has to go to Will Wheaton,an actor I have always enjoyed,but I only knew he was Gordie after watching it and was very surprised that he was so great at such a young age.Stand By Me is a great film with great character development that I would highly recommend to fans of both Stephen King and Rob Reiner.A man looks back on his childhood after one of his close friends dies,back when they,along with two other friends,head off on a quest find a dead body.
The Untouchables is a fantastic movie with a very clever and well thought out script by David Mamet and some outstanding performances by Kevin Costner,Robert De Niro and most of all Sean Connery,who won an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role,and rightfully so,his character was clearly what made this movie so great,and you really feel for him all the way through.The movie is very violent,definitely not for sensitive viewers,I thought the violence was brilliant and very convincing,Brian De Palma is clearly a great director.Fans of movies like the Godfather and Scarface should definitely love the Untouchables.Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) hires a group of men who eventually become known as the Untouchables in order to protect his family and put a stop to Al Capone (Robert De Niro).
Frozen is a fantastic movie with a great,very well written and original storyline and a professional voice cast.The movie is certainly a very impressive one from Disney,the film is beautifully animated,the music in it is outstanding and the characters are very likable,it will definitely go down as a Disney classic.My favourite is without a doubt Olaf,i've never really been a big fan of Josh Gad in the past but his voice acting in this was outstanding,filled with a tone of energy.Fans of classic fairy tale Disney films will love Frozen.After her sister Elsa leaves her town in a state of eternal winter,Anna sets out to find her,with some help from some unlikely characters.
Brüno is a good movie with a very good set up for very cringe worthy hidden camera comedy and a very risky performance from Sacha Baron Cohen ,not his best movie,but it's definitely his most offensive.It will definitely offend many people and if you are easily offended definitely do not watch this movie.He visits some of the dark parts of Los Angeles that I didn't even know existed,particularly the straight camps and wrestling arena,which made the cringe in this movie so brilliant,I felt made about how much I was laughing at his jokes,because that's just the kind of movie it is,you realize its offensive,but you can stop yourself from laughing.Its certainly no Borat,but fans of Sacha Baron Cohens comedy will definitely enjoy Brüno. Brüno (Sacha Baron Cohen) a European fashion model,heads to Los Angeles to become a big celebrity by following his own steps in becoming famous.
Bad Teacher is a decent movie with an alright storyline although the set up is kind of stupid,and the cast didn't seem to be having too much fun,other than Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel.There are a fair amount of funny scenes in this movie,but there wasn't a single scene that really stood out as hilarious and quotable,the only really memorable scene was the school car wash,for obvious reasons.I really did not appreciate Justin Timberlake's character,he's a very mixed actor,but in this he dosen't have a single funny line and at times was just irritating.Unless your a die hard fan of Cameron Diaz,you would be better off avoiding Bad Teacher.After her fiancé breaks off their engagement,an attractive but immature women returns to her job as teacher,which she hates,in order to make enough money for breast enhancement surgery.
2 Guns is a great movie with a pretty well developed storyline with a very entertaining and energetic cast.The movie certainly wasn't fantastic and unique but Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg make a very great team and there was very good chemistry between the two of them.The dialogue between their two characters reminded me of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in the Men in Black films which is a type of humour that I found very funny and kept me interested.It's not either of their finest films,but if your a fan of Denzel Washington or Mark Wahlberg,then you should definitely check the exciting,funny and action packed 2 Guns. Two men,a DEA agent and a naval officer work together to take down a major drug dealing business,either of them knowing that the other is an agent undercover.
The Blues Brothers is a fantastic movie with a very well written and developed storyline and a very talented and comedic cast.The chemistry between Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi is without a doubt the highlight of this film,the two of them were clearly very close friends and were very interested in their characters,Jake and Elwood,they deliver top notch performances as these characters that think their a lot more threatening and suspicious than they actually are.The music in this film is also great,there isn't a single song I don't like,they are all very catchy and the amazing musicians they got in this movie to play some of the songs (and of course Aykroyd and Belushi) is outstanding.The Blues Brothers is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great comedy or musical.Two brothers,Jake and Elwood Blues must put bring their old band back together on order to save the orphanage they grew up in from shutting down.
The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell Of Fear is a great movie with a hilarious story line,a good cast (except for Leslie Nielsen,who is brilliant!) and brilliant characters,Frank Drebin being one of my favourite movie characters of all time.The movie certainly isn't as good as the first Naked Gun,but its still a lot of fun,and the first is hard to compete with,its comedy gold.It still manages to be a good fresh sequel,with lots of laughs from start to finish.Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) is back and must save a kidnapped scientist who has been taken by his ex-girlfriends new love interest,who Frank still has feelings for.
The Waterboy is a funny movie with a good story,a great cast and some very funny scenes.Its nothing unusual for Adam Sandler,its not his best movie,but its also not his worst.The cast had there roles suited for them perfectly,I especially enjoyed Adam Sandler,Henry Winker (Fonzie from Happy Days) and Kathy Bates.Bobby Boucher (Adam Sandler) has been the water boy for a football team for many years,but he is kicked out,so he becomes a water boy for a rival team,who discover he has a great ability for tackling and he becomes a member of the team. -DILLON HARRIS
Rushmore is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a very talented cast.For such a short movie it still manages to fit in a lot of character development,we learn so much about the characters played by Jason Schwartzman,Bill Murray and Olivia Williams,when it was finished I didn't feel like we needed the know anymore.It is also beautifully directed by Wes Anderson,this is one of his very first films but he already proved that he is a unique and very talented writer and director.Rushmore is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama with some subtle comedy. A student at Rushmore Academy falls in in love with his teacher,only to discover she's having an affair with his mentor.Best Performance: Bill Murray Worst Performance: Mason Gamble If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Up in the Air is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a fantastic cast.The movie is a pure drama that feels very real,which makes it very depressing,I know people who look at life the way these characters do which is mainly why I found it so upsetting.George Clooney delivers a brilliant performance,nothing like anything he's done before,he's certainly never played a character that was as vulnerable and open to their personality as this character was,I also really appreciated the performances of Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga.The movie also has a surprising twist at the end,it's not the kind of movie that I would expect there to be an unlikely plot twist,which really made me appreciate it more.Up in the Air is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama. When a man who makes a living firing people meets a pretty businesswoman,his philosophy on life falters.Best Performance: George Clooney Worst Performance: Melanie LynskeyIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Ghostbusters 2 is a great movie with a good story line,a brilliant cast and fantastic characters.Its certainly not as good as the first Ghostbusters,but its still really enjoyable and hilarious.The same cast members are all back and as funny as ever,especially Bill Murray,who's back as Peter Venkman and a lot more sarcastic than he was in the previous film.I feel if this movie lived up to the previous Ghostbusters we would have a third Ghostbusters by now,I want this movie to happen more than any other movie thats stuck in development hell,Bill Murray is being unreasonable,but I don't want a third to happen without him,Peter Venkman is what makes Ghostbusters so great.Bill Murray,please just do a third one already,I don't want to see one without you.Five years after the first Ghostbusters,the gang are out of business,until they discover a mysterious slime in the sewers,and more paranormal activities starts occurring once again,and Peter,Ray and Egon are back in business.
12 Years a Slave is an outstanding movie with an extremely well developed and beautifully written storyline and a fantastic cast.It is very dramatic and intense but it makes you aware of the cruelty that people had to go through in the 1800's just because they had a different skin colour,which is just awful and this movie shows what terrible torture these poor souls had to put up with from these racist people that sadly had a lot of power and wealth.The performances are without a doubt the highlight,Chiwetel Ejiofor was unbelievable in the lead role,he had to go through an awful lot playing this character but he stuck with it all the way through,and of course the Oscar winning performance of Lupita Nyong'o is brilliant,her characters scenes were the hardest to watch and she certainly deserved the award,and also Michael Fassbender is great,this was my first time seeing him play a character that wasn't any bit likable,we feel no sentimentality for him from the minute he enters the film to the minute he leaves,which is what made it such an incredible performance.Not for the faint of heart or anyone under the age of at least sixteen,but other than that 12 Years a Slave is really a work of art that I would recommend to all moviegoers. Follows the twelve years of slavery Solomon Northup was put through after being abducted by white men.

Enemy of the State is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is interesting,fast paced and very intense,at no stage did I feel like it was moving too slowly nor did I feel it was moving too fast.Will Smiths performance is fantastic,he is without a doubt one of my favourite actors and he dosen't disappoint in this,I also enjoyed his scenes with Gene Hackman,the two seemed to enjoy working together,as well as Jon Voight and Regina King.The movie also took a risk by getting some well known comedy actors and putting them in serious roles,such as Jack Black,Jason Lee and Seth Green,and they were all surprisingly very good,I liked seeing a movie do a risky decision and it worked out well for them.The movie is action packed and it goes by very fast,I would recommend Enemy of the State to anyone looking for a good action or crime. After he receives some important evidence to a political crime,Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) is soon being hunted by a group of professionals working for the NSA.

Crazy Heart is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is pretty easy to watch,it's short,simple and has a storyline that is very easy to follow,but it's the actors performances that really brings this movie to life.Jeff Bridges does an outstanding job playing a character that is nothing like any role he's done before,and certainly deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role,Maggie Gyllenhaal and Colin Farrell also delivered great performances.Crazy Heart is a simple movie brought to life with great acting,I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or romance,also there is some beautiful music in this. An alcoholic country singer tries to turn his life around after meeting a young journalist.Best Performance: Jeff Bridges Worst Performance: Jack NationIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Fantastic Four is a good movie with a good storyline and a great cast.The movie certainly has its flaws,but it's still a fun superhero movie with lots of cool special effects and good character development.I use to love this film as a child,but it's a lot more mediocre watching it at an older age,but I still can't help but love these characters,all four of them have a special place in my heart.My biggest problem with this movie,which is how a lot of other people feel as well,is Doctor Doom,they didn't develop his character enough and give him a really good reason to be evil,he was basically just bad for the sake of being bad,I also think that Julian McMahon was bad casting,I really felt like he was just acting,he didn't come across as interested in his character.Fantastic Four is a good movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or adventure.A group of astronauts gain superpowers after a cosmic radiation exposure.Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) develops super stretch,Sue Storm (Jessica Alba).can turn invisible,Johnny Storm (Chris Evans),can light himself on fire and fly,and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis),turns into a rock-hard monster with super strength.They must now use these powers to defeat evil.

The Change-Up is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great comedic cast.It was certainly a lot if fun to see Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds switching bodies and trying to deal with being the opposite person that lives a completely different life.The first hour of the movie is certainly really funny,but the second half,when it's starts trying a bit too hard to get sweet gets a but irritating,I understood having some heart of course but I felt like when it tried to be too emotional it ended up stretching out to movie to a length that wasn't necessary,the movie is two hours long and it really should have been just an hour and thirty minutes.I felt like the writers were trying to hard to make us feel sorry for these characters while still be a comedy,which didn't work out because the characters personality and the movies set up is just too goofy to really feel sorry for them trying to coup with being a different person.It has its flaws and it's definitely overlong,but the Change Up is still an enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun comedy if you have some time to kill. Two friends magically swap bodies after they envy each other's lives,only to realise the grass isn't always greener on the other side.Best Performance: Ryan Reynolds Worst Performance: Mircea MonroeIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
A Clockwork Orange is a very strange and creepy movie with a storyline that is very simple to understand but the dialog is very strange.I found it very hard to believe this movie was made by Stanley Kubrick,a director who previously wrote and directed 2001 and Dr. Strangelove,two outstanding movies,and then he brings us this messy movie filled with some very detailed violence and crime that is very hard to get out of your head,I wont be able to hear Gene Kelly sing Singin'in the Rain the same way again.Howver,i'm still giving this movie a six because the cinematography was very impressive,and although I did not like Alex as a person one bit,Malcolm McDowell did do a fantastic job at playing this creepy and messed up character.The first thirty minutes of this movie are almost unbearable,but once Alex gets what he deserves it gets more enjoyable.I understand why this movie is popular,but it just wasn't really a movie for me.After committing a series of crimes with his friends as they have nothing else to do,Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is sentenced to fourteen years in prison and takes a test developed by the government to solve his problem.
The Woman in Black is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast.It is certainly a very unique movie,it contains elements of horror that I've never seen in just one film before,but it could also be quite slow at times and was certainly not as horrifying as it could have been,it has a PG-13 rating but the storyline is easily something they could have made in to a R rated movie.Daniel Radcliffe delivers a great performance in his first film role since the last Harry Potter,and he proves he can expand beyond that character with this movie where he plays a very different role altogether.Though it isn't the frightening film I was expecting,the Woman in Black is still intense and enjoyable,I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or thriller. A Victorian lawyer is called to a remote house to prepare it for sale,but the property is supposedly haunted and the locals are very suspicious.Best Performance: Daniel Radcliffe Worst Performance: Ciarán HindsIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Pulp Fiction is a fantastic movie with an extremely well thought out storyline,an inspired cast and terrific characters.The movies entire cast played all their roles perfectly,especially Samuel L Jackson,in my opinion,who always plays his characters with great passion.I thought Bruce Willis did a good job,but felt his story was really needed,it goes on for ages and doesn't even connect that much with the other stories.But what makes this movie so great is that Quentin Tarantino is an amazing Director and writer,and it wouldn't have been the same if it was made by anyone else.Fans of Quentin Tarantino movies and crime will love this movie.A tale of four separate stories which revolve around two hit men,the hit men's boss's wife,a boxer with a priceless watch and a couple at a diner.
Seven Psychopaths is an amazing movie with a terrific script from Martin McDonagh,the storyline was so well written and thought out,with plenty of violence and twists involved in it.The cast was outstanding,each actor fitting there role perfectly and seeming very into who they where playing,I would especially have to give credit to Christopher Walken and Woody AHarrelson,two actors that have always impressed me in there roles and always seem into there characters.It wasn't different for Christopher Walken,but it was a big difference from what I've seen Woody Harrelson,hes usually the funny guy,which he was in this as well,but he was also very violent and one of the craziest of the seven psychos in this movie.Marty (Colin Farrell) is working on a script for a movie revolving around seven psychopaths,his friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) gets some really life psychos so they can hear there stories and maybe put it in the movie.HAowever,Marty and Billy get distracted when Billys puppy stealing business where he returns the dog and gets money for it,robs a shih-tzu belonged to Charlie (Woody Harrelson),who is a psycho and obsessed with his dog.Billy has become attached to the dog and doesn't want to give him back,so Billy runs away from town along with Billy and the owner of the puppy stealing business Hans (Christopher Walken).
Ghost is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a fantastic cast and great characters.The movie is very emotional from the moment Sam dies and I will admit,I usually don't cry watching a movie,but the end of this left me in tears,I wont tell you what happened,but if you have any heart,you will be upset.Whoopi Goldbergs performance in this movie is amazing and she definitely deserved her Academy Award for Best Actress In A Supporting Role,I believed her performance all the way through,she did seem genuinely creeped out that she could hear ghosts.Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is killed by a man who is now looking to kill his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore).Its up to Sam to protect Molly,but he is only a ghost,so he gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg),a woman who can hear ghosts.
This Is the End is a brilliant movie with a really well written storyline and a fantastic cast that do a great job playing the people they play best,themselves.I don't think there was any part of this movie that didn't make me laugh,Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg made a really great script about real celebrities dealing with the apocalypse.Everyone played exaggerated versions of themselves brilliantly,but the best ones in my opinion were Seth Rogen,an actor I always enjoy,Danny McBride,an actor I don't know that well but he was hilarious and also kind of creepy,James Franco,an actor who's great at being both serious and funny and Michael Cera at the beginning of this movie is one of the funniest parts,clearly not how he acts in really life at all,and that's why it was so hilarious.This Is The End is a hilarious movie that also has a lot of heart and some surprisingly impressive effects,fans of previous Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg movies (Superbad,Pineapple Express,etc) will love it.When Jay Baruchel flies out to LA for the weekend to see his close friend Seth Rogen,Seth takes him to a big house warming party at James Franco's house.While at the party,the apocalypse begins,many party guests are killed,but the remaining celebrities,Seth,Jay,James,Jonah Hill,Craig Robinson and Danny McBride work together to survive.
Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is a great movie with a really well thought out storyline and a very talented cast.I know a lot of people were disappointed by this movie compared to the original Wall Street,but I honestly preferred,because the other one had a very dark setting to it that I didn't like,a lot of people probably did,and I also preferred Gordon Gekko as as a person in this.It felt very different,because the first one really felt like a Sheen family movie,since Charlie Sheen is the main character and Martin Sheen plays a role in it as well,its completely different in this,although I was happy they gave Charlie Sheen a cameo as Bud Fox and lets us know what happened to him after the events of Wall Street.I was also really impressed with Shia LaBeouf,its the first time I could take him seriously as an actor.I really don't see what critics problem was with this movie,I really enjoyed it and feel people who enjoyed Wall Street will like this too,it takes place exactly where the first left off,and Michael Douglas is as good as ever.After he is released from prison,Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) meets up with the man who is going to marry his daughter,and also has similar business problems that Bud Fox had,Gordon helps him out with his own business skills.Meanwhile,Gordon try's to win back his daughters love.
The Wizard Of Oz is a fantastic movie with an incredible story line that will be remembered forever,a truly inspired cast and unforgettable characters.I have seen this movie countless times and it never gets old,its one of my favourite movies from this film era.I decided to watch it again after I saw Oz The Great And Powerful,and I did enjoy Oz,but it cant compare to this,no other version of this story ever will,the movie is 74 years old and its still so great.Dorothy (Judy Garland) is sent to Oz after a tornado in her hometown,Kansas.She must go to the Wizard Of Oz to get home,along with her dog Toto,she gets some help from a scarecrow with no brain,a tin man with no heart,and a lion with no courage,but the Wicked Witch Of The West gets in their way.
Hop is a great film for the whole family,its colorful and fun with great humor and storyline.I would also praise the great voice cast, Russel Brand as EB (also does a brief cameo as an assistant talking to EB) Hank Azaria as Carlos and Hugh Laurie as Ebs Dad The Easter BunnyA young Bunnys dad,who is The Easter Bunny,wants his son to take his place when he retires,but a few years later to time has come but EB wants to be a drummer for a band instead but his fathers forces him to be the next easter Bunny.Meanwhile,a young man called Fred O Hara has failed another job review and is still living with his parents.His parents decide to kick Fred out so he will get a job,his sister lets him stay in his boss's house while he is on vacation but he must keep the place nice and clean.Keeping it clean becomes a problem,when EB runs off to Hollywood to become a drummer instead of an Easter Bunny,and decides to stay at the house after he Fred runs him over,but doesn't do a good job at keeping the place clean,The Bunny decides to audition for The Hoff(David Hasselhoff).
How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a great movie with a well written storyline and a good cast.It certainly made a few mistakes with adapting the classic Dr. Seuss book in to a live action movie,there are just certain elements to it that certainly could have been improved upon.It is a film lots of people like to watch at Christmas,and while I'll admit it is a fun movie,it dosen't really put me in to the Christmas cheer the same way movies like Its a Wonderful Life or the Santa Claus do.However,Jim Carrey as the Grinch is certainly a highlight,he's completely unrecognisable in this make up,but the characters personality and mannerisms remind us that it really is him under all that.I remember reading a review by Roger Ebert a few years ago in which he said that this movie focused too much on the meanness of the Grinch,and I would have to agree that this was a problem as we are suppose to feel sympathy for him,but it's hard when all we are seeing is why he's a bad person and seeing very little moments of kindness.It certainly made a few mistakes,but How the Grinch Stole Christmas is still a fun movie that brings the creations of Dr. Seuss to life,and I would recommend it to a family looking for a nice Christmas movie. An evil creature living near the cheery town of Whoville plans to put a stop to Christmas once and for all.

GI Joe: The Rise Of The Cobra is a decent movie with a rather messy storyline,but a pretty solid cast.Channing Tatum and Dennis Quaid both delivered impressive performances,and I was also pleased with Marlon Wayans,and I was surprised,because I didn't think he belonged in a movie like this,I pictured him as someone who could only be in movies like Scary Movie or White Chicks,but he did a pretty good job.Fans of the GI Joe fhranchise will definitely not be pleased with this movie,I'm not a fan but people I know that are told me they were very disappointed.Fans of action movies will probably enjoy this,but fans of GI Joe should probably avoid this.A military unit known as the GI Joe's battle against an arms dealer and his gang who have stolen very valuable weapons.
Public Enemies is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and an amazing cast.The story and it's characters are certainly very interesting and it's very hard to believe that this is entirely based on a true story.I certainly think that it could have been better,it's a very enjoyable movie but with its source material and with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale in the lead roles it had so much more potential,it certainly had its flaws.I think Bale's character needed more screen time,I understood Depp being in the main role but Christian Bale needed more time for his character to develop.Johnny Depp's performance was certainly outstanding and inspired,some performances of gangsters just feel like they're impersonating them,but Depp really became his character.Public Enemies is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great biography or crime film. FBI agent Purvis (Christian Bale) is appointed to catch 1930s bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) in a gritty manhunt of street tactics.Best Performance: Johnny Depp Worst Performance: Jason ClarkeIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Alien 3 is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.This movie will certainly be a disappointment to fans of the first two Alien movies,it's storyline just isn't as enjoyable to follow and the script felt messy,it was easy to tell that it had been rewritten over and over.The majority of its cast are significantly weaker than the previous movies,but as long as you have Sigourney Weaver this movie is still quite watchable,she was of course the best part even if the script made some poor decisions for her character.Its still action packed and terrifying,but it's just not as good as Alien or Aliens,but I would still recommend Alien 3 to anyone looking for a good action or sci-fi. After thinking she has finally gotten away,Ripely's escape pod crashes on a planet where more aliens roam.

Home Alone is a great movie with a good story,characters,cast,some funny scenes and a fun Christmas theme that make it a great movie to watch with the whole family,especially during the holidays.The movie is very well remembered,and is more than twenty years old but still holds up really well with todays standards,it started the career of child star Macaulay Culkin and is pretty much the only good thing he has ever been in (the Home Alone isn't that bad,everything else he was in,forget about it).Kevin McCallister (Macauley Culkin) is left home alone while the rest of his family go on a family Christmas vacation to France and leave him behind.At first,he enjoys being on his own,but he finds out burglars are planning to rob his house,thinking there is no one there.
Tootsie is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast that succeed in both comedic and dramatic scenes.There are plenty of very funny parts,which is exactly what I expected from a movie were Dustin Hoffman pretends to be a woman to succeed as an actor,but the movie also contains a lot of very sympathetic and dramatic scenes that make us connect and feel for these characters so much more.There is great chemistry between Hoffman and Jessica Lange which is what made this unusual love story so great,you can tell that they loved working together and are both some of the best actors Hollywood has ever been lucky enough to discover.A near perfect mix of both comedy and drama,Tootsie is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for either genre. A desperate unemployed actor gets the role of his dreams and instant fame,but no one knows this new female television star is actually a man.Best Performance: Dustin Hoffman Worst Performance: Geena Davis If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is a decent movie with a promising and different storyline and a terrific comedic cast that are certainly the highlight. It certainly had a lot to work with, the storyline was an interesting set up for a comedy and Steve Carell and Keira Knighley playing love interests is something I never expected to see, but there is surprisingly great chemistry between them. My main issues with the movie is first off, it simply isn't funny enough, it spends too much time focusing on the characters relationship, trying to be sweet and there just isn't enough scenes where they focus on making the audience laugh. Also, the final act is very disappointing, I won't say exactly what happens, but for a movie about the apocalypse, it's building up to that the whole time, and ultimately the results are a huge let down for the audience. It definitely has its moments and terrific performances from Carell and Knightley, but Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is simply not enjoyable enough to recommend. As an asteroid nears Earth, a man finds himself alone on his last few days alive after his wife leaves him, until a new girl comes along who he only has a month to spend time with.

Moonraker is a good movie with a great cast,good action and a great storyline.Obviously,Moonraker is not the best Bond film ever made and not Roger Moores finest movie either,but its still very good and I find it to be very underrated by critics.The actors I enjoyed the most in it are Roger Moore as James Bond,obviously,and I also really enjoyed Richard Kiels role as Jaws,who I found to be a scary,but also very funny character.James Bond(Roger Moore) investigates along with his partner Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles),after a mysterious mid-air theft of a space shuttle with has clearly gotten into the wrong hands of Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale).
48 Hours is a terrific movie with a great story,some very funny scenes,characters and a great cast.This movie is also the film debut of Eddie Murphy,a comedy legend who has starred in many movies with other great actors,they myth not have all been good movies,but when there good there really good.He was obviously not that well known at the time,but he is well famous today,back then Nick Nolte was better known than him,and many people wouldn't know who Nick Nolte is today.Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) a ruff cop needs help to catch a murderer and gets help from a sarcastic criminal named Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) who has just been released from prison.
The Day The Earth Stood Still is not a great movie,the story is very dull,the cast is extremely unispired and compared to the original,this is a huge disappointment.Any fans of the classic 1950's Day The Earth Stood Still should probably avoid this movie.The movie changes some major plot points and Klaatu is replaced by Keanu Reeves,a truly unispired actor,I like the Matrix,but I don't think this man can act at all,Neo is a great character,but thats because of the writers,not because of his performance,and he destroys the fantastic character of Klatuu is this movie.The movie has a bad cast and a bad story,sure the effects are great,but thats never enough to make a good movie.An alien visits Earth to warn them and get them to protect the planet,whe he is ignored,he decides to attack them himself.
The Expendables 3 is a good movie with a well written storyline and an outstanding cast. It's not as enjoyable as the first two Expendables and I think that is mainly because of the age rating,this being 12A while the other two were 15A and 16. It simply wasn't as fun when they gave it a rating so younger kids could watch it, because we didn't get to see these huge action stars use some intense violence and vulgar language, which is the main reason the first two are so much fun, and it definitely made for an underwhelming experience. There is no denying that this cast is stellar, with huge action stars such as Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schawarzenegger, Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson, who steals the show as the main villain, I really hope they can get a cast as good as this back for a fourth movie, with an R rating this time to keep the movies usual age group happy. It's not as good as the first two and it is certainly disappointing, but I would still recommend Expendables 3 to anyone looking for a good action or adventure if you ever see it on television. Barney assembles his team with some new recruits to take down a man who is intent on destroying the Expendables once and for all.

Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a terrific voice cast.The movie is a very fresh sequel to Madagascar that I think is just as good,in fact probably better,than the first one.Its filled with more interesting characters and each of the four main characters are given their own story,which I really liked.I liked seeing all four of them dealing with a new life in Africa,particularity Marty as we see him hanging around a ton of Zebras who look and sound exactly like him,I thought this was a funny set up and seeing how sensitive Marty was about being unique,it was a good choice.Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a very enjoyable movie that fans of the first one will definitely enjoy. As they fly back to New York,the animals crash land in Africa,where Alex is reunited with his parents,although he must fight to prove he is worthy to stay.Meanwhile,we see the rest of the gang get use to a new life in Africa.

As Good As It Gets is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story,great cast that makes this film so great.Having Jack Nicolson as the main actor and James L. Brooks being the writer and director is what adds up to make this movie so great,Jack Nicolson is one of the greatest actors of all time,and James L. Brooks is a fantastic writer,of course The Simpsons is my favorite show and James L. Brooks is one of the main developers.I also loved the dog Verdell,who is such a cute and funny little character,especially with the attachment he makes with Jack Nicolsons character.A moody author,a single mother working at a restaurant and a gay artist all begin an unlikely friendship,with the mothers young son who has serious as-ma,the artist put in a serious accident,the author takes care of the waitresses son and the artists dog.Starring Jack Nicholson,Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear.
Trading Places is a brilliant movie with a very well written storyline and a fantastic comedic cast that are both talented and very funny actors.The film is absolutely hilarious,without a doubt one of my favourite comedies,a time of scenes are extremely memorable and quotable,most of those coming from Eddie Murphy who is without a doubt the films highlight.Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis also deliver hilarious performances and were clearly interested in their characters.Murphy comes across as extremely positive and confident in his acting in this movie,which is great and very impressive seeing that this is only his second film,after 48 Hours.Trading Places is a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy.A very wealthy man and a homeless mans places are switched around after a bet between two millionaires looking for a bit of entertainment.
Captain America: the Winter Soldier is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.I kind of expected this to be an average movie that would give us one more look at Captain America on his own before we see him with the rest of the gang in Avengers Age of Ultron next year,but I was very wrong,it stood out on its own as a great superhero film,and is much more action packed than the first Captain America.I won't spoil for anyone what happens in this movie,but I will say that it will certainly have a huge effect on future Marvel films and their television series Agents of SHIELD,and I really am looking forward to see how they deal with this situation.The cast is great,Chris Evans is back and as good as ever,Samuel L Jackson is fantastic as always,Robert Redford is on it,I never expected him to be in a Marvel movie,and he did a really great job,he's has been acting for a long time now but he is still great,and Anthony Mackie stars and I have very high hopes that we will get to see more of him because I would really like to see this character develop.Also,Scarlett Johansson returns as Black Widow,and I really enjoyed her performance,her character develops a lot more and she's get more time in the spotlight than she did in Avengers,and I thought she was much better in this than she was in Avengers and look forward to seeing her as Natasha in future Marvel movies.Captain America the Winter Soldier is an action packed and very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to all Marvel fans.Steve Rogers must battle the Winter Soldier as he struggles to deal with the world he lives in now that he is not use to.Best Performance: Scarlett Johansson Worst Performance: Emily VanCampIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Good Morning Vietnam is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.The movie is without a doubt some of Robin Williams finest work,one thing that he has proved to us over the course of his outstanding career is that he is great at doing both comedic and dramatic roles,and in this he gets a very even portion of both of these styles of acting.The highlights are certainly the scenes where he is hosting a radio show,and it is very obvious that Williams got to improvise these lines and they are absolutely hilarious.There are also some very dramatic scenes in the movie and it is quite heartwarming at times.It delivers both laughs and emotion very well and I would recommend Good Morning Vietnam to anyone looking for a good comedy or war film. A DJ is assigned to the U.S. Armed Services Radio station in Vietnam,his outrageous broadcasting style lands him in hot water.Best Performance: Robin Williams Worst Performance: J.T.

Grosse Pointe Blank is a good movie with a good,albeit different,storyline,a good cast and some good twists to it too.I've never been a huge fan of John Cusack,but I did appreciate his role as Martin Q. Blank in this.I really enjoyed Dan Aykroyds role as Grocer and Hank Azaria as Steven Lardner,because I've always been a big fan of the two of them,Dan Aykroyd for great comedy films he wrote and starred in such as Ghostbusters and The Blues Brothers,and Hank Azaria because of his many voice roles on The Simpsons.They could have gotten a much more attractive female lead for this movie,no offense on her,but Minnie Driver is not good looking,someone like Cameron Diaz would have been much better for the role of Debi Newberry.An assassin is sent on a mission to a place called Grosse Pointe,and by an amazing coincidence,it is where his ten year high school reunion is taking place at the same time.
Django Unchained is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.This film is another work of art from Quentin Tarantino,who is easily one of the most original and creative directors in Hollywood at the moment,he has made more movie gold once again here and I can see myself watching it as many times as I've seen Pulp Fiction or Inglourious Basterds.The cast is absolutely terrific,Jamie Foxx suits the main role perfectly,Leonardo DiCaprio takes on a very different role,Samuel L Jackson is unrecognisable,but the best performance is without a doubt Christoph Waltz,he plays this character so naturally and with so much heart,he earns his second Academy Award win for this movie,and despite him being the least known in the main cast,Waltz still manages to steal the show.It is very long,running at almost three hours,you would certainly have to be in the mood for it before you start watching,I did feel that a weak point of the movie was that some scenes were just unnecessary and way too long,the dinner scene goes on forever,this is of course necessary,but it didn't have to feel like 50% of the film,and some scenes like the one with the KKK were long and just didn't seem needed at all,but they are well acted parts,I just felt like they didn't need to be in the movie and took the audience out of the story too much.Well acted and superbly written,Django Unchained will surely withstand the test of time and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good western. Django (Jamie Foxx) breaks out of slavery with some help from bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and heads on a journey with him to Mississippi to save his wife.Best Performance: Christoph Waltz Worst Performance: Quentin Tarantino If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Flight is a great movie with an amazing story,a terrific cast and some great characters.Denzel Washinton delivers a fantastic,inspired performance as Whip Whitaker,and its also great to see Robert Zemeckis directing a live action movie again,after years of doing that creepy animation in The Polar Express.Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is an airline pilot and a serious alcoholic,he saves the lives of 96 passengers on a plane while he is drunk,but trouble begins on figuring out the planes malfunctions.-9/10-DILLON HARRIS
Anchorman 2: the Legend Continues is a fantastic movie with a great and hilarious storyline that will keep you laughing from start to finish.Will Ferrell,Christina Applegate,Steve Carell,Paul Rudd and David Koechner are all back for this sequel that has been highly anticipated since the movies release in 2004,and after this long wait and all the promoting the cast have been doing,I was very nervous about this film, and I can honestly say I wasn't a bit disappointed.The new members of the cast,including a tone of outstanding cameos,are all great, the best newcomer for me would have to be Kristen Wiig,she did a great and very funny job a Bricks love interest,who is just as stupid as he is.There is also an outstanding scene that is similar to the News Channel fight in the first Anchorman,but it's much bigger and much better,and filled with some outstanding and unexpected actors.If you're a fan of the first Anchorman and had high hopes for this sequel,trust me, you won't be disappointed,the first one is certainly better but this one is just as good and one of the most pleasing comedy sequels to date. After Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is fired from his News network and replaced by Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate),he separates from her and gets his old news team together after a huge offer to join GNN,a twenty hour news network,unknown to Ron and his friends that they would change the history of the news anchoring forever.Best Performance: Will Ferrell Worst Performance: Judah NelsonIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Gone Baby Gone is a brilliant movie with a really well developed storyline and an unbelievably impressive cast that I am surprised none of them had won Academy Award's for their performances.Ben Affleck did a clearly fantastic job directing this movie,I would never have placed this actor as a director,but he is actually really good and all his films are very original,he clearly knows how a good movie is made and I really hope he continues to make more.I was very impressed with Casey Affleck and Ed Harris,their performances were without a doubt my favourite's,I was surprised in a movie with Morgan Freeman and Michelle Monaghan that they managed to out shine them.This movie is very depressing and emotional,and if you enjoy dramatic films I would highly recommend it.Two detectives investigate the kidnapping of a young girl,which proves more difficult than it may seem,with a lot of mystery behind the case.
Burn After Reading is a great movie with a very well written storyline with a very talented cast that offer unique performances.The movie is definitely strange even for the Coen brothers standards,mainly because of the characters and how they develop over the course of the movie,Frances McDormand and George Clooney's characters were two that really stood out in my mind,they started off seeming very normal,and the more you get to know them the more you find out strange things about.I also really enjoyed Brad Pitt in this,his character was the comic relief of the movie,he was very funny and a different character for him.Fans of the Coen brothers films should definitely check out Burn After Reading. Two gym workers discover the classified memoirs of a CIA agent and decide to exploit them for their own ends
Get Low is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a talented cast.Its enjoyable,it is certainly nothing breathtaking that lifted my spirits after watching it or gave me any of those good feelings after watching a well written drama,I think it could have had more scenes where the characters get very serious and personal with each other,it certainly would have helped the performance,I felt like Robert Duvall easily could have gotten an Oscar nomination for this character that didn't seem easy to play,but the fact that there just aren't enough scenes were he can really embrace himself is a problem.Duvall and Bill Murray are certainly the right casting choice,they are both characters that didn't seem very easy to portray as likable,but getting those two to play them made it a safe bet,Felix is an arrogant man the minute we see him,but because he's played by such a beloved actor we give him the benefit of the doubt and the fact that they're played by two actors that can do that really helped this movie.Its nothing outstanding,I probably won't see it again,but Get Low is unique and enjoyable enough to for me to say that it is worth a watch if you ever see it on television,it's short,sweet and you won't regret it. A mysterious hermit decides to host his own funeral,while people struggle to distinguish the truth about him.Best Performance: Robert Duvall Worst Performance: Lucas BlackIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
My Neighbor Totoro is a great movie with a really enjoyable and sweet storyline filled with fun and colourful characters and beautiful animation.I like the fictional animals in this movie a lot,those were the best parts for me.My only major problem about the movie is that the creatures aren't in it enough,I know its suppose to be about Satsuki and Mei,but Totoro is the title character so he should have been it much more.The characters in the movie are all very lovable,and it isn't a creepy Japanese animation,except for one scene involving the father and a bath tub.It isn't Hayao Miyazaki best,but fans of his films shouldn't be disappointed.Two sisters whose mother is ill,discover mythical creatures around their new home,including the king of the forest,Totoro.
Insomnia is a great movie with a very well written and well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is very easy to get sucked in to and the story is easy to follow,it contains very deep and intense dialogue at times that is certainly too much for anyone over the age of fifteen.Al Pacino,Robin Williams and Hillary Swank all deliver fantastic performances,Pacinos character isn't unique for him,but Williams has never played a character like this before,he was very creepy and basically unlikeable,the chemistry between all three of them was fantastic.Insomnia is dramatic and intense,I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good mystery or thriller.

The Descendants is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.This film is very true and honest that it actually makes it difficult to watch at times,George Clooney's character is so human and life like,the way reacts to these tuff situations feels like the exact way I would as well,we follow these characters as they face a very tuff time in their lives,we are interested and support the decisions they make throughout.The performances are absolutely magnificent,.George Clooney delivers some of the best acting of his career thus far,but even the cast of mostly unknown people at the time are still well able to act alongside Clooney with no sense of nervousness or lack of confidence,particularly Shalllene Woodley,who is huge today but at this time was very unknown,but her acting,especially the scenes with her dad or when she confronts her mother,is magnificent,she got to shine in many scenes and its no wonder she's doing so well today.Depressing,dramatic and sometimes a bit of a tearjerker,the Descendants is a very powerful,character driven movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama.

The Last of the Mohicans is a fantastic movie with a storyline that is really well developed and a very talented cast that all deliver very fine and strong performances.Obviously the best performance was from Daniel Day-Lewis,he is probably one of the greatest actors of all time,he is so believable and he puts so much heart into all of his performances.His performance as Hawkeye was truly breathtaking and i'm so shocked he didn't even get an Academy Award nomination,it definitely isn't his best performance,but it's really good.AI also really love the soundtrack to this movie,the music is so beautiful and it really suits the overall setting.My only problem really is that it wasn't long enough,it goes by so quickly and when it ends I felt like there could have been so much more,it was an hour and fifty minutes,but it feels much shorter.I strongly recommend this movie to all fans of Daniel Day Lewis and Michael Mann.During the war between Britain and France over America,three men must do all they can to keep a Colonel's daughter safe.
Penguins of Madagascar is a great movie with a well written storyline and a terrific voice cast.I really enjoy the Madagascar movies and the penguins are without a doubt one of my favourite parts of the franchise,and it was really fun to get to see them in their own solo film.It certainly dosen't have as much heart as Madagascar,it's much more goofy and cartoony,which isn't a huge problem as it is making itself unique from the other movies,but a bit more sentimentality would have helped.The voice cast is certainly a highlight,the four voices of the penguins are obviously good,but we are introduced to some really fun new characters as well,played by well known actors,Benedict Cumberbatch is definitely the best newcomer,his character was funny without even realising it and I hope to see more from him and the rest of his team in future movies,also John Malkovich is almost unrecognizable in his role as Dave the octopus.Spin offs are usually unsuccessful for movies,but Dreamworks seem to know what they're doing (ie,Puss in Boots) and this movie is no exception,it's nothing outstanding but the Penguins of Madagascar is fun for the whole family. The penguins must team up with a group of animals in an undercover organisation to save the world from an evil octopus.

Night at the Museum is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant cast.The movie is dramatic,funny and also takes you on a fun and crazy adventure,which will keep people glued to their seat all the way through.Ben Stiller is great in the lead and he is also joined by an outstanding supporting cast,which includes the great Robin Williams,Owen Wilson,Dick Van Dyke,Ricky Gervais,among many others.The effects are absolutely beautiful and you can tell from start to finish that a lot of time,money and dedication was put in to making this film.Fun for the whole family and a wild ride,I would recommend Night at the Museum to anyone looking for a good family or adventure film. A new security guard for the Museum of Natural History discovers that everything there comes to life at night. Best Performance: Ben Stiller Worst Performance: Kim RaverIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Star Wars Episode IV- A New Hope is an outstanding movie with a brilliant science fiction storyline that will appeal to all fans of sci- fi,a very talented cast and extremely likable characters (including the villains) that will forever withstand the test of time.The movie started the Star Wars franchise,one of the biggest and greatest of all time.There are so much memorable lines and scenes in this movie and I'll never get sick of it.The cast are all fantastic,my favourite is Harrison Ford as Han Solo,a funny and sarcastic character,and also James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader,the perfect casting decisions were made here.The movie is a must see for all science fiction fans.The story of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) as he begins training to become a Jedi,with some help from Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness).He meets up with some unique characters in order to travel to the Death Star,battle Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) and rescue Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher).
No Country For Old Men is a fantastic movie with a terrific and unusual story line,an outstanding cast and terrific characters.You'll probably notice from start to finish that Javier Bardem is a fantastic actor,he played his character,Anton Chigurh,brilliantly for the entire movie,he;s extremely creepy,but thats what makes him so brilliant,and he completely deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and this movie deserved Best Picture mainly because of his performance,but Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin also did a great job,and the Coen Brothers deserve a lot of praise.A lot of crime and drama occurs when Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) accidentally stumbles upon a drug deal that involves more than two million dollars,and Anton (Javier Bardem) will do whatever he can find and murder him.
For Your Eyes Only is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a decent cast.Its certainly not one of the finest Bonds but it's not one of the worst either,it's right in the middle.The movie was certainly a lot longer than it needed to be and there were a lot of unnecessary scenes,but the action sequences were outstanding,and Roger Moore is in good form.I also liked the movies main villain,but I have to admit that the majority of the cast are very weak for Bond standards.It's a middle of the road 007 film but fans will still appreciate it,I would recommend For Your Eyes Only to anyone looking for a good action. James Bond must recover a strategic communications device before it falls into the hands of the Russians.Best Performance: Roger Moore Worst Performance: Lynn-Holly JohnsonIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Seven Year Itch is a fantastic movie with a very clever story line and an extremely talented cast.Marilyn Monroe is fantastic in this movie,her performance is brilliant,and,like always she is beautiful.If anyone ever wondered where the famous picture of her dress blowing in the air comes from,this is the movie.The script to the movie is very unusual,I was expecting it to be a simple fifties movie,but it wasn't,a lot of dialogue between the characters is strange,and Richard should probably be put into a mental hospital.Fans of Marilyn Monroe and classic movies from this era of film will definitely enjoy The Seven Year Itch.Richard Sherman (Tom Ewell) makes an effort to dedicate his life to his business while his wife is away for the summer with their son,but an attractive new neighbor distracts him from doing what he promised.
Collateral Damage is a good movie with a good set up but definitely could have been so much better than it ended up being.Arnold Schwarzenegger and Francesca Neri both put in a good performances but the rest of the cast really don't deliver.My biggest problem with the movie was the character development,mainly Gordy's son and wife,I knew going in to this movie that they were going to die,but we should have gotten to know a bit about them before they get killed,they literally die after two scenes of the movie,and then Schwarzenegger spends the rest of the movie seeking revenge because of the death of two people we weren't given enough time to care about.The twist at the end is very good and unexpected,you definitely won't see it coming,I won't say what happens, but the way Gordy finds out didn't make any sense.If your a big fan of Schwarzenegger,you should probably check it out for his sake,but Collateral Damage is not an action or drama I would highly recommend. After his wife and son are killed after a terrorist attack at their local mall,Gordy Brewer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) will not rest until he finds the people who killed his loved ones.
Shane is a great movie with a very good story line and a very talented cast of characters.The movie holds up very well today as a very good and enjoyable western,mainly made so great because of Alan Ledd's fantastic performance as the title character.The movie has a lot of heart and you will definitely enjoy if you are into classic movies.A gunfighter decides to settle town in a quiet town with a family he gets along very well with,however other residents of the town do not agree with him living there and they want him out and he has ruined the simple innocence of their neighbourhood.-DILLON HARRIS
Batman is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast.Its a fun and enjoyable action with some very dark elements,but it dosen't take itself too seriously,there is a Tim Burton atmosphere throughout,but he certainly tones down his usually creepy directing style.It is quite different from the Batman films that would follow (particularly Christopher Nolan's trilogy),we are actually given shockingly little detail about Bruce Wayne's personal life and what possessed him to become Batman,he can be scene fighting crime and wearing the suit within the first five minutes of the movie,which I don't think was a clever decision,it didn't to give the audience more build up and excitement that I think is very necessary for superhero movies.It is very clear throughout that Burton was more interested in the Joker than Batman, admittedly he is a great character and Jack Nicholson shines in the role,a lot more than Michael Keaton does,but the film is called Batman and the fact that Jokers origins are told, and he definitely has more dialogue than the title character,is unusual,although it definitely makes for a different experience in the Batman universe.Action packed with very interesting characters and entertaining performances,I would recommend Batman to all fans of the franchise and to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. The caped crusader begins his fight against crime with the Joker,his biggest nemesis who is looking to take over Gotham City. Best Performance: Jack Nicholson Worst Performance: Billy Dee Williams If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a great movie with a clever and different storyline and a talented cast.I didn't think I would end up liking it because I have never read any of the comic books,but it turns out you didn't need to,the humour is weird and different but its still easy to understand.There are some misses,but its most really funny,and a lot of laugh out loud scenes.I really enjoyed Michael Cera in this movie,I like his awkward personality and this character suited him perfectly.The movie is very different and weird,but its also very enjoyable and kind of refreshing because there's nothing like it,I would recommend it to all fans of comedy and fantasy and i'm sure fans of the comic book will be pleased because the movie really feels like you're reading a comic book.Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera),a Toronto bass player,falls in love with cool New Yorker,Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead),but to win her heart,he must defeat her Seven Evil Exes.
Daredevil is a decent movie with an alright,but dry storyline,however there is a very talented cast to the movie.Most Marvel fans despise this movie,I am a huge fan of Marvel,but I don't hate this movie,at the same time I don't love and do agree that Ben Affleck as Daredevil was a bad decisiion,the best parts of this movie to me is the villains,I enjoyed Colin Farrell and especially Michael Clarke Duncan,who made play unexpected roles,I would have never placed these two as villains,but my rating for this movie would be much lower if it weren't for them.I don't think that Marvel should give up on Daredevil entirely,they should give it another go,because I like this hero and,despite this movie,he has a big fan base over the brilliant comics.A blind lawyer who loses his sight from toxic waste gets a big enhance on his other senses and becomes a crime fighting superhero at night,Daredevil.
Knight and Day is a decent movie with a average storyline but very enjoyable performances from both Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise.The movie is definitely action packed and there is great chemistry between Cruise and Diaz,but it was also suppose to be a comedy and I really didn't find it funny,there weren't many parts that made me genuinely laugh.What bothered me most about the movie was that Cruise's character was very secretive,I know they did this on purpose but I thought it just got so confusing whether he was a good guy or bad guy and why he was doing all this to a degree that it was very irritating.If your a big fan of Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise then you should at least check this out,but if your looking for a good action or comedy,you would be better off avoiding Knight and Day.A CIA assassin fighting to clear his name and stay alive must also kidnap a woman in order to keep her safe
Hot Fuzz is a fantastic film,its hilarious,with a good story,good characters and good mystery to it.A lot of people say that Shaun Of The Dead is Simon Pegg and Nick Frosts best work,but I think this is,because it manages to be extremely funny but with a thrilling storyline that keeps you wondering at the same time.A well trained cop,Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg),hoping to carry on his work in London,is put into a small country town outside of London.He expects everything to go fine,easily solving small cases like under aged drinkers with his dim witted partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost),until murders start occurring around the town,everyone else in the police force assumes its just accidents,but Nicholas assumes much more.
Pirates Of The Caribbean On Strangers Tides is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast.Although Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are absent for this film,and probably won't be in any other Pirates of the Caribbean in the future,their characters are certainly missed,but as long as you have Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow the series can easily go on without them,he made this franchise famous and without him it would have gone nowhere.The edition of Penelope Cruz was also great as herself and Depp had great on screen chemistry.Its not the finest in the franchise,but it's not the worst either,fans if the previous three should definitely be impressed with On Stranger Tides.Captain Jack Sparrow embarks on a quest along with some new friends and foes to conquer the Fountain of Youth.
What Happens In Vegas is a below average movie with a very cliché romantic comedy storyline that is made even worse with a cast that don't deliver any heart to their unlikeable characters,made even worse with one bad joke after another,the majority of them being offensive to both genders.I love Cameron Diaz and it is very rare when she lets me down,but this is a very big exception,Ashton Kutcher is alright but his movies are very hit or miss and this is definitely a big miss.While the story may seem like a fun and original set up for a romantic comedy, it really is the exact opposite,I would recommend What Happens in Vegas to absolutely no one.When Joy (Cameron Diaz) and Jack (Ashton Kutcher) meet in Las Vegas for one crazy night,they wake up the next morning married.They both agree to divorce until Jack wins $3 million in a casino with Joy's coin,then the couple are forced to stay married for 6 months to receive $1.5 million each.
The Love Guru is a dreadful movie with a bunch of painfully unfunny jokes,and I'm pretty sure I didn't laugh once while watching this movie.U really like Mike Myers,I love Wayne's World,Austin Powers and Shrek and he's the only reason why I watched this movie,but he was the worst part of this movie.His character Guru Pitka was extremely annoying and possibly the most unlikeable character I've ever seen in any movie,and the scene where we see Young Pitka (a young boy with Mike Myers forty year old face edited on) is just disturbing.The entire movie is a big insult to comedy and I would recommend it to absolutely nobody.The Guru Pitka (Mike Myers) heads back to America in order to help a hockey player with his love life in order to do well in the final game.
Rebel Without A Cause is a great movie with a very good storyline that was probably very risky for the fifties and a very impressive cast,especially from the great James Dean in one of his most famous performances.The movie is very enjoyable and very easy to watch,although I did feel with that story that it could have been more exciting and thrilling,it was actually a lot more plain than its title may suggest.The best part of the movie was without a doubt James Dean,his performance was very inspired,he was clearly an amazing actor that died too young,his character was very creepy,brave and also lovable in a weird way,also Natalie Wood and Sam Mineo gave very impressive performances.The movie is definitely a must see for fans of this classic era of film.The son of an overhearing mother and a withdrawn father copes with the world through violence and alcohol.
The Mummy is a fairly good movie but its not brilliant.Some parts can be exciting but the story still drags on a bit.I've never been a fan of Brendan Fraser and I don't think he picks great movies to star in,however I do like Looney Tunes:Back In Action but thats just a happy childhood memory of mine.However,The Mummy did inspire a fantastic ride at Universal Orlando Resort and it is definitely better than the sequels,The Mummy Returns and The Mummy:Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor.An American serving on an archaeological dig awakens a Mummy.Richard 'Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser),Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah) head on a journey to find a treasure hidden within the mummy's tomb.
Blade is a great movie with a very work developed storyline and a talented cast.Wesley Snipes does a great job in his first outing as the well known superhero,he really did put in a great performance as this soulless and emotionless character.There are several scenes in the movie that are surprisingly frightening,and I wouldn't recommend parents allow their young children watch it,while it is a superhero movie,the vampire elements make it very frightening for a younger audience.Blade is an action packed and highly entertain going movie that I would recommend to fans of action,horror and superhero movies.A half vampire battles the forces of a rogue vampire who plans to bring permanent night to the world.
Rocky is a brilliant movie with a great story line and a fantastic cast,not to mention a brilliant,Oscar-Nominated performance from Sylvester Stallone,this actor hasn't done many fantastic movies,but this movie is fantastic and its all made so great from his impressive script and truly inspired acting.The movie was a Best Picture winner for 1976 and it completely deserved this Academy Awards,maybe the sequels weren't very necessary,they don't live up to this movie,but there still pretty good.Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) has been training as an amateur boxer his whole life,but he finally gets his big break when he is scheduled to fight a well known boxer.
Scary Movie is a good movie with a lot of very funny scenes and a decent comedic cast.Its definitely not a movie that people who like really good comedy will enjoy,but people who enjoy fast paced comedies with stupid humor should get a laugh out of it,and its definitely better than the movies that this movie inspired,like the Scary Movie sequels,Disater Movie,Epic Movie,etc,the sequels aren't bad,but everything else are some of the worst movies of all time,literally.People who enjoy scary movies and making fun of them will definitely enjoy the references to well known horrors,and fans of the Wayan Brothers should enjoy their roles.Scary Movie is a harmless movie that will make people who aren't very fussy with comedies laugh,its no Airplane or Life Of Brian,but its not bad.A group of teenager's get suspicious when a murder occurs in their town a year after they accidentally killed a man.
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a brilliant movie with a nicely put together storyline and a fantastic,very comedic cast and so much laugh out loud and extremely memorable scenes.Will Ferrell is pitch perfect as Ron Burgundy and the rest of this fantastic cast,Christina Applegate,Paul Rudd,Steve Carell and David Koecher all clearly get along really well and all the cameo roles by many well known comedy actors (Vince Vaughn,Jack Black,Ben Stiller,etc.) are all very funny and inspired.Anchorman is a must see for all fans of Will Ferrell's comedies.Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) and his crew continue to be the number one news reporters,but find some competition from Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate),who could destroy Ron's future in the business.
Ali G Indahouse is a decent movie with a bad storyline but it makes up for it with a ton of very funny scenes and a very likable performance as Ali G from Sacha Baron Cohen.Ali G is definitely not my favourite character Sacha Baron Cohen created,and the brief cameo Borat has in this movie just reminded me that he is much funnier than Ali G.I think that Martin Freeman was a bad decision,I always like him in everything he's in,but he is usually a very calm character,and Ricky C just wasn't the right role for him.Fans of the series Da Ali G Show will probably be disappointed with this movie,but will still enjoy the many laugh out loud scenes,and Ali G is a very likable character.While protesting to save his beloved leisure center,Ali G gets caught up with the Prime Minister and makes the government for liked than they've ever been,but the Chancellor has is own plans set up against the Prime Minister.
Pain & Gain is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast that have the ability both serious and funny which made them great casting for a movie I like this.Although it is very hard to believe,this is actually based on a true story,and as the movie continues it becomes more and more unbelievable,but are robed every now and again that it is actually a true story,which was clever because they obviously knew people would be thinking that throughout.This movie has different characters narrating throughout,which is something I have complained about in past reviews,I just think we should only be following one character,and when we learn about a different characters past it should still be the main character telling their story,I think it should have just been Mark Wahlberg's character telling the story instead of switching around to Dwayne Johnson,to Bar Paly and later on Ed Harris,they gave so much characters the chance to narrate which just really irritates me.The movie really is a breath of fresh air considering it is directed by Michael Bay,who's never done a movie like this before,and the characters are nothing like Mark Wahlberg,Dwayne Johnson or Anthony Mackie have played before. Pain & Gain is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or comedy.Based on a true story about three bodybuilders who get involved in burglary and kidnapping in order to get all the money and wealthy lifestyle they desire,but to fact that none of them are particularity brainy dosen't help them. Best Performance: Mark Wahlberg Worst Performance: Rob CorddryIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Vertigo is an outstanding movie with a very mysterious and unpredictable storyline and very strong performances.Its probably not his best,but its very close to one of James Stewarts greatest performances,he was very powerful in this movie and his characters personality was very different to some of his other performances.Kim Novak's performance was also breathtaking.Its one of the most critically acclaimed movies of all time,and thats no surprise,its a crazy ride from start to finish and you never know whats going to happen next,one of Alfred Hitchock's most impressive movies.I would highly recommend Vertigo to all fans of both James Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock.Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart),an ex-police officer with an intense fear of heights,is hired to protect a friends wife (Kim Novak) from committing suicide.
Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is a great movie with great humor,storyline and a fantastic cast.Its the fourth in this film series and although I don't think its as good as animated fhranchcises such as Shrek and Toy Story,it still is a good and entertaining series of films and doesn't look like its going anywhere anytime soon.The continental drift is occurring and the ice is breaking apart and Manny is separated from his wife and daughter.Along with Sid,Diego and Sids grandmother,they must find there way back home.On there journey they are kidnapped by pirates and Diego falls for a female white tiger.Meanwhile,Scrat is still searching for his nut.
Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby is a very funny movie with some great jokes,storyline,characters and cast that will keep you laughing from start to finish.While it isn't Will Ferrell finest work,its still a great,very funny movie it just doesn't reach his high standards from movies such as Anchorman and Step Brothers.It has a terrific cast for actors such as Will Ferrell,John C.Reilly,Sacha Baron Cohen,Jane Lynch,Gary Cole and Michael Clarke Duncan(RIP),which makes it even more enjoyable,i especially appreciate that Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly have an accent on that sounds nothing like them,and they keep it on for the whole movie.Number 1 NASCAR driver Ricky Bobby,who has been at the top for many years,has a mid life crises after some tuff competition comes along,determined to defeat him.
Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines is a great movie with a clever story line,a brilliant cast and fantastic characters.Its the third in The Terminator series,and it is a fresh threequel,but fans of the first and second Terminator will definitely be disappointed by it.It isn't directed by James Cameron this time,and you can tell he has no involvement in it,it is directed by Jonathan Mostow,a rather unknown director.I didn't like how it was trying to be humorous at tmes,while I will admit I did laugh,I didn't like the idea of finding a Terminator movie funny,for example,the scene where Arnold puts on the Elton John glasses.Fans of the Terminator may enjoy it,but will be disappointed compared to the previous two.The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) returns to protect John Connor,who is now twenty years old and his future wife from the T-X as they head towards Judgement Day.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic movie with an extremely well developed storyline with a great cast.To be honest,none of the human actors stood out to me as much in this movie as they have in previous Planet of the Apes,not because they were bad actors,but because the apes truly stole the show this time around,I actually found myself rooting for Caesar and his gang,which really surprised me,but I loved that it did.The motion capture is outstanding,it is impossible to believe these animals aren't real,they have to be some of the most realistic animals I've seen in any film,the moment you see Caesars deep stare in the first scene,you really see how far we have came with technology.The movie is intense and of course action packed,but there is also plenty of time for character development for both the apes and the humans,I really didn't feel like anything was missing.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a great movie that fans of the previous installments will definitely love,and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or sci-fi. The apes are threatened by the human survivors of a deadly virus.They think they have made peace with one another,but this agreement soon proves short lived. Best Performance: Jason Clarke Worst Performance: Kodi Smit-McPheeIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Little Miss Sunshine is a brilliant movie with a great,however very depressing and emotional storyline and a fantastic cast that suit their roles perfectly.I don't think Alan Arkin deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role,he was good in it,but he was barely in it and I definitely didn't consider his performance Oscar worthy.I think that Steve Carell should have at least been nominated,I know hes usually in comedies,but e plays his character brilliantly all the way through and I was much more concerned for him rather than Alan Arkin's character,he was definitely snubbed.If your a fan of drama movies,but also like when there's plenty of comedy,you'll definitely enjoy this movie.Olive,a young girl who's dream is to become a pageant girl,heads off cross-country with her family to be in a popular pageant,but the journey causes a lot of drama and conflict with her already unhappy family.
Carlitos Way is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast that deliver very dramatic performances.The movie is another great from director Brian De Palma and from Al Pacino,while it certainly isn't the best work if either of them,it still is a really great movie that is dramatic and intense.The character development of Carlito is extremely well written and also Sean Penn's character Kleinfeld,who starts off seeming like a very innocent character,but he changes a lot over the course of the movie.Carlitos Way is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good crime film.A criminal is determined to go straight but finds himself drawn back into the world he sought to escape.Best Performance: Al Pacino Worst Performance: Luis GuzmanIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Pirates In An Adventure Scientist is a brilliant movie with great humor and fantastic animation,I always enjoy Aardman Animation films and they never let me down and I believe The Pirates can compete against Wallace And Gromit and Creature Comforts as some of Aardmans finest works.Pirate Captain (voiced by Hugh Grant) and the rest of his crew are determined to make sure there captain wins Pirate Of The Year.But they end up getting involved with Charles Darwin when he claims that the Captains parrot Polly is actually the last living Dodo bird,they set off to England to win treasure in a science fair,although Queen Victoria has a huge hatred for pirates.
A Fistful Of Dollars is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline,some beautiful scenery and a very impressive cast.The movie's entire cast is brilliant,but obviously most of the credit has to go to Clint Eastwood,his performance as 'The Man With No Name' is truly breathtaking,he's kind of creepy and also very funny at the same time.This is my very first time watching a western,and I realized from watching this that I actually really like the genre,and I look forward to watching the other two film's in the Dollars trilogy on Netflix,and I heard they only improve.I also really enjoyed Ramon's character,played by Glan Maria Volonte,who was a very good villain.A Fistful Of Dollars is a must see for all fans of the western genre.When a mysterious man (Clint Eastwood) walks into a rundown town,he causes drama between two different families,the Rojo's and the Baxter's,and starts making easy money off of them at the same time.
Non-Stop is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a talented cast.The films story was certainly an original one,and I though I think the final half of the movie is a disappointment,the movie is still a very exciting action and thriller from start to finish.Liam Neeson is without a doubt the best actor in this film,he really carries the rest of the cast and the movie certainly wouldn't be the same without him as the very likable lead,although Julianne Moore did deliver a great performance and none of the actors were bad.The reason why I was disappointed by the ending is because it seemed like there was going to be an amazing twist,but that never happened,nothing was very shocking which I did find to be a big disappointment.Non-Stop is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to fans of Liam Neeson,thrillers and actions.On a plane headed to London,an air marshall must springs in to action after he receives text messages that someone will kill a passenger on the plane every twenty minutes unless the airline transfers $150 million in to an anonymous bank account.
The Jerk is a fantastic movie with a very well written storyline and a brilliant comedic cast.This movie is the beginning of Steve Martins career,it was his first big comedy film,and despite the several great projects he has done since then,this is still his finest role,his character is extremely stupid yet lovable and this journey we go on with him is ridiculous in a very good way.The film is consistently funny from start to finish,there homestly isn't one scene where I didn't laugh at least twice and every time I watch this the same jokes get me every time as well as parts that I couldn't remember.Hilarious and very clever,I would definitely recommend the Jerk to anyone looking for a good comedy. After finding out he is adopted,a man with little intelligence struggles to start a new life on his own.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a decent movie with a very good story that you really need to pay attention to and a very different cast that didn't seem to have great chemistry on screen.I have not read the book,and I don't think that anyone who hasn't read the book will understand a lot of this movie,there was so much I didn't understand and was really confused with a lot of the movie.I really enjoyed Martin Freeman,an English actor I always enjoy,and I really liked Mos Def's performance and my favourite character in the movie was without a doubt Marvin,I found him both funny and lovable and I loved Alan Rickman's voice-over.But I really didn't like Zooey Deschanel and Sam Rockwell,I felt like they didn't understand what was going on which didn't help their acting,and I know both of them are very good actors judging from other things i've seen them in and they just didn't really belong in this movie,their American style of acting didn't fit in with this overall British movie.Fans of the book will probably enjoy the movie,but anyone who hasn't read the book will be scratching their heads for many scenes.Escaping the Earth's destruction,Arthur Dent(Martin Freeman) embarks on a galactic journey in search of the meaning of life.
Interstellar is an absolutely outstanding movie with a really well developed storyline and a superb cast.Christopher Nolan returns with his first movie since he finished the Batman trilogy and proves once again how original and intelligent he really is as both a writer and director,he is without a doubt one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood at the moment.The movie looks absolutely beautiful,it's probably the most realistic space movie to date,I would even say it looks better than Gravity,and the sound is really fantastic,I was so sucked in by all of the intense scenes in space,I forget who I was and everything around me,all I was thinking about was this story,and that's what I really love about a movie which dosen't happen as rarely as it should,that you forget you're watching a movie.The cast is of course outstanding,Matthew McConaughey delivers another outstanding performance that he will surely get an Academy Award nomination for,as well as Anne Hathaway,John Lithgow,Jessica Chastain,Michael Caine and several other great actors that I don't want to say because they don't come around until later on in the film and are a really pleasant surprise that adds to what's already so good about this movie.Dramatic,sweet,emotional, intense and outstanding,Interstellar is without a doubt one of the best movies of 2014 and I would highly recommend it to all moviegoers. A group of astronauts are sent on a mission to save their planet,but the few hours that they spend it space will take away years of life back on Earth.

The Man Who Knew Too Much is a brilliant movie with a great storyline and a very impressive cast.It isn't Alfred Hitchcock or James Stewart's best movie,but it still is very enjoyable,I haven't seen a movie by these two that I haven't liked.James Stewart is definitely what makes this movie so good,if it was anyone else playing Benjamin McKennait probably wouldn't work,he suited the role perfectly.I haven't seen the previous one,also made by Alfred Hitchcock,but this one is meant to be better,and I'm not surprised because he was only beginning as a director at that stage,by now he had been s professional.Fans of Alfred Hitchcock and James Stewart wont think its the best think they ever did,but they'll definitely enjoy the ride.When a couple on vacation accidentally get involved in an assassination plot,their son is kid and they must travel to London to get him back.
Apocalypse Now is a fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline with a very talented cast that all deliver outstanding performances.This was Francis Ford Coppolla first big movie after directing the first and second Godfather films,and he really proved that he could make great movies outside of the Godfathers genre,this movie is nothing like it,and while it certainly isn't better,it is a brilliant piece of film and will be remembered for years to come.Martin Sheen delivers an outstanding performance,watching his character mature and deal with all the serious events he was experiencing in this war was very interesting and he put some much heart in to his performance.Although my favourite performance in the movie is without a doubt Marlon Brando,his character dosen't come around till about the last thirty minutes,but it is a really inspired and haunting performance,it really did send a shiver down my spine,which is something I never expected from Brando,and was very impressed.Apocalypse Now is without a must see for all fans of war movies. A US captain is sent to find and kill an insane war hero who has set up a brutal regime deep on the jungle.
Risky Business is a fantastic movie with a clever storyline and a outstanding debut for Tom Cruise,who I find to be one of the best actors of all time,and this movie gives us a great first impression that Tom Cruise can really act,and he was only in his early twenties at this stage.The movie is one of those teen sex comedies,but there's a lot more drama and seriousness involved in it,it isn't one of those movies like American Pie or Superbad,there's a lot more drama to it,although the movie is also very funny at times as well.Fans of teen comedies will enjoy Risky Business and people who love Tom Cruise should definitely enjoy it as well.When his parents are away for a week,Joel Goodsen (Tom Cruise) gets carried away with trying to have a bit of fun and gets involved with the wrong kind of people.
Despicable Me 2 is a brilliant film with a great storyline and an impressive voice cast.I definitely wouldn't say it was better than the first Despicable Me,the first one was a lot more heartwarming,but it still is a very good sequel and has everything you want in a family film,humor for both young and older audiences.However,the story of the movie feels very scattered and throughout I felt like they were trying to fit too much in one hour and a half.Like the first Despicable Me,the Minions are the best part,and they get even more screen time in this one that they did previously,it's almost impossible not to laugh at these goofy and lovable characters.It's not as good as the first Despicable Me,but this sequel is very funny and an enjoyable movie for the whole family and I look forward to seeing what Illumination Entertainment does with these characters in the future.Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) joins the Anti-Villain League in order to find an anonymous villain working on an experiment to turn the world evil.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part 1 is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.Its still an enjoyable movie but it is certainly not as good as Hunger Games or Catching Fire,it suffers from the very same thing Deathly Hallows did,they made the first part very slow paced in order to save all the really good stuff for the finale.There is some action in this,but all the really intense stuff has clearly been saved for Mockingjay: Part 2,but I don't think that's entirely a bad thing,because they get through a lot of important things as regards to character development and building up to the finale which honestly would have taken up a lot of time had Mockingjay been one movie.The performances are certainly the highlight this time around,some characters who didn't get a chance to shine in the previous two do in this,Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as usual,we get to see a lot more Gale,played by Liam Hemsworth,who I honestly had very little care for previously,but in this they made him a genuinely interesting character,I also had little sympathy as regards to Elizabeth Banks on the past,but she shines in this as she takes off her make up and we get to see her character more for who she truly is,returning performances from Woody Harrelson,Josh Hutcherson,Donald Sutherland and the late great Phillip Seymour Hoffman are also very much appreciated,and a great new character played by the amazing Julianne Moore.Suffers significantly from slow pace and little action,but Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part 1 is still a really great movie that shouldn't be missed by the fans. Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen the previous two Hunger GamesAfter the destruction of District 12,Katniss must relocate to District 13,where President Coin and Plutarch Heavensbee convince her to become the symbol of the rebellion at the hopes of rescuing Peeta. Best Performance: Jennifer Lawrence Worst Performance: Jeffrey Wright If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Die Hard With A Vengeance is a great movie with a story line that will keep you interested from start to finish,and a fantastic cast.Obviously,its not as good as the first Die Hard,none of its sequels ever will be,although I do look forward to seeing A Good Day To Die Hard,but this was much better than Die Hard 2.I really enjoyed seeing Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson as a team as they are very good actors,and I also appreciated Jeremy Irons performance.John McClane (Bruce Willis) and Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) must work together and do everything a bomber tells them or there will be consequences.
The King's Speech is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast that all work immensely well together. Film is cosidered a form of art, and this certainly proves that point, the way the directing conveys the life of the Royal family, and of course the way the characters are portrayed, is very artistic, superbly made and a ton of work is put in by all. The performances are oustanding, Colin Firth delivers the role of his career, with some very dazzling acting as a stuttering King George V, he is in character in every moment, even when he isn't speaking. My favourite part of the movie is the complicated, but very sweet, friendship between Bertie and Lionel Logue, there is great chemistry between Firth and Geoffrey Rush, and this movie wouldn't have won Best Picture without these powerful characters. Superb and very artistic, I would recommend the King's Speech to anyone looking for a good drama or history film. After his brother resigns in order to marry a divorced woman, Bertie is forced to become the new King of England, but must cure his speech impediment first. Best Performance: Colin Firth Worst Performance: Derek JacobiIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
This does not star Kurt Russell, but rather allows him what amounts to an extended cameo. This work is more centered around the "son of" story line than it is the actual super heroes themselves, thereby failing to deliver the appropriate level of entertainment, and contributing instead, that enigmatic substance known as "kid appeal." I expected more. But having said that, there is more to this work than meets the eye. The story is modeled after the old classic "B" science fiction movies we hate to love, but do. The effects are nothing spectacular, but are still above what you would expect, all things considering. And beneath the camp, lies a stronger feeling, reminiscent of a classic superhero story, yet it still fails to achieve the desired affect; if only marginally.It was entertaining and I still had great fun in watching it.This rates an 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.
Rocky V is a very mediocre movie with a storyline that never gets interesting or even just enjoyable and a cast that have lost all the inspiration they use to put in to their characters and clearly only continuing this franchise for the money.I thinks it's better than the fourth Rocky,but only slightly,this film series clearly dragged out and this one dosen't prove differently.In the fourth,Sylvester Stallone still feeling interested in his character was really the best thing,but this time around I think he realised that he's played this character more times than he needed and kind of gave up on keeping him a living and confident character,and the edition of Tommy Morrison didn't help out..Fans of the Rocky series definitely won't be impressed with Rocky V, while I do think it's better than the fourth,it isn't way better.Broke and suffering from brain damage,Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) trains a protégé to carry on his legacy, meanwhile,Rocky Jr. Has trouble dealing with the family's new lifestyle.
Team America World Police is a hilarious movie from the same genius minds that brought us South Park,Trey Parker and Matt Stone.Since this film,the two haven't done anything outside of South Park because of the box office results of this film,but that shouldn't matter to them because Team America was well received,and if they made a second one it would probably be successful.They should do more outside of the South Park series,another South Park movie,another Team America or a completely different new series or movie,because they are hilarious and as much as I love the show South Psrk,I think they should do some more outside of the show.A team that protects the United States from terrorists gets a new member,Gary,who is a terrific actor so they get him to disguise as a terrorist and find out what there up to.It turns out Kim Jong-Il has a big plan involving American celebrities.The end of this movie delivers a good message.
Goodfellas is a fantastic movie with a great story line and a truly inspired cast,Joe Pesci performance is fantastic and he completely deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.There was really only two problems I had with the movie,I didn't like how they put Robert De Niro's name before Ray Liotta's in the credits and even on the posters he is in front,this is making you think that James Conway is the main character,but thats not true,Henry Hill is,and although I obviously prefer Robert De Niro to Ray Liotta,he is the main character,and no one will know that going into the movie.I also don't like how they changed the narration to Lorraine Bracco's character,because Henry Hill is narrating,and it doesn't make any sense to change to another character,Forrest Gump doesn't go from Tom Hanks narrating,and suddenly jump to Robin Wright.Going through the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who narrates his life,starting as a young man wanting to be part of the mafia,to being part of it and quickly regretting it.
Robocop 2 is a terrible movie with a ridiculous storyline that is too long (almost two hours) and an uninspired cast that are only in it for the money.The only scenes that I enjoyed in anyway are Peter Weller's parts,but he isn't even in it that much,he's in the first half and after that it starts focusing more on the humans,Robocop is the title character,and if his name is in the movies title,he should be in it more than anyone else.The worst part about this movie is the cheesy special effects,and especially Nancy Allen,she wasn't great in the first Robocop,but she's even worse in this,she is a terrible actress only says her lines.I also didn't like the strong use of children in this,it was just creepy seeing such young kids as criminals.Robocop 2 is a stupid sequel that I would not recommend to fans of the original.While the crime rate is only getting worse,Robocop is destroyed and replaced by a newer model,they try their best to put him back together as more memories of being Alex Murphy come back to him.
The Good,the Bad and the Ugly is a fantastic movie with a very well developed and smart storyline and a brilliant cast that know where well how to play in a western.I definitely feel this movie is overrated,number 5 on the IMDb Top 250 is way too high,it is good,but not that good.I think that the plot stretches out a bit too much,and there is a lot of detail that is not needed that could have brought this movie from two hours and forty minutes to just two hours.Another problem I had was Tuco,he was a great character,but he got way too much screen time,probably more than Clint Eastwood,he is the star of this movie and he's what makes the Dollars trilogy so brilliant and he needs the most screen time,also Angel Eyes needed more screen time,he is 'the bad' in the title and if he's one of the title characters and should have been in this much more.There is a lot of violence and action and magnificent performances all around in this movie,I don't think its as great as critics make it out to be,but it's definitely a must see for all fans of western's.Two men work together in a scam in order to lead their way to the whereabouts of a cemetery with gold buried underneath worth over $200,000,but their not the only people that no know about this gold.
End of Days is a good movie with a very different storyline and a good cast,with a very strong performance from the always brilliant Arnold Schwarzenegger.I expected this movie to be an action packed movie with an Armageddon type of theme to it,and I wasn't disappointed,but I really didn't expect it to be scary,there are actually some very frightening scenes in this movie,mainly any of Gabriel Byrne's scenes,and its a lot scarier than some of the ridiculous horror movie you would see today that aren't at all frightening.The movie is very unpredictable,and I was surprised it got such bad reviews,I really enjoyed it,it certainly wasn't perfect,but it didn't deserve any Razzie nominations.Arnold Schwarzenegger did a fantastic performance,Gabriel Byrne was very creepy and believable,and Peter Hyams did a great job directing this movie,it looked beautiful,none of them deserved Razzie nominations.Its certainly not Arnold Schwarzenegger's finest film,but fans of the actor will get a great kick out of this movie.As the world reaches the year 2000,the Devil (Gabriel Byrne) is in search of Christine York (Robin Tunney) to make her his bride,its not up to police officer Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzengger) to keep her safe.
The Godfather: Part 2 is a unbelievably great movie with a brilliant storyline that goes on for a long time but it never gets boring,in fact when it was over I felt like there could have been more,thats how great it is,and the cast is incredible.Its one of the only sequels that people consider just as good,or even better,than the original than the first.In all honesty though,I don't really agree with that statement,the first Godfather is just so brilliant,I don't think this one is better,mainly because of Marlon Brando.Robert De Niro did a fantastic,but he just can't beat Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone.I also think that they should have broken this movie up in to two separate movies,because a lot of it felt a bit too ppushed together since they were trying to tell both Michael and Vito's story,they would have had more time if they told both stories in two different movies,because I really felt Vito Corleone's story could have been more detailed.But other than that,this movie is a real classic,fans of the first Godfather will not be disappointed by this sequel.Stars where the first Godfather left off as we see Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) rise to power,meanwhile,the movie also recounts the early life of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro).
Rat Race is a good movie with a pretty good storyline that is without a doubt more original and a lot funnier than a lot of comedies similar to this (Road Trip,Dude Where's My Car,etc) and a very good cast that are funny and energetic from start to finish.The movie was definitely just set up for a lot of funny mishaps between the different,this usually bothers me when the story is set up just for laughs,most of them being visual,but I overall enjoyed in in this,it was fast paced and spaced out the amount of time for each character well.My favourite storyline is either Jon Lovitz,mainly because the dialogue between him and his wife and kids was hilarious and if they had their own Vacation type of movie I would definitely watch it,or Cuba Gooding Jr.,his character was really funny because of how competitive he was and I found the situations he was put in some of the most enjoyable,also it was a very different role him.The only storyline I didn't really enjoy was Whoopi Goldberg and Lanei Chapman,I found their characters irritating (especially Goldbergs) and the situations they were put in to (especially the squirrel one) was just stupid and didn't make me laugh.Rat Race is in no way a perfect comedy,but its fun and different cast should keep many people entertained and many parts are funny enough for you to ignore the parts that wern't.Wealthy man Donald Sinclair (John Cleese) sets up a race between six groups of people in which the first to make it to a locker in New Mexico will receive $2 million.
White House Down is an outstanding action movie with a really intense storyline with very impressive performances and managed to also throw in some great humor without going away from the seriousness too much.This movie didn't too too well with critics and I honestly can't see why,I enjoyed it in so many different aspects.Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx both worked really well together and I also really appreciate Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Woods serious performances.I was really impressed by the movies villains,normally the bad guys in action movies are just bad,but I found these guys genuinely scary and you never saw what they were going to do funny. I really liked Whote House Down and think the mix of serious and humor is how most action movies should be made,and would recommend it to all fans of action. While touring the White House with his daughter,a cop must save his daughter from terrorists while keeping the president of the United States safe.
The Proposal is an adequate movie with a cliché and typical romantic comedy storyline and a star studded cast that sadly aren't enough to make this any good. I honestly expected a lot more from Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, I'm a fan of both of these actors and always enjoy seeing them in movies, and despite the terrific chemistry between them, it simply isn't enough. It myth sound somewhat original, but this movie still carries the exact same typical formula you'd see in all romantic comedies, I don't even understand why these movies are made without the writers trying to make an effort at being original and at least making a few scenes that are genuinely funny. The whole cast seemed to enjoy working together, but they're the only thing that makes the Proposal any bit enjoyable, I would not recommend it to anyone. A successful woman forces her assistant to marry her when she is threatened with deportation to Canada. Best Performance: Sandra Bullock Worst Performance: Betty WhiteIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a fantastic film with great characters,humor and storyline.The mix is brilliant,its like mafia films meets Looney Tunes and you do not feel like the cartoons are just animated in when they finished filming,because it is very impressively directed by Robert Zemeckis,and because the cast is very professional,not once did I think Bob Hoskins was actually talking to thin air.It is also probably the only time you see Disney and Looney tunes characters together,a scene that especially surprised me was when I saw Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse at the same time.There have been talks for a long time about a sequel,which I hope they do but I hope they keep the characters old fashioned animation,not CGI.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a fantastic movie that is fun for the whole family. When a clumsy cartoon character named Roger Rabbit is framed for killing a man who had an "affair" with his wife Jessica Rabbit,him and a grumpy detective,Eddie Valiant(Bob Hoskins),go investigate who the real murderer is.Best Performance: Bob Hoskins Worst Performance: Alan Tilvern If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Sin City is a fantastic movie with an extremely well developed storyline with an outstanding and star studded cast that all portray characters that are nothing like any character any of them had played before.I was extremely impressed by the way this film was directed,Frank Miller took on a very risky and unique way of directing,certainly nothing like anyone had done before,and it looks beautiful and is an absolute breath of fresh air.The three stories are great and are similar to the way they did it in Pulp Fiction were all stories connect in some way,I loved Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke's story,I liked Clive Owen's as well but it was definitely the weakest,I thought it went on a bit longer than it should have and was certainly the weakest part of the movie.Sin City is a great movie that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great crime film or thriller. Follows the story of three different people caught up in corruption in a city infested with crime. Best Performance: Mickey Rourke Worst Performance: Benicio Del ToroIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Transporter is a decent movie with an alright storyline and an average cast.It is an enjoyable movie but there really isn't any element to it that is outstanding and I honestly don't see why it's what one of Jason Statham's best known films,his performance is good but he's done so much better action films than this and it's sequels.Qi Shu is a really terrible actress and without a doubt the worst part of the movie,she is very attractive,but pulling off eye candy isn't that easy when the actress says her lines as if she's reading the script for the first time.The Transporter has some action packed scenes,but there is nothing amazing about this movie and I would only recommend it as an action to just watch on TV if there is nothing else on,don't go out of your way to see it. Follows a man who transports anything,no questions asked,however,one package could be his undoing.Best Performance: Jason Statham Worst Performance: Qi ShuIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Born on the Fourth of July is a breathtaking movie with a fantastic and very real storyline and an extremely impressive and inspired performance from Tom Cruise.He plays Ron Kovic,a real life man who fought in the Vietnam war,which such great heart and he was extremely convincing,once he got a beard,I couldn't even believe it was actually Tom Cruise,its without a doubt one of his most impressive performances to date.The story is told perfectly and is very real and the music in the movie from the great John Williams (Star Wars,Harry Potter,Superman,etc) is absolutely beautiful.Uf our a fan of war biography's then Born on the Fourth of July is a must see.Based on the true story of Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise),a man who goes to fight in the Vietnam war for his country.But after he is paralyzed and see's some terrible things,he goes against the country he once supported.
The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is a great movie with a fantastic storyline,script,cast and characters.I found it to be a little disappointing because the movie won 3 Oscars and is written by Eric Roth,the same man who wrote Forrest Gump,and I thought it would be similar to that,which it was,but not as good in my opinion.Forrest Gump was more up to date with plenty of cultural references and comedy,however Benjamin Button is a lot more old fashioned and serious.It is still very enjoyable,with a length you wont feel and an outstanding performance from Brad Pitt.Benjamin Button looks back on his life as he starts off as an old man and gets younger as his life goes on.
X-Men: First Class is a fantastic movie with an extremely well developed storyline with an outstanding cast and great characters.Prequels are always hard things to do,and I didn't enjoy the majority of prequels i've seen,I wasn't sure about a prequel to an already troubled franchise (with X-Men: the Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine),but it was fantastic and the cast is just as good if not better than the original X-Men cast,every actor suits their characters very well and it is very interesting to see how they all developed in to Professor X,Magneto,Mystique,etc.X-Men:First Class is a top notch superhero movie and prequel that fans of the first two X-Men will definitely be pleased with.A young Magneto and Professor X recruit a group of mutants to save the world from an evil scientists plans to start a third world war.Best Performance: Michael Fassbender Worst Performance: Morgan Lily If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Garfield is a great family movie with great humor and a good storyline.Garfield is without a doubt my favorite comic strip character,I would usually read him at the back off the paper and I also use to love the series,I think that Bill Murray definitely had the perfect voice for Garfield.This movie shows you the origin of how Odie and Grfield first met,showing that Garfields owner John got the dog off Liz and Garfield being very jealous at the start.After John takes Odie to a dog show.A man called Happy Chapman wants to use Odie to advertise his dog products,Odie gets out of the house one night and goes missing and Happy Chapman finds him and does exactly what he had planned to do.Garfield see's Odie on TV but John and Liz are unaware,Garefield decides to head on a journey to save the dog who he realizes he is missing.
Boogie Nights is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The film is a very different type of drama film,I don't think there has been a drama since that centered around the life of the porn industry,it was interesting to see the kind of world they lived in back in the seventies,its dark and at times quite depressing.The character development is brilliant,we get to know a lot about all the main characters,of course we learn the most about Mark Wahlberg's character,but we get a lot of development as well from characters played by actors such as Burt Reynolds,Julianne Moore,John C.Reilly,Don Cheadle and William H. Macy,that all deliver great performances,particularity Reynolds who took on a very risky role that is nothing like any character he's played before.Boogie Nights is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great drama.A tale of fame,greed and envy set in the seedy world of the 1970s porn industry as we follow the career Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg),who changed his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes one of the biggest porn stars in the world.

The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a very mediocre movie with a decent storyline that dosen't try too hard to be different from its predecessor,and a promising cast that sadly didn't seem very inspired.It saddened me that Steven Spielberg actually made this movie because it just didn't feel like he enjoyed making this as much as he did the original Jurassic Park and it seemed like it was only for the sake of money this time around,it also felt like he was mimicking his own work in many parts.While it does look beautiful,it simply isn't as enjoyable story wise and I don't care for these characters as much,Roger Ebert made a great statement when he said that the cast were acting like they were in a movie about dinosaurs,but not like they were experiencing the danger of real dinosaurs,and this is definitely true,save Julianne Moore and Pete Postlethwaite,as these actors really felt like they were doing this movie for the cheque and didn't get too interested in their characters.It has its moments but The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a huge disappointment and I would only recommend it if you really want to finish the series. When a second island of dinosaurs is revealed it arouses the interest of several scientists and mercenaries.

Frank is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It can definitely be considered a comedy, but it isn't laugh out loud funny the whole time, that's not the type of movie it is, but there is a constant atmosphere throughout that is very humorous and it seems very aware of how ridiculous the concept is. The cast is terrific, all playing characters not like ones they have played previously. This is my first time seeing Domhnall Gleesom in anything, and he is definitely a talented actor, Maggie Gyllenhaal has a strange role that was certainly different for her, and Michael Fassbender shines as this very unique character, there really is no film character quite like Frank, he is hilarious, but you can also really feel for him. It isn't outstanding, but Frank is a fun and quirky film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or drama. Jon puts his love for music to the test when he joins a very unusual band as they struggle to write new music, lead by a man named Frank who refuses to show his face.

Rio is a great movie,the animations great,the characters are great,the humours great,the cast is great,the musics great,the movie in general is a well deserved hit.After a bird is adopted several years ago,he has never left his owners site,hes afraid to go outside and the bird (Blu) can not even fly,but he isn't bothered about it on e bit.A male bird doctor comes asking for Blu and the owner to come to his hometown,Rio so he can breed the birds almost extinct species with a female bird.But while at Rio,the two birds get kidnapped and the adventure begins.
Fast And Furious is a great movie with a well developed storyline that takes the Fast and the Furious franchise back to where it belongs.They clearly realize that these movies are better off with the same people,in the second one it was only Paul Walker with a main role and in the third the cast is completely different.I found this one much better,even better than the first in my opinion,it seems more mature and focuses more on a good story rather than just good car chases,don't worry though,there's plenty of time for that as well.Clearly the Fast and Furious movies can only continue with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker,and from this one forward they realize that,and the fifth only improves.Fans of the first Fast and Furious will be very pleased with this installment.Brian O'Connor is back working with the FBI in LA and reunites with Dominic to investigate a murder.
Schindler's List is a brilliant movie with a really well developed storyline that takes its time telling a very long story but never fails to be interesting.The films cast is pitch perfect,its without a doubt one of Liam Neeson's most impressive performances,but I think the best performance has to go to Ralph Fiennes,his performance as Amon Goeth was unbelievably inspired and he put a lot of heart in to it.Obviously a lot of credit for making this film so beautiful is Steven Spielberg,easily one of the best directors of all time,he clearly has a huge interest in World War 2 and puts so much heart and effort into every film he makes.If your a fan of war and biography films and just a moviegoer in general,Schindler's List should not be missed.Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson),a man sent out to exploit Jewish labor,finds himself unexpectedly risking everything to save lives.
To Kill A Mockingbird is a brilliant movie with a fantastic,heartwarming and emotional storyline,with a great cast and some wonderful characters.The film gives a great message,mainly from the character of Atticus Finch,who tells use that we should always follow what we think is right,no matter how much people think differently.I really got a laugh out of the fact that one of the kids friends name is Dill Harris,as my name is Dillon Harris.Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) is a very successful lawyer,defend a black man who is convicted for rape,although people are against him for defending the man,Atticus's children defend his fathers decision and believe he is right.
Johnny English Reborn is a brilliantly funny movie,it kept me laughing out loud the whole way through which Rowan Atkinson always seems to do (especially as Mr Bean of course),the storyline and everything else was altogether brilliant.Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) must return to M1-7 after being gone for years working on his skills in Asia,and now a group of international assassins are trying to eliminate a world leader and cause global chaos and now its up to Johnny English and his partner Agent Tucker to stop them,but they don't seem to have the brains for the job.
Scarface is a fantastic movie with a brilliant storyline and a great and inspired cast.The main reason this movie is so great is,of course,because of Al Pacino,his performance as Tony Montana is unbelievably good,and he kept me interested in this movie all the way through.The movie is very long,almost three hours,but I didn't get bored once during this movie and I didn't feel like there was too much detail in this movie,I actually think it could have been about ten minutes longer,the ending scene all felt like it happened too fast and I think they should have made it much longer and dramatic.I also think we could have gotten to learn a bit more about Tony Montana's life,I felt like there was a lot left out that we would have found out about eventually,but we didn't.Fans of mob films will love Scarface,and fans of Al Pacino will be swept away by his performance as Tony Montana.When Tony Montana,a Cuban immigrant,finally gets a chance to go to America,he gets involved in a drug dealing business in order to make the money he needs to become big,but he lets his greed get the best in him.
Shutter Island is an absolute breathtaking movie with a tremendous storyline that will keep you interested all the way through and a brilliant cast that all follow through with their performances in an overall terrific film once again from the great Martin Scorsese.The movie sounded pretty plain to me,I thought it would be an average thriller that I would enjoy but it would be pretty forgettable,but it totally wasn't,the movie had me curious and also confused,and the twist was one of the greatest,most surprising and most shocking twists i've ever seen in a movie,I literally never suspected it,not even once,and when it did happen I still didn't believe it.Shutter Island is a must see for all fans of Leonardo DiCaprio,Martin Scorsese,thriller and mystery.Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio),a US Marshall,sets out with his partner to a mental institution in a quiet island to investigate where a missing patient could have gone.But there's something suspicious about the island that they didn't bargain for.
For A Few Dollars More is a fantastic western with a terrific storyline that stays fresh and entertaining from start to finish and a brilliant cast that know very well how to act in a western.It is the second of the three movies in the Dollars trilogy,and manages to be even better than its already brilliant predecessor A Fistful Of Dollars.Clint Eastwood returns as The Man With No Name and his character and acting skills are even better than before,and the addition of Lee Van Cleef really helps out.Glan Maria Volonte returns as the villain in this,and he is as enjoyable as ever.A Fistful Of Dollars is terrific,but For A Few Dollars More is only an improvement.A Must see for all fans of the western genre.Two bounty hunters work together to find and kill a murderer with a reward for $10,000 if they get him,but it proves a lot more difficult that their passed experiences of catches criminals.
Glory is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is a very interesting and probably a very realistic look at how the US Civil War was fought.I didn't particularly enjoy Matthew Broderick as Robert Gould Shaw,he wasn't as bad as I thought he was going to be,but getting Ferris Bueller to be the main role of a serious war film was just a strange and risky casting decision,however,this movie was saved by two actors that were relatively unknown at the time but have gone on to become some of the biggest names in Hollywood,Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman,I loved seeing these characters develop and watch their personalities change drastically over the course of the movie.Glory is as intense and it is dramatic,and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good history or war film. An army officer must become the leader of a group of black soldiers during the civil war.Best Performance: Denzek Washington Worst Performance: Cary ElwesIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Incredibles is a terrific movie with a great storyline,great animation,great characters and great actors doing there voices.It is definitely one of Pixars finest and I personally think the best work to come out of the mind of Brad Bird.Syndrome,voiced by Jason Lee,is one of my all time favourite villains,he would right up there in a list of my favourite villains alongside Darth Vader and Mr Burns.There's been a lot of talk for different Pixar sequels,like a Toy Story 4,but I think if have any sequel plans after Monsters University,it should be a sequel to The Incredibles,we need more from this amazing family.Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) has to give up his job as superhero Mr Incredible and settle down in the suburbs with his wife Helen (Holly Hunter).But its difficult for them to live like a normal family with there three kids when they all have superpowers,Bob has super strength,Helen can stretch,there son Dash has super speed,Violent can turn invisible and there new born baby Jack-Jack's power is yet to be discovered.Bob isn't enjoying his normal life and when he is given an opportunity to be Mr Incredible again,he immediately takes it,but must keep it secret from his family.
Revolutionary Road is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast.It is certainly a well acted movie,though it is certainly not their finest performances,Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet both shine in the lead roles,and their acting has certainly improved over the eleven year gap of Titanic,both movies contain great chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet,but this time around it felt more real and sincere.I felt like there were certainly several things missing than could have made this movie better,one thing is that it certainly would have benefited with making us feel for these characters more,I found them quite unlikable for the most part,and at times that certainly made it difficult for me to care about the decisions they make or the things that happen to them.I also think it needed more scenes containing intense dialogue between the Wheeler's,these parts were the highlight of the movie as Winslet and DiCaprio both deliver their dialogue beautifully.Its certainly not outstanding and could have benefited more from its two leads,but Revolutionary Road is still a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or romantic film. A seemingly successful couple in 1950s Connecticut struggle to fight off the boredom and resentment their marriage is facing.Best Performance: Kate Winslet Worst Performance: Kathryn HahnIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Robin Hood is a good movie with a storyline that starts off very promising but after a while stops being as fresh.Ridley Scott did do a great job directing this movie,but I found it very disappointing,and I didn't feel like Russel Crowe put as much heart into this movie than he did in movies like Gladiator,he did a good job but not a fantastic job.I heard there were possibilities of a sequel,and although I was disappointed in this I think sequels to it have great potential,they understand were they went wrong with this and can make a much better sequel.Fans of Ridley Scott and Russel Crowe will be disappointed,but you should still check it out.Robin Hood (Russel Crowe) and his gang of many men fight against the leaders of their local village.
Pineapple Express is a fantastic movie with a very clever and exciting storyline and fantastic comedic performances,most of that credit going to Seth Rogen and James Franco,two actors that always work really well together,Franco's performance as Saul was brilliant and I wasn't surprised when I found out he was nominated for a Golden Globe for it.I was very impressed that this movie managed to be both really funny and also non- stop action all the way through,I really like how they pulled this off very well.Fans of Seth Rogen comedies will definitely laugh out loud watching this movie.A hapless stoner(Seth Rogen) witnesses a murder and goes on the run with his drug dealer (James Franco).
Wayne's World is a brilliant movie with a well written storyline that is filled with one laugh out loud scene after another and a great comedic cast.Mike Myers clearly loved playing this character that he created as a series of sketches on Saturday Night Live,and it shows as he delivers a ton of ridiculous but hilarious lines with such enjoyment.I also really love the movies constant use of breaking the fourth wall,it only happens with Wayne and Garth,where they both know their in a movie,and I find it hilarious,especially the scene towards the end where they keep changing the ending.Waynes World is a short but sweet comedy filled with so many memorable scenes and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.Two best friends become a huge deal when a TV show they film in their basement gets a deal with a real television studio,but it myth not be as great as they think. Best Performance: Mike Myers Worst Performance: Rob LoweIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Raging Bull is a great movie with a really well developed storyline and a terrific cast. The movie is mostly a great watch because of Robert De Niro's absolutely outstanding performance, he owns this character from start to finish, delivering an honest, sincere and real role that makes it very clear why he is one of the most successful actors of all time. I honestly don't think it comes near to be being Martin Scorsese's best film, it is very character driven, more so than the majority of his films are, which is fine but it isn't entirely exciting the whole way through, delivering little of the violence I've come to expect from Scorsese. Stunning performances and a superb script, I would recommend Raging Bull to anyone looking for a good sports drama. A boxer with a huge temper begins to isolate himself from the people around him. Best Performance: Robert De Niro Worst Performance: Nicholas ColasantoIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
The Amazing Spider Man is a fantastic movie with some great actors,action and a heartwarming storyline that lives up to the previous three,I do think Tobet=y Maguire is better because I grew up watching his Spider Man movies,but Andrew Garfield was still terrific and I couldn't imagine anyone being a better replacement than him.Its not like this has never happened before,there isn't one James Bond,there isn't one Batman,and stuff like this will continue.Spider Man is my all time favorite superhero,always has been,always will be.I love the villains,but the Lizard has always been one of my favorites and I'm glad they went with him.I sure we get to see Andrew Garfield in an Avengers sequel.Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) is having a tuff time at school,dealing with bullies and the death of his parents,with his aunt and uncle minding him and cant take up the courage to tell Gwen Stacey(Emma Stone) he likes her.But all this changes when he is bitten by a spider and becomes his alter ego,Spider Man.However fighting crime,the cops are after him,including Gwens father(Denis Leary).
Babe: Pig in the City is a good movie with a very enjoyable and well developed storyline with a good cast and a tone if very lovable characters.I find this to be a very underrated sequel,I found it just as good if not better than the first Babe,I loved all the animals in this one even more than the first,and I also felt a lot more emotion in this one.The movie also has a tone of very funny scenes.Fans of the first Babe should not be disappointed by Babe: Pig in the City.As he heads to a big city to save his farm,Babe goes to a hotel infested with animals.Its up to Babe to save these animals when they are discovered by animal control.
Armageddon is a great movie with a well written storyline and a fantastic cast.The movie isn't considered a brilliant effort in film making,but I really enjoyed it,the effects were beautiful and the acting was great,a lot of people just don't like Michael Bay films,and granted he isn't Spielberg or Scorsese,but he makes fun movies with great actors and amazing effects,and I will continue watching his work.There is a lot of comic relief in this movie,which I really liked,sometimes in a movie as dramatic as this the comic relief character can feel very forced and mediocre,but I think it worked out well in this,particularity Steve Buscemi's character,almost all of scenes had me laughing and his character was one of my favourites.It won't go down as one of the greatest films of all time,but Armageddon is fast paced,intense and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or adventure. NASA must train a group of drillers to become astronauts to head in to space before a giant asteroid hits Earth.

Run,Fatboy,Run is a good movie with some very funny scenes and a good cast that makes the movie very watchable.The movie was saved with the fact Simon Pegg contributed to the writing process,and some good directing in David Schwimmer.The movie has an enjoyable cast,especially from Simon Pegg,who I like very much from Shaun Of The Dead,Hot Fuzz and Paul,and Hank Azaria,who I love because of his many voice roles on The Simpsons,Im a big fan of Hank Azaria and IO found it hard to picture him as the unlikable character in this movie,he just doesn't normally play that kind of character (even Moe from The Simpsons is funny and very likable),I just enjoyed the scenes he was in,not looking at him as the character I'm not supposed to like.Dennis (Simon Pegg) leaves his wife Libby (Thandie Newton),who is also pregnant, at the altar.A few years later,Dennis has gotten very un-fit and Libby is living with there son Jake,and dating a successful man names Whit (Hank Azaria).Dennis wants Libby back and decides to prove his love for her by running a marathon that Whit is taking part in.
Drive is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.Its a really enjoyable ride,there are several very intense scenes and some parts that are quite hard to watch.There is also pretty good character development and even with their very flawed personalities the script still manages to make us care very much for these characters.Ryan Gosling's performance is outstanding,certainly one of the best of his career so far,his character is very unique and simply can not be compared to anyone from any other movie.Packed with some intense scenes and dramatic acting,Drive is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or crime film. After helping out a friend of his,a Hollywood stunt man lands himself in a huge heap of trouble.

Lone Survivor is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.The movie is very intense almost from the get go,you are following these soldiers in a dangerous area and are really hoping they will be safe.This is certainly one of Mark Wahlberg's most impressive performances to date,quite possibly his best,he is a very hit and miss actor,sometimes he's a great ,other times he's awful,but in this he is certainly outstanding,he really got in to his character and I really feel like he became his character,he wasn't just acting.Lone Survivor is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or war film. A group of soldiers set out on a dangerous and risky mission to find and possibly kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shah.

The Emperor's New Groove is a fantastic movie with a really well written storyline and a terrific voice cast. It is a very smart and unexpected turn from Disney, every time I watch it I just can't believe they ever allowed it be made, it's constant use of breaking the fourth wall and adult innuendos surprise me each time. The use of breaking the fourth wall is definitely my favourite part of the movie and is what makes it so fun and unique, it is mostly done by the main character Kuzco, who questions the films premise constantly and pauses it throughout because he is confused whenever he isn't on the screen, this type of thing can be annoying at times in movies, but it works out perfectly here and I never got annoyed. All the characters in this movie are great and likable in their own way, my favourite is Kronk, every line of dialogue by him is memorable and he had me in stitches most of the time. Very funny, smart and a huge risk from Disney that worked out well, the Emperor's New Groove is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a film for the whole family to enjoy. After a king is transformed in to a llama by an evil woman looking to take his place on the throne, he must get the help of a friendly village man in order to turn back to normal.

Star Trek: Generations is a good movie with a storyline that dosen't really go anywhere for a very long time but a very inspired cast like there always is in Star Trek.It definitely wasn't a fantastic start for the Next Generation crew,it being their first movie,but I don't think its as bad as most people make it out to be,I don't think its the worst Star Trek but its certainly not the best,these movies are sometimes outstanding (The Wrath of Khan) and other times awful (The Final Frontier),I would put this right in the middle.The plot was sometimes very frustrating because it just didn't know were it was going for such a long time,but the impressive cast made it bearable,I really enjoyed Malcolm McDowell as the villain,he always delivers very creepy performances and he fit perfectly into the Star Trek universe.I didn't really appreciate William Shatner's performance,it all felt very forced and I think this movie would have been better off just focusing on the Next Generation crew instead of bringing in members from the original series.Fans of Star Trek:The Next Generation will definitely be disappointed,but will still appreciate the casts strong performances.Captain Kirk (William Shatner) disappears on a mission,seven decades later,Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) encounters similar peril and only the two captains can save the Enterprise.
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a brilliant movie with a surprisingly clever story line,and an unexpected twist,a great cast and a fantastic main character.Jim Carrey is fantastic as Ace Ventura,the character is wacky,crazy and really funny,nothing you wouldn't expect from Jim Carrey,I definitely wouldn't want anyone else playing this character,I read in the trivia that Rick Moranis turned the opportunity to play Ace Ventura,which is good,because Carrey was perfect for this role,Rick Moranis wouldn't be as entertaining or energetic.Fans of Jim Carrey and easy to watch comedies will love Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.Ace Ventura,a detective that specializes with animals,investigates on a kidnapped dolphin who is a mascot for a well known football team.
Gran Torino is a fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline that will have you feeling a series of mixed emotions.Clint Eastwood brings a very different performance for him, his character starts as a clearly not as likable as any character he has played on the past,but as the movie continues his character starts to develop and become a lot more likable.Eastwood also did a great job directing this movie and did a great job with a lot of new and promising actors that have never been in a movie as a big as this on the past,Bee Vang,Ahney Her,Christopher Carey,among others were all very new actors,and gave dazzling performances.While it's not like anything he's done in the past,fans of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director will definitely enjoy Gran Torino.A bitter,racist old man begrudgingly changes when a Hmong family move in to his neighbourhood and come under threat from gangs.
Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan is a great movie with a really well thought out storyline that improves immensely on the first Star Trek movie,Star Trek: The Motion Picture,and you can even tell from the acting that the cast was more positive about this script than they were for the first movie.The thing I liked best about this was that it felt more cinematic,like something they couldn't do on the television series,thats the only reason films for TV shows should be made,to have a much larger situation,the first movie just feels like a long episode of Star Trek,but this movie is really what a movie based on a television series needs to be.Fans of the original Star Trek series will not be let down by the second installment.The Enterprise must work together to stop a nemesis of Captain Kirk from using his sons device,the Genesis,which is able to destroy any planet in the galaxy.
Christmas with the Kranks is a good movie with an enjoyable storyline and a good comedic cast.I really enjoyed Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis as the married couple, the two had great chemistry and clearly worked really well together,and also really enjoyed Dan Aykroyd's character.The movie has plenty of funny parts and although it certainly won't go down as a classic Christmas film, it is very enjoyable.I would recommend Christmas with the Kranks as a fun film fir the whole family to watch at Christmas time. When a couple decide to forget their annual Christmas festivities,preferring to take a luxury cruise,however,their neighbours disapprove.
Pitch Perfect is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific comedic cast.It's a ton of fun from start to finish,the music is beautiful,very well choreographed and the cast clearly had a load of fun working together.The writing is hilarious,quite similar to Bridesmaids,there are many scenes that had me in stitches and also some parts that were so good simply because of how unexpected they were.The main girls are immensely talented,they were well able to both sing and dance,they are all charming in their own way and this movie really helped them showcase their talent.Pure fun and entertainment, Pitch Perfect is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy.

Futurama is an outstanding television series that is extremely well written and developed,with an absolutely stellar voice cast.I have my doubts that any one reading this hasn't watched it yet,but if you haven't then I would highly recommend you start.It is from the same people who brought you the Simpsons,but it is very different,the humour is quite similar but the characters and the concept is certainly not similar.I grew up watching this show as a child,Fry,Bender,Leela and the rest of the gang are like family members to me and it would go high up on my list of favourite animated series.The show has been cancelled before and I'm sad to see it leave again,they had such a wide variety of fantastic episodes,ones that are hilarious,and even emotional,it can be very versatile.The final episode dosen't end in a way that it has to be the final time we ever see these characters,I could easily imagine the show coming back,or at least doing a movie to finish it off once and for all,I just hope to see the Planet Express crew again soon.A classic series that kids and adults will love,I would highly recommend Futurama to anyone looking for a good comedy or animated series. Phillip J. Fry is accidentally frozen in 1999 on New Years Eve and wakes up in the year 3000,where he starts working with a delivery company run by a crazy professor,where he works with a robot,cyclops,talking lobster and others as they are sent on many adventures.

Shrek is a fantastic movie with a great and really original storyline with a brilliant voice cast and some really lovable and unforgettable characters.The movie is easily one of the best family films ever made,there is plenty of jokes that will make the whole family laugh,and also plenty of subtle humor that only adults will understand,also the story isn't too dark for children or too childish for adults and there's a lot of not so subtle digs at Disney as well.Mike Myers,Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz all did a fantastic job and as much as I watch this movie and its sequels I never get tired of it,and Donkey is one of my all time favourite fictional characters.I would highly recommend Shrek to people of all ages,as a movie for the whole family,a comedy and just a beautiful animated film.When an ogre's swamp is invaded by fairy tale creatures,Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) must head on a quest with a talking donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) to save Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) from the dragons castle so she can marry Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow) and get his privacy back in his swamp,but he gets more than he bargained for on this journey.
The Hunt for Red October is a great movie with a very well developed storyline with a very talented cast.This is the first movie to have anyone playing Jack Ryan,and while the other movies had Ryan in the main role,this movie focused a lot more on Sean Connery's character,but this didn't bother me because Connery is a fantastic actor and really brought class to this movie,also I really didn't like Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan,I don't think the character suited him one bit and was happy that they focused on Connery's character more.The Hunt for Red October is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or thriller.A USSR submarine captain violates orders and heads for the USA.Everyone is now trying to find out what this man is up to.

Limitless is a great movie with an amazing story line,which is well thought out,clever and very different,and also a very talented cast,with fantastic performances from people such as Bradley Cooper,an actor I never treated seriously before because of movies like The Hangover and The A- Team,but today he has showed that he really can act,even being nominated for best actor this year at the Academy Awards for Silver Linings Playbook.I also thought Abbie Cornish,Andrew Howard and of course Robert De Niro all did a fantastic job.Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) starts taking illegal pills from his ex-wife's brother,which keeps you very concentrated and focused,and lead to him becoming very successful,but come with side effects.
Star Trek Into Darkness is a brilliant movie with a really well thought and action packed storyline with a fantastic cast like there always is in Star Trek and great characters.Some people thought this was a disappointment compared to the 2009 Star Trek,but I thought it was just as good,if not better.Chris Pine,Zachary Quinto,Zoe Saldana and Simon Oegg are all just as good as ever,but the best performance in this movie,in my opinion,has to go to Benedict Cumberbatch,this was my first time seeing him as a villain,I knew he was a great actor,but I didn't know he could play a character like this,especially not as well as he did.Fans of Star Trek in general,the 2009 film and sci-fi in general will be very pleased with Star Trek Into Darkness.The crew must all work together to put a stop to Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) an unstoppable man who is a long time enemy of the Enterprise.
The Graduate is a great,inspiring movie with a terrific story,and a good cast and characters.It was a great early role for Dustin Hoffman and showed us what an amazing actor he truly is.Im not sure what kind of a genre this movie is,its definitely a drama,I'm not sure about comedy,and I suppose it can be a romance,but not in a good way.Im not sure is Ben just meant to be misunderstood or just generally a mad person,I was routing for him all the way through,but I wasn't sure if I was suppose to,the thing with Mrs Robinson was t the beginning,a meaningless affair,but wants he falls for Elaine,it takes a dark turn.Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman),recently graduating from college,it not sure what to do with his life,and gets very distracting when he starts a sexual relationship with Mrs Robinson (Anne Bsncroft),but things get worse when Bens parents set him up with her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross).
No Strings Attached is an awful movie with a cliché romantic comedy storyline that's been done many times before.Sadly this movie had a great cast and a legendary comedy director (Ivan Reitman) attached,but they didn't get a great script to work with so all this combined talent was sadly put to waste,There was great chemistry between Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher,but it wasn't enough to make up for the fact that none of the characters are very likable and the movie is simply not funny.It dosen't contain enough humour for the man to enjoy,or an interesting romance for the woman to enjoy,I would not recommend No Strings Attached to anyone.

The Purge is a good movie with a well written storyline and a good cast.It isn't anything outstanding,but it's a short and sweet film that is very thrilling and will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout.I do think the movie got in to the main storyline too quickly and put the main characters in danger before giving the audience enough time to really care about them.Most of the cast isn't great but the movie was mostly saved from the performances of Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey,sure Hawke dosen't shy away too differently from characters we've seen him play before and Headey's acting isn't the same outstanding acting she delivers in Game of Thrones,but having more professional actors did honestly make you care more about their characters,however I honestly had no care for their children.The thing that annoyed me the most is that the movie was trying to give out a message about the future of humanity that didn't work out as well as they probably thought.The Purge is an enjoyable movie that certainly has its flaws but I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a short and sweet thriller. A wealthy family must protect themselves and their home from people that are free to commit any crime they want for 12 hours once a year.

A Fish Called Wanda is a very good movie with a fun and simple story line,a fantastic,funny and talented cast and some great characters,and you can clearly see in the movie that it is written by one of the six Monty Python's,that being John Cleese,who in my opinion is the best of the six and has made the best career outside of Monty Python out of the other five,he has made other comedy gold,such as Fawlty Towers and this movie.Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) is using many different men,a jewel robbery (Kevin Kline),one of his henchmen (Michael Palin) and the thief's lawyer (John Cleese) to get what he wants.-DILLON HARRIS
The Hangover is a hilarious movie with a well thought out storyline and a great main cast,Zach Galifanakis,Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper are all a delight.The movie is laugh out loud funny from the very beginning to the very end and it is also surprisingly clever.Alan is my favourite character in the movie,everything he says is very quotable and he is without a doubt one of the best comedy movie characters of all time.Fans of rude comedies like Old School or Superbad will love The Hangover.Four friends,Doug,Phil,Stu and Alan head off on a bachelor night in Vegas before Doug gets married,they wake up the next morning with no memory of the following night,there's a tiger and a baby in there hotel room and Doug is missing,they must retrace there steps to find Doug and find out what else happened that night.
The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3 is a fantastic movie with an incredible,well thought story,great directors work from the late Tony Scott and an incredible performance from both Denzel Washington and John Travolta.This movie received very mixed reviews,and I find it to be very underrated,but maybe thats just because I haven't seen the original 1974 version,but even if that one is much better,I still think this is a very good movie that critics weren't fair on.Ryder (John Travolta) hijacks a subway train and threatens to kill each passenger if he doesn't get what he wants,he talks to Walter Garber (Dennzel Washington),one of the men working at the subway station and Garber distracts Ryder with conversation.
12 Angry Men is a unbelievably inspired film with a really well developed storyline and beautiful acting from all twelve men.The movie is literally an hour and a half of twelve members of a jury discussing if a man is guilty or not,it dosen't sound that exciting,but all these characters different personalities and opinions on this man come together so well that its made really enjoyable and intense,the conversations these men have get very deep and they look at every aspect of the night of the murder.I really didn't think it sounded that good but I wanted to watch it since it is so high up on the IMDb Top 250,and rightfully so,there is no movie quite like this one,its really unique.I would highly recommend 12 Angry Men to all moviegoers.A jury of twelve very different men discuss if a man is guilty or not for a murder,but their different opinions make it into a much longer discussion than they expected.
Stuck On You is a great comedy movie with a well written storyline that is filled with plenty of hilarious and cringe worthy scenes and a cast that clearly had a lot of fun starring in this movie.I am a huge fan of the Farrelly brothers,and while I certainly don't think this movie is anywhere near as memorable as movies like Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary,it still is packed with plenty of moments that will make you know it is definitely a Farrelly brothers movie,and it had me laughing all the way through.I was surprised that they got Matt Damon to be in this,it's nothing I like what he has done before and nothing he will ever do again,but it was great to see him take on something very different,and the chemistry between him and Greg Kinnear is what makes this movie.Stuck On You is certainly not the Farrelly brothers finest movie,but I would still recommend it to fans and to anyone looking for a good comedy.Two Siamese twins find each other "separating" when they learn that they have two very different dreams after one brother forces to other to go to LA with him in order to pursue an acting career.Best Performance:Greg Kinnear Worst Performance:CherIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Kung Fu Panda 2 is a great movie,and is still as fresh and as good as the first one was,the storyline was great and all the characters were still as good and as funny as ever,but you really gotta give it to Jack Black as Master Po the star of the movie and the life of the whole thing,it wouldn't be the same without him.Master Po and the Furious five embark on an amazing adventure to fight an old enemy of kung fu with a new weapon,but when Po's dad tells him that he is adopted he gets curious of how things were before his duck father found him,but this old enemy knows the truth.-DILLON HARRIS
Red is a good movie with a very good story line and a terrific cast.The movie isn't anything new or exciting,but it is very enjoyable movie that doesn't go on for too long either.The cast is all very good,Bruce Willis,John Malkovich and Helen Mirren,in a very different role,are all great.I though the best performance was from Morgan Freeman,an actor I always enjoy,and never fails,and I wish he was in it for longer,I wont tell you what happens to him,but it all happens too suddenly and unexpectedly,and it wasn't really needed.I will more than likely be seeing the sequel.A retired CIA life is on the line when assassins are trying to kill him,he assembles his old gang to keep him safe from them and they hatch a plan to work everything out their way.
Filth is a good movie with a well written storyline and a talented cast.There is certainly nothing outstanding about it,but the movie knows exactly what it's suppose to be,an adult comedy,and dosen't strive to be anything more than that.James McAvoy did a great job,his character is very unlikeable,which is usually a huge flaw in a film,but it works out fine in this,as we follow him slowly realize how pathetic his life is and it is kind of enjoyable and funny to see him become miserable.I really didn't not the hallucinations that McAvoys character kept having throughout the movie,whenever it happened I practically jumped off my seat and this wasn't something I was looking for in a comedy.Funny but certainly not a feel good comedy,Filth is enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good quick comedy film to watch. A corrupt cop tries to get a promotion in order to win back his wife,while still breaking the law and committing adultery.

Hot Rod is a great movie with a well written storyline and a fantastic comedic cast. It is a very fun movie that you will likely enjoy from start to finish, it's a very simple story, it's obviously nothing inspirational or uplifting, but it's just a very enjoyable comedy. The main thing that makes this movie so good is the ridiculous dialogue between the characters and of course the great chemistry between cast members, many of them come from Saturday Night Live and you can tell they are close. My favourite scenes are the ones between Andy Samberg and Isla Fisher, their chemistry was pure and the relationship between the characters definitely had me in stitches the most. It's certainly nowhere near perfect, but Hot Rod is a very quick and very fun movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy.

War Of The Worlds is a fantastic movie with an exciting and action packed storyline and a brilliant cast.I think that Tom Cruise's performance as Ray Ferrier is one of his greatest role's,and that's saying a lot because I like him in pretty much everything he's in,he's a fantastic actor and I haven't seen anything with him in it I didn't like,I loved Rsy's character and Tom Cruise played him brilliantly.Another person who deserves huge credit for making this movie so great is Steven Spielberg,obviously one of the greatest directors of all time and this is only one of his many fantastic films.Fans of action,sci-fi and Tom Cruise should definitely watch War Of The Worlds.When Earth is invaded by alien tripod, Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) will do anything he can to keep his children safe.
Star Wars: Episode 2- Attack of the Clones is a brilliant movie with a great storyline,a very talented cast and brilliant characters.This movie is a huge improvement from The Phantom Menace,the plot is better as the plot in Phantom Menace didn't really go anywhere,there's much better character development,Jar Jar Binks is barely in it,Samuel L Jackson,Obi-Wan,Yoda,C3PO and R2D2 are in it more and we learn much more about Anakin Skywalker,he was basically just some boy named Anakin in Phantom Menace.Although i've never been fond of Hayden Christensen as Anakin,I don't think he does a very convincing job as Anakin Skywalker,and even worse trying to be evil,he wasn't a good casting choice.Though Attack of the Clones isn't perfect,its a huge improvement from Phantom Menace and we get learn a lot more of how some of the most loved Star Wars characters origins.A must see for all Star Wars fans.Set ten years after the events of the Phantom Menace,when the Princess is almost killed,Obi-Wan sets out to find the bounty hunter and discovers an army of clones being developed against the Republic,meanwhile,Anakin and Padme start a relationship.
Bad Neighbours,or Neighbors,as it's called in most parts of the world,is a fantastic movie with a very well written storyline and an outstanding comedic cast.The film is absolutely hilarious,especially if you're a fan of Seth Rogen,he is without a doubt one of my favourite comedy actors and you can tell in several scenes that he improvised his lines,and I really like when comedy actors get to do that.I also thought Rosa Bryne did a great job,she is a brilliant and attractive actress who dosen't do comedies very often,but when when she does she's fantastic,she was one of the funniest in this,she worked really well with Rogen and seemed very comfortable in her role.Also Zac Efron,an actor who I have never been a big fan of,actually did a really good job,I thought his character was just going to be a jock with little character development,but we actually did get to learn a lot about him (but not too much that it gets annoying) and it made him more likable,Efron certainly has good things coming for him in his acting career.Bad Neighbours is hilarious from start to finish,I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. When they move in to the suburbs to raise their new child,a young couple are soon disturbed by a frat house that moves in next door.When they call the police on them,these college students want revenge.

Rocky 4 is a decent movie with an alright storyline that definitely has some enjoyable parts,but takes a lot of bad turns throughout.The movies cast is still great but I don't feel like their hearts were really in it as much this time around and that they were just doing it for the sake of making more money.I won't spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen this movie,but the decision they make for Appollo Creed,played by Carl Weathers,was a very bad decision,it was dark and really unexpected from this film series,and was definitely the biggest mistake made in this movie.I also really did not like the character Drago,he was suppose to be intimidating competition for Rocky,but I just found him irritating.Rocky 4 certainly has it moments but fans of the previous films will definitely be disappointed.A now retired Rocky faces a challenge from from the Soviet Union's top boxer,that soon becomes personal.
Argo is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a very inspired and talented cast.This movie absolutely deserved the Academy Aaward for Best Picture,I can name out several movies that didn't deserve this award (Slumdog Millionaire,Titanic,Sound of Music,etc.),but Argo certainly did,Ben Affkeck put some very hard work in to making this,it is very dramatic and captures a true story in a correct manner.All the performances are very inspired,the movie has some memorable quotes and is at times surprisingly funny,particularly from Alan Arkin's character.Intense and a great ride from start to finish,I would recommend Argo to anyone looking for a good thriller or drama. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) pretends he is making a science fiction movie to distract the media and head out to find "filming locations" in Iran,while he's really trying to save American hostages.

Cloverfield is a fantastic movie with a very clever storyline,that mixes found footage movies,like the Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity with monster movies,such as Godzilla and King Kong,very well and in a clever way,the actors of this movie are also very good and believable and the fact I didn't know any of them is what made it so believable that this really happened.I really hope they end up making a sequel to this movie,because there is a lot of stories you can tell out of this,but it seems a bit unlikely seeing how busy JJ Abhrams is lately,but it could still happen someday.Revolves around a group of friends at a party where one guy films their entire night as the town becomes invaded by a big monster that comes out of nowhere.
The Chronicles of Riddick is a great movie with a good storyline and a great cast.Many people didn't,but I thought this movie was a lot better than Pitch Black, the cast felt more professional this time around and the characters felt more lively,Vin Diesel really matured as an actor within the four year gap of these two movies,and also adding Judi Dench to the cast was without a doubt a great decision,she is an outstanding actress who can pull off any type of character she plays and suited her character in this very well.I think fans of Pitch Black will definitely be impressed with Chronicles of Riddick,also it's worth a watch for people who enjoy action and sci-fi.Set 5 years after the events of Pitch Black,Riddick (Vin Diesel),lands on a planet ran by Necromongers,an alien army that want to convert all human life,and kill any human that they can't convert.
Watchmen is a fantastic movie with a brilliant and extremely well developed storyline,a very talented cast and a really interesting characters.I have never read the novel,but after watching this movie I really want to,because I really got into the movies characters and was really impressed with the development and the way the story is told,and the novel is obviously much better,I heard this was a bit of a disappointment to fans,which makes me really anxious to compare them.My favourite character in this was Rorschach,I cared about what happened to him all the way through,Jackie Earle Haley plays him with great passion,and even though the voice similarity with Christian Bale's Batman bothered me at times,I still really loved this character.Fans of more dark superhero movies,like Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy or Man of Steel,will really enjoy this movie.In 1985,President Nixon is still popular,having won the Vietnam War and banned superheroes,he is elected into his third term.However,a terrible plot is uncovered concerning some former superheroes.
Monsters Inc. is a fantastic movie.I would definitely say one of the greatest animated movies of all time,and one of Pixars best humor wise,but the movie would not be the same without the life of the film,Billy Crystal as Mike Wozowski,one of the funniest characters in an animated family film in my opinion.I truly love these characters,Sully,Mike and Boo and I can watch this movie again and again and still love it just as much.In a monster world,all the electricity is controlled by the children screaming at monsters when go into there rooms through there closet by using doors of that lead you there at Monsters Incorporated,and the top scarer there is Mike P. Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) with the help of his best friend Mike Wozowski (Billy Crystal),but the second best scarer Randell Boggs (Steve Buscemi) wants to beat his record.Drama occurs around Monstropolis when a little human girl gets out of her room and Sully and Mike must protect her.
Rush is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast.I wasn't very interested in watching this movie,a lot of my friends were recommending it to me but they were all people that are big F1 fans,which I am not,but I decided to rent it and didn't regret it one bit,you don't have to be interested in Formula One racing to enjoy this movie,we get to see a lot of Niki Lauda and James Hunts personal life and see how they made it in to the business and later on we follow their rivalry,it is a interesting biography film.The acting is very good,Daniel Brühl and Chris Hemsworth delivered great performances,I particularly enjoyed Brühl,I haven't seen him in anything other than this and Inglorious Basterds,but I am impressed with his acting skills and hope to see more of him in the future,I was also very impressed by Olivia Wilde,when I heard she was English in this movie I didn't think she could pull it off,but she did a great job and I would have liked to have seen more of her in this.Certainly not a clichéd racing film,Rush is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good biography film or drama. Chronicles the rivalry of Formula One racers Niki Lauda and James Hunt during the 1970s.

Footloose is not a great movie with a very dry and easy to tell storyline,the cast is pretty solid but other than that this movie does not stand out,Kevin Bacon and John Lithgow did do a good job though.I thought that this was a musical,which it is in plays,I'm not very in to musicals but when I put this on I expected a lot of singing.There is very little music in it,but where there is,there the most enjoyable parts.Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) moves to a town where music and dancing is banned.Ren is very passionate about this and trys to bring it back with the help of his school mates.-DILLON HARRIS
Chinatown is a great movie with a good story line,a great cast and some good characters.The movie is all made so enjoyable because of a fantastic performance from Jack Nicholson.The story to the movie is very strange,and there will be times when you'll get confused,and its filled with unexpected twists that you wont see coming.A private detecting is investigating a case for a woman who thinks her husband is having an affair,while investigating he stumbles upon many mysterious things revolving around this woman and JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) finds himself learning and discovering a lot more than he bargained for.-DILLON HARRIS
I Robot is a great movie with a really well developed storyline with a very impressive cast, the movie is both action packed and dramatic.Will Smith offers a very dramatic and inspired performance,like he always does, and I was also very impressed by Bridget Moynahan 's performance,and also Alan Tudyk,an actor I have only seen in comedies in the past,did a great job as all the robots in this movie.The movie still looks great today,the special effects are outstanding and beautiful.Even though the movie is almost ten years old,it's message about how were relying too much on technology is even more legit today as it was then,and it really makes you think that maybe all this technology isn't a very good idea.If your a fan if action or Will Smith you will definitely want to see I Robot.Set in the year 2035,robots are built to help humans.But after the murder of the robots creator is committed,a police officer is convinced the machines have gone bad and are no longer following their rules.
LA Confidential is a fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie is a really great mystery and it also has some very thrilling scenes,I was sucked in to this very interesting story and the brilliant character development from start to finish.There isn't a single bad actor in this cast,from Kevin Spacey to Russell Crowe,among many others,I did think Kim Basinger delivered a great performance and it was certainly the highlight of her career,her character was also certainly unique,but I honestly don't think she deserves the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role,it was a good performance,but it wasn't Oscar good.It can go from mysterious to thrilling in the matter of seconds,I would recommend LA Confidential to anyone looking for a good drama or crime film. Two cops are drawn together by an obsession with the same investigation of murders and a beautiful woman. Best Performance: Russell Crowe Worst Performance: Guy Pearce If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Foxcatcher is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.Its based on a true story,one that I never knew about,and didn't bother learning anything about it so I would be surprised with what was to come,and it certainly kept me at the edge of my seat.Though the movie isn't a thriller for the majority,there is a constant creepy and unpleasant atmosphere throughout,you can tell that something big is coming.This atmosphere is mostly conveyed by Steve Carell,who delivers an absolutely terrific performance that is nothing like what he's done previously,he is a complete creep and it is certainly uncomfortable watching this character,but in a very enjoyable way,it was amazing to see a man who played Michael Scott and Brick Tamland now take on such a very different character,and do so with such grace.Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo also do an amazing job,you can tell in many scenes that they got in to these characters as much as they possibly could,their mannerisms and speech are very different and both deliver one of their finest performances to date.I do feel like the movie struggled a bit to find their leading man,which was a bit of an issue,for a while it was mainly Tatum,but it stopped following him and jumped to Carell a bit and then to Ruffalo briefly,this isn't a huge issue but I felt like it should have focused on one character as the leading role and not jump around characters.A dramatic and well acted movie that I will certainly watch again,I would recommend Foxcatcher to anyone looking for a good biography or drama. Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is finally getting the recognition as a wrestler he dreamed of after getting in to business with Team Foxcatcher,led by the very successful John du Pont (Steve Carell),but all may not be as good as it seems.

Bedtime Stories is a great movie for all ages,the humor is clean and hilarious and just a feel good movie,the cast is also terrific,starring Adam Sandler,Russel Brand,Courtney Cox and many more,I also enjoyed the children's lovable pet guinea pig Bugsy,he was great.When a man minds his nephew and niece while there mother is away trying to save there school,he realises that the bedtime stories he tells them before bed end up coming through in a more realistic matter in real life the next day,so he decides to use it to help make him become the owner of the hotel he wants to own that he has been working with his father as since he was a child and to make other stuff he wants happen,but it gets more difficult when he realises it only happens if the two kids say and what they say isn't necessarily what he wants.
Babe is a great movie with a really sweet storyline,a great voice cast as well as an inspired performance by James Cromwell and some very likable and memorable characters.The movie is a great movie for the whole famly,it has enough in it to entertain both younger and older audiences.I certainly don't think that is a Best Picture nominee,although it did definitely deserve the Academy Award Best Visual Effects as the movie is very well made.These talking animal films are usually only fun for children,but Babe has enough in it for the entire family to enjoy and I would highly recommend it as a film for the whole family to watch.Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) trains a pig who was taken away from his mother and grew up with sheepdogs,to herd sheep himself.
Olympus Has Fallen is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very very talented cast.The movie is action packed from start to finish and several scenes are very intense.Gerard Butler,Morgan Freeman,Angela Bassett and Aaron Eckhart are my favourite actors in the film,they are all very talented and professional actors and their dramatic acting in this movie definitely added to the drama of the film.The film is very enjoyable and not a cliché and predictable action movie,and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or thriller.After the president is kidnapped and the White House is under attack by terrorists.its up to the presidents former employee Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) to put a stop to them and save his country.
The Talented Mr. Ripely is a brilliant movie with a really well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.It is an absolute thrill ride from start to finish,from the moment we meet Tom Ripely we do feel a sense of danger,as if this man may not be as innocent as he appears,but what is to come is totally unexpected and this is easily one of the most unpredictable films I've ever seen,I couldn't tell anything that was coming,Ripely is a very strange character and you really don't know what he's capable of.The cast is outstanding, this character is nothing like any other role Matt Damon has played and he does a terrific job of conveying an anti-hero that the audience will support but feel bad as they're doing it, joining him are several other terrific actors,including Gwyneth Paltrow,Jude Law,Cate Blanchett and Phillip Seymour Hoffman,each of their performances and characters provide a huge contribution and important plot points to this film.It will keep you at the edge of your seat and you won't be able to see whats coming,I would recommend the Talented Mr. Ripely to anyone looking for a good thriller. Tom Ripely is sent to Italy to retrieve a US playboy,but his mission takes an unexpectedly dark turn when things don't go his way.Best Performance: Matt Damon Worst Performance: Jack Davenport If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Dogma is a great movie with a very good story made up by Kevin Smith.The cast of the movie is also brilliant,especially Ben Affleck,Linda Fiorentino,Chris Rock and Alan Rickman,I also enjoyed Jason Mewes and Kevin Smiths return as Jay and Silent Bob.I've heard rumors before that Kevin Smith has considered making a sequel to Dogma,I don't think this is needed,I think it is better off if they left it at one,I don't think the story is really sequel material,although if he ever made one I would check it out,but I don't imagine Ben Affleck and Matt Damon returning as they are much bigger stars now than they where back then.Two angels sent to Earth after going against God go on a killing spree of the people who committed major sins in hopes that they will be let back in.
Salt is a good movie with a very enjoyable,albeit very predictable storyline,and a pretty impressive performance from Angelina Jolie.It didn't surprise or shock me once,I found everything was going to happen extremely predictable,but I did enjoy the great action sequences in this movie and Angelina Jolie suited Evelyn Salt perfectly.I heard rumors about a sequel and if one was made I would go see it because the ending made a continuation very seem very promising.The movie is a fun ride and I would recommend it to action movie fans,but don't be expecting a very good movie,just some good action.Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie),a CIA agent,has to flee when a Russian defector claims she's a sleeper agent about to commit an act of terrorism.
Predator is a brilliant,timeless movie with a terrific story,action,thrills,suspense,cast and characters.Dutch is one of Arnold Schwarzeneggers finest characters,and he right up there with his greatest,such as The Terminator and Douglas Quaid (from Total Recall).The movie really keeps you watching with the way they show the damage but don't show the Predator for a while,and you almost don't feel ready when you know your about to finally see the monster.A team of commandos in a jungle in Central America find out a lot of damage is being done by monster that doesn't belong in our planet,its up to Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to stop it.
Jack The Giant Slayer is a decent movie with a storyline that just exaggerates on a children's fairy tale,but a very positive cast.The movie really felt like Bryan Singer was trying to make his own Tim Burton type of movie,but it just didn't work out and this movie would have been much darker and more respectful if Tim Burton had directed it.The cast were all very positive and they all just seemed like they knew this movie would be a success,which it wasn't,they did the best they could,especially Ewan McGregor,but it just wassn't enough to make this movie enjoyable,there was way too much obvious CG.Jack The Giant Slayer will probably only entertain children that are ten or younger.When a beanstalk is formed by magic beans,the giants begin attack the humans,its now up to Jack (Nicholas Hoult) to put a stop to them.
A View to a Kill is a good movie with a fairly developed storyline and a great cast.It is certainly not the finest Bond,there is certainly a lot of campy humour in it which I did not appreciate,sure every Bond had this back then but it is used too frequently in this to a degree that it can no longer be considered a little bit of comic relief for the audience.Many people criticized Roger Moore for being too old for the part this time around,but I think he still delivered a great performance and being a great Bond really dosen't matter on your age,just whether or not you're a good actor,and he certainly is.I was very disappointed with Christopher Walken as the main villain,he's a fantastic actor and casting him as the lead antagonist seemed like an obviously great decision,but his dialogue just wasn't very well written and he wasn't a very threatening or chaotic person,which is usually represented in these characters to make a great Bond villain,but sadly this was missing for Walken and this was simply wasted talent.Still an enjoyable action movie,but A View to a Kill is a disappointing Bond finale for Roger Moore and it's really only worth a watch if you come across it on television and have time to kill. Bond is assigned to foil a wealthy industrialists plot to destroy California's Silicon Valley.Best Performance: Roger Moore Worst Performance: Grace JonesIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a terrific movie with a really well written and original storyline that is sweet but at the same time very real,to a level that this at times hard to watch.The cast is extremely inspired,it is without a doubt one of Jack Nicholson's finest performances,and that is saying a lot because she is an incredible actor.The movie won five Academy Awards,including Best Picture,and I honestly think this movie will always be very well remembered as a classic and very well written drama.I would highly recommend One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to all moviegoers.A mental patient inspires his fellow patients to resist the hospitals oppressions.
Bean is a good movie with a decent storyline and a very good comedic cast.It certainly isn't the comedy gold that the television series is but it's still very enjoyable and you will laugh out loud a lot.My biggest problem was that Mr Bean spoke too much in this movie, he's suppose to be a silent character who myth say a few words every now and again,but in this he actually has full lines and even a while speech at one stage.Rowan Atkinson did do his best as Mr Bean and delivered plenty of solid laughs and I really liked Peter MacNicol as well as the voice of reason.The movie is very different to the television series and fans will definitely be disappointed,but if you really enjoy watching Rowan Atkinson play Mr Bean in any aspect then you should definitely check out Bean. Mr Bean heads to Los Angeles to return a famous painting from a museum in England back to America.He stays with a family that he breaks up with his own stupidity without even realizing.
Taken 2 is a brilliant movie with a terrific storyline,action,thrills,suspense,cast and characters.Liam Neeson is back again as Bryan Mills,one of his finest roles too date.A lot of critics didn't have positive feedback from the trailers and thought they where making it look obvious that it was a sequel,but I don't think they did that at all,it trys to be its own movie and doesn't copy stuff from the original,something that sequels like Die Hard 2 and The Hangover Part 2 have failed to do.The movie keeps you on your seat from start to finish.Bryan goes on a vacation with Lenore and Kim to Isanbul.But the father of the men who took Bryans daughter several years ago that he killed is looking for revenge and kidnaps Bryan and Lenore,Bryan gets help from Kim to fix things.
Movie 43 is an absolutely brutal movie with a terrible storyline that just set the whole movie up for a bunch of incredible disgusting and just not funny sketches starring some very talented actors playing unlikeable,disgusting and offensive characters.The movie cast is surprisingly brilliant,starring some very different actors,from Richard Gere to Emma Stone to Hugh Jackman to Jason Sudekis,and it really depressed me that such great actors wasted their talent in these ridiculous sketches,I honestly don't understand how they read the script and thought it was a good idea to star.There was not a single sketch that I liked,I am sensitive to vulgar humour,I'm a fan of stuff like South Park and American Pie,but this movie went way too far,with several jokes about incest,children losing fingers because of a music device that looks like a naked woman and a gay cartoon cat,it was incredibly offensive and just unwatchable.Whether Anna Faris wants Chris Pratt to take a dump on her,Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant want to play a dare competition or Keiran Culkin and Emma Stone want to do weird things to each other,Movie 43 is a terrible movie in every way,that a fantastic cast can't even make enjoyable,I wouldn't recommend it to anyone,avoid it in all ways necessary ,it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.When two close friends and ones younger brother learn about Movie 43,the most banned film on Earth,they go to the dark corners of the internet to find it,which leads to a series of strange sketches they find online.
Fargo is a brilliant movie with a very well written and well developed storyline with an outstanding cast and unique characters.The film is without a doubt some of the Coen brothers finest work,they put so much effort in to both writing and directing this movie together.William H. Macy does an outstanding performance as Jerry Lundegaard,if you read the trivia for this movie you will see that Macy fought hard for this role because he felt so strongly that he was the prefect choice for the character,and that is so true as I could not imagine anyone else as Lundegaard.I was so impressed that they managed to develop the characters and make such a detailed story with really no plot holes in the space of only an hour and a half,it didn't seem like enough time for such a complicated story,but the Coen brothers managed it perfectly.Fargo is an absolute classic film that I would recommend to all moviegoers.Based on a true story about a crime gone wrong as a husband pays henchman to kidnap his wife in order to get his own half of the ransom money from his father in law.

True Grit is a fantastic movie with a terrific story,a great cast and terrific characters.This movie really lives up to the novel by Charles Portis,in my opinion even more than the original 1969 movie,although I did prefer John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn over Jeff Bridges,but Bridges did still a great performance and himself and Matt Damon got the western accents perfectly.Like all movies based on books,there is a lot of detail missing,that bothers me with some movies but not this one,because I read True Grit and,although it is a very good book,there is a lot of not needed detail in it.After Mattie Ross's father John Ross is murdered by Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin),and his gold and cattle is robbed from him,Mattie seeks revenge and gets help from Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) and LaBoeuf (Matt Damon).
Elf is a fantastic movie with a great well written storyline and a great comedic cast.It is a must watch for all during the Christmas holidays,it is hilarious and has enough humour for the whole family to enjoy.Will Ferrell does a fantastic job as Buddy the Elf,a hilarious and lovable character.Elf is without a doubt my favourite Christmas movie and a just watch for everyone during Christmas.When Buddy (Will Ferrell),a human raised in the North Pole by elves,learns that his real father lives in New York,he heads off to find him.-DILLON HARRIS
Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smothsonian is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast.It is certainly not as good as the original,it dosen't have nearly as much heart and emotion as the first one showed,the relationship between Larry and his son played an important role which was very sweet and one of the first movies highlights,but there is no kind of sentimental factor this time around.I was disappointed that it didn't show some of the characters from the first as much,but I did really enjoy some of the new characters,Amy Adams was fantastic as Amelia Earhart and Hank Azaria was absolutely hilarious as the main villain.The movie looks just as good as the first,they once again put a lot of heart and money in to making this and it looks absolutely beautiful. Entertaining and very funny,I would recommend Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian to anyone looking for a good movie for the whole family to watch.Larry must head to the Smithsonian to rescue his old friends from the biggest museum in the world.

The Day After Tomorrow is a great movie with a pretty well developed storyline,although at times relies too much on special effects,but they are very good effects.I thought the movie didn't sound like something I was going to enjoy,just another cliché end of the world movie,but I decided to watch it because I like Jake Gyllenhaal and Dennis Quaid,and I thought that they and several other cast members made what could have been a straight forward end of the world movie a lot more intense and enjoyable.The movies special effects are truly groundbreaking,especially for 2004 standards,they definitely overused it but it was so good I was able to get over it.Fans of action movies and apocalypse movie will definitely enjoy The Day After Tomorrow,and will find it a lot more refreshing than the usual mediocrity you would expect in these type of movies.As Earth cracks under tornadoes,tidal waves and ice caps,scientist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) races to save his stranded son Sam (Jack Gyllenhaal).
Hollywood Homicide is a mediocre movie with an average storyline that I felt had the opportunity of being very different but simply didn't and a cast that could have delivered more.The set up of a buddy cop comedy in LA with Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett easily could have worked but simply didn't,they completely lacked any necessary chemistry for their parts.I always love seeing Harrison Ford on screen,but was very disappointed by his performance in this,he simply couldn't do comedy,he delivered pretty much every line very poorly and I feel like he slowly lost more and more interest in his role throughout.There were certainly a handful of parts that made me laugh,but there wasn't enough and there was nothing aside from that,the action sequences are unimpressive,and we are never really given any reason to truly care for these characters.It has its moments,but Hollywood Homicide is mostly a poorly written and poorly acted comedy that I would not recommend. Two detectives investigate the murder of a popular rap group.

Back To The Future is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a fantastic cast and some very funny scenes,the movie is lots of fun from start to finish,the imagination of time travel in the movie is a lot of fun and this is still today easily one of the greatest movies ever made.What makes this movie so great is the amazing performances from Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd,who seem to have great chemistry and there characters,Marty McFly and especially Doctor Emmett Brown,are two amazing characters.Its With a doubt one of my favourite movies of all time and I would highly recommend it.Marty McFly accidentally travels back to 1955 in his friend Doctor Emmet Browns DeLorean time machine,Marty meets his parents when they where only teenangers and Martys future mom starts to fall for him,this causes trouble and myth make him and his siblings never exist,its up to him to bring his mom and dad together and find a way home to 1985.
On The Waterfront is a brilliant movie with an really well developed storyline with an outstanding cast that all deliver extremely impressive performances.It was Marlon Brando's first Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and he definitely deserved,he is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time,he really gets in to his characters and is a perfect example for anyone trying to become an actor.I would highly recommend On the Wterfront for anyone looking for a good classic drama and to all fans of Marlon Brando.An ex boxer struggles to fight the corrupt union bosses of the dock he works on.
Miracle On 34th Street is a terrific movie with a brilliant,heartwarming story,a beautiful cast and characters,that make this an amazing,heartwarming movie,filled with emotion,and one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made that should be watched every year during the holidays,and should have never been remade back in 1994,it amazing how a movie can still be so great and so well remembered,when it was made back in 1947.A man who plays Santa Claus at parades and shopping malls during Christmas,claims he really is Kris Kringle,and despite being taken to court about these claims,he still says he is,many people believe,but could this man be telling the truth after all?
The Firm is a decent movie with a promising storyline that dosen't really deliver.The movie certainly shouldn't be called a thriller,it wasn't very exciting and it wasn't something that I couldn't keep my eye away from.I was impressed with Tom Cruise,Jeanne Tripplehorn,Gene Hackman and Ed Harris performances and their probably the only reason why this score isn't much lower,because their all just very talented and did the best they possibly could with this overall dull and boring movie.I wouldn't recommend the Firm,especially not to fans of thriller's,it isn't exciting as the story makes it seem,and it is dragged out way too much,with two hours and a half,and it gets boring after about the first hour.The movie is too plain,simple and long but fans of these actors will appreciate their performances.Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise),a trained lawyer,joins a prestigious law firm only to discover their business is dangerously shady.
Dr. No is a great movie with a well written storyline and a great cast.It is the first ever James Bond film,a hugely successful film franchise that is still going today.I don't think it's the best James Bond,although many people consider it the best even today,Sean Connery is outstanding as Bond and without a doubt one of the best and definitely the one that future Bonds will always look at for inspiration,one of the biggest moments in film history was being made when he signed on to play this character.The movie still has some cheesy moments,it being a 60s film,but the action sequences are really good for its time.I was annoyed that the films main villain and title character didn't appear enough,it's a very long time until we are introduced to the character,but it is worth it once we see him,still today one of Bonds finest nemesis.Dr. No has its flaws and can be cheesy at tines,but it is a huge moment for film history and would also recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or adventure. 007 most uncover the activities of Dr. No,who has designs upon the US missiles base at Cape Canaveral Best Performance: Sean Connery Worst Performance: Eunice GaysonIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Man Of Steel is a fantastic movie with a great storyline,an inspired cast and fantastic characters.I had very high hopes for this movie since Christopher Nolan was involved,and I was disappointed to be honest,but only slightly,its definitely not going to be as good as Nolans Batman Trilogy,but more will hopefully be made because this movie has great potential for more.Henry Cavill is definitely a good Superman,Amy Adams is even better as Lois Lane,but I thought Russel Crowe's performance as Jor-El was the best part of the movie,he played the character with great passion,and I know this is saying a lot,but I thought he did a better job than Marlon Brando did in the 1978 Superman,I he was only in it briefly,but he didn't play the part with much passion,it was just money,Russel Crowe really did.Fans of Superman and people who just enjoy superhero movies in general should love Man Of Steel.When Earth is attacked by members of his home planet,Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) must find out what he is destined for in order to save the world.
Batman Returns is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's still enjoyable, but it certainly lacks the same level of fun and action that we saw in the first Batman. Tim Burton is certainly a dark and unique director, but he toned down his weird style for Batman, this time around, however, he dosen't and it's much darker and creepier than you would want a Batman movie to be, for example, a scene of a woman being pushed out a window falling to her near fatal death and the Penguin biting someone's nose off. He clearly had more power with how the movie was made this time around, but he simply went too far with conveying his own style which dosen't really suit the Batman universe. The highlight of the movie is certainly Michelle Pfeiffer, she is a fabulous actress and performs brilliantly as Catwoman, her scenes are the most memorable as well, particularly her dialogue with Batman. My biggest problem with this movie is the same one I had with the first Batman, but it's more extreme this time around, Batman dosen't have enough screen time and is underdeveloped, the villain has much more dialogue, which wasn't a huge issue the first time around as Jack Nicholson was terrific as the Joker, but I really wasn't fond of Danny DeVito as the Penguin. Villiains normally have a lot of reasons to be likable, but the Penguin was simply creepy and every time he was on screen I was uncomfortable, it was clear that Burton found this character fascinating, but giving him, as well as Catwoman, more dialogue and screen time than the title character is simply odd. It certainly has its flaws and fans of the Batman franchise will probably be disappointed, but Batman Returns is still a very enjoyable movie and I would recommend it as a good action if you ever see it on television. Batman (Michael Keaton) must put a stop to a corrupt mayor and a psychopathic man who calls himself the Penguin, from taking complete control of Gotham.

Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast.The movie is action packed from start to finish while still managing to have great character development and making the audience really care about these people.Its a groundbreaking piece of film history,it's the debut of Indiana Jones,has an amazing soundtrack and not the mention one of the most iconic scenes in movie history.Its no surprise this movie is so high up on IMDBs Top 250,it's just one of those films that is so watchable no matter how many times you've seen it.Harrison Ford is a great actor and Indiana Jones suited him perfectly,also the chemistry between him and Karen Allen is fantastic.Raiders of the Lost Ark is an outstanding film and an absolute classic,I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or adventure. Archaeologist Indiana Jones races to beat the Nazis to a religious relic which is central to their plans for world domination.Best Performance: Harrison Ford Worst Performance: Vic TablianIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Beverly Hills Cop 2 is a fantastic movie with a very good storyline and a really funny cast and characters.It certainly isn't as good as the first Beverly Hills Cop but its still a very enjoyable and fresh sequel.My biggest problem is that the effort with a good storyline wasn't as impressive this time around,what't there is enjoyable,but a lot of the movie is Axel Foley messing around and doing unprofessional or illegal things,but all the stuff he was doing was just too funny to bother me that much,but they still could have made more effort with a storyline.Like the first,the music is fantastic and the cast are as great as ever.Its certainly not as good as the first Beverly Hills Cop,but Beverly Hills Cop 2 has enough comedy and action to keep the fans entertained.Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) must return to the Beverly Hills police force to help his old friends investigate the shooting of their chief.
Tower Heist is a great movie with a well written storyline with a great comedic cast.I was certainly disappointed by this movie,it teams up two comedy actors who I am huge fans of,Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy,and on top of that it also stars Matthew Broderick and Casey Affleck,and while it is an enjoyable movie,I gave my hopes up on this being an outstanding comedy,because I expecting nothing more with a comedy cast like this,also it was Murphy's first adult comedy on years.It still is a really good comedy however,and the best performance certainly has to be Eddie Murphy,it was a great comeback to characters like his Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop characters,the much better and way funnier Murphy that I really missed,and this movie is certainly much better than the movies he's done in recent years (Meet Dave,Norbit,etc.) and I hope he realises after doing this film that these comedy suit him much more than family friendly ones.Tower Heist is a very enjoyable comedy that I would recommend to all fans of comedy,Eddie Murphy and Ben Stiller.After a group of men discover they have fallen in to a Ponzi scheme,they hire a professional thief to help them break in to his residence at the top of a tower.Best Performance: Eddie Murphy Worst Performance: Michael PeñaIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris
Valkyrie is a brilliant movie with a really clever,different and well developed storyline with a very impressive cast.I really enjoyed how risky this movie was,nothing related to Hitler could have been easy to make,I don't think it turned out as exciting as it could have been but it was still a very refreshing movie and,as usual Tom Cruise is outstanding in this,his character was very different compared to his usual performances.I would highly recommend Valkyrie to fans of thrillers.Set during the height of World War 2,an army officer leads a conspiracy to assassinate Adolf Hitler.
Machete is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a very talented cast that all play characters none of them have really played anything similar to before.The movie is an action movie that knows exactly what genre it is,it dosen't try to develop its characters too much or make you really care about them,it's just fun and action packed,and dosen't try to be any more than that.The cast is outstanding,Danny Trejo is perfectly suited as the title character,and I also really liked Jessica Alba,Robert De Niro,Steven Seagal,Lindsay Lohan and Cheech Marin,they were all clearly in on the joke and seemed to have had a lot of fun being in this movie.Simply a fun movie that is very quick and enjoyable,I would recommend Machete to anyone looking for a good action movie.

Casino Royale is a fantastic movie with an action packed and very well written storyline and a great cast that follows through with their characters.This is Daniel Craig's first Bond movie and he give's us a great first impression,even from the very first scene we know he's going to be a great Bond,and he only improves on that as the movie continues.The movie is action packed and intense from start to finish,and the action and chase scenes are clearly inspired,not just action like the ones in Fast & Furious movies that are just an excuse to avoid telling a story,the action follows through with the story in this.Casino Royale is a must see for all fans of James Bond.James Bond (Daniel Craig) is sent off on his first mission as 007 where he must go to Casino Royale and track down a weapons dealer.
The Iron Giant is a great movie with a great,heartfelt and sweet storyline.I remember this movie so well from my childhood,and I found my old video of it and decided to watch it,and it was such a nostalgic trip.I remembered how much I loved the Iron Giant himself,and today i'm also able to appreciate the more adult jokes,the beautiful animation and the fact that Brad Bird is just a brilliant director,he knows just what people like.I was very shocked when I saw on this that Vin Diesel was the Iron Giant's voice,I love him as an actor and was very surprised that he was the voice of one of my favourite childhood characters,and he did a great job with the voice as well.I would highly recommend the Iron Giant to fans of good animated films and someone looking for a good movie to watch with their family.Hogarth Hughes comes across a giant robot from outer space that he becomes very close to.He must protect the robot from the government who are seeking to destroy the 'evil' robot.
Star Trek: Nemesis is a good movie with a pretty decent storyline that kind of gets to the point too quickly but is fun and action packed,unlike Insurrection,that is very slow paced,and I thought Nemesis was much better.The cast are still as strong as ever,just like every other Star Trek,but I found it disappointing for the fact that it was the Next Generation crew's final adventure,it didn't really go out with a pleasing ending like the Undiscovered Country did with the original crew,and it sort of ended like there was going to be more,but there never will be.A lot of be wouldn't agree with me when I call it enjoyable,a lot of fans really hated this,I didn't really see why,I thought the set up and especially the villain was very good,it isn't the best Star Trek,but it's certainly not the worst.Fans will definitely be disappointed by Nemesis and will feel like you didn't get to properly say goodbye to the crew,but its still a fun and action packed Star Trek adventure.The crew is sent to the planet of the Romulus as they want to declare peace,little does the crew know it is a trick to take over the planet Earth.
Signs is a mediocre movie with a fairly well developed storyline and a good cast that sadly didn't deliver as strongly as I hoped.After previously seeing the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable,I was expecting a lot from this,all of them being directed by M. Night Shyamalan,but this just didn't work as well as I had hoped,aliens seemed like a subject that he would have had a field day with,but the movie just didn't work out that well for me.I felt like the plot was trying to find itself the whole time,it wasn't sure whether it wanted to be a very character driven drama or a very gritty sci-fi,it jumps around from those two things way too often.I liked Mel Gibsons performance but he has certainly seen better days,however,Joaquin Phoenix performance was definitely the best and,though he wasn't in the lead,I still found myself caring for his character more than anyone else.A disappointing movie that didn't deliver as well as some of Shymalan's previous work,Signs has it moments but it's mostly a sci-fi that I feel people would be better off avoiding.

Jerry Maguire is a good movie with a good storyline,some very funny scenes,and good cast and some very memorable lines that are still being said today,such as "show me the money!" and of course "you had me at hello".The cast was fairly good,I thought Tom Cruise,Cuba Gooding Jr,Kelly Preston,Bonnie Hunt,among others played there roles well,even the very well known child star Jonathan Lipnicki.However I do not like Renee Zellweger,I'm scene many films with her,where shes with a very talented cast,but I think shes a horrible actor,she doesn't seem to get in to her roles,all her characters are just Renee Zellweger,and if I was a director,I wouldn't be casting her for any role in my movies.A sports agent,Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is fired for expressing his true feelings.However one athlete,Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr) stays with him.Meanwhile,Jerry feels he has found true love in Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger).
Beauty And The Beast is an absolute classic from Disney,I saw the movie in theaters in its 3D re-release this week,I don't really care for 3D and didn't find the 3D in this great,but I went to see because it is a childhood favorite of mine,Be Our Guest is one of my favorite movie songs and Lumiere is one of my favorite cartoon characters.A girl named Belle is trapped away in a castle after saving her fathers life with a prince who has turned into a beast and his friends who turned into cups,candles,clocks,etc.,Belle doesn't like it there st first but the beast and Belle start to fall for each other,the items try to make sure it happens because the beast finding true love is the only way the spell can be broken.
Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a good movie with a storyline that gets a bit carried away with itself,but a strong cast and brilliant characters still make this movie watchable.I am not a huge fan of Star Trek,but every time I watch it I enjoy it,and I do understand why this movie would disappoint a lot of the die hard Star Trek fans,probably the most loyal fans on the planet.I found the story and some of the dialogue stupid at times,but I still enjoyed this movie because William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy still manage to deliver great performances as Captain Kirk and Spock.Trekkies will definitely be disappointed with their first big screen adventure and should probably just watch three episodes in a row instead,but I do feel people who enjoy sci-fi that aren't die hard fans could enjoy Star Trek: The Motion Picture a lot more.Captain Kirk leads the Starship Enterprise to put a stop to an entity on its way to Earth to find its creator.
Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory is a brilliant movie with a lovely storyline,a good cast and fantastic characters.This movie is one of my favourite movies from my childhood,I was looking through some of my old DVD's and when I saw this,I just had to watch it,and it still holds up really well today.I remember when my mom took me to see the Tim Burton remake,it was terrible,it loses all the heart we get in this movie.Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka is one of the greatest performances in any family movie ever.Fans of the beloved Roald Dahl children's book and people who enjoy feel good family movies will definitely enjoy this movie very much.When a competition occurs where only five people can win a chance to visit a famous chocolate factory,huge competition begins to win one of the five golden tickets in the chocolate bar.
American Psycho is a terrific movie with an extremely well developed storyline that is kept interesting and exciting all the way through and a really inspired performance from Christian Bale.I found it much more frightening to follow the psychopath rather than following a character who is going to be killed,it is much more frightening the go into the characters messed up mind and learn about the small and stupid things that make him want to kill people.Patrick Bateman is a great character,he was extremely unlikeable and it annoyed how he was getting away with all these murders,but thats how they wanted you to feel,and they did it very well.I would highly recommend American Psycho to all fans of thrillers and horror.By day,slick banker Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) lives a life of excess and style,but by night,lets his murderous alter ego out to play.
Super is a decent movie with a comedic set up (very similar to Kick Ass) that kind of falls flat and the comedy of a normal guy trying to be a superhero gets tiring after a while (unlike Kick Ass).The humour in this is very dark and some of the jokes are just way too vulgar and disgusting,and did laugh a good bit during the movie,but there are certainly no jokes that don't go too far,James Gunn clearly just wrote exactly what he felt like writing and got away with a lot of it.I had never heard of this previously,but I saw it on television and decided to watch it because I really like Rainn Wilson on the Office,and I found him to be the just enjoyable part of the movie,if you like Dwight Shrute then you'll like Frank Darbo,they but have the same kind of weird and unique personality.Super is funny at times,but if you prefer more easy to watch comedy like myself you should avoid it,but if you like very black comedy,this is definitely the movie for you.Frank Darbo (Rainn Wilson) dons a superhero garb and turns vigilante after his wife leaves him for another man.
Bewitched is a very mediocre movie with a promising storyline and a great cast that sadly both failed to be as good as they could have been.Firstly,I don't think this movie should have been about making a remake of Bewitched,it should have just simply been a movie reboot of the well known series Ferrell and Kidman would have done a much better job,I think personally,playing Samantha and Darrin rather than greedy actors that are playing them,also we wouldn't have to have constant jokes about the film industry,they clearly thought they were being clever and self aware but after a while it just got annoying.A lot of people complained about the lack of chemistry between Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman,but I honestly thought they worked quite well together and though I will admit they did not appear to be in love,they looked liked they enjoyed working together.Steve Carell's cameo was my favourite part of the whole movie,he was only beginning to make it big when this came out,but this brief appearance showed that he is a genuinely funny man,this scene and the obvious friendship between him and Ferrell was the only part that had me in stitches.It has some good moments,but honestly Bewitched is not a great or memorable comedy and I would only recommend it to you if it's ever on television and there is nothing else to watch. A real life witch trying to live a non-magical life is cast as Samantha in a TV remake of Bewitched.Best Performance: Steve Carell Worst Performance: Kristen Chenoweth If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris

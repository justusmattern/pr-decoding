Some of the best movies based on comics (like Ghost World or American Splendor) have nothing to do with super-heroes...and, like Whiteout shows us, some of the worst ones have nothing to do do with super-heroes either.11 years ago, the independent studio Oni Press published the graphic novel Whiteout, written by the then unknown Greg Rucka, who would later become a star in the comic media thanks to his remarkable work on more popular titles, like Wolverine or Batman.And even though I liked the focus Rucka took about those super-heroes very much, I have never read Whiteout, so I went to see the film adaptation without any kind of expectation, at the same time I could not judge its fidelity to its original source.Needless to say that after watching this pathetic movie, I do not have any interest in reading the graphic novel.I do not know if the following can be considered as a spoiler, but I decided to include it on this review, because I think it will make the movie more accessible to the people who expect something different (like I did): although the cold environment from Whiteout evokes horror and sci-fi films like The Thing, The Last Winter and Fritt Vilt, there are not any supernatural or fantasy elements in this film.The screenplay is in fact a typical and very predictable mystery, where the main character follows weak clues and her doubtful intuition to solve a crime and find the guilty of the increasing crime wave, at the same time we have the motivation from the villains and the expected "mcguffin" which pushes the story.The result is another tedious "thriller".Kate Beckinsale is a decent actress, but the screenplay is so poor that she cannot do anything with her character.The rest of the characters are the crude archetypes of the genre, from the heroin's mentor to the mysterious agent who collaborates on the investigation in spite of his suspicious attitude (played by Gabriel Macht, trying to make us forget about The Spirit).The screenplay is absolutely uninteresting and the conclusion is as bland and predictable as the rest of the movie.16 years ago, director Dominic Sena promised a lot with his phenomenal debut Kalifornia.However, after that, his career declined pretty much with two tedious movies (Gone in 60 Seconds -2000- and Swordfish) and now, Whiteout definitely marks the end of my interest in his career.I recommend you to stay far away from this movie.
The film Penelope has good intentions at offering us a picturesque fable which is full of colorful characters who learn valuable life lessons.But the main problem from this film is that the "Burton-esque" aesthetic from this film and its screenplay cannot capture all the magic the story requires,so the final experience is sympathetic and entertaining,but not completely satisfactory.The best element from Penelope is definitely the cast.Christina Ricci shows a lot of professionalism with her role,so she results credible.James McAvoy brings an expressive and detailed performance which makes us to get interested in his character.The great Peter Dinklage is perfect as the villain.And,finally,we also have solid performances from Reese Witherspoon and Russell Brand.Director Mark Palansky made a solid work on all the technical aspects from this movie.But,this film has various fails.The screenplay feels a little bit artificial and it has some moments which do not add anything relevant to the story.Besides,I think this film is a bit longer than what it needs to be,so near the ending,it feels a little bit tiring.In spite of those fails,I liked Pen√©lope.It is not too memorable,but it is a good option for spending time.
Approximately 20 years ago, writer Clive Barker melted my brain with The Books of Blood, collection on various volumes of his short stories, which came out of nowhere and were immediately acclaimed as a watershed on literary fantastic genre.In The Books of Blood, Barker showed that the brutal violence could perfectly be endorsed by brilliant stories and that the most grotesque descriptions of human and supernatural horrors are much more terrifying when they are expressed on an almost poetic language.I think that everyone is gonna have his/her favorite Barker's story from The Books of Blood; in my case, that one is In the Hills, The Cities, but The Midnight Meat Train is on a very close second position.Because of that, I had a bit of awe on its film adaptation, but the fact that Barker approved it and that it was directed by Ryuhei Kitamura (who made the very entertaining films Versus and Godzilla: Final Wars) made me have a bit of optimism on it.The result was an interesting and entertaining movie, but which is not very memorable and has some important fails.The best element from this film is definitely Vinnie Jones' performance, which is really brilliant.The intensity on his face and his body language bring perfect life to his character.In summary, Jones definitely increases the quality of the movie.In the leading role, Bradley Cooper feels a bit bland.I do not think he is a bad actor; he was adequate as a "sidekick" on the TV series Alias and he showed an excellent instinct for the comedy in The Hangover.However, he does not seem to be very interested in his character in The Midnight Meat Train.Besides of Cooper, there are some important fails on the screenplay.As it always happens when a short story is adapted to cinema, the screenwriter must "pump up" the story in order to get the average running time on contemporary cinema of 100-120 minutes.Some elements on the screenplay work well, like for example the discussions about the main character's career as a photographer, the relationship he has with his girlfriend Maya and some philosophical dialogs he has with his friend Jurgis.But I think the screenplay lost the main point from the short story.I will not reveal it in order not to say spoilers, but the historical and cultural punch with which Barker concluded the short story is reduced to some generic sequences of horror and violence, which lead us to a moderately satisfactory ending but which does not have enough substance to endorse the twist at the end.If I had to compare The Midnight Meat Train with other film adaptations of Barker's works, I would consider it superior to Nightbreed, at the same level of Lord of Illusions and very below of Hellraiser.It may not be highly memorable, but I can recommend The Midnight Meat Train because it made me have a good time in spite of its fails.
I was not very interested in watching Seeking Justice but I decided to risk myself, because the publicity and the title suggested a typical tale of personal revenge in the purest style of B cinema, and besides, Nicolas Cage can be a good actor whenever he wants to. To my surprise, the film ended up defying my low expectations with a screenplay which is more ambitious than I expected, and even though it eventually tangles itself too much for its own good, I never found it boring or predictable.I found the concept of Seeking Justice very interesting...something like an hybrid thriller, built with parts from Fight Club, Straw Dogs and Strangers on a Train. The combination works pretty well until the half of the film, when we get into conspiracy fields which quickly become confusing, improbable and even a bit ridiculous. However, Roger Donaldson's dynamic direction avoids the movie from getting boring. Cage makes a credible work in the leading role, and he is well complemented by the solid performances from January Jones and Guy Pearce.So, I would say that the screenplay from Seeking Justice is simultaneously its main pro and its main obstacle, because it starts with an interesting idea, it develops it well for a while, but it looses the course and the narrative focus during the second half, until leading to an excessively convenient ending.Anyway, I had a good time while watching Seeking Justice, and I consider it worthy of a moderate recommendation. However, if you wanna watch better movies about revenge, I recommend you Oldboy, both versions of I Spit on Your Grave or Death Wish. Nevertheless, I liked Seeking Justice despite its fails, and it was better than I expected.
I know that Avatar: The Last Airbender is a very popular animated series, but I have never had too much interest in it and I have only seen a few episodes.So, I cannot evaluate the fidelity the film adaptation The Last Airbender has to that TV series.Nevertheless, faithful or not, The Last Airbender is an atrocious film which wastes resources in an incoherent, badly structured and poorly told story.I do not know if the problem was that director and screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan tried to introduce too many mythology and characters in the film, or if the original material is so complicated that it looses coherence at being adapted on this way.The point is that the story wanders lazily, without any impulse or rhythm in order to involve us on its structure.In the tradition of the worst adaptations, The Last Airbender seems to have been constructed around obligatory points which must be visited, even though the way of coherently joining them is not found.And besides of all that, we have the multiple holes and forced drama from the screenplay: How many times is hero kidnapped by the villains, only to escape in the most ridiculous way? Did the hero need to consult a mystic dragon to know he must use water in order to fight against fire? Well, the list of goofs like that is too long.The action scenes feel slow and listless.For example, the first time the hero impulses a rebellion against the fire tribe should provoke excitement and joy, but the sequence is so weakly orchestrated that it only provokes sarcasm for its obvious artificiality...what takes me to Shyamalan and his declining career.With every new film, this director is increasingly away from the standard he established with The Sixth Sense.However, I had the slight hope that The Last Airbender was going to be better than the tedious The Happening and the mediocre Lady in the Water, which had both disappointed me pretty much.Nevertheless, his career bottomed with The Last Airbender, at the same time he shows that he lacks of the appropriate sensibility to balance action, adventure and philosophy (or whatever you wanna call the frequent speeches about responsibility and destiny which "adorn" the screenplay).In other words, Shyamalan shows that he has lost every narrative talent in this movie.The special effects are quite good, but I felt pity to see that they are trapped in such bad movie, which does not have even a pinch of excitement or the most basic emotions to get us interested in story or the destiny from the hollow characters.And what can I say about the performances? They are all authentically pathetic.For you to understand how bad this movie is (if you have not seen it yet), I have to say that I found the deplorable Dragonball: Evolution to be less bad (I cannot say "better") than The Last Airbender.So, needless to say that I do not recommend this vomiting movie.
I liked the films Spy Kids and Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams very much because they captured the tone and sensibility of the best family cinema, naughty and subversive but without falling into the vulgarity and without insulting the audience's intelligence. However, I think the third film of the saga (Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over) stretched the concept too much and lost the focus on the characters, making them lose any grace. Now, the fourth film Spy Kids: All the Time in the World tried to resurrect the franchise with a new family of spies, some characters we already knew and a potentially creative screenplay which did not end up being as ingenious as it could have been. The final result is an entertaining, but not very memorable family film, which is very superior to the third one of the saga, but very inferior to the first two ones.The actors from Spy Kids: All the Time in the World make a good work in their roles, starting by the kids Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook, who are likable and spontaneous. Jessica Alba and Joel McHale have a good chemistry with each other, and also feel natural and credible, without exaggerating the humor moments nor forcing their emotions during the obligatory scenes of family conflict (Oh, no! The father works a lot and doesn't have any time to be with his sons! The kids miss their biological mom and resent the arrival of their father's new wife!). I generally don't like Alba's performances, but I have to admit she made a competent work in here. However, what I most liked in Spy Kids: All the Time in the World is the dog Argonaut, in part because of the animal's charm and ability, and in part because of Ricky Gervais' energetic voice work.As for Robert Rodriguez's direction in here, it feels kinda impersonal; like if Spy Kids: All the Time in the World was only a clause in his contract with Dimension Films, or a quick source of funding for him to make a movie in which he is more interested. Nevertheless, I had a good time while watching Spy Kids: All the Time in the World despite not being very memorable, and I can give it a moderate recommendation as a casual entertainment to spend a pleasant time with the whole family. But if you wanna see genuinely creative family cinema, I recommend you the first two films of this saga, or the underrated Shorts, which was also directed by Rodriguez.
Due to his erratic behavior and inappropriate comments, Mel Gibson's days as a Hollywood star have finished (even though, on the other hand, he's more popular than ever as an object of jokes and parodies). The films from his filmography, which once were big box office successes, are currently ignored by most of the people. However, his recent work in Edge of Darkness, The Beaver and Get the Gringo proves that Gibson keeps being a solid actor. As for Get the Gringo as a film, I found it entertaining, but not very memorable.I usually think it's a mistake to take the cinema as a didactic tool, but even like that, I think Get the Gringo opened my eyes regarding the Mexican penitentiary system. I suppose that not every jail is like the fictitious Pueblito, but I suspect that the level of corruption is pretty close to reality, and because of that, I found this film more interesting for its social setting and environment than for the main character's adventures. Having said that, I liked the labyrinth of hierarchies, motivations and secrets revealed through the movie, as well as the picturesque characters which are perfectly played by the whole cast, highlighting Kevin Hern√°ndez. As for Gibson, he's credible in his role, and he also makes his character likable.On the negative side, I found Get the Gringo better in concept than in execution. Some of the twists made by the screenplay display moderate ingenuity and narrative creativity; unfortunately, we also find too many coincidences and improbable elements which contradict the "border logic" from the film (for example, I could never swallow the reasons why the "owners" of the jail decided to keep the main character alive; it seems that their only motivation is: "If we kill him, the movie is over"). Besides, some moments of humor (such as Clint Eastwood's imitation) feel out of place in such a raw film, which isn't afraid of hurting sensibilities with its representation of Mexican justice. Nevertheless, despite those complaints, I had a good time while watching Get the Gringo, mainly because of Adrian Grunberg's efficient direction and the good performances, and I think that makes it worthy of a moderate recommendation.
Independently from the utility, relevance and quality from this remake, I will say something: I felt a chill all over my body when I saw the words "A Hammer Films Production" in the screen. I could not avoid it; the films from that British studio substantially contributed to the obsession with horror cinema I developed during my childhood. And now, various decades later, I liked to see that name associated again with my favorite genre (even though it was only a distributor, and even though it never disappeared actually). End of the nerd's speech. Now, let's move on the subject which concerns us: the film Let Me In, a competent but unnecessary remake of the brilliant Swedish film Let the Right One In.I would put Let Me In at the same level of Quarantine or Dark Water: North American remakes which have a certain level of intrinsic quality despite the questionable reasons which motivated their making. In other words, I think Let Me In is a solid horror movie on its own merit, with a good atmosphere, some well achieved moments of suspense and excellent performances from Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee (who had both already left me astonished in Kick-Ass and The Road, respectively). On the other side of the coin, I have to mention a few scenes which try to startle us with bad special effects and cheap thrills.In conclusion, Let Me In is a good movie (but if I have to talk about recommendations, my absolute suggestion would be for you to watch the original film), but which suffers from the "Hollywood Syndrome", supposing that the spectators are idiots, and that because of that, it has to explain everything and leave nothing to the imagination, because otherwise we would not understand it (for example: instead of letting the spectator to deduct that the film is set during the 80's, the screenplay feels obliged to say that from the beginning and, just in case we did not understand it, it fills various scenes with relics from that decade, including Ms. Pac-Man, Ronald Reagan, Culture Club and the song Turning Japanese; and if it does that with the historical context, which is not very relevant, imagine what it does with more relevant stuff, like the relationship between one of the main characters and her "father"; wow, what a long parenthesis). So, Let Me In is not a bad movie, and I moderately enjoyed it while I was watching it; however, that does not avoid me from considering it unnecessary: why trying to fix something which is not broken?
The Green Hornet is one of the best superhero films I have seen in a long time. It might not be perfect, but it kept me hugely entertained the whole time, and not only because of the evident funny elements from the screenplay, but also because of the irreverent intelligence co-screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and director Michel Gondry brought to this movie, which will undoubtedly be misunderstood by many people.This is the interpretation I have about this film: The Green Hornet is a parody of the superheroes cinema, and at the same time, it is a tribute which takes the clich√©s from the genre seriously. Or, better said, it does not take them seriously, but it puts them into a context in which they seem real. That context is an absurd comedy full of immature and narcissistic characters; the humor which comes from it is almost accidental. What matters is that Gondry, Goldberg and Rogen understand that the teenage fantasies on which the superhero fantasies are based can only subsist into a comical environment, and they risk themselves to follow that policy to the last consequences. For example, Batman Begins is an extraordinary movie, but it requires us to take a considerable leap of faith for us to accept the existence of a millionaire disguised as a bat. In The Green Hornet, we do not have to take a leap of faith, because when everything else is absurd, the character naturally fits into the surrealistic environment. And those who have seen the previous movies directed by Gondry (Human Nature, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Science of Sleep and Be Kind, Rewind) will know that the surrealism is this filmmaker's natural environment.Rogen's and Goldberg's work as screenwriters reminded me a little bit of Kevin Smith, because they seem to be so in love with their monologues and diatribes that they introduce long and repetitive scenes only because they cannot stay silent, or because an additional joke which makes the spectator to smile came to their minds. That may not seem as a very convenient strategy, specially in an action movie...but on some way, that works very well in this movie, because after all, the "real" plot (in other words, the conflict between The Green Hornet and the neurotic villain Chudnofsky -very well interpreted by Christoph Waltz-) is not the axis from the film. On the contrary, the most important thing in this movie is the chemistry between The Green Hornet and his assistant Kato, as well as the relationship they develop with each other during the movie. Someone who is also involved in that equation is Cameron Diaz, because even though her character has a relatively short screen time (she takes half an hour more or less to appear in the movie, and she later tends to disappear for long periods of time), her scenes are essential and very entertaining. I do not want to reveal very much, but I liked the way in which Rogen and Goldberg make her an integral part of the "heroic duet" without making her to be a simple damsel in danger or frivolous visual attraction.In conclusion, I had a fascinating time watching The Green Hornet, and I took a very pleasant surprise with it; I just think you need to find the correct angle in order to enjoy it. And sure, I understand the reason why some people consider it to be an epic fail which betrayed the potential from the character. But personally, I liked this movie very much.
Based on a novel written by S.J. Watson (which I haven't read), Before I Go to Sleep introduces its premise with a moderate ingenuity. Unfortunately, that ingenuity decays considerably as the film goes by, and when the "big revelation" comes, I found out that I wasn't very interested in knowing who "the good one" was and who "the evil one". And we also have Rowan Joffe's poor direction, forced performances from Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth and a screenplay which obviously condensed the novel too much, creating many holes and rushing passages which might have needed more time to feel credible, or at least, not as illogical. Thinking about it well, the main problem might be the fact that the story only works inside the artificial universe the film built for its own benefit, where the cops don't show up until they are necessary, the technology works only like the screenplay says so and the four relevant characters don't require interaction with anybody who could ruin the delicate balance of credulity, coincidences and paranoia which feeds the film. And last but not least, we also have a bland and almost corny ending. In conclusion, I can't recommend Before I Go to Sleep, because I felt it like a genuine waste of time. Besides, it seems I caught the main character's amnesia, because I finished watching it one hour ago, and I already struggle to remember it.
Like almost every single fairy tale, the original story from Rapunzel has an abundant level of cruelty and violence before reaching to the happy ending. The studio Disney naturally cleaned that story in order to make it more consistent with its current branding, and the final result is the film Tangled, which takes the most basic elements from the famous fairy tale (a princess with a very long hair who is trapped into a tower) and reinterprets them in a generic adventure story with apparatus action scenes, innocent romance and bland musical sequences. In other words, Tangled is another pre-fabricated animation film; however, I have to say it ended up being a bit better than I expected thanks to the likable voice acting, excellent animation...and also some narrative elements.I am honestly not bothered by the changes the screenplay from Tangled makes to the original story. What I did not like very much is that those changes were only made in order to adjust to the typical scheme from Disney. I would have also liked the songs to have more personality, the comedy to be funnier and the general tone from the movie to be less generic. However, Tangled kept me moderately entertained mainly thanks to the characters and some narrative elements which had a certain level of deepness. Besides, I liked to see that Tangled was not another poor imitation of Pixar or DreamWorks, like some recent animated films from Disney were.So, in conclusion, I found Tangled to be a mediocre animated film, but it did not bore me, and I appreciated that it did not treat the kids like idiots. And because of that, I think it deserves a slight recommendation.
I'm not a fan of director Lars von Trier's, but I like some of his films; however, other ones left me deeply irritated because of their obvious symbolism, which was combined with such exaggerated artistic pretensions that they end up feeling like accidental jokes. Or are they accidental? I have honestly never been able to determine whether the flamboyance from films such as Antichrist and Dogville, as well as von Trier's pro-Nazi statements and his self-proclaim as "the best director of the world", are due to an out-of-control ego, or to crafty jokes at the expense of the media and the North American cinematographic industry. On the other hand, when von Trier knows what he's doing, he can make films of an unusual emotional and narrative strength (Dancer in the Dark and Idioterne come to mind). But whenever his "internal diva" gets out of control, he ends up making films such as Melancholia.It's quite easy to figure out that Melancholia (the film) is an examination about depression, with Melancholia (the fictitious planet) as an obvious metaphor about the anxiety and apathy which affect the victims suffering of that condition. And the film also offers some images of an impressive beauty. However, it's a pity that those elements were included in such a tedious and irritating movie as Melancholia. The worst part of this film is definitely the horrible scene of the wedding, which lasts for 1 hour, and made me consider taking the DVD off. And what is more, I found the characters from Melancholia totally hateful.The fans of art-house cinema will surely acclaim Melancholia as a ferociously personal film which crowns von Trier's filmography. However, I think Melancholia is a clear example of "the emperor's new clothes", so I will limit myself to say that, by my humble point of view, von Trier is naked, but nobody wants to accept it. I wouldn't consider Melancholia a bad film; however, in my personal experience, it was intolerable, despite some beautiful images and having a few moderately interesting ideas.
We are accustomed to see family films which try to sell us an "attitude", a McDonald's Happy Meal, or a rancid moral lesson which only exists in order to disguise the commercialism of their authentic intention.So, it was truly refreshing for me to see a movie like Where the Wild Things Are, whose main strength does not reside on special effects, but on its reflexive tone and rich narrative, which is not afraid of approaching the complex vicissitudes in the life of a boy who is lost between the comfortable indiscipline from childhood and the disturbing realities of maturity with seriousness.In other words, Where the Wild Things Are ended up being a unique and absolutely memorable film experience.I have recently been complaining of all those family movies about boys who travel to a magic kingdom to discover they are in fact "special" pretty much.Where the Wild Things Are basically follows that formula, but it is so different on form and substance that it deserves to belong to a different category in order to reflect its unusual combination of honesty, intelligence and melancholy better.I think we could even consider it as a "family movie for adults".Thinking about it well, I do not think it is even a family movie; I think it would be more appropriate to describe it as an hypnotic psychological study of a child's mind.It was hugely satisfactory for me to find such a mature movie like this one, which relies on screenplay and atmosphere instead of in conventional humor and over-designed action scenes.The screenplay from this film is truly phenomenal, because it is full of fascinating emotional and narrative layers; the special effects are really extraordinary; and the Australian rugged settings perfectly complement the organic and elegant production design.In summary, Where the Wild Things Are deserves a totally enthusiastic recommendation, because it is unfortunately not very frequent to find a masterpiece such as this one.This film has definitely earned a place in my list of favorite movies, so I hope as many people as possible discover this gem.
In 1982, the computers and the videogames were phenomenons which were new enough to have a certain aura of mystery...like if they were windows to a future with huge potential but diffuse shape, something which was not easy to assimilate by most of the people. In that context, the film Tron captured my imagination with a fantasy which was a bit absurd (anthropomorphic people living heroic lives and high levels of drama in the interior of the "mainframe") but also accessible to those of us who vaguely comprehended the complexities from the rising digital world. Now, almost 30 years later, we have millions of people interconnected with each other, practically living their lives inside that "digital frontier", which is infinitely dynamic and in a constant expansion. How would that evolution affect to the elegant and austere grid from Tron in its sequel, Tron: Legacy? Unfortunately, this second part decided to discard the ideas which were sown in the first movie, by only focusing on the visual upgrade in order to bring us a predictable and conventional heroic fantasy; anyway, I cannot deny I found this sequel to be visually attractive. In summary, Tron: Legacy is another example of style over substance which wastes the opportunity of reaching the visionary level from the first film.I understand the fact that Tron: Legacy is a Disney movie designed to attract as many spectators as possible, but I think that films such as Inception, The Matrix and District 9 proved that a solid screenplay is not an enemy of the economic success. So, I was disappointed to find a predictable and insubstantial screenplay in Tron: Legacy, which has a few interesting ideas there is not too much time to explore because the fights in slow motion, the chases and other clich√©s from action cinema have the priority. I am not going to deny that those frantic scenes kept me moderately entertained; but the experience would have been much more satisfactory if it had been endorsed by a screenplay that would challenge our imagination, or that would make us think with innovative concepts extrapolated from the digital reality we are living every day of our lives. And that would have not been too difficult, because a small part from the huge budget from this movie could have been used to pay for the advice of brilliant "splatterpunk" writers like, for example, William Gibson, Rudy Rucker or Bruce Sterling. It would have not been even necessary that they had written the screenplay; it would have been enough if they were paid to provide some juicy ideas which would have worked as a support of the drama and which would have made the action to be less frivolous and gratuitous.Tron: Legacy does not have the logic from the authentic science fiction, but the one from Hollywood, in which the hero can overcome to any obstacle on the basis of simple attitude and "coolness", at the same time he falls in love with a girl and solves his "daddy issues" with the father who abandoned him years ago. And of course, every scene of introspection or emotional openness ends with a lot of action in order to recover the attention from those who were getting bored with the tremulous dialogs about the "perfect world", or the parental abandonment. And I found some moments to be boring, specially those long and useless semi-dramatic monologues with few relevance to the story, and which do not even help to the character development, because the actors do not seem to be very interested in their characters. The only exceptions are Jeff Bridges and Michael Sheen, who are the only ones who bring energy and conviction to their characters.The visual aspect from Tron: Legacy is pretty good, and its 3D technique works very well, not exactly for feeling very "real" (like for example it did on Avatar), but because its abstract dichromatic world combines with the 3D well. There are many scenes of a doubtful narrative utility (for example, an air combat near the ending) but with an indubitable aesthetic value. Nevertheless, nothing of that compensates the various inconsistencies from the screenplay (for example: Why does it rain in the digital world? Why can't the villains make infinite copies of the information they desperately need? Why do the physical abilities from the characters change so arbitrarily according to the level of suspense required by the scene?) or the weak ending, which is simultaneously simplistic, anti-climatic and confusing and which tries to solve the huge logical holes it implies with emotions. However, I have to admit that the visual aspect and the action scenes were enough to keep me moderately entertained in general during Tron: Legacy, so I think I can give a slight recommendation to it.
I decided to see Planet 51 because I thought it could offer an entertaining tribute to the sci-fi genre.And even though the film offers many references to classics from the genre, I found the humor to be painfully primitive, not to mention its story is so bland, predictable and boring that detracts the solid work of animation, which may not reach the heights of Pixar or DreamWorks, but it still is well done.This movie has too many generic elements, like for example the subjects about self-improvement and friendship and touches of a forced romance.The direction is absolutely insipid, the voice acting is weak and the humor is extremely irritating.Oh, and we also have to add the unfortunately popular practice of extending trivial events and becoming them into forced action sequences, in a desperate effort to rescue the movie.Co-directors Jorge Blanco, Javier Abad and Marcos Mart√≠nez and screenwriter Joe Stillman did not take any risks with this film, and they finished making such an inoffensive product which lacks of any emotion, suspense or humor.It is a shame that the work of many animators was wasted on an uninteresting story based on decrepit formulas.So, with the exception of the technical aspect, there are not good elements on this horrible animation film.Do not waste your time on this absolutely boring movie.
During the '90s, I was amazed by the innovative visual aesthetic employed by director Tarsem Singh in some video-clips and commercials. However, when Singh finally directed a movie, it ended up being a narrative disaster, even though I cannot deny that it included impressive images that are still in my memory. Some people thought that the visual style of The Cell was enough to make it a good movie, but I am not one of them. And now, his film Immortals also bored my very much, despite having some visually attractive images.I guess that when Singh and co-screenwriters Charley and Vlas Parlapanides watched 300, they took it as a personal affront and as a challenge to surpass it in every sense. And that's what they tried with Immortals...another rehash of the "peplum" genre filtered through an hyper-artistic and elaborate sensibility, which did not feel satisfied with itself until every pixel from the screen was opulently over-designed, and every fight was choreographed in slow-motion, with a morbid attention to every stream of blood and every muscle of the Greek warriors who, in different circumstances, would not feel out of place as backup dancers in some Lady Gaga's video-clip.As for the screenplay, we can expect the usual formulas employed by an end in themselves, and not as tools in order to tell a coherent story. Unfortunately, the Parlapanides bros. show such few interest in the characters development that even the most bombastic clich√©s feel bland and lacking of energy.Now, I have to express my fear of seeing Henry Cavill as Superman next year. He definitely has an athletic body...but even in the most intense scenes of Immortals, he looks like a cardboard cutout, absolutely incapable of transmitting his emotions to the spectator. The rest of the actors (with the exception of John Hurt) only limits itself to say their lines without any enthusiasm or conviction.In conclusion, despite the visual attraction, I found Immortals tedious, and I really feel like having wasted my time with it, so I cannot recommend it.
I know, I know...I voluntarily went to see Grown Ups, even knowing it was another comedy starring Adam Sandler, who I usually cannot stand.I knew what was expecting me.So, what am I complaining about? I will tell you: I complain because I try to be as objective as possible (even though I do not always achieve it), and I think a film deserves the opportunity of being evaluated by its own achievements and fails.Sure, that attitude is balanced by the unavoidable expectations created by my previous experiences with a same actor, director or genre.So, accepting the fact that it is impossible for me to be completely objective, at least I have to give the movie the chance to defense itself, and the best way of doing that is paying in order to see it.And in the case of Grown Ups, I regret having done that.As horrible as the comparison sounds, Grown Ups pretends to be a modern version of the brilliant film The Big Chill, but with jokes about urine and obesity.Its cast includes talented comedians, who are Colin Quinn, Tim Meadows, David Spade, Kevin James and the great Chris Rock.My hope before watching Grown Ups was that their work was going to raise a little bit the quality of the movie, but unfortunately, that did not happen...Sandler's malignant aura infected all the actors, and it put them at his same level of clowning, which provokes more irritation than laughs.And a factor which was obviously introduced in order to attract more spectators is the presence of cute actresses.However, not even the good looks from Salma Hayek, Maria Bello and Madison Riley were enough to compensate the atrocious screenplay.Talking about the screenplay, I found it to be boring and painfully insipid.We have the obligatory rude old lady, precocious kids, immature adults and a loser whose wife could be his mother...or his grandma.I have the impression that Sandler simply reunited his friends to have a good time, film some twaddle and sell it as a "summer movie".Co-screenwriters Sandler and Fred Wolf did not even bother to tell a real story, so the whole movie is only a parade of unconnected and unfunny vignettes which do not lead to anywhere.In summary, I hope you have a better common sense than me and avoid this execrable movie.Please, learn from my mistakes; at least like that they will be useful for something.
There isn't any other possible description: Act of Valor is basically a recruitment video for the North American Navy, extended to 110 minutes and starred by authentic seals. Its screenplay is based on true missions faced by the different Seal Teams around the world; and, in order to bring it some dramatic cohesion, we have a narrative about international terrorism. However, despite its obvious demagogic intention, I found Act of Valor a very competent action film which is quite satisfactory regarding violence, realism and suspense.Even though Act of Valor employs a few professional actors (such as Roselyn S√°nchez and N√©stor Serrano), most of the cast is composed by real seals, and that's why the performances feel a bit weak. On the other hand, the brilliant cinematography and the solid direction bring an intense realism to Act of Valor, making it have a semi-documentary tone which increments the suspense and transports us to the chaos of combat, the tension of the infiltrations inside enemy territory, and the frenzy of the shootouts against international mercenaries.Screenwriter Kurt Johnstad took the good decision of building a simple story with perfectly defined heroes and villains, leaving no place to any moral ambiguity, even whenever the marines illegally get into foreign territory and casually violate the sovereignty of a country which homes terrorists. That tacit varnish of hegemony and North American interventionism might alienate the spectators who can't completely swallow the crude ultra-patriotic rhetoric from Act of Valor; but viewing it only as an action film, I think the film offers an exciting and very entertaining experience.As for the function of Act of Valor as a recruitment tool, it shouldn't surprise us, because Hollywood has a long tradition of cooperating with the government when some "inspiration" is needed for young men without an aim who could find a new purpose in their idle lives if they join the army, specially when they see Tom Cruise flying fighters and seducing Kelly McGillis in Top Gun; or in this occasion, watching the marines' exploits shown as levels of Battlefield or multi-player modes from Call of Duty. Anyway, I might not share that ideology, but I definitely enjoyed Act of Valor pretty much because of its relentless energy, agile style and fluid direction.
I thought that Horrible Bosses was going to be another rancid dose of vulgar comedy full of immature characters, who seem to come out from a workshop of improvised comedy of from a sketch which was rejected by the producers from Saturday Night Live. However, Horrible Bosses ended up featuring more realistic characters and a different sense of humor, darker and more sardonic, mixed with narrative elements which almost make the movie a light thriller. But don't misunderstand me...the characters are still idiots (not in Will Ferrell's style, but in Steve Carell's), and there is certainly scatological humor. But I liked to see that co-screenwriters Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein offered something different to the "man-kids" which infest the modern comedy for adults. I will not deny the fact that there are some good movies from that category, but its creativity hole is quickly drying.I will not say that Horrible Bosses is an authentic thriller, but it kept me in suspense during big part of the story, because I really did not know how it would end. The premise is well handled, and the ending is satisfactory, although a bit convenient. Unfortunately, this movie's good parts are interspersed with moments of crude and forced comedy which violently crash with the initial tone from the story. As an example, I can point out the endless sequence in which the friends surreptitiously enter into the home from one of the bosses. They seemed reasonably "normal" people up to that point; they might not were geniuses, but they were not buffoons either...until the slapstick routine begins, and Markowitz, Daley and Goldstein decided to throw any prudence through the window by making one of the friends introducing himself elements into his butt, other one accidentally taking drugs and the other one getting constantly startled with a furious cat. Some of those routines made me laugh, but they feel out of place and they look like last-minute additions in oder to make the movie naughtier and less dark.As for the cast, I think its only weak spot is Charlie Day, who I found over the top and forced in his character. On the opposite, I liked the performances from Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis very much. Kevin Spacey brings a very good performance which reminded me of the one he brought in the underrated Swimming With Sharks. Colin Farrell has a relatively short screen-time, but his work is perfect, and one of the highlights from the film. And Jennifer Aniston is totally credible in a character which makes her explore a new histrionic field.In conclusion, I had a good time while watching Horrible Bosses, and I can recommend it for that despite not being a highly memorable experience, and the fact that I would have preferred a more consistent screenplay.
Killer Elite is a mediocre action film, but I have to admit that it kept me moderately entertained at least, mainly because of the performances from Jason Statham, Clive Owen and Robert De Niro.On some way, I appreciated the methodic rhythm from Killer Elite, as well as the gradual introduction of characters, more intrigue and more hidden intentions. However, there comes a time when the screenplay gets excessively complicated, to the point in which came a moment when it was impossible for me to cypher who is working for who, who the "bad guys" are and who the "good ones" are. Thinking it well, the screenplay from Killer Elite might not have "good guys" in the conventional sense; all the characters in this movie are killers because of the friendship, the patriotism or the money. But after all, that ends up not being very important, because even though screenwriter Matt Sherring tried to transcend the pre-fabricated drama we usually find in this kind of cinema, the unnecessary turns and twists from the screenplay end up clouding any moral advantage the characters could have. I do not think it is bad whenever an action movie makes us think (in fact, I find it more satisfactory), but if we have to take down notes and draw diagrams to understand the story, I think the movie failed on the narrative aspect.Besides, I think that the historical period from the story is absolutely useless. On the beginning, I thought that the '80s setting would be justified by relating the movie with some socio-political event from that time, but it was only an excuse to employ a "retro" style in the cars, clothes and other aspects from the production design.However, as I mentioned on the first paragraph, the 3 main actors are what mainly make the movie moderately entertaining and worthy of a slight recommendation. The action scenes do not feel very exciting, while the screenplay stumbles too many times with its own anti-logic (Was it really necessary to organize a super-secret meeting in the middle of the desert only in order to exchange a mallet? Yes, a mallet); but Statham, Owen and De Niro are perfect as tough men defying the danger, chasing each other and competing with each other to see who has the most threatening look. Because of them, and some interesting elements from the screenplay, this movie did not bore me.
The career from director Roman Polanski includes movies which are acclaimed as classics from modern cinema, and even though I do not have any doubt about the artistic and cultural value from Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby and Repulsion, my personal taste leans to the modest thrillers he made (Frantic, The Ninth Gate).And The Ghost Writer is an addition to that group, because I found it to be a tense and perfectly modulated thriller with a fascinating and intelligent story, excellent performances and a perfect direction from Polanski, who seems to improve with the age, at the difference of other icons who survive thanks to their past glories (Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Spielberg come to mind).The plot summary from The Ghost Writer may sound as a bit dry to some people, but as well as Polanski made the world of the book collectors fascinating in The Ninth Gate, he again shows his expertise to drive a deceptively simple story, whose unexpected twists and hidden secrets are revealed at the same time the characters win detail and deepness.This kind of "simmer" suspense cinema is much more elegant and efficient that the thrillers focused on action, chases and shootouts (translation: Hollywood cinema).So, the result is an intelligent, narratively satisfactory and absolutely fascinating thriller.Nevertheless, the other side of the coin is that the movie is built on the basis of dialogs, data and deduction, something which could make it boring to some people.In other words, instead of quick escapes by car, we have a deliciously tense drive with the help of a satellite navigator; in the absence of explosions, we have discussions which are so full of passion that they seem equally lethal; and the only special effects I think to have seen are subtle auxiliaries to disguise the German locations and become them into the island of Martha's Vineyard, in the United States, where Polanski cannot go due to his notorious legal problem.I think Ewan McGregor is one of the best contemporary actors, because his great talent allows him to keep the same level of credibility and solid performances in any kind of cinematographic genres and styles, from romantic comedy (Down With Love) and historical drama (Miss Potter) to Hollywood blockbusters (The Island) and bizarre art-house cinema (The Pillow Book).His work in The Ghost Writer is truly flawless, and besides of his, I also liked the performances from Olivia Williams, Pierce Brosnan, Tom Wilkinson and Kim Cattrall very much.Even James Belushi brings a competent performance as the main character's ambitious and inflexible boss.Oh, and I cannot forget to mention the interesting parallels between the fictitious character of the "ex-Prime Minister Adam Lang" and the real ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair.It is obvious that author Robert Harris, who wrote the book The Ghost Writer is based on, resented the unconditional support offered by Blair to the North Americans during the invasion to Iraq, and even though the controversial dignitary was not accused of war crimes, some elements from the story look like direct denounces of what could have happened.But well...with or without political content, The Ghost Writer is a magnificent thriller which could be described as "hitchcockian"...but which also has Polanski's characteristic seal.Needless to say, I very enthusiastically recommend this perfect movie.If only we could have more thrillers like this one...
14 years ago, the film Gattaca revealed director and screenwriter Andrew Niccol as a filmmaker interested in genuine science fiction, based on fascinating ideas and not on simple scenes of futuristic action. Later, Niccol made the interesting Simone and the excellent Lord of War. However, I think that In Time, his most recent film, is the first misstep in his filmography, because its vaguely creative premise crumbles due to a poorly built and executed screenplay.The main problem from In Time is that the universe built by Niccol is excessively improbable, absurd and full of arbitrary and incomprehensible rules. In other words, the premise from this film does not work as the livelihood of a narrative at all.And besides of that hard-to-swallow premise, we have weak narrative mechanics, the inscrutable motivations from the characters (the heroes as well as the villains) and the failed dramatic moments (not to mention the romantic ones) which are not able to provoke even the slightest level of emotion (except for involuntary laughs, in the worst of the cases). In general, In Time left me with the impression of having been conceived during a drunken night from Niccol, in which he said: "What if we had to pay with our remaining time of life instead of with money?" And a friend of his (who was equally intoxicated) replied: "Hey! That's really deep! You should write a movie about that". However, Niccol refused to hear the opinion from the friend of his who was not drunk, who asked: "But, how would that economy work? What society would accept to receive an absolute time of expiration? And how would that be possible from the organic point of view?". Then, Niccol made the fatal mistake of answering like this: "What does it matter? It's science fiction...I can do whatever I want!".I think that that arrogance made In Time to sink. Its development is composed by "cool" scenes which do not resist even the slightest logical analysis. As examples, I can mention: the poker game (or whatever it is), in which the life is literally played (The hero's big plan is based on an impossible luck strike?); the ride through "time zones" which goes from ghettos for poor people to elite enclaves for the rich ones (Where the hell do the cooks, gardeners and stylists from the powerful ones live?); the car chase between two beautiful classic cars (How can the hero drive on such an expert way when he could barely pay for his bus ticket a few hours before?). All those elements are combined in order to make In Time a movie which is the exact opposite of the genuine science fiction...stupid when it pretends to be smart, conventional when it pretends to be innovative, and lacking of any emotion during its "exciting" moments.As for the leading actors, Justin Timberlake feels absolutely forced, while Amanda Seyfried brings a credible performance. However, despite her competent work, I cannot recommend In Time, because it is a boring and poor sci-fi film.
Around 10 years ago,the Asian interpretation of horror cinema changed the face of the genre,and its influence keeps being felt on our days.However,its simple formula and limited iconography helped to its eventual obsolesce,with imitators all around the world copying its subjects and situations till saturating many people (like me).And maybe because of that,some parts of the world tried to make different interpretations of horror cinema as an answer to the Asian style.What takes us directly to France.This country is currently the leader of vanguard horror producing movies of unusual audacity and inventiveness,which present solid ideas and messages under their grotesque violence.As an excellent example of that,we have the movie Inside,a ruthless movie which is not afraid of showing absolutely disturbing scenes of violence which,at difference of movies like Hostel,Captivity or Vacancy,have a very big emotional impact on the spectator.Revealing too much about this movie is absolutely forbidden,so that one can appreciate to the maximum its twisted revelations and unexpected ending.This movie is a brilliant combination between psychological and visceral horror.On the one hand,this film creates an excellent level of tension and suspense on the mind of the spectator; and on the other hand,this movie is not afraid of showing brutal scenes of violence.Inside balances both styles perfectly.The only fail I found on this movie is that Alysson Paradis feels a little bit bland on the leading role.But,that is not a too important fail.As a fan of horror cinema,I recommend this excellent movie with a lot of enthusiasm,but I also have to make a serious warning : Inside is so disturbing and shocking that is clearly not for the faint of the heart.I had a unique experience watching this movie,and it produced on me something that not horror movies do : emotional impact.
After the very interesting films Cassandra's Dream and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, director and screenwriter Woody Allen made Whatever Works, a big step back to the time in which he made insipid and tedious movies like Hollywood Ending and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. There are a few positive elements in Whatever Works, but not enough of them in order to make it worthy of a recommendation.At least, I think that there is a valid reason for the anachronistic narrative from Whatever Works. Apparently, it is an old screenplay written by Allen during the 70's, when he considered comedian Zero Mostel (1915-1977) for the leading role. But when Mostel died, Allen desisted from the project, and he kept the screenplay for "another day". Such day came various decades later, in 2009, when the threat of an actors' strike left Allen with very few time to prepare a new film, so he decided to unearth that screenplay, which does not only look sexist nowadays, but which is also irritating and unfunny.Among the few positive elements from this movie, I can mention Larry David's performance. His work is passionate and sincere, and I truly wish he had better material to work with. Evan Rachel Wood is credible as the trite character of an innocent girl who is dazzled by the "greatness" from her reluctant benefactor. And I think that Ed Begley, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson also managed to bring solid performances despite the poor screenplay.In conclusion, Whatever Works is a mediocre and very boring film which does not reflect Allen's talent at all. But well...at least Whatever Works is not as bad as You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, so it is not Allen's worst movie. Unfortunately, that is one of the best things I can say about this film.
The Punisher (2004) was an atrocious film which fatally failed on its attempt of adapting to the cinema the adventures of the famous character from Marvel Comics created by Gerry Conway and John Romita Sr.Fortunately,that publishing house has shown good predisposition to improve their film mistakes and,as well as we had a much better Hulk on the second attempt,another creative team had the opportunity to make another Punisher film,and the result was not a great film,but entertaining and enormously superior to the previous film.Let's see the positive points from this film first.With one exception,the cast is perfect : Wayne Knight,Dash Mihok,Dominic West and Doug Hutchison bring their characters to genuine life.The screenplay is well structured and it keeps a good balance between drama and black humor.The violence is brutal and disturbing,and it is not afraid of showing juicy explosions of blood and gore with every shot,decapitation or puncture.The cinematography is very appropriate because it brings a very particular visual identity to the movie.Now,let's see the negative elements.The biggest one is Ray Stevenson,the main actor,since as for his character,I could never feel the threaten from his presence,the intensity of his porpoise or his wish of revenge.And,besides of that,we have Lexi Alexander's insipid direction.She made a good work of camera,visual style and performances (with the exception of Stevenson) but she does not bring too much emotion to her direction.In other words,she can never make us feel emotionally involved on this movie.Maybe,Alexander did not have too much interest on this movie or she is better working on the technical sight than on the emotive one.In spite of my complains,Punisher : War Zone is a good action film which,although it does not result too memorable,kept me entertained the whole time.Pity this movie failed on two essential elements : the main actor and the direction.
I usually do not like the films about sick people and medical tragedies,specially when they are based on true events,because they are manipulative and lacking of any subtleness.Because of that,I did not have very big expectations about My Sister's Keeper,but although the movie did not result to be great,it was interesting and better than I expected.My Sister's Keeper is based on a book,and not on true events; maybe because of that the story is more sober and less sensationalistic.However,director Nick Cassavettes uses various cheap tricks for making the spectator to cry,something which is unnecessary because the movie works well as an emotive family portrait.The screenplay from My Sister's Keeper is well structured,and although the ending offers a simple message,the development is interesting.Using the popular trick of "flashbacks",we see the development of Kate (Sofia Vassileva's character)'s sickness and the effects that produced on her family.That is the best element from the movie,by my point of view : it is not only a parade of symptoms and treatments,but also a realistic view to how a sick person can change the family dynamic.However,Cassavettes' direction on some dramatic scenes was not exactly my cup of tea.I think there are at least four "musical mounts" on this movie,which are used as a cheap trick which wants the spectator to cry at any cost.And besides of that,Cassavettes shows us various languid sequences filmed in a stop motion and accompanied by plangent music.I think that with more sobriety on the direction,the final result would have been more resonant and memorable.However,I cannot deny that Cassavettes made a very good work on directing the cast.Almost all of the recent work from Cameron Diaz has been on insipid comedies,but on movies like Very Bad Things,Any Given Sunday,The Invisible Circus and this one,she proves she is in fact an excellent actress who is absolutely wasted on that comedies.Jason Patric does not work very often and although he never became on the star he seemed he was going to be in late 80's,his work is always phenomenal,as we can see on this movie.The brilliant Alec Baldwin is also very solid on his role.Abigail Breslin and Vassileva bring competent performances,but they are a bit darkened by the adult cast.It is not a great film,and the final experience is not very memorable,My Sister's Keeper is a good drama which resulted to be better than I expected,because the screenplay is much more reserved that on other movies from this type.The direction of some dramatic scenes took various points out to it,but I think this film deserves a recommendation.
At first sight, Hesher looks like one of those "indie" dramas which draw attention for including some famous actors in the cast, whose participation is maybe due to the fact they want to prove that they have not been changed by success, and that they keep being artists interested in the art itself. On some way, that is an appropriate description of the film; but leaving that prejudice against artistic pretensions aside, Hesher is an excellent movie with a fascinating screenplay whose narrative force validates the presence of those actors, at brining them roles which are worthy of their talent.The premise from Hesher might sound similar to a film starring Robin Williams, in which a simple but wise wanderer magically rescues an unhappy family. But the reality is very different, because even though the character Hesher is the catalyst of the change in the home of the Forneys, his attitude is more towards the one of an authentic sociopath, encouraging violence, rage and legal problems around the ones who are close to him. Let's say that the family cinema never shows the main character trampling a boy with his van, nor trying to encourage a widow man with a speech about amputees testicles. My point is that Hesher keeps a perfect balance between its disparate funny and dramatic elements, and the result is simultaneously funny, touching and very satisfactory. Co-screenwriter Spencer Susser (who was also the director) and David Mich√¥d built a story which repeats the archetype from "indie" cinema (family tragedy, suburban environment, misunderstood outsider), but they distinguished it with a brilliant dominion of characters with well defined emotions and personalities, which are so real that we can excuse the occasional moments of narrative incongruence (for example: Who would tacitly accept the presence of a lout in their house?).And sure, the characters also work because of the magnificent performances brought by the cast. As I said on the beginning, the presence from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Natalie Portman and (on a lesser degree) Rainn Wilson might look like a commercial "hook"; however, they take their characters very seriously, and bring them such a force and conviction that I immediately forgot I was watching celebrities in order to fully focus myself in the characters. Needless to say that the three of them bring extraordinary performances, and I think that the young Devin Brochu also made a magnificent work in his role, because he can perfectly express the emotional turbulence from his character with only his face and his look. And finally, the great Piper Laurie also brings a perfect performance as the grandmother. I honestly did not know that Laurie kept acting (the last time I had seen her was 7 years ago, in an episode of the TV series Dead Like Me), but it was a pleasure to see her again fully displaying her big talent.In conclusion, Hesher deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation because of its excellent screenplay, solid direction and perfect performances. Susser had a great debut with this film, and I am definitely very interested in watching his next projects.
As I have mentioned many times, I have been a fan of the conspiracy literature since I started using the Internet in mid-90s, and I discovered the fascinating universe of forums and websites in which serious and lunatic investigators proposed their crazy theories. That's why I expected a film with the attractive title of The Conspirator to offer a sordid perspective of its central subject: Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865)'s death and the conspiracy behind his murder. However, The Conspirator ended up being very different, because it employed the mentioned assassination just as the detonating of a story about justice, revenge and civil rights. The result is generally interesting, but not completely satisfactory.Because of its historical period and legal subject, this movie could be compared to the film Amistad, but The Conspirator uses a much colder and more cerebral narrative than the one from that movie. In fact, the point of its story isn't even determining Mary Surrat's culpability or innocence, but simply respecting her civil rights and not letting external factors (the Civil War, the collective pain of losing a beloved President) work as an excuse in order to ignore the Constitution and trample the intention from the ones who wrote it. Screenwriter James D. Solomon obviously wanted to use this little famous passage in History as an analogy of what's currently happening with the "war on terror", in which the privacy, human rights and occasionally the simple decency tend to disappear for the sake of security.Unfortunately, the way in which director Robert Redford translated that screenplay is so dry and parsimonious that I was occasionally a bit bored. And the production from The Conspirator is so modest that I would even call it "minimalistic", because the 90% of the film is developed in the same three locations: the military court (completely different to the affluent ones we have seen in the movies based on books written by John Grisham), Surrat's guest-house (which currently exists as a museum), and the woman's unclean cell.Despite that, the screenplay kept me generally interested, and the excellent performances from James McAvoy, Robin Wright, Evan Rachel Wood and Colm Meaney helped me to overcome the moments of the film I found a bit boring. In conclusion, I can give The Conspirator a moderate recommendation, with the warning that you don't have to expect to find the traditional formulas of the legal or the conspiracy cinema.
A few years ago, I found Forgetting Sarah Marshall to be a mediocre comedy which was redeemed to some point by having some funny moments.Among them, we had had the interventions of Russell Brand in the role of a ridiculously arrogant rock singer.He was only a secondary character, but I guess that some producers saw potential in him, and as a consequence we now have the film Get Him to the Greek, which is not a sequel to Forgetting Sarah Marshall but a spin-off dedicated to Brand's character, with a screenplay (extra-officially) inspired by the film My Favorite Year, where a writer has to deal with a veteran (and incorrigible) actor who is more interested in the liquor that in the TV programme which will save his career.In the case of Get Him to the Greek, an executive from a record company has to deal with a rock star to take him to the concert which can save his career.He is not as popular or as extreme as Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler, but Brand provokes the same divisive effect as them on the people.Some ones hate him with passion, while other ones appreciate his improvised and extravagant style (such as me), and that will be the decisive effect for the spectator to enjoy or detest Get Him to the Greek, because the entire movie turns on Brand and his routines.Personally, Brand's performance is the main reason I enjoyed this film, at the same time that he has a good chemistry with Jonah Hill.As for the supporting cast, I liked the performance from the great Colm Meaney very much; Sean "P Diddy" Combs is unexpectedly effective in his role...even though I am not sure whether he was acting or if he was laughing at his public image; Rose Byrne shows credibility and good presence in her character of model/singer/muse; and Elizabeth Moss does not have too much material to work with in her role of Hill's character's girlfriend, whose sub-plot makes the movie to extend a bit more than unnecessary, with some moments which feel a bit boring.As for the humor, there were a few occasions in which it did not work, but it did in various other occasions.So, in conclusion, I can recommend Get Him to the Greek because it kept me entertained and it has more positive elements than negative ones, even though the final result is not highly memorable.
The movie A Serbian Film has been causing controversy for more than one year, from the days it was silently circulating in fantastic cinema and "underground" film festivals, to when its DVD release suffered of blocks, censorship and delays from distributors who are afraid of becoming accomplices of crimes against the morality. But anyway...thanks to the constitutional right of the "freedom of expression", I could finally acquire a legal DVD and which is only slightly censored (less than 15 seconds, which can naturally be found on the Internet). Was the scandal justified? And, more importantly...Is it a good film, or a simple tabloid spectacle made only in order to bring attention? To start with, there is no doubt that A Serbian Film includes some very graphic scenes which could affect the sensitive people, or the ones who are not accustomed to the "extreme" horror cinema. It is difficult to establish a "repulsion criterion" in this point; every person has his/her own limits, and even inside those limits, there are contextual variants based on the personal tastes, customs and experiences which are only known by every individual. For example, there are people who do not have any problem watching an animal being tortured in THE REAL LIFE during a bullfight (something I hate with all my soul), and however, some of those people cannot tolerate scenes of ARTIFICIAL gore in horror films such as Hostel or A l'interieur (just to mention two examples). Thinking about it well, that might be the decisive factor from A Serbian Film...the violence, the sex and all the other grotesqueness shown are simulated with special effects, edition tricks and ingenious digital composition. In that aspect, I found A Serbian Film graphic, but inoffensive.On the other hand, there are some conceptually disgusting elements which produce a moderately disturbing effect, but not because of what is shown, but because of what is suggested. But, unfortunately, moments like that are exceptions in this movie. A Serbian Film ended up saturating me with "extreme" scenes to the point in which it was difficult for me to keep the emotional connection with the main character, something which would be essential to appreciate the ending, which (in my case) produced apathy instead of anguish and sadness. That's why I felt the excellent performance from Srdjan Todorovic kinda wasted; from the beginning, he makes a perfect work at bringing his character to shape, whose previous life as a "porn star" does not demerit his humanity, nor the genuine affection he feels for his family. Pity that the movie comes to a point when director and screenwriter Srdjan Spasojevic buries that humanity under an avalanche of perversion.In conclusion, I found A Serbian Film moderately interesting, but not very satisfactory, occasionally a bit boring, occasionally too obvious, and lacking of enough narrative substance.
I don't know whether it was because I'm not a big fan of Meryl Streep's nor Julia Roberts', but the case is that I found August: Osage County a total disaster. Or it might have been because adapting a play to the big screen is even more difficult than a book; sometimes, what works on a stage with the actors live somehow becomes over the top and artificial when it's shot with the characteristic display of Hollywood affectations: the "acting duels", the screams and fuss to simulate emotions, the actresses who accept to look uglier in order to be nominated for the Oscar... in other words, the classic ingredients of an inflated melodrama which wants to be "important" despite failing on every narrative aspect. As for the performances, Streep makes an excellent work as "Meryl Streep with a weird accent" and Roberts is brilliant as "Julia Roberts saying profanity". In summary, there are movies which employ the family dysfunctions as a tool to explore interesting characters on a constant evolution. And there are movies which employ them as an excuse to bring us 2 hours of tedium and clamor. August: Osage County definitely belongs to the second group.
It's Kind of a Funny Story is a light dramedy with intellectual claims and an ensemble of picturesque characters who are completely away from reality. As you might have already figured out, this is another "indie" which tries to illuminate our day with the likable adventures of various bizarre and occurring characters, with which we share our joys and unexpected sorrows, and which try to make us appreciate our lives as hollow and insipid they might be. And I think that It's Kind of a Funny Story achieves all that mainly thanks to a well balanced screenplay which does not use the comedy and the drama as opposites, but as efficient complements which allow the creation of characters with a sincere humanity behind their ridiculously picturesque "madness".Like we have seen in other movies about personal reflection and self-analysis, It's Kind of a Funyn Story employs the old strategy of assigning a different facet of the main character's nature to every other character. And I think that that works pretty well.It's Kind of a Funny Story could be described like a teenage version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, seasoned with the black humor from Girl, Interrupted and filtered with the sensibility from the modern "indie" cinema. According to the taste from every spectator, that combination might sound likable or absolutely repulsive. I belong to the first group, despite the presence of a few forced dialogs and artificial moments of visual "creativity". However, that did not avoid me from enjoying this film pretty much, mainly because of the generally well written screenplay and the competent performances. Keir Gilchrist feels honest and credible in the leading role, and I also liked the work from the rest of the actors, highlighting Zach Galifianakis, Jeremy Davies and Emma Roberts.In conclusion, It's Kind of a Funny Story is an interesting and very entertaining film, and I can recommend it because of that.
Marcus Dunstan co-wrote with Patrick Melton some horror films I liked (Feast, Feast II: Sloppy Seconds, Saw IV and Saw VI), some horror films I did not like (Saw V and Feast III: Happy Finish) and a horror film I found mediocre (Saw 3D), so I did not know what to exactly expect from The Collector, his debut as a director (which he also co-wrote with Melton).The result is that The Collector ended up being another rehash of Saw, with a lot of blood and cruelty but with a forced and lacking of cohesion screenplay.In The Collector, I liked the moral ambiguity from the main character as well as the set-up of the situation during the first 20 minutes.However, the development feels repetitive, with long scenes of bloody torture which offer many good make-up effects but few narrative interest.Anyway, Dunstan could achieve some good moments of suspense and he kept a clear visual language, which always makes what is happening to be clear.But for every scene of good tension, something absolutely ridiculous or improbable immediately happens, reminding us of the multiple inconsistencies from the screenplay and the classic stupidity from the characters.In conclusion, I think The Collector is a mediocre horror film, but it at least kept me moderately entertained due to Dunstan's moderate talent as a director and the competent special effects.I just wish those attributes were employed in a movie with a more original and less derivative screenplay.
After reading The Da Vinci Code,I was amazed by all the popularity author Dan Brown obtained.I had found it moderately entertaining,but it was far from being something great.I think Brown's biggest achievement on that book was plagiarizing the fascinating investigations described on books like Holy Blood,Holy Grail and The Templar Revelation and incorporating it to the structure of an average thriller.However,I eventually discovered that Brown's authentic intelligence is with his knowledge of the "zeitgeist",the popular culture and his dominion of marketing.In summary,Brown found the perfect way to taking theological controversy to Wal-Mart's books shelves,in the exact moment of maximum vulnerability on the Catholic church to exploiting the distrust from its devotees and exposing them to concepts which years before would have been scandalous heresy.I would like to say that on the book Angels and Demons I found the same ability,but unfortunately,I found the story from it very slow and boring,using vague theories and vintage conspiracies about the legendary order of the "Illuminati" as an excuse to bring us another parade of puzzles and enigmas which are arbitrarily solved by a scholar character whose supernatural powers of deduction let him find,in a matter of seconds,the answers to mysteries which were hidden for centuries.And now,the film adaptation tries to decorate that bland narrative with violence,bombastic violence and hollow action.Unfortunately,the result does not work at all.This movie is really crappy.While I was watching Angels and Demons,I felt it as a very expensive episode from Scooby Doo (without humor,obviously),which is trapped on its inflexible formula and which is completely incapable of producing suspense on the spectator.The last scenes from this movie deserve a mention,because they are so ridiculous that they produced accidental laughs on me.Considering that I have enjoyed movies with mutant monsters,masked killers and robots from the future,this complain may seem a little bit hypocrite,but...an antimatter bomb ?! Really?.I would expect to see that ridiculous "mcguffin" on a "B" movie starred by Steven Seagal or Mark Dacascos,but not on a multi-millionaire movie which is so formal and on which were involved some Academy Award winners.But,that may be one of the least important problems from this movie,because we unfortunately have much worse ones.For one sight,we have the forced development from a dug story and the frequent pauses it takes to bring us mystical monologues which are tedious and provoke impatience on the spectator.Ron Howard's direction completely lacks of any energy or enthusiasm.One of the few positive elements I found on this movie is Tom Hanks' performance,because he shows conviction and credibility even on the most ridiculous scenes.The worst aspect from this movie is that it is horribly boring from beginning to end,and that's the capital sin a movie can commit.Because of that,and for many more reasons,I suggest you to avoid this crappy movie,because there are more interesting ways to spend your time and your money.
A few days ago,I decided to re-watch Transformers,so that I could go to see its sequel with realistic expectations and fresh memory of what had happened on that movie because there may were some elements which were necessary to understand some things from Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen.I am such a dreamer...of course it is not necessary too much detail for following such a poor story,but I have to mention that,although this sequel is very mediocre,I found its screenplay slightly better than the one from the first movie.However,that's saying practically nothing.The story from this sequel is not much more than an excuse for showing explosive special effects sequences.And "explossive" is the most appropriate word because I do not think there has been a movie with more pyrotechnical excess in the History of cinema.But the screenplay commits the fatal mistake of thinking that the special effects will be enough for holding a two-hours-and-a-half movie,so it does not create interesting characters or honest drama.Besides,the characters and a lot of situations feel forced.Thinking about it better,I would not say the screenplay from this movie is better than the one from the first part...I think "less bad" is a more proper expression.This movie has too many irrelevant filler.As an example,I can mention an extended and tedious sequence which is set on a campus,which could have easily been deleted from the movie because it only introduces us one of many irrelevant characters.I think the only porpoise of that scene is showing us the underwear from actress Isabel Lucas.And the touches of "humor" in this movie result,as in the first part,to be execrable.As in almost all of his movies,director Michael Bay had a negative influence on this movie.I think that with a real director,we would not see so many explosions and destruction,but a more disciplined style,where the dramatic scenes were treated as dramatic scenes,and not as obligatory pauses the camera wants to abandon.There is something called "cinematograhic language" and if Bay is not able to "speak",it will be impossible to communicate something relevant.Do not misunderstand me...I am not against breaking the rules when the situation allows it; the problem is that Bay does not know when to use his "creative vision" and when he has to stick to the basic rules of cinema to benefit the movie.One of the few things I liked on this movie are the extraordinary special effects.This is one of the biggest achievements from the legendary studio Industrial Light & Magic.Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen is a very crappy movie which,although it constantly shows us explosions,is very boring.Avoid this film.
I have to admit I had some enthusiasm for watching Monsters vs Aliens because,in spite of the horrible state of animation cinema in Hollywood (with a few exceptions,of course),I thought it would be fun to see a movie obviously inspired by various fantastic cinema movies from the 50's,like Attack of the 50 Foot Woman,The Blob,The Fly or The Creature of the Black Lagoon.However,the movie resulted to be hollow and boring,with over the top moments of comedy (which do not result funny) which change ingenuity for noisy action.This very weak movie may satisfy to very little children,but the ones who want to see animation cinema of the best quality should look anywhere else (like,for example,some Japanese movies like Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke).As it could be expected,the references to the sci-fi genre in this movie go beyond of the name of the characters,and although I appreciated the mention of Red Dwarf,E.T.,Star Trek,Close Encounters of the Third Kind and a long etcetera of famous works from the genre,I did not feel them as honest tributes,but as condescending tricks to ingratiate a certain group of spectators...and to suggest they are not copying concepts and situations,but innocently playing tribute to those works.The cast of voices made a decent work,although nobody stood out too much.On the animation field,I found the design from the monsters pretty disparate.I understand the intention of making them sympathetic and not frightening (although this last thing would have worked much better),but they do not seem to belong to the same visual scheme from the movie.Besides,it seems that they were created by artists who had very different concepts about the tone and nature from the story.The main point is that that attitude destroys the basic idea from the movie,which is : "never judge the people from their appearances,but by their actions".On many aspects,Monster vs Aliens reminded me of the sequence from Toy Story (or was it Toy Story 2?) in which the monster toys help the heroes.The animators from that movie were not too shy with the design,because they comprehended that making the monsters too sympathetic would kill force to the message.But,after all,what could I expect from DreamWorks? The good will they had won with Shrek was extinguished after producing craps like Shark Tale,Madagascar and its sequel and,specially,the execrable Bee Movie.I respect that the dramatic scheme from DreamWorks does not try to copy the one from Pixar (which is obviously superior) and I understand their sensibility,which is more commercial and less artistic.I just do not respect the complete lack of narrative ambition from almost all of their movies.Monsters vs Aliens is another very mediocre animation movie which commits the fatal mistake of being boring.
I suppose that the satire and the politic have harmoniously lived with each other from pre-historic times; in fact, I would not be surprised if some cave paintings were in fact caricatures in which the fails from some leader from the tribe or witch doctor was denounced.The cinema adopted that practice from its beginnings, and I estimate that the tradition will continue as long as there are people dissatisfied with their leaders...and enough freedom to express the message on a pacific way.I even dare to say that the political satire is one of the few cinematographic genres of a genuine importance, whose effects and motivation transcend the mere entertainment of the masses.It is said that the ideas can change the world, so what can we expect from a medium designed to transmit them with particular strength and motivation? The excellent British film In the Loop may not aspire to change the world, but it undoubtedly left me thinking with its hilarious portrait of the modern international politic...or better said, of the people who, by chance or destiny, are responsible to control it.I guess there still are people who consider the politic as an exclusive field for sages and martyrs with a humanitarian interest in the welfare of the community.In the Loop presents a much more cynical (and, in my humble opinion, more realistic) point of view, showing us the political process as an unpredictable clash of opinions, interests and conspiracies, where the one who is right does not win, but the one who knows how to manage the situation for the own benefit.And co-screenwriters Armando Ianucci (who was also the director), Simon Blackwell, Jesse Armstrong and Tony Roche endorsed the story with hilarious dialogues, exuberant characters and an extremely fierce satirical attitude.And besides of all that, we have the brilliant performances from the whole cast, who bring their perfectly written characters to life.The actors who stand out are Peter Capaldi as the Communications Minister, who is an expert in communicating with the most acid (and hilarious) vulgarities; Gina McKee as a suffered secretary; David Rasche as a sly North American politician with black intentions behind his affable appearance; and James Gandolfini as a distinguished general for and against the war...according the time in which he is asked.I have to leave clear that In the Loop is not another movie about the Iraq war, or another late denounce against George W. Bush.Instead of that, it is a very intelligent denounce against the whole political process, but expressed with so much humor and sagacity that we have no other choice than laughing at the same time we assimilate that that is the reality of our rulers, from any time or ideology.The only fail I found on this movie is that there a few moments which feel a bit forced.But that minor fail does not avoid me from recommending In the Loop with a lot of enthusiasm, because this is one of those films which entertain us a lot at the same time they leave us thinking.
In 1992, director Abel Ferrara made the controversial film Bad Lieutenant, and I have always thought that that movie was a protest/parody of the anti-heroes who were infesting the popular culture...all those alcoholic, divorced and depressed policemen we saw (and keep seeing) as main characters in uncountable thrillers or action films.It is like if Bad Lieutenant wanted to say: "Do you want an anti-hero? THIS is an anti-hero".18 years later, we have a new version of that film, called Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans, and even though it is not a great movie, it ended up being a pretty interesting experience.Nevertheless, I would not consider it as a remake.The best thing I can say about Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans is that it is a unique film.I still do not know whether it is very good or very bad, but at least this is not one of those bland movies lacking of vision we commonly see on contemporary cinema.This film has plenty vision (and madness), and that disproportionate passion is one of the main things which make it interesting.Nicolas Cage entertained me with his extreme and over the top performance, but at the same time, that plays against this movie.He abuses from the same style we have seen him doing in other films, and it became so common that it does not provoke the necessary impact in his performance.The rest of the actors bring solid developments.Eva Mendes is simultaneously sober and precise on her character; Jennifer Coolidge shows her talent, which is unfortunately wasted on many occasions; Alvin Joiner (more famous as "Xzibit") surprised me with the maturity he shows in his character; and finally, the brilliant Val Kilmer and Brad Dourif also bring competent performances.If I had read the title "Director Werner Herzog prepares a remake of Bad Lieutenant" on Mad Magazine, I would have thought it was an appropriate satire of the ridiculous fever for making new versions of classic (or semi-classic) movies.And I guess Herzog and screenwriter William M. Finkelstein also found that idea funny, because behind the drama and sordid situations from Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans, there are constant winks and a soft sarcasm as indications we do not have to take this movie very seriously.And it is precisely that humor one of the main things which rescue it from being a mediocre thriller.So, this movie is not great, but I think it is worth exposing to its bizarre elements and humor.In summary, I think Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans is one of the few "so bad it is good" movies which were done with that purpose, and they succeeded on that.Whoever understands that will definitely appreciate this strange movie.
Even though I'm not a big fan of the "cosmic" elements from the Marvel universe (I prefer the more mundane and "realistic" stories), I liked the recent reboot of the comic Guardians of the Galaxy very much, thanks to writer Brian Michael Bendis' skillful hand, who applied his classic humor and perfect characterization in order to renovate the saga, making it a very amusing and quite ambitious "space opera" which took itself the freedom of playing under its own rules, without losing the respect for the established continuity. However, I didn't know what to exactly expect from the film Guardians of the Galaxy. At first sight, it feels like an anomaly into Marvel's filmography, lacking of superheroes in the conventional sense, and a director who is famous (at least among the fans of B cinema) for his twisted sense of humor and contradictory origins (James Gunn initiated his career in Troma Films while he was working as a screenwriter of the first Scooby-Doo film). Fortunately, that exotic combination of sensibilities ended up producing a hugely entertaining film with a solid emotional content, interesting characters and an excellent return to the science fiction cinema set in space, with abundant spaceships, alien races and epic conflicts which encompass entire planetary systems. But it's not a film meant to be taken very seriously (come on, one of the main characters is a mutant raccoon and another one is a tree with a face). The cast immediately assimilated that naughty tone, and brought perfect performances. Chris Pratt employs his humorous instincts and dramatic capacity very well; Zoe Zaldana brings the exact combination of toughness and sensibility to Gamora; Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel bring quite a personality to their digitally animated characters; and Dave Bautista shows an appropriate level of gravity in his character. I also liked the way in which the screenplay developed the villains, and we can count on Stan Lee's habitual cameo, even though my favorite one in here was (even though it just lasted for half a second) Lloyd Kaufman's... in a Marvel film! What's next: Ron Jeremy in Avengers: Age of Ultron? In conclusion, Guardians of the Galaxy is a very satisfactory experience which, in my humble opinion, perfectly captured the spirit of the comics, with that wink which reveals us its main objective of entertaining us, even though there are millions of lives in danger and the ending is a bit bittersweet. My only complaint against this film is that the edition falters on a few moments, obstructing the narrative with scenes and sequences which don't always "stick" correctly. For the rest, I enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy very much, and I left the cinema very happy... specially after that post-credits scene.
I was not very interested in watching another romantic comedy with attractive main actors who hate themselves on the beginning for then falling in love, before some artificial obstacle imposes on their way to happiness.However, the subversive tone which was promised on the trailer of The Ugly Truth and its competent supporting cast made me to risk myself and go to watch it.The result was another mediocre and boring romantic comedy.There are some irreverent details on the screenplay from this movie, but they were not enough for hiding the tiring formula it follows and the huge number of clich√©s it has.One of the few things I liked on this movie was the appearances of competent comedians on supporting roles.They unfortunately do not appear too much, but I smiled with the brief appearances from Bree Turner, Cheryl Hines, John Michael Higgins, Bonnie Sommerville, Nate Corddry and Nate Lewis.All of them have unknown names but very familiar faces because of their frequent appearances on sit-coms and movies on the roles of best friend,neighbor or other peripheral roles.I do not have much more to say.The "ugly truth" from this film is that it has a forced premise, it is boring, there are too many clich√©s, it follows the cloying recipe from a lot of romantic comedies and that Robert Luketic (who has a wide experience on the romantic comedy genre)'s direction is absolutely insipid.I do not recommend this film.
I honestly did not want to watch another movie which criticizes the war between United States and Irak,because there have already been too many good quality movies about that subject,at the same time that the landing of the new North American government on past January will kill some weight and relevance to all the films which criticized Bush's presidency.However,I decided to watch Grace Is Gone,because I have always liked the work of John Cusack,at the same time I wanted to see what perspective this movie was going to offer about the war.What a great surprise I took with Grace Is Gone.This is an excellent movie which finds a fresh way of depicting the war between United States and Irak.I simply admired the proposal from this movie,because it will always be valid and relevant for the simple fact that,with or without new President,the United States are going to suffer for a long time the consequences to their actions and I am sure the future will bring us new movies analyzing that thing...something like the enormous quantity of movies which were made about the Vietnam war during the 70's and the 80's.Grace Is Gone works perfectly well on two levels.For one sight,I found its portrait of the domestic and emotional life from the ones who stay at home,who are frightened but at the same time optimistic about the destiny of their loved ones, very interesting.But the best aspect from this movie is the interpretation it makes about the war,which is done on a very different way to the one which might be expected.It would have been very easy to show the main character as a liberal pacifist and to simply compel him to repeat the long list of complains we are used to hear.But it was much more provocative to show the main character as a guy who supported the war and who is proud of the work his wife has done there because she risked her life to keep the liberties many people do not properly appreciate.I will now mention all the other positive elements from this great movie : the family drama feels completely honest and realistic; the performances are excellent (the girls are particularly impressing); director James C. Strouse made a sober work which is completely at tone with the story,while as a screenwriter,he could get a precise balance between emotions and narrative at the same time he exposed the subject of the war on a provocative way.I will look forward to seeing Strouse's next movies.The only complain I have against this movie is that it felt a little bit dull on a specific moment.In spite of that,I recommend Grace Is Gone with a lot of enthusiasm.I did not have too big expectations with it,and I finished taking a great surprise.
I would think that after the films Lady in the Water, The Happening and specially The Last Airbender, the name of director and screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan would have already lost any credibility as a marketing hook; but it seemingly was not like that, because the posters and the trailers from the film Devil proudly carry the phrase "From the mind of M. Night Shyamalan".However, he only co-produced and brought the idea for the screenplay of this movie, leaving the direction in the hands of John Erick Dowdle, whose previous film was the competent remake Quarantine.Unfortunately, the final result of Devil ended up being horrible, and I felt it as an authentic waste of time.Devil tells one of those minimalistic stories which are focused in a small number of characters who are confined into a claustrophobic location.Strictly speaking, Devil has a bigger focus, because it divides its attention between the "psico-drama" which is developed inside an elevator, and the efforts from a policeman who tries to control the situation by using his training and deductions.Unfortunately, I did not find none of those narrative slopes to be interesting at all.The characters who are trapped in the elevator are antipathetic, and the actors who interpret them fall into dramatic excesses which feel ridiculous.The policeman is a living clich√© with a tragic past and deductive powers which would not feel out of place in Adam West's Batman, at the same time that actor Chris Messina is not credible at all in that role.The only positive thing I can say about Devil is that it has a short running time (80 minutes including the final credits).So, in conclusion, I found Devil to be a pathetic horror film due to its bad performances, its uninteresting screenplay and Dowdle's poor direction, so needless to say I do not recommend this movie.In my humble opinion, Devil represents another nail in Shyamalan's credibility's grave.
I honestly did not have the original intention of watching I've Loved You So Long.I skipped it when it was in cinemas at my country and I decided to watch it yesterday at night because I felt like watching a movie, so I found this one at the videostore, and I decided to give it a try and watch it.I am so glad of taking that decision...I've Loved You So Long ended up being a truly extraordinary film experience.The story from this movie may sound as a typical drama which wallows on the misery of others, but in fact, I've Loved You So Long has a sensitive and deeply human screenplay, which is perfectly written and is also complemented by monumental performances which are very difficult to forget, because at the difference of similar (North American) dramas, their strength resides on their subtlety and the force they bring to the characters, whose emotions can be felt even in the slightest gestures and expressions, without falling on the excesses the Oscars love so much.In other words, this movie avoids and corrects everything I dislike in the movies from (to mention two examples) director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu or based on books written by Nicholas Sparks.The same artistic discipline can be appreciated in the screenplay, which has enough confidence on the spectator not to explain those things we have to deduce, or cheat us with unnecessary complications which would only play against the intense but credible situations which integrate the story.As a clear example, I can mention the details in the main character's past.A less intelligent movie would use them to impress us with surprising revelations, but screenwriter Phillipe Claudel (who was also the director) incorporates them on a casual way to the development from the story, preserving our interest without cheapening the suffering from the main character as part from a forced twist.So, I've Loved You So Long is a magnificent and definitely memorable movie which deserves the most enthusiastic of the recommendations, specially if you are a lover of the cinema.It was authentically refreshing to see a sample of subtle and transcendent drama, instead of the false and affected one so many movies use (Remember Me and Dear John are two recent examples).
I was interested in watching The Quiet Ones because it was produced by Hammer Films. Sure, it's not exactly the same Hammer Films studio which made all those horror films I devoured during my childhood on TV and VHS, but I like to see it still active. Besides, The Quiet Ones is set during the '70s, highlighting the "retro" atmosphere and the strict analytical focus from this film which deals with one of my favorite topics from fantastic cinema: science against superstition. The Quiet Ones is supposedly based on true events (something confirmed by the "historical" photos we see during the end credits), but even if it wasn't, the story is based on an interesting idea: the cause of any supernatural event comes from the person itself, and not from external factors such as demons or spirits. 2 years ago, the film The Apparition attempted to do something similar (inspired by the same "Philip Experiment"), but The Quiet Ones takes the premise seriously and explores the possible mundane origin from a supernatural entity with more discipline. In fact, it may insist too much on that... and the consequence is that the film feels a bit repetitive, with too many discussions which round on the same topic, without reaching a completely satisfactory answer... until the ending requires so. Another problem from The Quiet Ones is its excessive use of shocks and unexpected sounds to scare the audience; on the one hand, the audio design is pretty good, and I appreciate the fact that the film decided to focus on atmosphere and suggestion, instead of special effects. On the other hand, the technique is so abused that it loses pretty much impact much before from reaching the ending. Despite that irritating strategy, I liked the employment of obsolete technology and politically incorrect attitudes, because they bring realism to the narrative and excuse on some ways the main character's extreme methods, as well as his lack of ethic and scientific rigor. The performances from The Quiet Ones are good, and I also liked the emphasis this movie puts on the psychological aspect from the horror, besides of the sober focus with which it tells a story which could have fallen on visual excesses which are always inferior to what our imagination can evoke with the correct stimulus. So, despite not being highly memorable, The Quiet Ones is a competent horror film, and it deserves a moderate recommendation. I didn't like it as much as other pseudo-scientific horror films (such as The Asphyx, Quatermass and the Pit and The Exorcism of Emily Rose), but it's a decent addition to that niche.
Director Joel Schumacher is hated by many people, for having ruined the first Batman franchise with the atrocious films Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. However, I don't have a particular antipathy against this filmmaker, even though I can't deny his various false moves, such as Trespass, his most recent film, which is a horrible thriller.Trespass features every single clich√© from the "home invasion" sub-genus, and it didn't make me feel any suspense, nor interest in the irritating characters, who suffer from the "chronic stupidity syndrome" employed by lame screenwriters when they need to advance the story, but they lack of the necessary talent in order to make something genuinely ingenious and innovative. Besides, the twists in the screenplay are completely predictable. And worsening the situation, Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman bring poor performances in the leading roles.Schumacher's direction is completely bland and anonymous, with dramatic scenes lacking of any emotion and action sequences which only made me snooze. In conclusion, I hated Trespass, and I suggest you not to make the same mistake I did, so don't waste your time nor your money in it.
It was expected that the success of the excellent The Hangover would rush the arrival of comedies with the same kind of humor, simultaneously warm and vulgar, combined with interesting characters and the presence of actors who do not charge the stratospheric salaries of Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler.Hot Tub Time Machine is one of those comedies, and even though I did not find it to be brilliant or very memorable, it made me laugh thanks to the competent performances from the main actors and the nostalgic humor.I do not know whether it was good or bad to base big part of the humor from Hot Tub Time Machine on the 80's nostalgia and culture.On the one hand, there are funny observations about the changes in habits and ideology; but on the other hand, the constant references to icons from the 80's could limit the attraction to the new generations, who did not live during that decade.I did live during that decade, so I found the mentions to Red Dawn, Alf, Rambo, Cold War and James Spader (among many others) to be funny.And I also have the mention the excellent soundtrack from the movie, which goes from Poison and Public Enemy to Spandau Ballet and Men Wihout Hats.But this movie's strongest point is the solid work from the 4 main actors: John Cusack, an 80's icon thanks to his appearance in films like Say Anything and Better Off Dead; Craig Robinson, who had already shown his big talent in the North American version of the TV series The Office; Clark Duke as the classic nerd without friends; and Rob Corddry, who uses the maniac sense of humor he employs in his stand-up routines in here.The female cast is not at the same level of the male one, since Lyndsy Fonseca, Collette Wolfe and Lizzy Caplan feel a bit forced on their roles.At first sight, the story from Hot Tub Time Machine may sound as the febrile dream from a mediocre sci-fi author, but the fantastic angle is only an excuse to add grotesque and surrealistic humor to the "adult reviving his youth" clich√©.So, there is no need to analyze its arbitrary logic and find the holes from the screenplay; we only have to get carried away by its absurd premise and accompany the main characters, and in my case, that was enough for me to have a good time.Continuing the comparison to The Hangover, I will say I liked that one much more because there was a well structured and very solid story behind the humor, at the same time it presented credible narrative arcs for every character.Hot Tub Time Machine did not aim to do as much, but it still deserves a recommendation, mainly because it made laugh.
In 1993, I was left amazed by the film Kalifornia, and I considered Dominic Sena as a very promising director. The reality ended up being very different, because with his following movies (Gone in 60 Seconds -2000-, Swordfish and Whiteout), the expectations I had originally had about him considerably decreased. That is the reason why I went to see Season of the Witch, Sena's most recent movie, with few enthusiasm, and unfortunately, my pessimism was justified, because I found it to be an uninteresting and very boring adventure film.Season of the Witch is another "quest movie" focused on the tedious path from the point A to the point B. The problem is that the more the characters walked, the more I felt that the story was going nowhere. And I think that screenwriter Bragi F. Schut thought the same, because he periodically introduces obligatory obstacles and dangers in order to distract us and make us think that something is really happening. The problem is that those are simply arbitrary interruptions which do not influence on the plot at all, except for sacrificing disposable characters. The ending made me laugh with its absolute impudence and horrible special effects. If the whole movie had been like that, Season of the Witch would have been a "so bad it's good" movie. Pity that that moment was too short and came too late.With the exception of Ron Perlman, the actors feel absolutely out of place, specially Nicolas Cage, who simply appears like Nicolas Cage wearing loaners from a restaurant with a medieval subject, and not like a genuine warrior from the Crusades who is facing a faith conflict. Besides, he does not make any effort for emulating the accents or linguistic idioms some of the other actors use in order to fit into the historical context from the movie. And I have to say that Cage is laughable when he uses his Californian accent to say such serious phrases like: "We shall not let her sacrifice to be in vain". And, call me immature, but when Cage pronounced the name "Debalzaq" as "the ball sack", I could not avoid laughing either.In conclusion, Season of the Witch is bad movie which kept me very bored despite a few moments of involuntary humor. So, needless to say that I cannot recommend it, at the same time that Sena proved once more that he is nothing more than a "one-hit wonder".
I already abandoned the hope of watching Jason Statham in a movie which does not include car chases, brutal body-to-body fights or apparatus explosions. That may be the only kind of job offered to him, or maybe Statham himself chooses to stay in the action genre because he likes it. Or he possibly knows the fact that the fame is transient and treacherous, so he does not reject any role fearing that it may be his last one. But, you know what? Whatever the reason it is, I am not bothered at all of seeing him over and over interpreting the tough guy with a good heart, challenging the adversity with guns or his fists, and making unlikely stunts by car. After all, his charisma and solid performances almost always benefit to those movies. What takes me to The Mechanic, the most recent film in which he has been involved, which is an entertaining but not very memorable action film.The Mechanic is a serious, violent and brutal action film, but not lacking of a sense of humor in its over-the-top action scenes and in Statham's performance, which is virtually identical to the one he brought in the films The One, The Transporter and its sequels, Revolver, Death Race, Crank and its sequel and The Expendables. But that does not matter, because it is exactly what The Mechanic required; besides, the chemistry he has with Ben Foster is pretty good, because their interaction simultaneously captures the potential of an incipient friendship and the distrust of sharing the most secret aspects from their life with a stranger. As for Foster's individual work, he brings another one of his realistic and passionate performances, showing the flexibility which allows him to work with the same credibility in art-house cinema (like The Messenger and Birds of America) and in action films (like this one and Pandorum). And despite his short stature, his physical development is equally competent.I also liked to see in The Mechanic some moments of solid drama and emotion (at least inside of what we can expect in a movie from this genre). So, in conclusion, I think that The Mechanic deserves a moderate recommendation, because despite not being very memorable and the screenplay being a bit predictable, I cannot deny that it made me have a good time.
The story about the Enigma code is fascinating, not only because of its technical details, but also the colorful persons who were related to it and the huge effect they had in the conclusion of World War II. That's why I was interested in watching a "prestige" film about that topic; however, The Imitation Game ended up being more superficial than I expected in its handling of a theme which might be too arcane for mainstream cinema. In other words, The Imitation Game was afraid to scare the audience with too much science, and it preferred to exaggerate the drama in order to obtain a warmer and more accessible narrative. I understand the making of that decision, but it makes the film feel a bit incomplete. Nevertheless, there are various attributes in The Imitation Game, such as the excellent performances and the well defined characters. And there's also some romance, but I'm glad to say that the resolution of that sub-plot didn't end up being as predictable as I had expected, because it's also employed to reflect on other topics, which are very distant to war and cryptography, but at the same time, equally important in their historical context. Benedict Cumberbatch makes a perfect work in the leading role, transmitting many emotions with his expressive face, and he's well complemented by the rest of the cast. However, I wasn't left completely satisfied by The Imitation Game, because I found its screenplay excessively light and lacking of genuine ambition. Screenwriter Graham Moore made a decent work, but he didn't have the audacity of taking the cryptographic subject as a starting point to create a memorable narrative puzzle, instead of limiting himself to cover the basic requirements of a functional but kinda insipid biopic. Anyway, I think I can give a moderate recommendation to The Imitation Game, because despite not being something special or highly memorable, it has enough positive elements, and it tells an important story for contemporary world, not only for the effects it had on World War II, but also for establishing the bases of the digital culture we nowadays enjoy (or suffer) every day.
Back in 1984, the film The Company of Wolves took the classic tale Little Red Riding Hood and brought it a Gothic and mature twist, examining the psychological subtext and its subjects of sexual repression. It might not be a perfect movie, but it definitely represents a unique and fascinating experience. Now, 27 years later, we have the film Red Riding Hood touring around the same thematic territory...but with the only ambition of capturing the teenage spectators with an imitation of Twilight. In other words, the fantasy concept from Red Riding Hood is ruined by an insipid romance and feelings which are as false as the medieval environment presented by the movie. In summary, Red Riding Hood ended up being truly unbearable to me.To be honest, the romance in Red Riding Hood is kept as a peripheral element. However, the many scenes dedicated to the werewolf mystery are tedious, because the pathetic screenplay tends to ramble between family drama, religious mystery and the follies from the Preacher, interpreted by Gary Oldman with such an enthusiasm that he borders the caricature (something which might sound as an insult, but in a film which is full of inert performances, Oldman is the only one who shows some energy). And even though the identity from the werewolf is kept in mystery for a pretty long time, there is not too much suspense or any sensation of danger, anguish or horror. Due to that uncertainty, Red Riding Hood lacks of identity, because it is frightened of being too violent for the teenage girls, and it does not entirely deliver to the romance in order not to drive away to fans of horror cinema either. The result is that the film fails in every aspect.In conclusion, the tedious rhythm, insipid tone and disinterested performances (with the exception of Oldman's) make Red Riding Hood to be a horrible film I suggest you to avoid like a plague.
I was not very interested in watching Rise of the Planet of the Apes, but when I started reading very enthusiastic reviews about it, my curiosity woke up. Now, after having seen it, I can say that the film is totally worthy of that acclamation, because it is an excellent movie which works perfectly well as a prequel of the original saga, as well as a modern "reboot" of the franchise.Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of those weird blockbusters which tell a really solid and consistent story. The screenplay shows a logical progression of events and an organic increment of the drama, instead of just being a parade of action scenes joined with each other by artificial melodrama, like we have seen in many blockbusters. And if we add to that an interesting message about animal rights, the final result is an exciting and hugely entertaining movie which also leaves us thinking. Having said that, there are a few details about the sapience from the apes in the screenplay which feel a bit forced. There were a few scenes in which I felt the same as when I saw the velociraptor opening the kitchen's door in Jurassic Park. I know that the objective is surprising us with the unexpected intelligence from creatures who are usually considered as "irrational"; but there are some things which do not precisely depend from the intelligence, but from the previous experience. However, the rest of the screenplay is built with such a care and attention to every detail that those little traps ended up not being very important.The apes created by the studio Weta Digital work magnificently. To start with, the textures, "shaders" and hair simulation are genuinely extraordinary, and their realism is as good or even better to the one from films like Avatar or Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole. As for the facial animations and range of emotions from the apes, they are equally impressive.As for the human element from the movie, James Franco is credible as the scientist whose optimism and good intentions are combined with a fatal result. The great John Lithgow makes a brilliant work as the scientist's father suffering from Alzheimer; it is very difficult to interpret someone with mental limitations without making it look like an offensive joke, but Lithgow perfectly achieved that without any apparent effort. And Freida Pinto is adequate as the main character's romantic interest. So, in conclusion, I very enthusiastically recommend Rise of the Planet of the Apes as a fascinating experience. Oh, and by the way, don't loose the final credits, when there is a scene which simultaneously works as an interesting epilogue and disquieting prologue.
Even though the character which is interpreted by Sandra Bullock in All About Steve was irritating me pretty much, the first 20 minutes of this film were inspiring a bit of optimism on me, because they seemed to be preparing field for a subversive satire of romantic comedies.In fact, although I had read lousy comments about it, I thought that it might had been misunderstood, and that it would offer some interest for the haters of the romantic comedies.Of course I was wrong, because All About Steve is tedious, repetitive...and the whole film was unfortunately as irritating as the first 20 minutes.I think I only laughed on 2 occasions in this movie, and that was thanks to the solid performance from Thomas Haden Church, which is the only positive element in this film from my humble point of view.At the difference of Bullock, Church understands the tone his character needs and he takes as much advantage as he can from his weak lines of dialog.Pity this actor was wasted in such a bad movie.Bullock horribly fails at trying to combine her natural geniality with her character in this film.And if we combine that pathetic performance with the disastrous screenplay, we have an unbearable experience as a final result.So, my final recommendation is for you to stay away from All About Steve, a movie which is so bad that it results insulting to the spectator.I regret having wasted my time and my money to watch this horrible piece of junk.
Even though The Last Station was very acclaimed by film critics, I must confess I was not very interested in watching it.Its cast of excellent actors attracted me to some point, but I thought that the subject it deals with (the last days of the acclaimed writer Le√≥n Tolst√≥y) was cold and depressing, besides of the fact I am not a very big fan of Tolst√≥y's work; in fact, the two times I tried to read War and Peace, I could not surpass the 100 pages, and not because it bored me, but because the archaic style, obsessive detail and huge list of characters overwhelm the reason (at least in my case).Nevertheless, I decided to give The Last Station a try and watch it and, to my surprise, the film ended up being a very interesting experience thanks to its perfect performances and its solid narrative, which has multiple levels of interpretation and a rich attention to the details.However, The Last Station is not perfect.The well-written story from this movie also works as an excuse to examine the Tolstoy philosophy.I personally think that every plan of economical utopia and social harmony (not only the ones from Tolstoy, but also the ones from Marx, Rousseau or Chomsky) seems naive for not considering the inherent vices from humanity, but it is anyway interesting to contemplate the process which concluded to its creation.On that aspect, I think The Last Station fulfills with its objective thanks to its accessible dialogues and very entertaining discussions.And besides of that, we have Michael Hoffman's elegant direction, nice cinematography and magnificent performances from Christopher Plummer, Helen Mirren, James McAvoy and the great Paul Giamatti.As for the negative elements, I can mention that the romance between the McAvoy's and Kerry Condon's characters occasionally derails the narrative without a particular purpose; and I also felt that ending is extended a bit more than it should.However, neither of those fails avoid me from recommending The Last Station as entertainment with some substance, which invites to the reflection and ingestion of new ideas.
Director Federico Fellini (1920-1993) was an authentic artist...something which is not precisely a compliment.His movies (at least the ones I have seen) seem to be based on impulse and whim, at the same time they have very few method and discipline.Some people admire that, but honestly, I am not one of them.The film 8¬Ω may be his most personal work, because it seems as a celebration/apology/explanation of his creative processes, contemplated in the context of his imagination (or subconscious?), where at the same time he examines the influence that many women had in his life.46 years later, the movie Nine added ostentatious and over-designed musical numbers interpreted by famous actresses in their underwear to that combination.Well, to be fair, I have to say that in the 80's, composers Arthur Kopit and Maury Yeston adapted 8¬Ω to a musical in Broadway.And what Nine does is taking that musical to the big screen with the direction of Rob Marshall (whose previous incursion in the musical genre was with the highly overrated Chicago), and the result is a boring and very mediocre film.I found Nine to be excessively pretentious, and with tedious songs.What is more, I found the performance from the great Daniel Day-Lewis to be feigned and bland.Among the few elements I liked in this film are some performances from the female cast, where the members who stand out are Kate Hudson and Marion Cotillard.I think that a musical film has the obligation of having good songs and an at least functional story to work as a support from the songs.Nine fails in both fields, so I cannot recommend this tedious movie.If you wanna see an excellent musical film, I recommend you Moulin Rouge or Fame (1980).
Snowpiercer is an adaptation of the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige, directed by the South Korean Bong Joon-ho and with a multi-cultural cast and special effects created by studios all around the world, making it an international film which isn't subject to the narrative laws of a specific region; in other words, it doesn't feel like a Hollywood action film, or an European art-house film, or an Asian multi-genre pastiche. Every spectator will have to decided whether that thematic confusion is good or bad. I think it's definitely good, because Snowpiercer works brilliantly in all those styles: there's abundant and exciting action during the literal class struggle on board of a train; the dramatic moments are very well executed as an integral part of the story; and there's also an eccentric sense of humor which provides a comic relief during the most tense moments of the story. Besides, Chris Evans brings a perfect performance in the leading role, bringing conviction, charisma and presence to his character. Song Kang-ho also brings an excellent work as Nam, an acid and laconic expert in security who reluctantly accept to help the revolutionaries in exchange of a constant drugs supply. On the negative side, Snowpiercer includes a few kinda improbable elements, but for the rest, I liked this film very much, and I definitely recommend it as a film difficult to classify but easy to enjoy.
I liked the film Twilight because of its precise direction, adequate performances and its good moments of humor; however, the romance between the main characters left me cold.Nevertheless, I had the hope that, with a new director and the addition of werewolves, the romantic scenes would be better balanced by horror or suspense in The Twilight Saga: New Moon.I did not have so much luck, and even though I did not dislike it, I found it to be mediocre and inferior to the first part.The only difference I noted in the direction is that, on this second part, Chris Weitz does not use "wire-work" and he prefers to use invisible digital tricks on a creative way.The narrative feels pretty parsimonious, and if...all the pauses...the actors...make...during...passionate...and uncertain dialogs had been deleted, the film would have been more efficient.Something which would have also made it more efficient would be the removal of many languid views from Bella, takes in slow-motion showing the actors taking their shirts off and forced moments of humor.This may put me on "Team Jacob", but I found his story to be much more interesting than the one from the vampires.Even though I appreciated the previously mentioned invisible digital tricks from Weitz, the action scenes feel artificially filmed, and that is one of the biggest fails in here.In order to put this review on context, I would like to mention that I have not read any of the novels, and that I am VERY far from the average age the fans of this saga are.In spite of that, I found New Moon to be mediocre, but moderately entertaining (with the exception of some moments which get a bit boring), so I think it deserves a slight recommendation.
The first thing which stands out in Waltz with Bashir is the animation which was used on its manufacture.It may not be very fluid or detailed from a technical point of view,but it perfectly helps to depict the memories,nightmares and ambiguous reality the main characters experiment.However,the most important thing in this extraordinary movie is not the technique which was used on the animation,but all the ideas which are expressed on the story,showing the human sight of a political moment whose historical importance darkens the effects it produced on a personal level to many people who were involved in the invasion to Lebanon.Waltz with Bashir offers us a personal and very emotive vision about the First War of Lebanon,analyzing it from a fascinating perspective which is usually ignored by the History books.The screenplay from this movie is very deep,because it does not only make a detailed analysis of that conflict,but it also explores philosophical subjects,like the fluid nature of memory and its validity on the emotional development of people.Because of its style,exotic atmosphere and balance between honest drama and unexpected touches of humor,Waltz with Bashir could be compared with the film Persepolis.And although I liked that film pretty much,I think Waltz with Bashir is very superior,because I found it to be more ambitious on its shape and more reflexive on its deepness.The brilliant idea of using animation for illustrating a semi-documentary story could be considered as many people to be a simple trick which alters the reality from the interviews.However,I admired that decision,because the vignettes finish waking up the imagination from the spectator,at the same time they add a lot of meaning to details which would go unnoticed.Finally,I have to give a very enthusiastic recommendation to Waltz with Bashir.This is one of those joys which remember us why the cinema is considered as an art,and it makes me very happy to see that movies like this still exist.In summary,a monumental film,which is absolutely worthy of all the acclamation it received.
2 years ago, director Rodrigo Cort√©s impressed me with the excellent film Buried, in which he employed a fascinating style in order to tell an interesting story into one of the smallest imaginable locations. Now, Cort√©s comes back with a more conventional film, called Red Lights; and even though the screenplay includes too many dramatic outbursts (not to mention a weak ending), I found the film interesting.Foremost, it's convenient to point out the fact that Red Lights isn't a horror film (as I thought it was going to be). I would describe it as a drama with supernatural touches, because big part of the narrative is focused on the debate between science and superstition, exposing the methods employed by the supposed "psychics" in order to make their miraculous readings, and explaining the human propensity to accept irrational answers as long as they leave them satisfied on the emotional level. However, as I said on the first paragraph, there are various occasions in which the level of drama is sharply incremented, making the characters to betray their nature and behave on a contradictory way to what had been established. The screenplay also employs exaggerations in order to "raise the bets", even though that ends up decreasing the story's credibility (for example, Simon Silver's fame seems excessive for being a mentalist retired 30 years ago...Would someone care if Uri Geller returned nowadays?). And going on with the complaints, I will also mention the edition, made by Cort√©s himself. The risk of being the director/screenwriter/editor is getting too accommodating and refusing to cut the leftovers. Red Lights suffers from that "author syndrome", extending some scenes more than the necessary and prolonging the "exposition" to overwhelming levels, when an agile and concise focus which would make us think more would have worked better.On the positive side, I liked the performances from Red Lights. Sigourney Weaver expresses her character's feelings with intensity and credibility. Cillian Murphy makes his character's evolution natural. Robert De Niro perfectly balances his character's aspects as an inscrutable individual of a doubtful intention and as an eccentric showman adored my the multitudes who believe in his cures. And Elizabeth Olsen managed to bring a decent work, despite the fact that her character doesn't feel very relevant.As for the ending of Red Lights, I didn't like it very much. I guess that the reaction will depend on the beliefs and interpretation from every spectator...and I personally think it was a trap. Nevertheless, and despite my complaints, I think Red Lights deserves a moderate recommendation because it managed to keep me interested the whole time.
The idea of a "classic" director like Kenneth Branagh making a superhero film might initially sound strange, but in the case of Thor that ended up being very appropriate, because the comic always used Shakespearean drama and archaic language to tell the story of the God of Thunder, the political/family conflicts in the Asgard kingdom and its interaction with the universe of Marvel Comics. And Branagh's competent direction, the excellent performances and the solid screenplay make Thor to be a very entertaining movie.I honestly had always preferred the character of Thor in small doses or as part of an ensemble, like he was on the beginnings of the comic The Avengers and in its modern reinterpretation The Ultimates. So, I did not have big expectations on a movie exclusively focused in that character; however, Chris Hemsworth brings a brilliant performance in that role, because he could perfectly combine the pompous and operatic "classic" Thor with the dynamic and unstable modern Thor. I do not know how the purist fans of the Kirby/Lee era will take that mash-up, but I think it was a very good decision, specially because Thor does not only work as an origin of that superhero, but also as an efficient preamble of the highly anticipated film The Avengers, which will be an unification point of Marvel's film universe.For example, we also have the character of Agent Coulson conducting scientific investigations from S.H.I.E.L.D. with his accustomed astuteness and efficiency; we also have a cameo of one of my favorite Avengers (even though without his traditional uniform); and a post-credits scene where a few concepts we are surely going to see in that future movie are established. But well...it would not be fair to only consider Thor as an extra-large trailer of The Avengers. As I previously said, it is a very entertaining movie with various positive elements, like Branagh's efficient direction, which drives the movie at a perfect rhythm. As for the cast, besides of the previously mentioned Hemsworth, I think that the rest of the actors is also worthy of applause, starting by Natalie Portman, who can perfectly express her character's emotions. I also liked the work from Stellan Skarsg√•rd; his participation is relatively short and it would seem irrelevant if it was not for the dramatic weight this actor brings to the character with his mere presence. And Kat Dennings is quite funny and credible as the comic relief.As for the screenplay, it is very well written; the only thing I would say against it is that it makes a few "traps" which feel a bit forced. As for the action scenes, I found them to be well filmed, with the exception of a few excessive close-ups which made them occasionally confusing; I think that is the only thing I can say against Branagh's direction.In conclusion, I took a very pleasant surprise with Thor, and I can recommend it as a very good re-invention of a difficult to handle superhero. It might not be a great film, but it definitely made me have a good time.
I do not know if the "retro" fever in contemporary horror cinema is due to simple nostalgia or a genuine appreciation for the simplicity and ease the genre had during the 70's and the 80's.Whatever the way it is, I think this fashion will quickly lapse if it keeps being used as a mere ornament of mediocre stories, bad performances and poor narrative.Fortunately, there are a few exceptions in which the "retro" style is executed with purpose and talent, as we can see on The House of the Devil, a very competent horror film.The House of the Devil is not reloaded with cultural clich√©s from the horror movies made in the 80's, although that did not avoid director Ti West to use some familiar faces from that decade, not only because of their "historical" value, but also because they are solid actors who bring weight and credibility to their roles.They are Mary Woronov, Dee Wallace and the brilliant Tom Noonan.Jocelin Donahue and Greta Gerwig integrate the young cast, and they also bring competent performances (specially Gerwig).The element I mostly appreciated on this movie is the sober and concise narrative language West used to tell the story, something which reminded me of the work from directors John Carpenter and David Cronenberg.Like them, West shows long scenes of leisure to generate an oppressive atmosphere of suspense, with the tacit promise that something horrible is about to happen, and nothing will be done to avoid it.However, that comparison deserves some mitigating...West develops a similar style to the one of those great directors, but The House of the Devil does not reach the intensity and impact from most of their movies.However, I think this young director deserves respect because of his audacious strategy of "less is more", something he completely achieved.I will look forward to seeing more movies directed by him.In summary, it may not be a great film, but The House of the Devil is an efficient and very entertaining horror film which deserves a recommendation, thanks to its good rhythm, competent performances and solid direction.I took a nice surprise with this film.
Roman Polanski, along with other audacious directors such as Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, was part of the "new school" which changed the face of commercial cinema during the '70s, leaving behind the retrograde moralist and edifying schemes the industry had been dragging from the '50s, when the famous Hays Code severely censored the "indecency" in cinema. However, at the difference of Coppola and Scorsese, Polanski seems to have improved with the age (leaving aside the misstep he had with Oliver Twist), because even though some of his classic films keep undeniably being very interesting (The Tenant, The Fearless Vampire Killers), I think his modern films offer a wider spectrum of artistic and narrative attributes. In other words, I think Polanski is living his best creative period, as it has been proved by the films The Ninth Gate, The Pianist and The Ghost Writer. That's the reason why I was very interested in watching Carnage, his most recent film; however, even though it ended up being an interesting experience, I didn't find it very memorable, and it's definitely very far from being among Polanski's best films.Even if it hadn't been mentioned during the initial credits, the fact that Carnage is based on a play would have been obvious. With the exception of the prologue and the epilogue, the whole film is developed in only one location, and it basically relies on the dialogs and the performances. On some way, Carnage is a filmed play, and as a consequence, it's difficult to appreciate Polanski's hand; but anyway...even without his characteristic atmosphere and visual style, the film is entertaining despite feeling a bit affected and pretentious. In this kind of minimalistic stories, we frequently see the structural simplicity compensated by over the top drama, because instead of looking for a visual deployment, the focus is on the evolution (or "de-evolution") of the characters, something which was exactly the point of Carnage. The result in here is competent, even though I occasionally found it superficial and not very credible. The conflict between the two couples begins on a realistic way, but its staggering is too quick and obviously designed to make a contrast between their moral values. And when the ending came, I felt the fact that too many things were left up in the air.However, I can't deny that the performances from Carnage are magnificent. Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly are absolutely perfect as the liberal and progressive middle-aged couple, so "politically correct" that they run the risk of becoming caricatures. Meanwhile, Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz are brilliant as a wealthy, but accessible and casual couple.Even though it didn't leave me completely satisfied, I can bring a moderate recommendation to Carnage as a competent film with excellent performances and an interesting story.
A few years ago, producer Emanuel Benhiby released the film Paris je t'aime, the first part of a creative experiment which pretends to collect bullets and short stories about life and the essence of a specific city, made by new and veteran filmmakers whose combination of styles would (ideally) produce an entertaining and eclectic "collage".Paris je t'aime barely fulfilled with that purpose, and now, New York, I Love You tries to do the same by focusing its attention into another one of the most famous cities in the world.Unfortunately, its intentions were better than the result, because I found New York I Love You to be unsatisfactory and generally boring.The extensive cast from New York I Love You made a good work, but the stories they interpret are, with one exception, excessively diffuse and disjointed, at the same time they lack of any charm or humor.The exception I referred to is director Joshua Marston's segment, which is the only one I liked, because it established two interesting characters I would have liked to follow for more time.However, the rest of the segments bored me, because besides of their pretentious stories which do not lead to anywhere, I felt the New York's "spirit" to be absent.So, I cannot recommend New York I Love You, because I found it to be a very unsatisfactory film experience.
Legion would have been a better movie if it had reduced its theological ambition and if it had simplified its confusing mythology because, after all, it results to be a variation of the popular "siege" formula, in which a group of people must trench into a remote location and reject the attack from various enemies.The facts that the future of humanity is in danger and that the attackers are possessed does not avoid the script of Legion to visit the clich√©s established on films like Rio Bravo and its disguised remake Assault on Precint 13 (1976).However, I cannot deny Legion kept me moderately entertained thanks to the efficient performances and its moments of violence and action.The combination of religious subjects with the western style from Legion will not result strange to the people who read books like American Gods and Good Omens, or comics like Preacher and The Invisibles.Legion captures the same aesthetic thanks to its arid locations, minimalistic design and sterile cinematography which makes us feel the isolation and dryness from the place.On the other hand, the characters are a collection of caricatures and easily recognizable stereotypes, but they are well interpreted by the actors.Dennis Quaid is adequate on his role; Charles S. Dutton brings a good presence and credibility to his character; Kate Walsh is also solid, even though the screenplay does not give her too much to do; and Paul Bettany is very well as "the man without a name".The most important fail from Legion is that the screenplay does not make too much sense.I do not pretend to reveal the few surprises from the screenplay, but there are so many logical holes and inconsistencies that the movie did not leave me very satisfied.The motivation of the central conflict is not very clear, as well as the importance of the character of the waitress and her baby.I guess that co-screenwriters Peter Schink and Scott Stewart (the last one was also the director) wanted us to "read between the lines", but that does not excuse the convenient stupidity of the villains who cannot open a door, or that the heroes ignore the most obvious weaknesses of their "fortress" until another shootout or another sacrifice are necessary.By the way, Stewart is another special effects artist (veteran of ILM and The Orphanage) who makes his debut as a director, and I appreciated the fact that he showed discipline on that aspect from the movie, because the special effects are only used whenever the story requires them.So, in summary, Legion is a mediocre movie, but its competent performances and the fact it is never boring make it worthy of a slight recommendation.However, I think a better alternative to Legion is the underrated film The Prophecy, which portrayed with more gravity and a much better screenplay a similar angelic civil war.
I understand the controversial nature of the sexual crimes committed by catholic priests who use their position and influence to take advantage of the trust the kids have on them,as well as the trust from the parents and the society.The film Doubt has a subject related to that horrible situation but what I mostly appreciated from it is that it tried to go a bit more far away than that.I will not tell more about that because if I do it,I may ruin the movie to some people.This is a very interesting movie.This film has an excellent atmosphere because that helps for increasing the intensity and tension.The dialogs are very well crafted,bot only because of their textual content but because of the subtle manipulation they make of our perception and ideology.I can mention for example the scene where Father Flynn defends the equality of a black race boy after a racist comment from Sister Beauvier.The dialog is perfectly reasonable but it has a totally different dimension because of its context and because of some things we already know...or we believe to know.Director and screenwriter John Patrick Shanley adapted his play to this movie and I think he did a very good work on both fields.As a screenwriter,he could adapt his play into an intense and very interesting screenplay; and as a director,he could find a minimalistic tone which helps to create the atmosphere of the movie,and he could extract extraordinary performances from the cast.Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman totally deserve the acclamation they received and I say it clarifying that I usually do not like Streep's work too much.She always brings detailed performances but they do not usually feel natural because,with a few exceptions,she does not become into her characters; she just interprets them (the most clear examples of this are her performances on the films The Hours and Kramer Vs. Kramer).But,on this movie,Streep could totally become into her character and make it really memorable.Amy Adams also brings an excellent performance.She expresses a lot with her expressions and she is completely natural on every scene she appears.Viola Davis also brings a brilliant work as a mother with solid motivations behind her actions.The fails I found on this movie are two.For one sight,Doubt felt a little bit slow on some moments; and for the other sight,the ending feels a little bit empty.I would have preferred a more compact conclusion.In spite of that fails,I liked this movie pretty much.Doubt represented a very interesting experience in my case and because of that,I recommend it with confidence.
Director and screenwriter Rian Johnson amazed many people (including me) with his first film Brick, a strange hybrid of juvenile comedy and "noir" thriller which worked very well because of its perfect direction, fascinating screenplay and excellent performances. Johnson's second film, The Brothers Bloom, ended up being completely different, but the result was also quite interesting, with a solid screenplay which brought an unexpected twist to the typical "heist movie". Now, in his third film, Looper, Johnson ventures into the science fiction with an entertaining, but not totally satisfactory, result.I like the science fiction very much, and I particularly enjoy the films about time travel...when they are well handled (such as Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, The Terminator or the Back to the Future trilogy). It's obviously a subject liable to turbid and very variable rules, according to the imagination from the screenwriter in turn; and for the same reason, it's exposed to fall into logical traps which can ruin the narrative whenever the rules of the game aren't established early, in order to afterwards follow them fussily. The problem with Looper is that it doesn't decide itself about what rules it wants to follow, and its arbitrary handling of temporal paradoxes lacks of the necessary "internal congruence" in order to satisfy on the conceptual level. I comprehend the necessity of allowing some creative license when such a complicated territory is explored; but what I can't excuse are the forced twists and unnecessary additions implemented by Johnson in order to justify the road the story takes (for example, the "TKs"). In other words, the main problem isn't the inconsistency of the time travel, but the lack of realism in the characters' attitude, not to mention the deafening squeaks of the narrative gears which demerit the pros from the film. I obviously can't elaborate about that point too much without getting into spoilers, so I will mention the character Sara as an example: a single mother who ferociously takes care of her son, but decides to immediately trust in a wanderer who illegally got into her farm with an improbable story.On the positive side of Looper, we have the solid performances from the whole cast. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings a precise and emotionally honest work, even when his character gets betrayed by the whimsical screenplay. Bruce Willis also brings a competent performance, but his screen-time is shorter than I expected. The villains are a bit generically written, but they get some deepness thanks to the good works from Paul Dano, Garret Dillahunt and the great Jeff Daniels. On the female side, Piper Perabo is only employed as an ornament, while Emily Blunt makes her best which a character who is sometimes a clich√©, and sometimes contradictory. On the visual aspect, Looper has an elegant simplicity, free of any affectations or unnecessary ornaments which would distract us from the screenplay. The special effects are employed with moderation, and they are almost always limited to the creation of the futuristic setting, so don't expect an explosive blockbuster, but a subtle and almost minimalistic film.In conclusion, Looper deserves a moderate recommendation as an entertaining sci-fi film with good performances and disciplined direction; however, I have too many reservations against the screenplay (I have the theory that it began as two different films which were weakly joined with each other, without adequately filing the broken edges produced by their violent fusion), and that was the last thing I expected from Johnson, because he had proved his talent to build simultaneously complicated and easy to follow stories thanks to their precise balance and clear structure. Nevertheless, I can't deny that Looper managed to bring me a good time.
For some reason, the "peplum" cinema is gradually returning to Hollywood, and this year, we have been seeing bad or mediocre examples such as Pompeii, 300: Rise of an Empire and The Legend of Hercules... to which we can now add Hercules (2014), a film made with such a reluctance that it's impossible for the spectator to plunge into the story, or to care for the characters. Director Brett Ratner made bland and insipid work, and Dwayne Johnson does what the screenplay allows his character to, which isn't too much. As for the supporting cast, it was weird for me to see excellent actors such as John Hurt, Joseph Fiennes and Ian McShane not bringing any conviction to their roles. And the least I say about the dialogs, the better. As an example, I can point out Hercules' speech to encourage his troops; it looks like something taken from a fortune cookie. The action scenes don't provoke any excitement, and seeing horses in very doubtful conditions of security embittered me pretty much... I suppose that shooting in Croatia and Hungary isn't only cheaper, but also more "flexible" than in the United States. In conclusion, Hercules (2014) is an insipid and boring experience which I can't recommend. I wouldn't be surprised to see the "peplum" cinema returning to hibernation soon for some decades. Or maybe, director Ridley Scott will resurrect it with Exodus: Gods and Kings... and the cycle will start again because of him, like it happened with Gladiator 14 years ago.
The main risk in a film about the process of musical creation is the fact that the music isn't as good as the screenplay supposes so. Unfortunately, that's the case with Begin Again. The songs from Gretta and Dan, the main characters, are pleasant and honest, but they never reach the necessary degree of greatness in order to convince us on her talent as a composer, or his magic vision as a producer. But nevertheless, Begin Again works reasonably well because of its narrative; and even though the music isn't particularly brilliant, it works as an attractive accompaniment (and occasionally catalyst) of the human drama. And then, we have the solid performances from the whole cast, starting by Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, who are completely credible as two "lost souls" seeking for a new sense in their lives, which they might find sharing a creative project. Catherine Keener and Hailee Steinfeld also bring honest and detailed works as Dan's wife and daughter (respectively). Adam Levine (the singer from Maroon 5) plays the character of Gretta's unfaithful husband, but he took the good decision of not portraying him as a monster, but as a typical rock star who was a victim of his own success. I don't like Levine's music band, but he has shown talent as an actor in this movie. In conclusion, I found Begin Again entertaining and pleasant, but forgettable and superficial. I can give it a moderate recommendation as an inoffensive weekend distraction, but if you want to see brilliant films about musical creation, I recommend you Once (whose director, John Carney, was the same one from Begin Again) or Phantom of the Paradise.
On many aspects,Four Christmases tries to avoid the clich√©s of the Christmas movies,which are released every year to exploit the artificial spirit that movies have.But,Four Christmases is a very bad movie which tries to seem subversive and irreverent when in fact it is a bland comedy with mellow homilies and tiring messages.This is one of that comedies which result totally unfunny and boring.The only good jokes from this movie have already been revealed on the trailer,so I highly suggest watching it on the Internet than losing the time watching this crappy movie.Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon have had good development on other comedies (Old School and Legally Blonde,respectively) but they do not have good material in here.The same can be said about the supporting cast,which is full of prestigious actors (Robert Duvall,Jon Voight,Sissy Spacek and Mary Steenburgen).They just say their lines and they do not seem to be too interested on their performances...it seems they are only worried in charging their paychecks.I do not blame them...after all,with a screenplay so poor like this one,anyone looses the interest.Four Christmases is an irritating and enormously boring "comedy" and I do not recommend it by any means.
It brings me distrust when a director proclaims: "Until now we have the technology to tell this story" (or similar words).I ask to myself if Shakespeare, Cervantes or Lovecraft had once said: "Finally! A blue ink pen! Now I will be able to write my masterpiece".If the screenplay from Avatar had been extraordinarily good, it would have worked even if it was represented with puppets.But it is not, and the film is supported on many brilliant special effects to simulate the fact that the screenplay is hollow.I cannot deny Avatar entertained me, but I am afraid I will erase it from my memory in less than a week.In mid-90's, a preliminary screenplay from Avatar appeared on the Internet, and I had the opportunity to read it.Director and screenwriter James Cameron said that that primitive draft was completely different to the final version of the movie, but I feel its basic structure is the same: on the one hand, we have the military and corporative villains ready to raze the "eco-magic" world for the sake of money; and on the other hand, the integration of a human being to the native culture, which does only alter his perspective of the planet, but also from his values and ideology.Sure, I imagine that the descriptions from the flora, fauna and geology from the planet Pandora were increasing their complexity as Cameron found new technological tools to visualize an entire planet.And there is certainly no doubt...the hundreds of millions of dollars the movie cost were well invested on the fantastic images which bring Pandora to life, not to mention that the special effects are also great.Besides, the action scenes are very well filmed by Cameron, because they are always clear and they involve the spectator on them.However, I cannot ignore the fact that the screenplay from this movie is hollow, predictable, full of clich√©s and packed of unidimensional characters.With the exception of Sigourney Weaver, the cast does not bring very solid performances.Stephen Lang (unrecognizable in comparison with his days on the TV series Crime Story) and Giovanni Ribisi do not bring too much energy and conviction to their characters.Even Sam Worthington (who was so charismatic in Terminator: Salvation) feels listless as the hero.I guess that it does not help too much the fact that, during the 90% of the movie, Worthington is replaced by a digital creature with a similar face but less histrionic talent.I will not deny that the Na'vi race is created with very competent special effects, which surpass on expression and realism to the insipid dummies from Beowulf (2007) and A Christmas Carol (2010), but they are still far away from being perfect.In fact, it took me around 1 hour to "plunge" myself into the movie and accept them as valid characters.Besides, Avatar has tiring ecological clich√©s and sentimental formulas which feel too obvious and cloying.However, in spite of its many fails, Avatar is an entertaining experience and I think that because of that it deserves a recommendation.Finally, I think that the inverse proportion which exists between the technical complexity from Cameron's films and their narrative ability is very noticeable, something which is a pretentious way to say that, in my humble opinion, his best films keep being The Terminator and Aliens, because what I most remember from them are the story and the characters, and not only special effects, like it happened to me with Avatar.
From 2003 to 2006, I was a regular reader of the comic The Losers; however, I confess that I could rarely understand what was going on in the plot.I liked the energetic narrative from author Andy Diggle, and the stylish art from cartoonist Jock, but the story was a labyrinth of alliances, betrayal, vengeance and mysteries, so I took the custom of accumulating the individual numbers during various months, in order to then read them all together and (theoretically) facilitate my comprehension of the complex story.So, before watching the film adaptation of The Losers, I had the awe that director Sylvain White was going to dilute Diggle's "voice", or that the story would loose richness in order to become into a simple vehicle for the action scenes.One of the reasons I liked the comic The Losers was its balance of action, intrigue and humor.The film adaptation handles the first two elements well, but the sporadic comedy sacrifices the credibility from the characters for the sake of some laughs.However, I appreciate the fact that co-screenwriters Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt were faithful to the comic, at the same time they avoided the arrogance from other screenwriters who try to "improve" the stories they adapt.Fortunately, The Losers eluded that destiny, but I still feel that the screenplay should have put more focus on the main plot, and to leave the "filler" for the hypothetic sequels (something I see as highly unlikely due to the poor box-office reception this film had).A problem of less importance in this film comes from the special effects.The Losers is not a constant parade of CGI, but the occasional instances of explosions, digital destruction and some blue-screen compounds look pretty deficient, and they run the risk of taking the spectator out from the story.I guess that the low budget from the film excuses that fails to some point, and it is needless to say that I appreciate the fact that this movie emphasized characters and story over visual spectacle; nevertheless, the poor quality of those special effects bothered me a little bit.And I also wished that the edition from this movie was less fractured and more logical...and I am not only talking about some fight scenes, but also about some dramatic moments.Talking about dramatic moments, I could not swallow the romantic aspect from The Losers; what worked in the comic along three years feels weak at being compressed to half an hour from the movie.But, despite its fails, The Losers kept me entertained, but it lacks of that indescribable "something" to make it memorable.Nevertheless, I think it is worthy of a recommendation.
I am going to explain my general posture about the cultural phenomenon Harry Potter, in order to give some context to this review, which will be positive; but maybe not as positive as the opinion of the fans who grew up with this saga, and who are acclaiming this last movie as a milestone of universal cinema. Anyway...I found the first three Harry Potter books to be moderately good inside the parameters of juvenile literature, but as the saga advanced, I noticed some loss of in the control of the narrative, which introduced characters and "ret-con" without rhyme or reason, trusting the reader not to ask for any explanations nor an adequate development of those elements. Nevertheless, author J.K. Rowling could conclude the saga on an emotionally satisfactory and dramatically consistent note. As for the film adaptations of the books, my reactions for every one of them were also irregular, because there were occasions in which the movies tried to very faithfully follow the books...something which duplicated the missteps, "deus-ex-machina" and forced "suprises" from their literary counterparts. So, my big doubt was...Would Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 minimize the cons from the book and maximize the pros? Fortunately, the answer ended up being positive, even though I do not consider it to be perfect.The basic premise from this film starts simple in order to later become more complicated with multiple adventures, action sequences, romance and the obligatory visits to the past which generate new narrative tangents or try to justify some characters' behaviors. Some of those digressions genuinely enrich the story and tie loose ends which had been crawling from a decade ago. Other ones look like simple excuses to introduce more extraordinary special effects, or to visit some popular actor from the supporting cast, or in the worst of the cases, to create forced dramatic moments which were difficult for me to digest, even though some of them are better raised in here than in the book. However, screenwriter Steve Kloves knew how to "tighten the nuts" from the story, and he abandons any filling during the final 45 minutes in order to fully explore the darkest passages from the entire saga. I have to say that the general result Kloves achieved in here is pretty good.The technical aspects from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 are brilliant. Eduardo Serra's cinematography is excellent, and I think that he could achieve an adequate balance between the "fairy tale" visuals we saw in the first films, and the colder and more severe atmosphere which started to be employed when the "dark side" of the saga appeared. As I previously said, the special effects are magnificent. And finally, John Williams' music fulfills with its purpose of accentuating the emotions deployed in every scene.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson show that they have not only grown up on the physical aspect, but also on the histrionic one. They are totally credible in their roles, and they have a very good chemistry with each other. As for the adult cast, my favorite performances in here are the ones from Maggie Smith and the great Alan Rickman, who both bring excellent works.8 months ago, I found Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 to be so slow and dramatically inert that it bored me very much, and that it considerably reduced my expectations for the final chapter. After all, I do not care very much if a movie is faithful to the book it is based on, provided that it finds its own "voice" and becomes into a solid experience which does not require any comparisons nor cooperation to its written version. After 7 movies of a variable level of quality, I think that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 is the one which could most achieve that, and even though it will definitely be more appreciated by the fans of this saga, I can recommend it also to those ones who do not memorize every book, nor saw the previous films more than once, because it is a satisfactory and very entertaining movie by itself.
While You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger was boring me to tears, I was thinking that the work from director and screenwriter Woody Allen has been one of the most constant elements in my various decades as a film lover. Every year (more or less), we have a new movie from this filmmaker, and even though he disappointed me in various occasions, he deserves respect for his vision and his perseverance, even when that vision falls under the standard of what we can expect in a movie made by him. In other words, various of the "bad" films directed by Allen are not bad in the absolute sense; they just seem bad when we put them into the context of his filmography. However, I think there are two exceptions in his filmography which are horrible movies under any standard we evaluate them: Anything Else and now, You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, which lacks of any of the focus, intelligence and humor Allen uses to show in his movies, at the same time that it erratically wanders in search of a conclusion which should supposedly illustrate us about its intention and its message. Sure, Allen warns us from the beginning of the movie that there may not be a concrete point in here, because the narrator of the story quotes the famous Shakespeare's phrase: "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing". However, I do not think that is an excuse to tell such a poorly written story like the one from this movie.The story from this movie may sound as a comedy, or as a drama about marital crisis and romantic disappointments. However, the problem from You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger is that...it is nothing. There are some vaguely humorous moments and serious scenes, but after all, You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger lacks of a defined purpose or, for the case, a specific objective in order to validate so many characters and so many conflicts. Needless to say that the classic subjects from Allen are present in this movie: insecurity, neurosis, fear of old age...but something which was absent was the narrative "glue" in order to naturally integrate them to the story, instead of appearing as a collection of vaguely interconnected scenes. Some people may say that the real life is like that, unpredictable and lacking of any logic in various times, because it is not subject to the will from a screenwriter. If that was Allen's intention, I have to say that he made a "real" movie, without a beginning or an end. Pity that it was such a tedious and uninteresting movie.The cast from You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger includes various excellent actors (Anthony Hopkins, Naomi Watts, Josh Brolin, Gemma Jones, Philip Glenister, Pauline Collins, Fenella Woolgar, Celia Imrie and Christian McKay), but I did not find any of them to be credible in their roles. I do not know if they were badly selected, or if Allen did not offer enough direction for them to adapt to the tone required by the movie. The result is that all the performances feel forced...like if the actors feel uncomfortable in their roles.In conclusion, You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger is a very bad movie which in my humble opinion, represents the lowest point in Allen's career so far. The huge disappointment I took with this movie is not only because it is in the context Allen's career, but also because, on a simpler level, the movie is terribly boring. I hope Allen recovers from this disaster in his next movie.
I like fantastic cinema due to its capacity to explore stories outside our reality, but subject to a traditional logic and reasoning...in other words, it does not matter if it is Ripley on board of the Sulaco or Dr. Malcolm in Isla Nublar; we all understand the danger from creatures with sharp teeth.However, there is an unstable sub-genus in fantastic cinema which subverts the reality itself and our perception from it.Some people consider it as "altered reality", and I describe it as an "unstable" sub-genus because some lazy screenwriters use it as a pretext to tell incoherent stories which pretend to solve everything with a twist (for example, the classic "everything was a dream") which in fact does not explain anything and only tries to justify their incompetence (The Cell and the remake of Planet of the Apes come to mind).However, that unusual strategy can generate fascinating and provocative films (such as, for example, Donnie Darko and Videodrome) which open our mind and make us interpret them from unexpected points of view.The film Triangle ended up being one of those films, thanks to its brilliant narrative, which employs a bizarre logic but is also internally consistent, at the same time it does not make any traps to take us by a spiral path which concludes on a simultaneously unexpected and satisfactory way.Director and screenwriter Christopher Smith had a very competent debut with the film Creep, but he revealed himself as a great filmmaker with his second movie, Severance, where he showed a big ingenuity and ability to combine blood, comedy and a biting social commentary into an economic and compact story.I did not like Triangle as much as Severance, but I have to say it is a more mature film, because it tells a much darker story.And besides of that, Smith builds solid moments of suspense and horror in Triangle, but they do not feel as gratuitous ornaments, but as integral parts of the puzzle we have to solve.As it usually happens with this kind of stories, Triangle could be frustrating to those who expect to find a simple and linear storyline.On the beginning, the screenplay looks like a variation of Open Water; it later becomes into a species of "haunted house" in the middle of the ocean; and it then incursions into the subjective reality, with a style which reminded me a little bit of director David Lynch.Actress Melissa George faces her character with perfect credibility, something which is not easy at all when we consider the surrealism from the screenplay and the difficulty of transmitting the intern conflict from her character when we do not even understand her motivation (at least on the beginning).The only thing I can criticize from Triangle is that some supporting characters could have been better developed.But that is a minor fail, which does not avoid me from giving a very enthusiastic recommendation to this original and absolutely fascinating film, with a good amount of suspense and a disturbing atmosphere which perfectly transmits the confusion and anguish from the characters.Smith has definitely become into one of the most interesting contemporary directors, so I expect his upcoming film Black Death with very big expectations.The fantastic cinema truly needs more filmmakers like him.
The beginning of Chernobyl Diaries makes us believe it will be another pseudo-documentary film in which the characters tape their own adventures (or dis-adventures). However, a few minutes later, we find out that the film was in fact shot on the conventional way, so there will be no need to worry about the drawbacks we have already found in various films made with that technique. Unfortunately, what will worry us is the lack of a good screenplay, of solid performances, or of a competent direction. The result is 86 unbearable minutes of bad actors screaming, failed attempts to scare us, and an incredibly bland and lazy screenplay.The characters from Chernobyl Diaries don't wake any interest, in part because they are poorly written, and in part because the actors lack of any credibility and presence in their roles. As a result, the characters are so hateful that I wished them to die as soon as possible. And what is more, the plot from this film is totally uninteresting, and Bradley Parker's direction is atrocious. In short, Chernobyl Diaries is a soporific and deplorable experience. And the least I say about the abrupt and improbable ending, the better.So, in conclusion, it's needless to say that my recommendation is for you to stay away from this pathetic piece of crap. In order to take the bitter taste out of my mouth, I think I'm going to play again the brilliant level of the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in which the ghost city of Prypiat (where Chernobyl Diaries is set) was reproduced with quite a realism. I think it offers, in 15 minutes, the suspense and excitement Chernobyl Diaries couldn't achieve in 86 minutes.
I generally like independent cinema, but I can't deny the fact that its subjects and screenplays tend to fall into the same clich√©s and formulas from commercial cinema. Only once in a while we can find an innovative film, whose screenplay is intelligent without falling into the pretension; and which possesses a very personal vision which still feels accessible. Despite not being great, Martha Marcy May Marlene is one of those films, and I think that that is more than enough reason to make it worthy of a recommendation.The films about religious cults tend to fall into the exaggerations of horror cinema, or into insipid political/religious lessons. It's not very common for them to show the effect of the "brainwashing" in its members, and it's even less common to see it portrayed in such an intense and personal way as in Martha Marcy May Marlene. Even though the commune to which the main character belongs to has some similarities with Charles Manson's, the screenplay isn't interested in denouncing the criminal aspect of these leaders who control and manipulate individuals with a low self-esteem and high suggestibility (women almost always, for some reason). The film certainly deals with those subjects on a tangential way, but its main point is making us participants of the mental dissociation suffered by a young woman who managed to physically escape from the cult, even though she might never abandon her "master"'s "teachings", for better or for worse.And then we have the wonderful performance from Elizabeth Olsen in the leading role, which expresses even the most complex emotions with looks, expressions and body language. Sarah Paulson also brings a good performance as the older sister with contradictory emotions about the entrance of the main character into her life, while John Hawkes managed to be simultaneously charismatic and frightening as the leader of the cult.As for the negative elements from Martha Marcy May Marlene, I can mention the fact that the abrupt ending feels forced, at the same time it avoids us from receiving an emotional catharsis; and I can also mention the fact that the character Ted is occasionally forced to create conflict when it wasn't necessary. Nevertheless, those complaints don't avoid Martha Marcy May Marlene from being a very interesting film which genuinely left me thinking once it was over.
I have seen some episodes of the anime Dragon Ball (or it may was Dragon Ball Z; I do not remember too well),but I think I was too old to appreciate its quirky characters and story.I liked its energy and its profuse aesthetic,but I never felt enough interest to consistently seeing the programme.So,I will write the critic of the film Dragonball Evolution from an unusually objective point of view,because I do not have any nostalgia or love for the series and its mythology.Dragonball Evolution is a very bad film,by my humble point of view.For one sight,I had difficulty in accepting this "real" interpretation of the original anime.Director James Wong decided to tell the story on a too "normal" world which does not evoke the varicoloured universe from the anime.Dragon Ball is not one of of those semi-realistic animes which could be made as live-action movies (like Cowboy BeBop or Fullmetal Alchemist); in other words,I think its unique aesthetic and tone belong 100% to the animated world,and I think it was a big mistake to give it fake life only to satisfy a marketing request.In other words,they could have easily changed the name of the characters and used another title for the movie because the movie does not represent the essence from the anime.It would be interesting to see how will the fans of Dragon Ball react to all the changes made on this movie.So,seeing it as a martial arts childish fantasy,Dragonball Evolution results very crappy.The main reasons of that are the poorly developed characters and all the irritating clich√©s it has.The special effects are very weakly done and the multiple fights from the movie follow the modern standard of "wire-fu" made with slow motion and confusing edition to hide the mechanical and visual tricks they were filmed with.I have liked The One,the previous martial arts movie made by Wong,much more.On that film,the ridiculous but unique premise added a touch of science fiction which I found enormously more pleasant than the generic Asian magic we see on Dragonball Evolution.The cast is mostly anonymous.Justin Chatwin,Emmy Rossum and James Marsters are completely insipid and they all show zero presence and charisma.One of the few things I liked on this awful movie was the appearances from the brilliant Chow Yun Fat and the underrated Ernie Hudson.Although they do not have much to do in this movie,it is always a pleasure to see the conviction and credibility they give to their characters.Dragonball Evolution is a really bad movie which commits the sin of being tremendously boring.Seriously,I could not wait it to end.That's the worst thing a movie can provoke on the spectator.And,besides of that,we have a mostly anonymous cast,a horrible direction and poor special effects.Skip this crap of a movie and invest your time and your money on something else.
I had never had too much enthusiasm in the adventures from the super-hero Green Lantern, until writer Geoff Johns took the reins of the comic and re-defined its confuse mythology, at the same time he focused the drama on immediate and tangible human conflicts, instead of the distorted "space-opera" which kept away for decades to the readers (like me) who were more interested in "normal" heroes like Batman or Spider-Man. Unfortunately, the film Green Lantern takes the most rancid formulas from the super-hero genre, and the result is a horrible, bland and tedious film.On some way, Green Lantern achieved what it proposed to itself: it introduces us the character, it shows us his exotic powers and it establishes the function from the Green Lantern army as protectors from the universe. Unfortunately, the screenplay covers all that without any energy, nor respect to the spirit from the comics, and without the slightest inkling of suspense, even when the Earth is about to be destroyed by an extraterrestrial monster. The things just happen as we expect them to happen; there are not any surprises nor sensation of a narrative progress. Hal Jordan (the main character) receives the ring. Hal Jordan visits the Oa planet. Hal Jordan is trained by the best instructors (during more or less 5 minutes). Hal Jordan saves Carol Ferris' life and takes advantage of the opportunity to restart his romance. Hal Jordan...well, you understand what I am talking about. The whole movie feels like a succession of scenes without any emotional connection or dramatic basis. Instead of telling us a story, it simply shows a series of events. It is like eating the individual ingredients from a pie, instead of enjoying an already cooked pie.As for the special effects, some ones are laughably bad (like the crash from a helicopter), but the cosmic landscapes, the visit to Oa and the manifestations of green energy are the only elements from the film which make justice to the comic. On the other side of the coin, there are various moments which are so bad that they are involuntary funny. For example, the first appearance from the super-hero should have been epic and impressive; however, it is made with such a clumsiness that I was uncontrollably laughing.It is easy to note that Ryan Reynolds brought effort to his performance as Jordan/Green Lantern; pity that his character is so poorly written that he could not do too much with it. Blake Lively is insipid and not very credible as the romantic interest. Peter Sarsgaard brings energy and conviction to his character; on the opposite, Tim Robbins seems to have appeared in here only in order to charge a paycheck. Mark Strong shows enough credibility to avoid his character to fall into a living caricature; his screen-time in the film is very short, even though his character promises to have more presence in the following film.The one who does not promise any presence or interest in the sequel is me (sure, assuming the fact that some suicide producer from Hollywood will have the courage to authorize a sequel after this fiasco). I already had enough with wasting my money and my time with this hollow, disastrous and mortally boring film. In summary: stay away from Green Lantern.
I started watching the film Passenger with erroneous expectations because, for some reason, I thought it was going to be a horror film inspired by the Asian cinema, but it was not like that.Anyway, what it matters is that Passengers is a deeply mediocre film which has a very predictable ending and which recycles one of the most popular formulas the TV programme The Twilight Zone used 50 years ago.The romantic relationship between the two main characters does not work at all, because it does not feel honest and it feels very forced.But the main reason it does not work is because of Patrick Wilson (who had left me a good impression in the films Hard Candy, Little Children and Watchmen)'s irritating performance, since he never feels credible on his role.Anne Hathaway has good presence, but that is not enough for rescuing this movie.In other words, she does what she can with her character, which is not too much.Clea DuVall offers her typical cynicism and aggressive personality on her character; Dianne Wiest fits on her character well; and David Morse is credible on his role, in spite of his trite lines of dialog.Passengers is a really mediocre film with a boring screenplay, an over-used premise and a forced romance.With the exception of Wilson, the actors do their best effort, but that is not enough for rescuing this film.So, I recommend you not to see this boring thriller.After all, the only mystery Passengers provoked on me while I was watching it was when it was going to end.
I didn't expect to have such a good time with Wrath of the Titans, at the same time it could achieve everything that its predecessor had tried without any success. 2 years ago, the remake of Clash of the Titans was a tedious parade of visual excesses and uninteresting characters. As a consequence, the expectations I had before watching its sequel Wrath of the Titans were very low; however, this film returns to the well told narrative, measured humor and heroic spirit from the '80s adventure cinema, and even though it's far from being great, it's very entertaining without insulting our intelligence, and it makes us be interested in the characters.The main pro from the screenplay of Wrath of the Titans is that it brings us a clear and comprehensible narrative arc, which touches the bases of the classic heroic narratives...the call to action, the recruitment of allies, the supernatural help...in summary, nothing new, but enough well structured in order to capture our interest. I also liked the humor employed by co-screenwriters Dan Mazeau and David Johnson, and I'm not only talking about the comic-relief characters Agenor and Hephaestus, but also about the naughty tone which lightens the "Greek drama" (literally) a little bit without losing the gravity of the situation. The special effects are excellent, and I also appreciated the fact that they are used in order to be auxiliaries of the narrative, and not as apparatus arbitrary exhibitions which interrupt the story's flow. But don't worry...we still have a big number of explosions, creatures and epic battles with a scale which isn't common to find in films with a medium budget. Director Jonathan Liebesman (another reason why this movie pleasantly surprised me...his previous filmography includes the deplorable Darkness Falls, the boring The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning and the mediocre Battle Los Angeles) understood where to invest the money in order to achieve the maximum impact and entertainment.In the leading role, Sam Worthington feels a bit bland, but his character is much better written than in the first movie, because his motivation is much more tangible and real, and his relationship with his father is more sincere and realistic. Liam Neeson perfectly balances the divine power of his character with his humanity; and I also liked Rosamund Pike's performance.On the negative side, even though the screenplay is generally well written, it also includes a few passages and characters which are a bit confusing; in fact, I was given the impression that Wrath of the Titans was hurriedly re-edited in order to make it more agile, breaking the flow from some scenes as a consequence. That's not a very important fail, and it certainly didn't ruin the movie, but it "took me out" of the film in a few occasions. Nevertheless, I surprisingly enjoyed Wrath of the Titans pretty much, and I can recommend it as a very entertaining experience, which despite not being excellent, is hugely superior to the first film.
The fact that the fifth part of a franchise is superior to the four previous movies is something very unusual, even though it might be unfair to compare Fast Five to its predecessors, because this new film changes the formula pretty much, by being a bit away from the car races in order to become into a "heist movie". But there is nothing to worry about; despite the change of focus, the story conserves the automotive fetish and the challenging attitude from the heroes we already know. In my humble opinion, the result was a satisfactory transition which does not stop at anything in order to bring a very entertaining time...even though nobody can consider it intelligent, logical or realistic.As well as in the previous movies, it is not very convenient to analyze the screenplay from Fast Five very much. In order not to abandon the automotive fetish, every single part from the criminal mission planned by the main characters must be related to fast cars and locations which allow the presence of cute young women moving their rear in front of exotic cars, at the rhythm of Brazilian rap. But anyway, nobody will go to see Fast Five expecting a deep and meaningful story, but "action, action and more action!". And I think that the movie succeeded pretty much in it, because it perfectly alternates exciting sequences of automotive destruction with brief moments of introspection, whose clich√©s do not avoid their function of bringing some substance to the story and motivation to the characters. In other words, Fast Five knows when to full throttle in order to keep us very entertained, and when to apply the brakes in order not to make us loose the emotional dynamic from the main characters.As for the performances, I found them competent. Vin Diesel is overflowing of charisma and credible in his role; Paul Walker shows he keeps improving as an actor; and Jordana Brewster is correct as the love interest. Besides of their characters, screenwriter Chris Morgan also incorporated abundant characters taken from the previous movies, using them well in order to distribute the weight from the story, something which makes the drama more agile and the action, more dynamic.On the other side of the law, I liked the performance from Dwayne Johnson as Agent Hobbs; what is more, his character has a memorable fight scene with Diesel's one. Joaquim de Almeida is adequate as the villain, but his character is a bit generically written.However, I think that the absolute star from this movie is director Justin Lin, who in my humble opinion, consecrates himself as an authentic craftsman from the action genre. As an example, I would like to point out one of the few action scenes which do not involve cars; there is a frantic chase through the labyrinths from a favela, and even though it might not be the most spectacular nor elaborated scene from the movie, I was surprised by the way in which Lin (with the help of the brilliant editors Kelly Matsumoto, Fred Rakin and Christian Wagner) could keep the suspense, the excitement and the narrative clarity while he follows a dozen of character from three different factions (cops, criminals and villains) through the complex geography from a favela. I can imagine the confusing mess that would have turned out to be in the hands from a director like Michael Bay or Stephen Sommers. So, in conclusion, Fast Five might not be a great movie, but I think it deserves a recommendation like an exciting and very entertaining film which accepts its dramatic limits, recognizes the value from narrative balance, and takes the maximum advantage from its resources in order to create excellent action sequences which are undoubtedly absurd, but which result curiously appropriate into the universe from this franchise.
The post-modern "deconstruction" of the super-heroes genre has been a popular subject in comics since Stan Lee and Jack Kirby appeared on the pages of Fantastic Four discussing with the "real" heroes the stories they would publish in their "imaginary" comic.Since then, we have seen some movies which make a realistic analysis about the super-hero myth, either on a realistic way (like Watchmen) or funny (like Mystery Men).Defendor belongs to the first category, and even though it is not lacking of some laughs, its somber tone reveals that director and screenwriter Peter Stebbings wanted to do something deeper.In my humble opinion, he achieved it, and I liked this movie pretty much.I think it is a mistake to consider Defendor as a comedy; it undoubtedly has some funny moments, but the sordid situations it portrays and the main character's melancholy make it a human drama of an unusual deepness.The confused super-hero's prowess are the motor of the screenplay, and they also work to analyze various interesting subjects, from the treatment the mentally ill people receive in contemporary society to the economical hierarchies behind the street crime, which is always endorsed by "big fishes" who are beyond the law.However, the most interesting point from the movie is showing that we live in a society where the heroism, the initiative and the altruism can be seen as crimes when they do not fit into the rigid parameters of law.Sure, the eternal debate between "law" and "justice" impulsed many movies (and comics), but I liked the simultaneously honest and ambiguous focus from Defendor, because it shows both sides of the same coin, and it refuses to bring easy answers or convenient solutions to make us feel good.And besides of that narrative deepness, the characters are very interesting and the story is well structured.The fails I found on this movie is that some moments feel out of place in the context of the movie, and that a few moments were a bit tiring...fortunately, the movie quickly picked after those weak scenes.In conclusion, I think Defendor receives a safe recommendation because of the solid screenplay and the excellent performances from Woody Harrelson, Kat Dennings and the always brilliant Elias Koteas.I think the best element from Defendor is that it offers a very interesting alternative to the super-hero myth, because it has rarely been examined from its provocative angle.
I found The Hangover to be a brilliant combination of vulgar humor, likable characters and an unexpected vein of genuine emotion and friendship between the main characters, which distinguished it from many other movies from the contemporary "adult comedy" niche. Now, two years later of that movie, we have a sequel with the same cast and the same director, which leaves us with two possibilities: The Hangover Part 2 will capture the humorous magic from the first film without any difficulty...or it will miserably fail due to the pressure of the spectators' expectations and the arrogance from the creative team. The reality is that this sequel is on some intermediate point, because on the one hand, it has some funny parts and it preserves the good chemistry between the actors; but on the other hand, it relies too much on repeating the same elements from the first film, something which avoids it from getting the same level of surprise and irreverence.In order to give you an idea of how many things from the previous movie are repeated, I can mention the following examples (all of this was already shown in the trailers, so they do not qualify as spoilers): instead of finding a tiger in the room, the guys find a monkey; instead of having lost a tooth, Stu wakes up with a tattoo which covers half of his face; instead of losing the groom, the guys loose the bride's sister; instead of singing a song accompanied by a piano, they play a guitar...and I could go on. It seems that co-screenwriters Todd Phillips (who was also the director), Craig Mazin and Scott Armstrong simply sat in front of the computer, opened the file with the screenplay from the first movie and they replaced elements in every scene in order to adapt them to the new Asian environment. In other words, The Hangover Part 2 has one of the laziest and most disregarded screenplays I have seen in a while. However, that does not avoid it from being moderately entertaining.Following with the unavoidable comparison to the first film, I will also say that The Hangover had not only been very funny, but that it had also told a logical and consistent story, methodically following the clues from the mystery in order to "hook" on the spectator and make the improbable situations provoked by the epic drunkenness more credible. In The Hangover Part 2, there is not too much mystery nor emotion. Besides, even though some of the jokes from this sequel are funny, various other ones do not completely work. I think that the cast is the best element from this film. Ed Helms shows enough charisma, and he is well complemented by Bradley Cooper and Zack Galifianakis, while Ken Jeong brings a good amount of energy to his character, despite the fact his character's presence requires strong squeaks from the narrative gears.In conclusion, The Hangover Part 2 is a moderately entertaining but unnecessary and mediocre sequel of the first film...it is not nearly as funny, not nearly as ingenious and it is very far away from reaching the same subversive surprises from its predecessor. Nevertheless, I think that it deserves a slight recommendation because of the performances and some funny moments.
I think Judd Apatow recognized that a big number of movies have exploded his style of comedy to the satiety, and maybe because of that, he decided to do something completely different with his third movie as a director, which is also based on the inherent humor from immature adults, but with a more emotional and reflexive tone.However, Funny People is forced and pretentious instead of honest, and even though I appreciated its sober tone and some adequate observations, I did not like the overall experience very much.The main problem I found on Funny People was its main actor.I generally find Adam Sandler's strident and unfunny style intolerable (the first seconds of Funny People caused pain in my eyes, and I considered taking the DVD off).Sandler is a bit more tolerable than he uses to in Funny People, but that is not saying too much, because his performance does not feel credible enough.Another problem of this film is its running time: were two and a half hours needed to tell such a simple story?! It came a moment in which the movie got tedious, and I think Apatow needed more discipline and control with his direction, because there are many moments and characters which add nothing to the story.However, in spite of all those important fails, I cannot say I disliked Funny People, because I appreciated its good elements (besides of the previously mentioned ones, there are some interesting dialogs).I will give a slight recommendation to Funny People because of them, but I think the film should have been deeper, more honest...and definitely shorter.
My Bloody Valentine (1981) was one of the best rehashes of Friday the 13th and Halloween (1978) which came out in the 80's.That film had obtained a very solid combination between the grotesque scenes of violence from the first one and the party "gimmick" from the second one,but focusing on St. Valentine's Day instead of Halloween.Now, 28 years later, we have the very entertaining remake of that movie, offering us black humor and gory violence...in 3D.The screenplay from My Bloody Valentine (2009) is much more ambitious and interesting than the average slasher movie and although it loosed the focus on a few occasions,it brings some substance to the long chain of murders.The actors are very well adapted to the style from the movie and the movie has a frenetic rhythm which does not loose any time on showing us a great deal of violence,at the same time it has a sex scene which culminates on a simultaneously hilarious and disturbing sequence.On this film, we can expect aspects every movie made on 3D has, like objects flying to the spectators or elements which seem to go through the screen.Fortunately, My Bloody Valentine (2009) uses the system of alternating polarization which was perfected by the company RealD, instead of the hateful and very poor anaglyph system.To be brief, I will mention that the technique works very well on this film, because it definitely adds a lot of impact to it.Editor Patrick Lussier trained his director office on the world of straight-to-DVD sequels, and with crappy films on his filmography like Dracula II: Ascencion or White Noise: The Light, my expectations for this remake were very low.However, I took a very nice surprise with this movie, and Lussier shows that when he works with a solid screenplay, his work can be very competent.It is undoubtedly far away from being a great movie, but I really appreciated to see the 3D technique was endorsed by a competent screenplay, cast and direction, so I recommend this movie with confidence.
After the fever of "romantic vampires" started by the film Twilight, I expected Daybreakers with enthusiasm, not only because if offered a return to the violent vampires (who are more interested in drinking blood than in the feelings from their victims), but also because it added a sci-fi angle which is not seen very frequently in vampire movies.However, I took a disappointment with Daybreakers, because even though it is moderately interesting, it did not leave me very satisfied because its fascinating premise is wasted by a weak execution.In 2003, Australian co-directors and co-screenwriters Peter and Michael Spierig called Hollywood's attention with their entertaining film Undead, which added sci-fi elements to a horror story.Six years later, they came back with Daybreakers, and it is easy to note that they invested a considerable amount of time in the production design and in the complicated mythology from the movie; however, the screenplay feels superficial and incomplete.After establishing the basis of a fascinating universe, the screenplay wastes it on a hurried story with the obligatory dressings of romance, sacrifice and violence, but which is not very satisfactorily solved when we lead to the abrupt ending.In summary, the movie promises a lot at the very beginning, so it is a bit frustrating to see that after that, what we see is mediocre.Besides, Daybreakers leaves too many questions without an answer...some of them are simple "holes" that Spierig bros. could not fill in (Why do the humans insist on going out at night?), and other ones needed a logical explanation (Why not raising humans as we today raise cattle?).Also, I think Willem Dafoe's character was underdeveloped.Talking about Dafoe, he brings a competent performance, despite the superficiality from his character.Ethan Hawke and Claudia Karvan feel a bit bland on their roles; and finally, Sam Neill is appropriate as the villain.In summary, I think I can give a slight recommendation to Daybreakers, because it is moderately entertaining, its very beginning is very good and there are some good bloody moments.However, it left me with a bitter taste, because I know it could have been much better.
The film Sherlock Holmes was a pleasant surprise for re-interpreting the iconic character as an action hero, without making him lose his traditional deductive powers and brilliant analytical mind. But the main reason the movie worked was because of the excellent performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, whose perfect chemistry with each other made us believe the long friendship and professional affinity between their characters. Now, the sequel Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows preserves that funny relationship (I'm sorry, "association"), even though it made the mistake of neglecting the screenplay, recharging it with action scenes and taking itself too long in order to establish the point of the story. Nevertheless, I found this sequel entertaining, even though inferior to the original film.The screenplay from Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows pretends to emulate the logical labyrinths from the Sherlock Holmes stories, but it lacks of the meticulous elegance and narrative economy employed by author Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) in his books. On the opposite, the screenplay from Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is an arbitrary tangle of causes and consequences designed to simulate ingenuity, when it in fact is confusing and poorly raised. However, the screenplay fulfills with its function of taking us through the action and the serious moments with a certain sensation of dramatic impulse, bringing various opportunities to display Holmes' intelligence, Watson's bravery and tenacity, and director Guy Ritchie's ability to capture the deductive process from the detective with quick edition and slow-motion. Yes, he definitely exaggerates a little bit with such many sequences from that kind, but they are so well made that they are enjoyed even when they are obvious filler and aesthetic whim, instead of contributing to the narrative, like they did in the first film.As for the performances, Downey Jr. and Law also bring solid works in this sequel, at the same time that, as I previously mentioned, their chemistry with each other keeps being perfect. But the rest of the cast feels a bit wasted. Noomi Rapace is there only in order to be a female presence to balance the "bromance" between Holmes and Watson. The great Stephen Fry fits well as Holmes' brother Mycroft; however, his character does not feel very well integrated to the story. And Jared Harris does not have too much to do with the insipid way in which his villain character is written.In conclusion, I can give a moderate recommendation to Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows because, despite its various fails, I cannot deny it kept me entertained, even though it is not as amusing and ingenious as the first film.
Moon was the magnificent debut from director Duncan Jones, and a sci-fi film where the emotions and humanity from the main character predominated over the technical and "scientific" aspect. However, Moon was an independent film made with limited resources. What could Jones achieve with a big budget and Hollywood stars? We can see the answer in Source Code, an excellent amalgam of science fiction, thriller and personal drama, wrapped into a recursive structure which kept me in suspense the whole time.The screenplay from Source Code is certainly ingenious, because even though it has some similarities with the film Deja Vu, it is much better written and it is based on more solid scientific principles (even though nobody could confuse it with a documentary). Nevertheless, as well as it had happened in Moon, the most important thing in Source Code is not the realism of the "science", but the force of the emotions we share with the main character while he tries to fulfill with his mission. Despite the initial bewilderment, the main character accepts the conditions from an experiment in order to save hundreds of lives; but the affection he develops for a woman becomes into his main motivation, and that relationship is fortunately totally credible thanks to the solid and charismatic performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan. It was undoubtedly a challenge to generate empathy for characters trapped in a situation which, due to its own nature, does not let too much time to a development or an expansion. However, Gyllenhaal and Monaghan bring such good works that I could perfectly accept the relationship, as well as inferring the past their characters share. Well, they did not share it strictly speaking, but it seems so.I also liked Vera Farmiga's performance. On the beginning, her character's attitude has a cold efficiency, but when she finds out the circumstances, the empathy she feels for the man feels genuine and sincere, something which is essential for accepting some surprising twists the screenplay brings us near the end of the movie. Speaking of which, I do not know if the ending is completely acceptable from the logical point of view...but it is definitely hugely satisfactory from the emotional aspect, and it leaves us with an optimistic melancholy when the final credits start rolling. I will obviously not mention more in order not to ruin that delicious mystery on which the movie is based, nor the creative dominion of the quantum mechanics in order to tie up the loose ends.The only thing I can say against Source Code is the presence of a few logical holes in the screenplay. However, I enthusiastically recommend Source Code despite that minor fail, mainly because of the fascinating labyrinth of action, science and feelings it exhibits.
I have to confess that the book The Road did not leave me completely satisfied.I did not dislike it, but I found the narrative to be cold and monotonous.In other words, I appreciated the experience to some degree, but I did not find it to be exceptional.However, I am consent that its purpose was not to wonder us with displays of descriptive ingenuity or a flowery prose, but to transport us to the bleak world the characters live in.Now, I have to say I liked its film adaptation much more than the book, because screenwriter Joe Penhall found the way to tighten the screws from the story and eliminating all those elements which are not necessary to bring the characters and the narrative to life.The final result is an extraordinary film.The Road (from now on, every time I say the title, I am talking about the movie) is not impulsed by action clich√©s, or romance, or personal redemption.It does not either show us heroes saving the world or Machiavellian villains who plan a global conquer.It simply shows a man trying to educate his son with archaic (but important) values of morality, independence and discipline, not only to improve his survival possibilities, but also to honor a world which has already gone, and to maintain the hope for it to come back some day.In other words, this is not a conventional movie, but it definitely brings an unforgettable experience, which is simultaneously inspiring and deep.And something which helps the movie to be memorable are the monumental performances from Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee.Their best achievement is that they completely become into their characters, so they never seem to be acting at all.Mortensen had already proved his big talent in various occasions, but I think he brings his best performance so far in The Road.And as for McPhee, he is an authentic revelation, so I hope to see him in a lot of movies in the future.And I cannot forget to mention the brilliant cinematography; the fantastic production design; and John Hillcoat's excellent direction, which creates a perfect atmosphere and makes us to "live" the movie.In summary, The Road is a memorable and perfect movie which deserves the most enthusiastic of all the recommendations.If only we could have more films like this one...
Travel in time is definitely my favorite sub-genus of science fiction, and even though I equally adore the creativity of the Back to the Future trilogy, the historical humor of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and the apocalyptic solemnity of The Terminator, I also appreciate the independent films which deal the subject with more sobriety and philosophy. Films like Primer and Suspension have compensated their low budget and visual simplicity with provocative ideas which leave the mechanics of travel aside in order to focus on the melodrama created by the characters, proving that there's no need of flying cars or phone booths when there's an ingenious narrative inhabited by realistic and interesting human beings. Even though I didn't like it as much as Primer or Suspension, the film Safety Not Guaranteed fits into that group, even though it doesn't necessarily include too much time travel. Or maybe it does. I'm not sure...but that uncertainty is one of the best elements from this film.Safety Not Guaranteed isn't a traditional sci-fi film. There may be time travel, there may be not...but the point of the screenplay isn't finding temporal paradoxes nor playing with historical chronology, but gradually discovering the nature and interaction between interesting characters, each one of them focused into their own "adventure". Screenwriter Derek Connolly built a complex but accessible narrative tapestry, free of unnecessary filler and with ingenious parallels which aren't always apparent, but eventually lead us to a satisfactory ending.Connolly shows an efficient control over the multiple sub-plots, and they all share subjects in common. And then, we have the perfect performances from the whole cast. Mark Duplass brings a simultaneously likable and mysterious personality to his character, something which is very appropriate. Jake Johnson is very funny in his role; his performance is similar to the one he brings in the sitcom New Girl, even though it feels more emotive and sincere in here. Karan Soni is credible in his character, and supports the other actors very well. However, the revelation of Safety Not Guaranteed is definitely Aubrey Plaza, who is able to express multiple emotional levels with the grim face and cynical attitude of her character.On the negative side of Safety Not Guaranteed, I can't deny that there are a few pretentious and auto-indulgent scenes. And even though Ryan Miller's score generally complements the scenes well, it occasionally feels a bit affected. Nevertheless, I think Safety Not Guaranteed is a very good movie, and I can recommend it mainly because of its screenplay and its performances.
In 2005, the film Batman Begins...no...One moment!...The Batman films directed by Christopher Nolan don't require an introduction, because they form one of the most acclaimed film trilogies in modern History, and I think that the three of them are very good movies thanks to their excellent performances, somber tone and dramatic intensity. Having said that, even though I liked The Dark Knight, the second film from the trilogy, pretty much, I don't admire it as much as many people do. And even though I keep considering Batman Begins as the best film from this trilogy, there's no doubt that The Dark Knight Rises is an excellent film which satisfactorily concludes the trilogy and leaves the door open for future re-interpretations of this iconic character.The Dark Knight Rises bombs with information, characters and events which generally enrich the narrative, even though they occasionally obfuscate it. The first 30 minutes from The Dark Knight Rises incorporate us very well to the situation in Gotham and to the role of the characters in a social setting which might have less crime, even though it's not lacking of injustice. The movie keeps being well developed despite a few minor fails; and the last 45 minutes are genuinely extraordinary, not only because of the action, but also because of the screenplay's ability to tie the loose ends and solve the tangled story with an impressive congruence, making the spectacle not to obstruct the performances nor the delicate characterization of the characters. Besides, as a fan of Batman in the comics, I appreciated the inclusion from various elements taken from the sagas Knightfall and No Man's Land.I also liked Batman's kinda reduced appearance in The Dark Knight Rises; even Bruce Wayne takes a supporting role during some passages, letting the weight of the story to rest on the other characters. On some way, this reduces the quantity of action and stunts, but it reminds us of the fact that the "bati-universe" created by The Dark Knight Rises and its two previous films isn't based on traditional super-heroic exploits, but on the characters' internal conflict and on the drama generated by the crash of classes and ideologies in the realistic context of Gotham. Christian Bale brings a perfect performance once more as Batman in this film, but Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and the great Joseph Gordon-Levitt also bring excellent performances. Tom Hardy didn't have too much opportunity of displaying his performance with the mask he wears in here, but his physical development in the action scenes is solid. On the female aspect, Marion Cotillard brings an adequate performance, while Anne Hathaway makes a competent work as Catwoman.In conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises is a highly recommended film, because of Nolan's magnificent direction, the solid performances and the brilliant screenplay, even though it occasionally takes some unnecessary tangents. In summary, a fascinating experience which is worthy of admiration.
In general, the juvenile comedy genre disappointed me very much in recent years, due to the crowd of unbearable pieces of crap straight-to-DVD (such as, for example, Cougar Club and Picture This), which almost extinguished my taste for this underrated genre.So, without being a great film, I liked Fired Up, because it does not fall on the easy scatological humor; and even though it relies on the old formula of "louts looking for sex", it uses a context and a development which are enough different in order to separate it from many cheap clones of American Pie which try to occupy the niche created by gems such as Clueless, Weird Science and Can't Hardly Wait.In Fired Up, the technical aspects are correct, but they do not have too much creativity; the performances are barely functional; and director Will Gluck drives the movie with a good rhythm, but he does not show too much vision (a few interesting transitions are not enough to bring a visual identity to the movie).Fortunately, the screenplay from the movie comes to the rescue by creating entertaining situations which on some way conciliate the message of equality and tolerance the movie proposes.Finally, the characters are interesting and their dialogs are well written.In summary, Fired Up may not be a highly memorable experience, but it kept me entertained and it made me laugh, and I think it deserves a recommendation because of that.
I haven't read the popular novel Fifty Shades of Grey (and I will never do so), but I understand its attraction as pseudo- pornography attenuated by a varnish of artistic legitimacy which (partially) eliminates the "harcore" stigma which wouldn't be acceptable in a social context. It's the same trick employed by the artists of Renaissance ("human body is God's ultimate work!") and the spectacles of Las Vegas, whose supposed sophistication and elegance seem to justify the topless dancers. I don't have any moral objection against those sexuality expressions, and I understand the powerful fantasy of the shy and insecure woman who is suddenly seduced by a perfect man who doesn't rely on expenses or "big gestures" to conquer her. The problem comes when that is expressed in such a boring way as in the film Fifty Shades of Grey. To start with, actors Dakota Johnson (who had left me a good impression in the sitcom Ben and Kate) and Jamie Dornan don't have any chemistry with each other. Both are undoubtedly attractive, but I could never feel the passion their characters have with each other. Besides, the screenplay has horrible dialogs, absolutely forced situations, and an uncertain rhythm which accelerates when it should have taken its time, and slows down to accentuate the tedium of scenes which pretend to bring some deepness to the hollow characters. As for the controversial sado-masochistic content, I don't have any opinion... I'm not interested in that subject, and I respect those ones who enjoy it responsibly. Yes, it's hard to believe that the physical and psychological abuse portrayed in Fifty Shades of Grey is attractive to some people, but I'm not one to judge those unusual tastes. What is easier to quantify is the tremendous boredom Fifty Shades of Grey provoked on me. And what is more, this film ends with an abrupt cliffhanger I don't have any interest in seeing solved, so I won't invest any time or money in the two sequels Fifty Shades of Grey will have; I have already wasted enough of them watching this piece of junk.
I have officially lost my enthusiasm in this trend of "re-imaginating" fairy tales to modern audiences. By many monsters, anti-heroes and "dark" melodrama which are introduced to these traditional stories, the result tends to be too far-fetched, lacking of narrative gravity and, in the best of the cases, only marginally entertaining. And they are all visually impressive in order to distract us from their hollow characters and pre-fabricated structures. Snow White and the Huntsman fussily follows that formula, making Snow White an action heroine and creating new characters which work as filler, comic relief or simple "cannon fodder". In other words, a bland "goth" fantasy, which despite not being boring, is completely forgettable.Snow White and the Huntsman isn't a bad film; I just found it sterile and generic. On the positive side, director Rupert Sanders shows a good eye for the special effects, and he doesn't saturate us with them to the point of the weariness, like it happened in similar films. And even though the screenplay has various weak elements, its rhythm is agile, and I could see a slight effort to bring an appropriate motivation to the characters, as well as the dramatic arc which makes them evolve through the movie. Having said that, there's nothing original in the screenplay, and it seems to have been built with the exchangeable modules we already know: the villain showing evilness on an innocent victim; the heroine who proves (out of nothing) being a fierce combatant; the anti-hero with a tortuous past who must prove himself; the speech in order to inspire courage on the troops; the wise old man who knows more than what he says...well, anyone who has seen a fantasy film (or has read a book of the genre) will guess the development of every scene in advance. As I said, that doesn't make the film bad, but it steals us the emotion of the suspense and the catharsis of feeling that the main character defeats insuperable obstacles because of her quenching, and not for being interpreted by the main actress.Talking about the main actress, Kristen Stewart makes a very poor work in her role; she only displays two expressions in the whole film, which can both be described as confusing anguish and anguished confusion. Stewart can never transmit the weight of her character. On the opposite, Charlize Theron brings energy and conviction as the villain, while Chris Hemsworth is adequate as the anti-hero. The "midgets" are interpreted by various good actors (I'm referring to Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Ian McShane, Nick Frost, Toby Jones and Eddie Marsan), but I found the fact that they were "midgeted" by special effects a bit offensive, because actors with the correct physical appearance could have been hired.Even though I didn't like it very much, at least I have to say I found Snow White and the Huntsman superior to Alice in Wonderland (2010), Red Riding Hood (2011) and Mirror Mirror. I don't regret having watched this film, but I didn't find it very satisfactory, and I can only give it a slight recommendation.
The first 15 minutes from 12 Rounds have enough material for a whole movie: during a complicated operating designed to capture a dangerous terrorist we have many shootouts, chases, destruction of private property and a few revelations which a more serious and disciplined movie would have left for the ending.But 12 Rounds is not one of those movies, because its intention is not leaving that things like logic, credibility or common sense to be obstacles on its mission to entertain us.The problem is that 12 Rounds does not fulfill with its intention of entertaining.It seems simultaneously unusual and obvious that a wrestling company accepted to resurrect the formula of some 80's action movies, with a stoic hero, unidimensional villains and over the top action sequences which should be exciting but result to be tedious and badly filmed.So, it is perfectly logical that the homework of making this movie fell on director Renny Harlin, who sent his career to hell after big pieces of crap he made in Hollywood, like Cutthroat Island, Deep Blue Sea and Driven.12 Rounds is another piece of junk in Harlin's career.Ex-wrestler John Cena is absolutely bland on the leading role; the screenplay is very weak, because it is only based on creating arbitrary action sequences joined by a bad premise; the villain lacks of any personality; and the supporting cast is absolutely anonymous.In summary, I did not feel any excitement, suspense or interest in the hero's mission, or in the survival of the damsel in danger, or in watching the villain receiving what he deserves.To worsen the things, at being PG-13, we do not have brutality or gore in 12 Rounds, but insipid violence.When the movie gets close to the ending and the villain says "we lead to the great ending", I felt myself really well, because it meant I was about to take the DVD out and go on with my life.In summary, 12 Rounds is a horrible action film, which is absolutely boring and without any energy, so do not watch it by any means.
During the first minutes of Marley and Me,there is a scene which is so ridiculously cloying (a couple kissing on the snow,while the song from R.E.M. Shiny Happy People starts) which made me thought if the porpoise of that scene was ironic and that made me fill my enthusiasm because it made me to expect a satire of the "tender" movies in which an animal changes the life of a family.After all,I could not believe that a so sentimental and cloying scene like that one could have been made with the intention of taking it seriously.Unfortunately,when the minutes went by,I noticed there was not any irony on the screenplay and that the film was tremendously bland.I am a lover of dogs (of all the animals in general) and I have literally lived all my life with at least one (at this moments,they are four.I rescued them from the streets) of that animals.I really consider them as members from the family and not as disposable toys.I take care of them but my enthusiasm with dogs does not go to the level of considering them as kids.I think that from any point of view,we are all part of the same pack and I am perfectly comfortable as that.Because of that,the forced jokes from Marley and Me which show the dog making mischief irritated me pretty much because they could have been avoided with a little bit of common sense by its owners (Tying the dog to a plastic table? Really?).I make an explanation : I did not watch this movie as if it was based on actual events (although it is inspired by a book in which the author reveals his experience with a dog) and I hope I am not showing too much my ideology on this comment...I simply did not like the screenplay,which was written with minimum effort and which it is only worried on showing the "cute" factor from the dog and the things it does.I never felt the movie tried to build interesting characters,realistic situations or a solid and entertaining story.After all,I think Marley and Me is a more serious version of Beethoven and its unfinished sequels.They are not great works of art,but on this kind of movies,I liked My Dog Skip and Because of Winn-Dixie more; they also were pre-fabricated movies,but I found them more honest and entertaining than the irritating and artificial sentimentalism from Marley and Me.One of the few positive elements I found on this weak movie are the actors.Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson have good chemistry and I also appreciated the appearances from Dave Barry (my favorite comedian) and the great Alan Arkin.In spite of the cast,I cannot recommend Marley and Me.It bored me very much with its cheap sentimentalism and its irritatingly bland and cloying tone.
The influence of producer Jerry Bruckheimer in the film Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is evident, because his formula for creating Hollywood blockbusters is noted: young and attractive actors; a mediocre screenplay where there is not too much drama, but critical situations which can only be solved with chases, fights and many stunts; apparatus special effects; and a collection of clich√©s.However, I cannot deny that this movie kept me moderately entertained.The last time I played the video game Prince of Persia was in early 90's on an Apple PowerBook computer, so I am not very familiarized with the recent sequels from the modern platforms, and, as a consequence, I cannot evaluate the fidelity of the movie in respect to the original material.What I can say is that the screenplay is not very well polished, and there are many forced elements in it.The cast is the main reason this movie is not boring: Jake Gyllenhaal feels credible and enthusiastic as an action hero; Gemma Arterton is also solid, and she shows she was wasted in the tedious Clash of the Titans (2010)(which has similarities with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time); Ben Kingsley feels appropriately mysterious on his character; and Richard Coyle also brings conviction to his character.However, my favorite performance from this movie is the one from Alfred Molina, who made me laugh as the "comic relief", at the same time he brings a lot of energy to his character.So, the well filmed action scenes and the competent performances are what rescue Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and make it worthy of a slight recommendation, despite the facts that the screenplay is mediocre, bland and lacking of substance and that the movie lacks of passion.
It will be better to mention it on the beginning in order to get rid of it: North Korean hackers, Sony Pictures, death threats, blah, blah, blah. I don't know how much it can affect every spectator the considerable international furor and political intrigue caused by the film The Interview before its release, but I had frankly got bored of such a coverage, and I feel that I could watch the film without any prejudices. And I have to say that I found The Interview an entertaining comedy. However, it's not very memorable. The story flows correctly in general, but some digressions don't work very well (such as the romance between Aaron and a high governmental official), and some jokes are funny the first time, but they end up getting a bit irritating when they receive more attention than they deserver (such as the use of Katy Perry's music). James Franco and Seth Rogen repeat their usual comedy routines in this film, while Randall Park takes his character seriously and avoids him from becoming a caricature and Lizzy Caplan makes a decent work as Agent Lacey. So, independently from having started the first world cyber-war, I found The Interview entertaining, and I can give it a moderate recommendation. I guess that The Interview might seem offensive for North Korea, but it doesn't make fun of Kim Jong-un or trivializes the difficult situation from that country. For the case, the series 30 Rock made a much more acid and incisive satire of the Supreme Leader in its sixth season, when they made him a recurring character played by Margaret Cho. Fortunately, nobody hacked NBC or KableTown for that transgression.
When I saw the trailers of Hanna, I thought that it was going to be something like the unofficial sequel of The Professional I had always imagined: the girl trained to kill following the steps from her father (or whoever he is) with stylish violence and dynamic cinematography. The reality ended up being a bit different, and even though I liked Hanna, it did not leave me completely satisfied.To start with, I found the tone from Hanna a bit irregular, because it is occasionally inflexibly realistic, while in other moments, it is too stylish and fantasy-like in order to be taken seriously. As an example, I can mention (slight SPOILER of something which happens during the first 20 minutes from the film) the escape from the main character of the high-security place where she is interrogated about the location of her father. The sequence combines solemn military procedures with action sequences which seem to come from a comic written by Warren Ellis. In other words, there are meticulously realistic scenes, followed by "spy-pop" scenes which seem to come from The Man of U.N.C.L.E., with large subway holes, strobes and generic soldiers using uniforms from the '60s ready to be killed by the ingenious main character. Do not misunderstand me...I enjoyed that sequence, as well as the rest of the movie; but I think that screenwriter Seth Lochlead and director Joe Wright should have decided themselves for only one road, either if it was an intense spy thriller, or a comic-like fantasy.However, I had a good time while watching Hanna, mainly because of Wright's dynamic direction, and specially, the excellent performances. Saoirse Ronan is absolutely perfect and worthy of applause in the leading role. Eric Bana makes the transformation his character makes from a mountain hermit to a secret agent absolutely credible. And finally, the great Cate Blanchett brings multiple nuances to her character.Going back to my complains, I felt the screenplay a bit hollow. After all, the whole movie feels like a chase, which does not leave enough time to deepen into the most enigmatic elements from the story. In other words, I wish the film had offered more depth and less shape. Besides, I was a bit disappointed by the fact that the action is not very strong; I think that if the violence had been more brutal and realistic, it would have worked better as a contrast to accentuate the drama from the main character and the contradiction from her existence. Nevertheless, I think that Hanna deserves a moderate recommendation, because I found it an entertaining action film.
In the films Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Good Night and Good Luck, director George Clooney showed a very solid vision, which put him on par (or even above) more acclaimed filmmakers; but the stridently political screenplay from his most recent film, The Ides of March, along with its trite message, make it much less ambitious than the two previously mentioned movies, and as a consequence, it is much less satisfactory. Fortunately, the excellent performances help the movie and make it moderately entertaining despite its various cons.Foremost, I would like to say that The Ides of March is not ANOTHER tiring denounce against George W. Bush, the conflict in Iraq or the war on terror. I think that we have already surpassed that stage, even though there are still many subjects to be examined in the cinema "with a conscience". What co-screenwriters Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon wanted to do with The Ides of March was not attacking a political party in particular, nor a person nor an ideology, but to the system itself, in which the straightness and the honesty become obstacles in order to advance in the road to power. That is a definitely important message, but...Does it really need to be repeated? Isn't it enough with only watching the news to find out that it has always been like that, and it will probably keep being so? I would have preferred the screenplay to include some other angle (such as the economical crisis, the addiction to oil or the election scandals), because that may have made this simplistic lesson about the obvious realities of contemporary politics more interesting.Besides, I did not find the existence of an intelligent, honest and fair governor, who denies himself to participate in the dirtiest tricks of the profession in order to guarantee his presidential bid, very realistic. Then, how the hell did he get to being a governor? By kissing babies and shaking hands with his voters? And, for the case, how is it possible to believe in a brilliant political strategist who works in function of his moral principles, and not because of the money and power he can win in a long-term? I mean, we are not in the era of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington anymore, in which the main character changed the course of the country with integrity and a smile. And even though the things get quickly sour to the characters of The Ides of March, the drama only works if we believe in their straightness from the beginning of the film.At least, I liked the ending, and as I previously mentioned, the performances are the main reason why The Ides of March kept me moderately interested, and not only the ones from Clooney and Ryan Gosling, but also the ones from the supporting cast, in which we find Philip Seymour Hoffman making a flawless work as the overwhelmed leader of a campaign; Paul Giamatti stealing every scene he's in as Hoffman's character's rival; Evan Rachel Wood bringing an appropriately innocent and sensual attitude to her character; and Marisa Tomei in a short role she perfectly interprets. In conclusion, brilliant performances in a movie which is excessively light in shape and elementary in substance. Nevertheless, I will keep following Clooney's career as a director with interest; I just hope that, in his future movies, he works with more ingenious, or at least more credible, material than the one from The Ides of March.
I do not consider myself a fan of director Terrence Malick's, but with the exception of The New World, I liked his movies because they possess an intense sensibility which captures the prepared spectator and transports him/her to the universe the characters live, in order to share their experiences and speculate about their motivations. And besides of that, we have the visual quality Malick brings to those movies, which combined with their ethereal atmosphere, brings them a spiritual and dream-like tone which we do not see from any other filmmaker (maybe with the exception of David Lynch, even though I would not dare myself to compare them because their films possess a completely different tone). What brings me to The Tree of Life, Malick's most recent film, and maybe the densest one in ideas and most ambiguous one in narrative. The result is not great, but I definitely found it very interesting.If it had not been made with such a visual beauty and emotional honesty, I would have laughed at the huge ambition from The Tree of Life. And if I were more cynical, I would say that I would have found it a combination of naturalist documentary and pretentious art-house cinema with an excessively obtuse message in order to take it seriously. However, Malick's direction and his fine dramatic instincts make the substance to transcend the shape, becoming the slowness from the movie into methodical reflection, and the arbitrariness from its narrative into a puzzle which invites us to solve it, not necessarily for us to know the hidden shape in its fragments, but to discover the value from the process itself. On the other hand, I understand that not every person will accept the homework of deciphering the intentions from a film which does not seem interested in telling a coherent or conventional story. And The Tree of Life certainly suffers from some of the symptoms from the most pretentious independent cinema, like some whispering dialogs which in fact say nothing, and confusing manipulation of time without an apparent purpose.As any work of art worthy of being, The Tree of Life is deeply subject to the personal interpretation. So, some people will take this film as a cathartic and intensely personal religious epiphany; to other people, the film could confirm the power of the pitiless natural order over the spiritual fantasies from the egocentric human beings. In other words, the juxtaposition of prosaic domestic routines with views from the space might mean that the life, the memories and experiences from humans are as vast as the universe itself. Or it might mean that the big tragedies, moments of happiness and decisions from our lives are inconsequential into the big scheme of the universal existence. I honestly do not know, and I am not worried in defining it, because I think that the experience itself of watching The Tree of Life is more important than its message.The Tree of Life never bored me, because its mere combination of music and images made it a very interesting spectacle, with a beautiful visual style and a good level of emotional potency. So, I do not think it is a great film, but I think I can recommend it as an innovative experience (as strange as the comparison might sound, I would describe The Tree of Life as a combination of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and 2001: A Space Odyssey -even though I did not like it as much as those two films-).
I have never been a fan of the fight videogames.Sure, I played the most famous games from the genre (Mortal Kombat, Virtua Fighter, One Must Fall and various iterations of Street Fighter), but I did not find these game strategies to be satisfactory: 1)frantically pressing buttons with the hope of achieving combinations which let us win the fight; and 2)spending long hours on the slow test and mistake process in order to learn those combinations.However, I understand the attractive those videogames has on so many people, because in some way, they simulate the fights we have seen on several martial-arts movies.So, I guess there is an ironic element when the roles are reversed, and a video game inspires a movie.The most recent example of that is the film Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, and the result is truly horrible.Like it happened on the recent Dragonball: Evolution, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li exploits the name of a popular franchise for bringing us a pathetic martial-arts movie.This film does not take advantage of its exotic location (Bangkok); it has a disastrous, stupid and deeply tedious screenplay; and the fights are very poorly filmed.On the leading role, Kristen Kreuk makes a good effort, but the material is so poor that she cannot do anything with her role.And I liked to see the Asian superstar Robin Shou on this movie, because I was so terribly bored with it that I started to remember some competent martial-arts movies he participated on (like DOA: Dead or Alive and Mortal Kombat, which were also based on videogames).Speaking of videogames, director Andrzej Bartkowiak's previous film was Doom, and even that piece of crap was better than Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.The deep incompetence from this film made me to remember with a bit of nostalgia the previous version of Street Fighter, which starred Jean Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia (1940-1994) 15 years ago.That film had been ridiculous but very entertaining, and the horrible quality of its successor made me to have a bit more respect for it.So, of course that my suggestion is to stay very far away from Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li. If you wanna see an excellent martial-arts movie, I highly recommend you Kung Fu Hustle, Fearless (2006) and Hero.
From the first seconds of 300: Rise of an Empire, it's clear that director Noam Murro pretends to surpass the violence, visual deployment and epic scale of the original film 300. And he achieved that on some way, but, in order to achieve that, he had many millions of dollars, various special effects studios and another detailed storyboard in the shape of the unedited comic Xerxes, written and illustrated by Frank Miller. However, what was visually very attractive in 300, nowadays feels tiring because of such a parody and repetition. Without that "surprise factor" and with an unnecessarily tangled screenplay, 300: Rise of an Empire feels like a mediocre sequel (even though it's not really a sequel, I call it like that in order to save time). On the positive side, I have to admit that 300: Rise of an Empire managed to keep me moderately entertained despite its various fails, and that its technical aspects are definitely solid. And I'm glad to say that the best element from this film has nothing to do with pixels, but with the human factor: Eva Green bring an intense, aggressive and completely credible performance, with a powerful scenic presence which captures the audience and brings energy, something which the rest of the cast is incapable of achieving (specially Sullivan Stapleton very insipidly playing the hero, with a lot of muscles and beard, but few talent and charisma). In conclusion, I can give a slight recommendation to 300: Rise of an Empire because it didn't bore me, but at the same time, I can't deny the fact that the film has various negative aspects. It was maybe not a good idea to leave the film in the hands of a director whose only previous experience was the modest indie drama Smart People. Wasn't someone more qualified available?
Even though it is generally enough with a good screenplay, good direction and good performances to leave me satisfied with a movie, it is indubitable that the richest cinematographic experiences are those ones which are based on ideas...their discussion, their expression and even their denounce.A good story can keep us entertained for a couple of hours; but an idea can change our lives, even if it is transmitted by a medium which is rarely famous for its intelligence (I am talking about modern cinema, of course).The film Agora may not go as far away as that, but it definitely has enough ambition to present a simple truth by a complex way, because of the historical context where it sets it as well as for the multitude of perspectives it uses in order to examine it.The previous filmography from director Alejandro Amen√°bar includes two excellent movies (The Others and Mar Adentro), but I think that Agora is his best work so far, mainly because of the passion he brought to this film.I also have to mention the extraordinary manufacture from this movie, from Xavi Gim√©nez's beautiful cinematography to the perfect combination of vast real settings with digital extensions which bring the city of Alexandria to life.However, that does not mean that Agora is precisely faithful to the historical reality...it simply proposes a theory about the destiny of the Alexandria Library, as well as an interesting conjecture about the methods and scientific discoveries from the fascinating main character.I think that the "dramatic license" from co-screenwriters Amen√°bar and Mateo Gil is perfectly acceptable, because I do not go to the cinema to receive a History lesson.I would also like to make a mention to the message this movie leaves, which is also absolutely interesting.Some people may take those ideas as a historical analogy about the current religious conflicts around the world.However, I think that the message goes beyond of bringing us another lesson about the danger of religion when it is connected to the government.I think that the main message from Agora is that religion is only the favorite excuse of some people to impose their will on other people, and justify any different point of view as "malignant".Besides, Agora's epic narrative is based on an intimate story full of intense emotions.And that leads me to the brilliant performances from Rachel Weisz, Max Minghella, Oscar Isaac and Sami Samir; they all express even the most complex emotions with the most subtle expressions and looks.The only fail I found in Agora is that some details from the screenplay feel a little bit forced and simplistic.However, that does not avoid me from very enthusiastically recommending this excellent movie, which besides of keeping me very entertained, also left me thinking.
The Railway Man is a film which vividly portrays the psychological consequences of war, and the unusual way a victim found to overcome his trauma (or at least try it). The performances are excellent; the production is modest, but meticulously designed, with an abundant historical detail and a solid cinematography; and director Jonathan Teplitzky and co- screenwriters Frank Cottrell Boyce and Andy Paterson keep the emotional content under control. Colin Firth brings a magnificent performance, which overflows passion under his stoic appearance. Nicole Kidman also brings a subtle and detailed work as his character's comprehensive wife, and Stellan Skarsg√•rd also makes a very credible work in his brief but important role. Having said that... I found the scenes with those actors a bit repetitive and curiously distant, something which made lose a bit of interest despite the brilliant performances. Fortunately, that's only one half of the movie; to my surprise, the best part of this film is the flashbacks of World War II, where the main character (in this case, perfectly played by Jeremy Irvine) tries to keep some dignity and control in front of the physical and psychological tortures he suffers. During those scenes, The Railway Man becomes a solemn version of The Great Escape, with the prisoners planning some way to escape, not because they have any chance of doing it, but just to keep their moral and find the internal strength to help them overcome the abuse. I would have frankly preferred the whole film to be like that, maybe using the modern parts as prologue and epilogue; but no... the dramatic knot of the story is the eventual confrontation between the main character and his captor many years later, which I found less interesting. Nevertheless, even though it didn't leave me completely satisfied, I can give a moderate recommendation to The Railway Man, specially to those who like reflexive and parsimonious art-house cinema, which isn't based on over the top drama, but on the gradual increase of emotions.
I tend to see with distrust any movie which includes a Hollywood star interpreting a mentally handicapped character.The simple fact that a famous actor (who is a man in most of the cases) wants to portray a role which so far away from his reality is something impossible to assimilate in my case, because in most of the cases the movies end up looking like crude parodies...or an offensive joke to the people who suffer from similar affections in the real life.I think the only time I liked a performance like that was with Leonardo DiCaprio in the excellent What's Eating Gilbert Grape...but thinking it well, I am doing some trap with that exception, because back in those days (early-90s), DiCaprio was an almost unknown actor who only had a few TV series and a "B" movie (Critters 3) on his filmography.Even when Robert De Niro interpreted a mentally handicapped character on the film Awakenings (which was 10 years before he lost all kind of interest in his career), I did not believe in his performance for a second.Because of all that, I went to see The Soloist without too much enthusiasm.However, I must admit that The Soloist resulted to be better than I expected, although I did not find it to be very satisfactory.First of all, let's see the positive points.Robert Downey Jr. brings a credible and honest performance.Jamie Foxx has the dangerous role of the mentally handicapped man, and I like to admit he made a good work on it, because his deep involvement with his character shows conviction and realism.And we also have solid performances from a group of talented character actors, composed by Catherine Keener, Tom Hollander, Stephen Root and the great Rachael Harris.And finally, I appreciated the fact that this movie wanted to do something different to the lachrymose drama it could have been.However, at the same time, I felt the story to be cold, impersonal and a bit tiring, because of the lack of focus from the screenplay and Joe Wright's diffuse direction.This movie has various pointless moments, and Wright lost the narrative flow a little bit, at the same time he made some very doubtful decisions, like for example moving the camera constantly and orchestrating complicated scenic choreographs in order to capture precise moments between the actors.What I wanna say is that his direction feels completely out of place in the context of this movie, because the narrative required a more intimate and sober work.I think The Soloist deserves a slight recommendation, because it is not lacking of some interesting elements, and mainly, because of the performances, although the experience did not leave me very satisfied.
By watching its poster and trailer (not to mention its main actors), it seems that the film Love Happens is another typical romantic comedy destined to perpetuate the artificial love fantasies popular entertainment regularly brings us.However, this film's reality is a bit more complicated, because even though the main formula from the genre is used in here, Love Happens is more of a drama, which bored me pretty much, but I cannot deny it has a brilliant performance from Aaron Eckhart.If the leading role had been given to a less talented actor (like, for example, Matthew McConaughey), this film would have been atrocious.But Eckhart is absolutely flawless in his character, and the mere intensity he brings to his presence is what makes Love Happens to seem better than what it really is.However, I do not see too many more positive elements in this film.To start with, Jennifer Aniston feels a bit bland on her role, and the screenplay has a combination of incompatible elements which damage the drama with forced frivolity.As an example, I can mention a sequence during the second half of the movie, which should be its narrative axis...and instead of that, it becomes into a stupid slapstick routine with the help of a cockatoo.Yes...it is as horrible as it sounds.And, as the ending gets closer, the level of hollow sentimentality increases to the point of the auto-parody.By the way, the obligatory "big gesture" at the end tries to make us cry at all costs, but it frankly made me laugh.Despite Eckhart's excellent performance, I cannot recommend Love Happens, because it bored me very much, and, in my case, it was unintentionally funny near the ending.
The studio Ghost House Pictures was created by Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert as a modest producing company specialized in horror films of a low cost but high profitability. And even though the "geek" credentials from Raimi and Tapert are perfect (just for having created the Evil Dead trilogy in cinema, and Xena: Warrior Princess on the TV), the movies which Ghost House Pictures initially produced weren't good; fortunately the situation later positively changed with the films Messengers 2: The Scarecrow and The Grudge 3. They weren't great movies, but they could find the way of continuing their respective franchises with a certain level of artistic credibility and technical expertise. Now, the tendency keeps improving with the film The Possession, because I found it a very competent horror film with solid performances, good direction and a well written screenplay.A film to which The Possession can be compared is The Unborn, because both deal with similar Jewish traditions (by the way, a religion which doesn't even recognize Satan), along with an open and flexible mythology about what a "possession" represents. The difference might not be substantial on the practical aspect (after all, The Possession employs clich√©s such as "girl speaking with a masculine voice", manifestations of insects and eyes in white), but on some way, it was refreshing not to find the obligatory Catholic iconography, or the typical priest having doubts about his faith, or any of the other stereotypes employed in films such as The Last Exorcism, The Rite and Exorcismus.But anyway, as I said, those differences are superficial. What mainly distinguishes The Possession is its care to build honest and credible characters. The relationship between the divorced parents is realistic, and it's not exploited with dramatic means. The girls aren't improbable "miniature adults" nor hateful "mean girls", but sisters with an obvious fraternal affection, even though they occasionally don't share opinions. And those interesting characters are endorsed by the good performances. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is totally credible as a man with good intentions which are occasionally sabotaged by bad decisions. Kyra Sedgwick brings a sincere humanity to her character, while Madison Davenport contributes emotionally to her scenes, and Natasha Calis is equally natural during the domestic moments, the possession scenes and the moments of transition, where she must perfectly delimit where the girl ends and the demon starts...or whatever inhabits that wooden box.In conclusion, The Possession isn't an excellent film, but I liked it pretty much because of its interesting screenplay, competent direction and credible performances, not to mention the appropriate music and the special effects (which are employed with a refreshing moderation). So, I recommend The Possession as a very solid horror movie.
I never watched the TV series The Smurfs, because I was already an adult man by the time in which it was released in my country (Argentina), so needless to say that I never collected the toys either. In summary: I feel an absolute indifference for those characters. In spite of that, I went to see the movie The Smurfs, and I found it tedious, repetitive and totally unfunny.I guess that the idea of setting this film's story in New York did not obey to a creative epiphany, but to the convenience of filming in real scenarios, instead of spending money to digitally reproduce the miniature village where the smurfs live into giant mushrooms. Besides, the change of location opened many possibilities of earning money with "product placement" disguised as comedy, but that is so obvious and bulky that it irritated me. As for the screenplay, it is genuinely pathetic. In spite of that, Neil Patrick Harris and Hank Azaria managed to bring enthusiasm and credibility to their performances.As for the voice acting, I found it adequate, highlighting the works from Jonathan Winters, Katy Perry and Alan Cumming. However, The Smurfs bored me to tears mainly because of its horrible screenplay and listless direction. I guess I could have not expected more, because director Raja Gosnell was previously responsible of the execrable movies Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo: Monsters Unleashed and Yours, Mine and Ours (2005).
Although the brilliant director Mike Leigh is more famous for his dramas (like Secrets and Lies,Vera Drake and Naked),it is obvious he posses a good sense of humor behind his artistic solemnity,like he has shown on Topsy Turvy and the underrated Career Girls.Happy-Go-Lucky fits on the second style and although it is not among his best movies,I found it to be a very interesting psychological study which is disguised as a sympathetic comedy.The story from this film is simple,but it is enough for keeping the interest for two hours.You do not have to expect plot twists or catastrophic events before watching this movie; just contemplating the main character on her ordinary life we find moments of humor,realism and meditation which are enough for making the experience entertaining and very interesting.Besides,the constant tone of happiness from this movie is contagious for the spectator (or at least it was for me).Sally Hawkins received deserved acclamation for her extraordinary performance on this movie,but the excellent supporting cast is also worthy of mention,because it is perfectly adapted to the tone of the movie.There are a few fails on this movie.For one side,there are some forced elements on the screenplay and then,there is a moment in which the rhythm of the movie goes a little bit down.But that is not too bad,because it quickly picks.Happy-Go-Lucky is a very interesting movie I recommend with confidence.This is another good addition to Leigh's filmography.
I like various musical films very much, such as Jesus Christ Superstar, The Rocky Horror Picture Show and The American Astronaut. And I would also include films which don't exactly fit into that category, even though their stories are related to music, such as School of Rock, The Commitments and Phantom of the Paradise. In fact, I generally like those ones more, because they employ well defined songs played in a logical context (rehearsals of a music band, the staging of a rock opera, etc.), unlike the "traditional" musicals, where the characters limit themselves to arbitrarily sing the dialogs, many times without a rhythm or a specific melody... just an irritating singsong which doesn't seem like a song or allows the natural expression of the performances. Some examples: West Side Story, Les Miserables (2012) and, unfortunately, Into the Woods. I hated these three musical films, because it was very difficult for me to tolerate their affectations and artificiality. Into the Woods was a truly insufferable experience for me. Its main problem is a tedious and badly structured screenplay, which makes too much of an effort to combine fairy tales without any logic or dramatic integrity. Yes, they are fairy tales, but that doesn't excuse the absolute lack of ingenuity or narrative flow. An example of how disastrously written this film is: when it seems that everybody will live happy forever, and that the ending of the film has finally come, we still have 45 minutes of "story", in which screenwriter James Lapine pathetically digs into the characters to find dramatic crumbs he then proceeds to inflate in order to bring the impression there's some kind of "message" or sense in this piece of junk. And besides of that awful screenplay, we also have Rob Marshall's horrible direction and diffuse and atonal "music". With the exception of Meryl Streep (who I found as forced I use to), the actors somehow managed to make a decent work in their roles, highlighting Anna Kendrick and Johnny Depp. However, they couldn't compensate the soporific experience I suffered with Into the Woods. I haven't seen the musical play on which this film is based; it might have been good, and something went terribly wrong in its translation to the big screen. Anyway, Into the Woods is one of the most unbearable films I have seen in a long time, and I truly regret having watched it. On the positive side, the fact that this execrable movie was nominated in the Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical at the Golden Globes confirms my contempt against the Hollywood awards, which are many times driven by popularity instead of quality.
I liked the series Sex and the City very much.Its brilliant screenplays made sharp feminist commentaries,and they also told intelligent and well structured stories.However,the movie of Sex and the City had not interested me too much,because I thought they were going to make a forced product made with the intention of making some money and not with the intention of telling a good story.So,I passed seeing this film on a cinema and I decided to rent it.My expectations about this movie were not wrong.Sex and the City (the film,obviously) resulted to be a very boring movie without a good story.Instead of telling a solid story,this movie only shows predictable elements from the romantic comedies and an obsessive emphasis on the fashion.That two elements had also appeared on the series,but they had as an endorsement realistic and intelligent stories.But,on this film,they do not have an endorse,so it bores pretty easily.Plus,this movie is excessively long.145 minutes are way too much for a movie like this,so I felt the running time from this film had been like 4 hours.I knew this film was going to disappoint me and I was not wrong.Sex and the City is a movie which bored me a lot and it results extremely long,while the series was enormously entertaining and their running time was perfect.I do not recommend this very weak movie.
Jupiter Ascending is a simultaneously simplistic and ridiculously confusing "space opera". We have seen its basic premise in an uncountable number of films: a normal person who discovers he/she is "special", and experiments a series of adventures which reveal unknown facets of the world (or the universe, in this case) and help him/her to mature. But in Jupiter Ascending, the context of those adventures and experiences is so scrambled and over the top that it was impossible for me to take it seriously. In summary, the film tries to be too many things, and ends up failing in all of them. Well, only one thing works: the special effects are truly impressive. For the rest, Jupiter Ascending attempted to combine the interplanetary politics of Dune with the action of Star Wars and the intrigue of Gossip Girl; but the ingredients of such disparate recipes are never combined harmonically, something which ends up producing frequent fluctuations of tone and logical inconsistencies. And like that, with bad jokes, laughable villains and bombastic music, Jupiter Ascending forcedly advances to its predictable conclusion, which lacks of suspense, excitement or even the slightest sensation that we are witnessing something epic or special. Regarding the cast, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum do whatever they can with their poorly written characters. And the least I say about Eddie Redmayne, the better; it's hard to believe that that pathetic performance comes from the same actor who made a magnificent work in The Theory of Everything. I don't know what happened to co-directors and co-screenwriters Andy and Lana Wachowski. I liked their first two films very much (Bound and The Matrix), but since then, they have declined very much, and every new movie ended up being more tedious than the previous one. I think their next project should be a small and independent film, in which they can display their narrative talent (if it still exists) and they don't have to worry about creating "cool" moments or spending millions of dollars in special effects, but simply tell a good story with interesting and realistic characters who haunt us with their humanity and authentic emotions. However, it's easier to write an apparatus space battle where there's no need to think, and leaves everything in hands of the post-production.
While I have liked some movies directed by Clint Eastwood very much (Unforgiven,Flags of our Fathers,Million Dollar Baby),I have found other ones to be a little bit overrated (Letters From Iwo Jima,Mystic River,A Perfect World).The ones I found overrated are not bad at all,but I have not found them to be too memorable,at the difference of so many people.So,I did not know what to expect from Changeling.And,while it is not one of his best movies,it resulted to be a very interesting and competent film.Angelina Jolie is an excellent actress but,before watching this movie,I was afraid that it was going to be a little bit difficult to accept her as a working class woman from the 20's.Fortunately,I was completely wrong.Her huge eyes and her lips perfectly adapt to the style of the 20's.But,besides of that,we have her extraordinary performance; it would have been very easy to exaggerate the crying and her expressions of pain,but Jolie did not fall on that easy trap.She does not exaggerate at all and she feels 100% natural and credible on every scene she appears.In other words,she never seems to be acting because she completely becomes into her character.Revealing too much about the story would be almost a sin because it has some truly unexpected surprises which would have been difficult to accept if the movie was not based on a true event.The screenplay is very well crafted,it offers us an important message,an intriguing mystery and well developed characters.Jeffrey Donovan (whose work on the series Burn Notice I enjoy very much) bring a very solid performance and he adds a sinister ambiguity to his character; Amy Ryan shines on her character; and it was a pleasure for me to see the excellent actor John Malkovich on a role which completely takes advantage of his enormous talent.Eastwood made a good work as a director; he obtained brilliant performances from all the previously mentioned members of the cast and he could find a good atmosphere.I also appreciated that this movie completely lacks of cheap sentimentalism; instead of that,it has a strong emotional intensity which feels honest and credible.On some reviews I have read about this movie,some of them say this movie is too cold,but they mention it as a negative element.I think that is a positive element because that coldness avoids the movie from having an excessive dramatic content.Still,there are some fails on this movie,which took some points out to it.For one sight,the performances from the childish cast are not completely solid.Although Eastwood made a brilliant work in directing the adult cast,I think he failed a little bit in directing the childish one.Plus,I think this movie needed a better edition on some parts,because it was a little bit dull on some certain moments.In spite of that negative elements,I can recommend this movie with confidence.It is not perfect but it is a very competent and interesting movie with a powerful message and excellent performances from the adult cast.It may not be between Eastwood's best movies,but it is definitely a good step on his career.
In the late-80s, I had read good comments (in Fangoria, Comics Scene, Starlog, etc.) about the Italian comic Dylan Dog, but I couldn't read it until the mid-90s, thanks to the North American editions of Dark Horse...and it honestly didn't impress me very much. The combination of horror and humor was moderately likable, but the "paranormal investigator" premise had already become a clich√© because of the TV series The X-Files, Millennium and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, not to mention the multiple literary characters belonging to that sub-genre (the comic Hellblazer, the short stories about Harry D'Amour written by Clive Barker, the saga of The Dresden Files, etc.). And already in that time, there was the rumor of a cinematographic adaptation possibly starred by Rupert Everett, on whom artist Tiziano Sclavi was inspired for the Dylan Dog image. The production lasted for more than 10 years in order to materialize itself, until the film Dylan Dog: Dead of Night was finally made. Unfortunately, the result ended up being truly deplorable.The screenplay of Dylan Dog: Dead of Night is a bad pastiche of scenes we have already seen in Underworld, Constantine, Lord of Illusions, Blade, Night Watch and the uncountable TV series which have continued the tradition of The X-Files (such as Special Unit 2 and Fringe). And even leaving that aside, the screenplay of Dylan Dog: Dead of Night feels very boring and unnecessarily confusing.Brandon Routh completely lacks of any credibility, charisma or presence in the leading role, while Anita Briem is genuinely horrible as the femme fatale. Dylan Dog: Dead of Night also fails as an adaptation of the comic, and its visual style looks ugly and "cheap".In other words, Dylan Dog: Dead of Night is atrocious as a supernatural "neo-noir", as a horror film, and as an adaptation of the comic. Don't make the same mistake I did, and avoid wasting your time and your money in this horrible experience.
I don't wanna say that Cars was Pixar's "worst" movie, because that would suggest the fact that it is bad. It would be more appropriate to describe it as "the least good one", because it offers good moments of humor, likable characters, extraordinary animation and interesting subjects. However, I think that it fell short on the emotional impact, ingenuity from the screenplay and the direction...at least considering the high standards we are accustomed to see in a Pixar film. That's the reason why the idea of a sequel seemed strange to me. Would they be looking for another opportunity to prove that the motoring universe from Cars has more potential than the one achieved in the first film? Or would it be a simple commercial strategy to repeat the success of the toys and commodity which was enjoyed by the original movie, something which compensated (to some point) its moderate box office success? I think that the answer is the latter, because even though I found Cars 2 moderately entertaining and funny, I think that it is the first purely commercial project from Pixar, because it seems to have been made with the only intention of promoting the mentioned toys and other commodities associated with this franchise. And I cannot deny that that left me with a bitter taste.If the idea of a world inhabited by living vehicles seemed a bit forced in Cars, the introduction of an action and espionage plot seems even more incongruent in this sequel, and I could not ignore all the logical holes that doubtful premise provokes (two examples: Why are there traditional houses in Paris and benches on the Tamesis' shore? Why does the Pope need a Popemobile?). In other words, Cars 2 is a much more childish film than the original one, despite the presence of action scenes, villains and heroes killing their opponents and mortal risks for innocent characters. As for the action scenes, they are well choreographed, but they rarely produce any suspense or emotion.Another problem is that the simpleton Mater is the main character in here, something which is consistent with the lighter tone from the screenplay...but at the same time, that makes the movie loose the generally efficient balance of humor and drama from the original film. At least, we have the solid voice acting from Michael Caine as a James Bond parody, and from Emily Mortimer as a rookie agent who must defeat her insecurities in order to save the situation; they both bring energy and personality to their voices.In the technical aspect, Cars 2 surpasses its predecessor with a better image quality, more expression on the characters and excellent special effects. In conclusion, I can give a slight recommendation to Cars 2, mainly because it is moderately entertaining after all. However, I also found it mediocre, and I think that it betrays Pixar's integrity, due to the fact that, as I previously mentioned, this mainly feels like a merely commercial project.
Even though he occasionally participates in more audacious projects (I Love You Phillip Morris, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), I think we can generally consider Jim Carrey as a victim of the "Eddie Murphy syndrome", whose main symptom is abandoning a genuine comic career in order to shelter into the bland and insipid family cinema produced by Hollywood. I guess that that is a valid economic strategy which allows him to win more money, but at the same time, it makes him to waste his talent with deeply stupid and predictable screenplays. Most of the family films Carrey has been involved in since the 2000's left me scratching my head with incredulity and some sadness for seeing a comedian who seemed destined to change the course of cinematographic comedy in his best times falling so low. What takes me to Mr. Popper's Penguins, the most recent pathetic family film in which Carrey has been involved. Mr. Popper's Penguins is so narratively insipid that it is terribly boring and predictable. You might be thinking that Carrey's humorous mania might rescue the situation to some point. Bad luck; Carrey interprets a busy but affectionate family man, while the penguins rule the roost of the "comedy", which is mainly based on their untimely fecal evacuations.In conclusion, Mr. Popper's Penguins is a bland, tedious and horrible film which I suggest you to avoid by any means, because it made me feel like wasting my time and my money.
It might seem strange the fact that director Michael Haneke, who is mostly famous for making thrillers, made a historical drama which emulates the visual chiaroscuro and the narrative melancholy from various films directed by Ingmar Bergman (1918-2007). However, the screenplay from The White Ribbon hides enough terrifying surprises to make it pretty tense, but the horror itself is left to the audience's imagination, limiting itself to show us the most mundane aspects which surround the moral and spiritual collapse from a small German town in the previous days to the start of World War I.The elegant manufacture from The White Ribbon reminded me of the European art-house cinema from mid-20th century, cold on its surface, but with boiling emotions which are hidden by the habitual protocol from "the old continent".The element I most appreciated in The White Ribbon is that the screenplay can be interpreted in various different ways. The historical period from the story (just before World War I) and the commentaries from the narrator (who seriously mentions "the bleak future from my country") can indicate that the movie tries to capture the social discontent which encouraged the nationalist movement...and the eventual rise of the Nazism. Something which can also be interpreted is that the point from the film is to show the inherent "evilness" which is developed from the intolerance. And it is also possible to conceive that what the film tries to say is that the evilness does not exist...the only thing we have is different points of view, where the atrocity committed by one person is the heroic act from another one. There are other levels of interpretation in The White Ribbon, but my point is that it was very interesting to see a film which can be interpreted on different ways, inspiring the spectator to think and draw conclusions.On the negative side from The White Ribbon, I have to mention that some moments feel a bit pretentious, and that there are some scenes which could have been deleted, since they feel a bit unnecessary in the context from the movie. Nevertheless, the solid screenplay and some excellent moments of anguish and tension are enough reason to recommend The White Ribbon as a very interesting movie.
I was not very interested in watching Cyurs, but after reading some positive reviews, I decided to risk myself and watch it, despite the fact that everything seemed to indicate another vulgar and excessively simple comedy which copies the style from director Judd Apatow. Fortunately, Cyrus ended up being very different thanks to a very interesting screenplay which aspires to a higher niche, where there is an authentic deepness in the characters and story.There are a few elements of modern comedy in Cyrus; but the screenplay's intention and the picturesque characters belong to the current tendency from independent cinema, obsessed with the "uncomfortable humor" from films like Sideways, The Savages and Friends With Money, which are not funny in the conventional sense, but which can provoke laughs due to the disparity from the elements they show, or due to the naughtily inappropriate situations they portray, or simple because we do not know whether to laugh or get horrified with the extremes reached by the characters. That is a difficult balance to achieve, and in my humble opinion, Cyrus could do it.I liked the performances from John C. Reilly and Jonah Hill very much, because their work feels improvised and natural but always careful from not caricaturing or exaggerating the defects from their characters. Marisa Tomei makes her character to empathize with the spectator despite the disturbingly close relationship her character has with her son; and Catherine Keener also feels credible in her role.What I can say against Cyrus is that there are a few moments which feel a bit dull and are a bit unnecessary. However, this movie ended up being much better than I expected, and I think it deserves a recommendation, because I found it to be very interesting.
I liked the Thai action film Bangkok Dangerous (1999).It was not a great movie,but it was entertaining,it had well done action scenes and it had also had the exotic "taste" the movies from that country usually have.Now,we have the crappy remake of that competent film.Bangkok Dangerous (2008) is a very bad action film which bored me very much.For one sight,the action scenes are badly filmed.They do not produce even the minimum level of excitement or emotion,so I did not care for what happened in them.One of the elements which had worked pretty well in the original film,was to make the main character a mute guy because that had helped to increase the dramatic complexity of the character.I thought it was a mistake to give him voice in this movie because,like that,the character completely lacks of complexity.Plus,I did not like Nicolas Cage's performance.I usually like his work,but on this movie he was unnatural and forced and I could never feel his emotional connexion with his love interest.Besides,the violence in this movie is completely insipid,so it never provoked impact on me.Bangkok Dangerous (2008) is another bad remake which committed the fatal mistake of boring me very much.Instead of watching this crappy remake,I suggest you to see the original film.
After reading so much about the shocking rawness and violence from the film Martyrs,I have to confess I almost had fear to watch it.When I finally saw it,I was left amazed by this brilliant movie,which has solid performances,a very ingenious screenplay and a disturbing intensity which makes it hugely superior to a lot Hollywood movies belonging to the sub-genus of torture cinema (like Hostel,Saw 5 or Captivity).The best element from this movie is definitely the screenplay.It is perfectly structured,and a little bit after half an hour,there is an absolutely surprising twist which puts the movie on a different context,at the same time it shows mental and physical torture to brutal levels which produced a lot of shock on me.The work of Pascal Laugier (whose previous movie Saint Ange had not left me very satisfied) was not only great on the screen writing field,but also on the directing field,because the cold and at the same time relentless tone of the movie makes everything to feel very realistic.Myl√©ne Jampono√≠ and Morjana Alaoui bring extraordinary performances,because they are 100% credible and intense on every scene they appear.The only fail I found on this movie is that near the ending,the screenplay has a few forced elements.But,in spite of some minor fails,Martyrs is a film which is completely worthy of admiration.I definitely recommend it to the fans of the horror cinema who are tired of all the remakes,rehashes and imitations the North American cinema usually offers on this genre.Comparing it with other extreme French horror movies,I would consider Martyrs to be very superior to the overrated Frontiere(s),marginally better than the brilliant Haute Tension and at the same level of A l'interieur.Martyrs is an undoubtedly difficult experience,and I dare to say it may result intolerable to some casual spectators.So,I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm but not without that warning.In my case,Martyrs was a devastating but unforgettable experience.
During the 70's, the 80's and the 90's, the mere presence of Robert De Niro in a movie was a guarantee of quality and artistic value.But, for some reason ($), during the 2000's, this prestigious actor wasted his huge talent in horrible comedies (like Analyze That and Meet the Fockers) and pathetic thrillers (like Hide and Seek and Righteous Kill), which showed how low a Hollywood star can fall when he limits to obey the requirements from his bank account.But now, Everybody's Fine looks like a positive augury for his future career.Well, I do not wanna exaggerate.De Niro clearly brings his best performance in many years in this movie; but compared with the work he did during the rest of the decade, that does not mean too much.The trailers try to sell Everybody's Fine as a comedy, but the film is in fact another affable familiar drama with pre-fabricated conflicts and an obligatory bittersweet ending.Fortunately, screenwriter Kirk Jones (who was also the director) had the common sense of moderating the sentimentality of the movie; I will not deny some moments sin of manipulation and artificial drama, but the film has a generally honest tone.By the way, Everybody's Fine is a remake of the acclaimed Italian film Stanno Tuti Bene, and I suspect the fans from the original will be disappointed for some changes which were made to it (for example, the references to the opera made in the original film were replaced by an obvious analogy between the telephone cables and the communication links the main character wants to have with his sons).As I mentioned before, De Niro brings a good performance in this movie, and I also liked the developments from Sam Rockwell (who was criminally ignored for his monumental performance in Moon) and Drew Barrymore, even though I thought her character was not very well written.The only member of the cast which seems out of place is Kate Beckinsale, who feels too "glamourous" for her role; I think an actress with the looks of a normal housewife instead of the ones of a Hollywood star should have been chosen.In summary, Everybody's Fine may not be highly memorable, and it has various fails (besides of the ones I already mentioned, I think it should have been a bit deeper), but it also offers various positive elements, and I think it is appropriate for having a good time.And I think that thing makes it worthy of a recommendation.
For better or for worse, Only Lovers Left Alive ended up being exactly what I expected... a vampire film directed by Jim Jarmusch. I have been a fan of this filmmaker's for a long time, and even though he has had a few missteps in his filmography, I generally enjoy his parsimonious narrative style, which sacrifices story in favor of atmosphere and richness of character. And even though I wouldn't place Only Lovers Left Alive, his most recent film, among his best ones, I liked it pretty much. Regarding the screenplay and atmosphere, Only Lovers Left Alive properly combines the traditional mystical of the tragic vampire (delineated by author Anne Rice) with the contemporary attitude from writers such as Laurell K. Hamilton and Poppy Z. Brite, adding a pinch of the pompous affectation from director Jean Rollin's vampire cinema. In other words, a vision with the best attributes from the genre combined with Jarmusch's undeniable style in order to add emotion and gravity. However, I can't deny the fact that I felt Only Lovers Left Alive a bit superficial; an interesting exercise of shape and style which couldn't find the necessary intellectual background in order to become something excellent. Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston bring perfect performances as two immortal beings whose considerable accumulation of knowledges and experience has left them a passive and philosophical perspective of life. Adam took the road of a "tormented artist", creating amazing music with retro instruments which has become a cult object, even though the artist refuses to publish it. On the other hand, Eve has a more bohemian life, enjoying the long and aesthetic experience from her long life. The film portrays them as two rock stars living a beautiful decadence, something which is undeniably "cool"... but there aren't authentic narrative foundations holding the attractive facade. Anyway, I enjoyed Only Lovers Left Alive pretty much, thanks to its elegant visual style, perfectly achieved atmosphere, good performances and extraordinary soundtrack.
If I did not know the story of Stuck was based on true events,I would have laughed of its premise.However,although the events shown on this film really happened,a lot of elements were changed for making the story more fluid.But the problem is that the story does not result too satisfactory.Stuck is not a bad film,but I think it is mediocre.On its most basic level,Stuck is a thriller which has impulse for the stupidities of its characters and all the bad decisions they take.I think that on some sense,it pretends to show the insensibility of the humanity and the difficult situation of North American society (or,thinking about it better,from the whole world) in which it is much more easy ignoring other people's tragedies.I also found on this movie,some touches of black humor director Stuart Gordon frequently puts to his movies (for example,King of the Ants) for making lighter the intense violence and drama.I appreciated that elements but the screenplay from this film lacks of personality and style.Plus,this movie lacks of any deep levels and,as a final result,Stuck is a hollow thriller.I am maybe being unfair because I should analyze the movie for what it offers and not for what it could have offered.And,also on that level,the movie is not too satisfactory.As I said,the screenplay lacks of personality and style and it is full of irrelevant elements which add nothing to the story.Mena Suvari does not completely fit on her character.She lacks of the intensity and dramatic weight her character needed.After winning fame for his excellent work on the horror genre,Gordon backed to the theatrical drama which made him start with his career and his most recent films have that style : small stories with very few locations and a group of characters facing unusual situations.But King of the Ants,Edmond and now Stuck,did not result too satisfactory,so I hope Gordon leaves a little bit aside this style from his most recent films.Stuck is not a bad movie and it kept me moderately entertained but it was a mediocre experience in my case and,as the previously mentioned King of the Ants and Edmond,it disappointed me after Gordon's excellent works on films like Re-Animator and From Beyond.
When I saw the trailer of Push,I thought it was going to be one of those cheap movies made at low cost in order to getting a release during the low seasons of the cinematographic industry from the year.The fact that this movie went completely unnoticed when it was shown in cinemas from the United States confirmed my very low expectations with this movie.However,I won some enthusiasm for this movie when I knew its director was Paul McGuigan,whose previous movie Lucky Number Slevin,was an unmemorable but entertaining and dynamic rehash of the formula which was popularized by Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and its many imitators.When I finally saw Push,I took a very nice surprise with it.It's not a great film,but I found it to be a solid and very entertaining thriller with an ingenious screenplay and interesting characters.The story from this movie is developed on Hong Kong and it was an excellent decision to do that,because the exotic taste from that city makes the movie richer,not to mention the obvious possibilities of comparisons with the popular TV series Heroes go down.McGuigan's direction is perfect.He puts to this movie a good level of energy and dynamism,but he recognizes the moments in which the narrative requires a more subtle and controlled work.The direction is,by my point of view,the best element from this movie.I also appreciated the sober use of the special effects,because they only appear as authentic auxiliaries to the story.The cast is very competent.Chris Evans shows energy and conviction on his role; Dakota Fanning confirms she has left behind her past as a mini-adult,for becoming into an excellent juvenile actress; the great Djimon Hounsou brings a lot of style and energy to his character; and Ming Na is also pretty good on her role.The important fails from this movie appear on the ending.On that moment,the movie shows absurd exaggeration for finally concluding on an ambiguous and not too satisfactory note.But,in spite of that,I had a very good time watching this movie.I took a very nice surprise with Push and I recommend it because,although it is not a great movie at all,I found it very entertaining.
Big part of the "humor" from Paul Blart: Mall Cop is centered on the same concept: the humiliation the main character suffers because of his obesity.The logic from this movie's screenplay seems to be the following: if a drunk man makes ridiculous things on a dance floor, it is funny; but if a fat man makes ridiculous things, is not it logic to think it will be hilarious? My answer is no, because that is simply not enough for holding a movie.I think there is some funny potential on an exaggeration of the typical security guard from a shopping, and I feel the film Mallrats captured the alchemical combination of arrogance and impotency from that people very well.Besides, on that film, those security guards were nothing more than peripheral characters who were an appropriate garnish of the comedy.But, that is not enough for holding an entire movie, which is what Paul Blart: Mall Cop tried to do.I think Kevin James is a solid comedian because his stand-up routines have shown a sharp sense of humor and appropriate observations.However, he seems to be absolutely lost with his character on this movie.The only positive element from this movie is Bobby Cannavale on an energetic performance...too bad he does not appear too much.Beyond that, we have bad performances from Keir O' Donnell as Blart's treacherous colleague and Heather Graham as Blart's love interest.But...wait a minute!...that was not Graham, but her imitator Jayma Mays.I guess that Graham made the good decision of declining to be on this piece of crap, and for a lesser cost, Mays provides a similar aesthetic and humorous style.Mays also worked as a replacement of Anna Faris on Date Movie...she is starting to have a career as a substitute of famous actresses who do not accept to appear on these execrable movies.I truly hated this deplorable movie, and my suggestion is for you to stay very far away from it.I cannot believe how this pieces of crap received the green-light in Hollywood.
A bit more than 10 years ago, Robert De Niro started to experiment with the comedy genre, and I have to admit that on the beginning, watching the classic tough guy from various movies directed by Martin Scorsese behaving like a buffoon in the films Analyze This and Meet the Parents produced funny results. However, over 10 years, we have seen De Niro wasting the good will from his fans in unfunny "comedies" (such as Analyze That and Meet the Fockers) and in involuntarily funny "serious" films (such as Hide and Seek and Godsend). Unfortunately, Little Fockers is another piece of crap in De Niro's filmography, and I truly hated it mainly due to its horrible and unfunny screenplay.I think that Meet the Fockers and Little Fockers are like an infection which spreads to some great actors from the past, and makes them believe that they will be appreciated by new generations if they accept to participate in these atrocious movies. Personally, I did not find watching De Niro with a 5-hour erection, Barbra Streisand talking about musical condoms, Dustin Hoffman learning to dance flamenco or Harvey Keitel as an irresponsible builder to be funny at all in Little Fockers. And that is something which in fact can be said about the whole screenplay, because all the jokes are very predictable and unfunny. And the message of family unit (or something like that) that comes at the end of the movie is absolutely irritating and cloying.In conclusion, Little Fockers is a tedious and horrible waste of time, and I suggest you not to make the same mistake as me and invest your time in something more interesting than this pathetic movie.
I found the films Underworld and Underworld: Evolution overcharged with a weak and complicated mythology which, in my humble opinion, was superfluous and only filled in the holes between the action scenes. I liked the third film, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans, much more, because it was an efficient prequel with less wordiness, more action and finally a clear screenplay which didn't require us to know every detail about the aristocratic vampire dynasties nor their fickle relationship with the werewolves, their eternal enemies. Now, in the fourth film, co-screenwriters Len Wiseman, John Hlavin, J. Michael Straczynski and Allison Burnett took the right decision of emulating the simplification from its predecessor, but this time taking us to the near future, in which the secret war between vampires and werewolves pales in front of the new threaten they have to face...the human being.I want to leave something clear...Underworld: Awakening is ridiculous in various aspects, from the solemn vampire melodrama to the absurd action scenes which defy any law of the Physics. However, I found this film very entertaining, because the screenplay is well structured, the fights are well choreographed and clearly edited, and the special effects gloat themselves on the R rating, offering good quantities of blood and entrails.In a film like this, the performances might seem irrelevant, but I would like to mention Kate Beckinsale's solid performance, whose conviction makes us to have an emotional connection to her character. And I think that Stephen Rea and India Eisley also make an adequate work in their roles.In conclusion, Underworld: Awakening isn't a great film, but I had a very good time while I was watching it, and I think that that is more than enough to make it worthy of a recommendation.
Disney is still trying to escape from the mediocrity which was on visually sumptuous but narratively very poor films like Atlantis : The Lost Empire,Treasure Planet and Brother Bear.After that failures,they thought 3D animation would save them,but craps like Chicken Little and Meet the Robinsons left clear the most important thing is not the technique,but the story.Bolt is another false move from Disney and they back to prove they are miles away from getting the artistic quality of its "frenemy" Pixar.The main premise from this movie is moderately ingenious but the execution completely lacks of any energy and the action sequences and moments which should be funny or emotive,feel very forced.The voices also lack of any energy.The worst guilty of this is John Travolta,whose monotonous intonation totally lacks of dynamism.Sussie Essman results bland and Mark Walters tries to emulate the maniac intensity from Jack Black but he does not get it.I never try to analyze the logic of the screenplay and characters motivation on an animation movie too much,but that is not an excuse for an arbitrary screenplay which has action,humor and emotive moments as basic blocks from co-screenwriters Dan Fogelman and Chris Williams but which never feel natural.This movie does not feel like that because the screenplay uses clich√©s and arbitrary manipulations to get to an obligatory point...in other words,the story is not fluid.And this is something which I truly hated from this movie : the reason for which the dog Bolt believes to have powers is ridiculous and it results an insult for the spectator.It seems Fogelman and Williams do not have any respect for the spectators and that they thought : "It's a kids movie...they are not going to notice any absurd things".Bolt is another boring animation film.It's slightly better than Disney's previous efforts but that's not saying too much because the movie falls on the fatal mistake of being boring.And that's something impossible to excuse.
Case 39 would have been a bit predictable even if the trailer had not revealed the mystery behind its story.For better or for worse, the story is an homogeneous combination of the well known elements we have seen on many movies which show kids involved on paranormal events.However, despite its lack of innovation, I had a good time watching Case 39, thanks to Christian Alvart's concise and dynamic direction and the competent performances from Ren√©e Zellweger, Jodelle Ferland and Callum Keith Rennie.There are various elements in the screenplay we have seen in other movies.However, even though the story lacks of originality, Case 39 is entertaining, because Alvart created a good rhythm and some solid moments of tension.What is more, the story is well structured.Zellweger made her return to horror with Case 39 after 15 years (since her unworthy appearance on the atrocious The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre).In recent years, she has created a very different image, but her performance in Case 39 feels realistic and effective.Ferland creates a good aura of threaten with her role; I liked not to see her trying to apparent evilness, because that is the point where almost all the child actors I have seen in the past in similar movies fail.And even though he has short screen-time, Rennie brings a good level of intensity to his character.As for the rest of the actors, they feel a bit bland.In summary, Case 39 is nothing extraordinary or highly memorable; but I think it is effective for having a good time, and I recommend it because of that.
Author Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) is one of those historical figures who wake the interest not only because of their work, but also because of their venturesome life (and death), which perfectly reflects the "tortured artist" archetype. For better or for worse, this has inspired all kinds of "adaptations" through the decades, which very few have to do with Poe's short stories and poems; the most recent example is the film The Raven, which despite not being bad, fails on two important elements.The screenplay from The Raven shows some ingenuity in combining "reality" with fantasy, incorporating parallels between the characters from the film and Poe's tales (for example, Inspector Fields is obviously an allusion to Auguste Dupin, the famous "knight detective" from Murders in the Rue Morgue and The Purloined Letter). The dialogues cunningly evoke Poe's prose, adding a humorous subtext which lightens the movie and makes it more accessible. The clues left by the murderer create a moderately interesting mystery, which gets increasingly intense as the crimes become more elaborate and straightly affect the main character. And I also have to say that co-screenwriters Hannah Shakespeare (?) and Ben Livingston made the effort of studying Poe's biography in order to bring us an apocryphal, but well raised, theory about the author's last days. However, The Raven didn't leave me very satisfied, because as I previously mentioned, it fails on two important elements.To start with, we have James McTeigue's weak direction, which displays a general poorness of vision and "personality" in every aspect from the film. And I'm not referring to the slow rhythm from the film...I'm talking about a lack of energy which avoids us to get interested in the characters, or have enthusiasm for the mystery's solution. This is definitely not the same McTeigue who directed V for Vendetta and Ninja Assassin. The other big problem from The Raven is John Cusack. I generally like this actor's work, but his performance in this movie is atrocious. I felt him too frivolous and casual; I could never feel his character's internal conflict, nor the melancholy which has followed him during his whole life. On the opposite, Cusack's Poe is simply Cusack with a beard, gesturing exaggeratedly and trying to make us believe the character's tortuous past without any result. Cusack's bad performance reminded me of the episode The Black Cat from the TV series Masters of Horror, in which the great Jeffrey Combs brought an extraordinary work as Poe. The episode itself wasn't very remarkable, but Combs' performance has stayed in my memory, because with only his look we could feel the character's depressed spirit, the weight of his vices and the anguish for the unavoidable future.In conclusion, The Raven offers some positive elements, but failed on two very important aspects, such as the direction and the main actor's performance, so I can only give it the slightest recommendation. After the not very satisfactory experience I had with The Raven, I think I will re-watch some of the adaptations of Poe's tales made by director Roger Corman. They weren't very respectful to the literary versions, but they were full of atmosphere and excitement.
Before watching We Need to Talk About Kevin, I had a vague idea about its story, but I didn't expect to find the fascinating narrative style employed by director Lynne Ramsay to tell this story about a family whose apparent normality hides deep and dangerous veins of dysfunction which conclude on a tragedy. In We Need to Talk About Kevin, even the most prosaic scenes take a big emotional weight once we finish to put together the pieces of the dramatic puzzle co-screenwriters Ramsay and Rory Kinnear had been giving to us little by little. In that aspect, I think We Need to Talk About Kevin is an excellent film, even though it's definitely not the kind of experience which brings us simple entertainment, but a sensation of pain and surprise which is very difficult to forget.I generally distrust of those movies that offer us a whimsical structure which jumps forward and backward in time, but in the case of We Need to Talk About Kevin, the style powerfully contributes to the substance, building the story on a casual way until we are overwhelmed by the magnitude of what we are witnessing. Besides, the title of this film becomes cunningly ironic when we consider the fact that We Need to Talk About Kevin has few dialogs, and its most intense scenes are mute but full of meaning with just looks, expressions and body language. It's unfortunately not very common to see a film like this one, in which every scene brings a new angle to the story, and there isn't a single element which has been ignored as part of the global narrative. Something which definitely includes the soundtrack, composed by songs which deeply contrast with the images which accompany them, creating a visceral answer; while other ones work as ironic accents which perfectly establish the melancholic tone from the film.And I now have to mention Tilda Swinton, who brings the best performance of her career so far in We Need to Talk About Kevin (something which is already a big compliment). This is the kind of performance which genuinely captures the spectator, because on some way, she transmits her character's emotional turbulence with her apparently impassive face and calm attitude. The other actors also bring excellent performances (Jasper Newell particularly), but Swinton is the one who definitely carries with the whole film. In conclusion, We Need to Talk About Kevin definitely deserves an enthusiastic recommendation, but I have to say once more that this isn't an easy or amusing film; in fact, it left me emotionally devastated for having portrayed a facet of the society whose existence we know even though we prefer to ignore it. In summary, a brilliant movie, even though I don't wanna watch it ever again.
Insidious is a collaboration between director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell, who are both mostly famous for being the creators of the Saw saga, which left (for better or for worse) an influence on the horror cinema from the previous decade. Some people might suppose that a new collaboration between Wan and Whannell will have the same ingredients of blood, cruelty and violence which gave them such a fame 7 years ago. However, they attempted to do something completely different with Insidious, and even though it might not be totally original, I consider it to be an intense and very entertaining horror film which deserves a recommendation because of its tense direction, solid performances and a "retro" atmosphere which evokes the cinema from the 70's, without losing a contemporary identity.If we omitted some details and the name from the characters, a plot synopsis of Insidious could describe almost any haunted house film made since various decades ago. In other words, Insidious is an amalgam of images, scenes and concepts taken from Poltergeist, both versions of The Amityville Horror, both versions of House on Haunted Hill, The Uninvited and Paranormal Activity, seasoned with an atmosphere of a domestic melancholy which reminded me of Don't Look Now, The Changeling and other serious horror films from the 70's and early '80s. And I could go on and on comparing Insidious to other movies, and pointing out the similarities, imitations and even tributes which bring the story to shape. However, that would be like describing a meal only mentioning the elements it contains. Fortunately, Insidious is more than the sum of its parts, thanks to its perfect direction, well structured screenplay and the force from the performances, which are solemn when they should and with the slightest humorous wink when they require so in order to make us accomplices of the horror. In summary, a dish composed by leftovers which conceals its lack of freshness with good tastes, textures and shocks (I think that this last one does not fit into the gastronomical analogy).As any good ghost movie, Insidious advances without any hurry, gradually tightening the gears from the suspense until we feel paranoid with every sound or movement which comes from the screen. And like in many of these stories, there is also a personal drama which emphasizes the characters' anguish when they face "the unknown" and notice that the world is much stranger and more threatening than they imagined. Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson credibly express their characters' emotions, and their reactions feel totally natural. And Lin Shaye interprets a character which respects her not only as a veteran of the fantastic genre, but also as a talented (but unfortunately underrated) actress.Of all the films I mentioned on the second paragraph, Poltergeist is the one closest in structure and subjects to Insidious. However, at the difference of that classic, this time the special effects are reduced to the minimum, with very few instances of digital tricks and a refreshing variety of effects obtained on camera, or with traditional methods of make-up and edition. That visual minimalism emphasizes the importance of the suspense and the atmosphere to cause terror.So, it might not be a great film, but I liked Insidious pretty much, and I recommend it either if you are a fan of the horror genre or if you are a casual spectator who is bored of the hollow gore and digital ghosts we usually see nowadays in this genre.
Even though I generally hate Adam Sandler, I decided to watch That's My Boy because it was co-starred by Andy Samberg, whose style of humor I usually like (at least when he collaborates with his comic "troupe" Lonely Island). However, the film ended up being a truly horrible "comedy".That's My Boy could be summarized as 116 minutes of Sandler making one of his "humorous" voices, while the screenplay ignores any narrative cohesion in order to bring us jokes which don't work at all because they are too simple and predictable, employing vulgarity instead of ingenuity and relying on the erroneous belief that anything said by Sandler in his irritating voice will be funny. While That's My Boy was boring me to tears, I remembered the fact that it was a box-office flop. Apparently, many of Sandler's fans got tired of standing the same routines for many years...or maybe they matured. Sandler has tried a few times to re-invent himself, in the films Punch-Drunk Love, Reign Over Me and Funny People. But, sure, they can all be considered flops if we compare them to the comedian's golden age, in which he was an "A-list" actor thanks to the box-office successes of Big Daddy, The Waterboy or 50 First Dates. So, it's natural to see Sandler keep repeating his old tricks in a vain effort of re-capturing the past. I wonder whether he will learn the lesson some day. And at the same time, I'm not interested in knowing the answer.In order not to seem such a bitter person, I'll try to mention something positive about That's My Boy. Let me see...something positive, something positive...there must be something over there...Oh! I think it was an appropriate decision to employ Eva Amurri Martino in the character of a sensual teacher, and then Susan Sarandon (her mother in the real life) to play the "thirty years later" version. They are both very good looking, and their obvious physical resemblance is certainly surprising. The underrated actress Leighton Meester looks more attractive than ever...even though her beauty is darkened by the awful and unworthy scenes the screenplay makes her play, so I don't think I can count her presence among the very few positive elements from this film. In conclusion, That's My Boy is an atrocious movie, and I recommend you not to waste your time and your money in this piece of junk.
I should already be accustomed to find many famous actors in modest films which were released straight to DVD in the United States, but in the case of the film Unthinkable that really surprised me, because in my humble opinion, it has enough quality and "star power" to make it deserving of a release in cinemas.I guess I will never understand the film distributors...Unthinkable is a very competent thriller with few action but abundant suspense and noble intentions of examining difficult ethical issues which have become relevant in the "war on terror".The three main characters represent three different points of view, and we contemplate the impossible problem from torture, its possible political utility and the reasons for which it should (or not) be employed as a last resource to save millions of lives through their eyes.Those people who have seen the last seasons from the TV series 24 will be a bit familiarized with this kind of discussion; however, screenwriter Peter Woodward refuses to present such a simple and limited vision of the problem like the one from 24.As well as some people will find the terrorist to be the villain, other people will think like that about the relentless agent who tortures the terrorist, and there will undoubtedly be other people who consider the compassionate female agent as the enemy, by putting the life of many citizens in risk for submitting herself to archaic notions of ethic.Who is right? Are there any limits for what should be done in the combat against the "terror"? Unthinkable does not pretend to bring a clear and reassuring answer, but to make us think about the multiple moral vectors which influence in the decision.The result is that this is a film which makes us think at the same time it is very entertaining.The great Michael Sheen is famous for his amazing histrionic flexibility, interpreting characters which go from Tony Blair in the films The Queen, The Deal and The Special Relationship (by the way, the last two ones mentioned were made for TV) to the vampire Lucien in Underworld and its sequels, without forgetting about his brief comical respite in the TV series 30 Rock; Unthinkable lets us to see another facet from his talent in a difficult character who is simultaneously sincere and enough ambiguous to make us distrust from his lachrymose revelations and impassioned pleas.And Sheen succeeded on all that.Carrie Ann Moss is credible in her character, at the same time she brings interesting nuances to it.And Samuel L. Jackson shows a genuine humanity behind the cruelty from his character.I have to admit that there are a few inconsistencies in the screenplay.I would have also liked the ending to go a bit further.However, in spite of that, I liked Unthinkable pretty much because of its solid performances, its competent screenplay and the fact that it leaves the spectator thinking, so I think I can recommend it with confidence.
REC was an excellent horror film, and one of the few ones which perfectly employed the pseudo-documentary technique. The characters, the narrative economy and the moments of horror made REC a fascinating experience which undoubtedly left an influence in modern fantastic cinema. The second part, REC¬≤, tried to be a (semi)logical continuation of the story, but it committed the fatal mistake of introducing (SPOILER) a supernatural/religious element which didn't only corrupt the zombie concept, but which also retroactively harmed the original film. And we now have REC¬≥ G√©nesis, which despite being superior to the second film, is still a boring experience which is very, very far away from reaching the level of quality of the first film.Even though the title of this film includes the word "G√©nesis", REC¬≥ isn't exactly a prequel, because even though it reveals the possible origin of the infection (at least on an hypothetical way), there are indications that the events portrayed in here happen in parallel to the ones from REC and REC¬≤. In other words, it's not necessary to have watched those films in order to understand this third movie...even though I would suggest you to watch REC as a substitute, because REC¬≥ G√©nesis is a tedious zombie film with a weak romantic subject as the emotional axis, something which didn't work for me. In fact, it made me remember the zombie-romantic films Zombie Honeymoon and Dance of the Dead, which both found an infinitely better balance between horror, comedy and romance. Speaking of which, REC¬≥ G√©nesis has a lighter tone than the one of the two previous films of the saga, because it employs elements of humor. Pity that they don't work at all either.In conclusion, REC¬≥ G√©nesis is an insipid and quite boring horror film. As a consequence, I can't recommend it, and I just hope the upcoming fourth part of the saga to be something as original and refreshing as the original REC was.
The Babadook is a reflexive and distressing horror film in which the main character's drama is as terrifying as the supernatural events which torment her. But, are they really supernatural, or just a manifestation of her deep melancholy and frail mental health? I'm not sure, and after all, it doesn't matter whether the creature named "babadook" is a real entity, or the hallucinations of a sick mind, or a metaphor of depression. What is important is that The Babadook achieves its intention of scaring us with a surprising intensity, leaving the tricks of horror aside in order to focus on realistic and overwhelming of humanity characters who capture us into their torment. The excellent screenplay denotes a precise comprehension of the authentic horror, not in the shape of zombies or ghosts, but in its existential variety, fed by the desperation of losing control over our life, and not being able to protect our loved ones. That's why I can't say I "enjoyed" The Babadook in a conventional sense... it's very well done, and it definitely fulfills with its purpose of making the spectator feel uneasy, but the general effect is too disturbing in order to consider it amusing... nevertheless, I recommend it with the absolute confidence that it will leave the fans of horror satisfied, as well as any other person who appreciates a brilliantly acted, written and directed drama. Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman make an extraordinary work, because they are so natural in their roles that we end up forgetting the fiction in order to accept them as mother and son with very difficult lives, in a constant state of crisis even before receiving the visit of the creature. Regarding the "babadook", I prefer not to say anything about it... something which will be easy, because its enigmatic nature is left to the audience's imagination, which adds a delicious mystery to the atmosphere and domestic horror and growing anxiety. In conclusion, The Babadook is a memorable experience, and an excellent debut for director and screenwriter Jennifer Kent, whose future work I will definitely be expecting with interest.
At first sight, it might seem that Cedar Rapids is another vulgar modern comedy about immature men behaving like idiots...and that description might be appropriate to some point. However, screenwriter Phil Johnston and director Miguel Arteta achieved something much more inspired and entertaining, which starts in a similar line to the "Judd Apatow style" in order to eventually become an honest and very funny film about personal growth, whose lack of excesses reflects a narrative maturity. Besides, Cedar Rapids offers excellent performances from the whole cast and a thematic deepness which is not very common to find in a comedy. In summary, this film has enough material to make us laugh, but its biggest value resides on its emotional background and on its observations about the insurance salesmen.Cedar Rapids is kinda like a light interpretation of two classic films about salesmen (Tin Men and Glengarry Glenn Ross), because it employs the same strategy of putting the matter of the sales on the background, in order to focus into the contrasting personalities from the salesmen and the different attitudes with which they face that difficult activity. But the main subject of Cedar Rapids is the "awakening to life" from a repressed man who ignored the complexities from the "real world", including the contradictions of friendship, the temptation of sex without any compromise and the religious hypocrisy. This kind of stories is usually reserved for teenage characters; the fact that the main character in this case is a thirty-something man makes Cedar Rapids funny, emotive and irreverent.Ed Helms makes a brilliant work in the leading role, because not many actors could have interpreted such a sincere and naive character without making him look like an idiot of an improbable ignorance. John C. Reilly also brings a perfect performance, because of the humanity he brings to his character. And I also liked the performances from Isiah Whitlock Jr., Alia Shawkat, Kurtwood Smith and Anne Heche very much.The premise from Cedar Rapids might sound a bit dry and banal, but that is part from its charm. We are accustomed to see complicated screenplays at the Hollywood style, where (for example) a reporter investigates a missing bike and he ends up discovering a conspiracy to assassinate the President of the United States, or something like that. On the opposite, Cedar Rapids seems to delight itself with its puerility, and the importance that the characters put to things which might seem trivial and absurd to many spectators. However, this film's big achievement is making us understand why those things are so important to them, and making us share the suspense for the main character's triumph or failure. In conclusion, I very enthusiastically recommend Cedar Rapids as an excellent comedy which is simultaneously intelligent, very funny and hugely entertaining.
The films from director Wes Anderson are unmistakable, because of their flamboyant visual style and the narrative which takes the characters through absurd routes of comedy and drama which rarely lead to where the audience expected. Needless to say that this style isn't everyone's cup of tea; personally, I liked some of his films very much (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom), but I wasn't left completely satisfied by other ones (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited). Fortunately, The Grand Budapest Hotel, his most recent film, shows us Anderson in quite a good shape, investing a huge care for the story to be always interesting, to make the characters feel real despite their eccentricities, and to make every frame of the movie a delight to the view. In that way, despite some scenes which cross the line from the idiosyncrasy to the irritation and a few forced details, we can always have a solid production design, extraordinary cinematography and the vision of a filmmaker who has the ability to combine images and emotions into a funny, melancholic and deep film. But, as I said before, not everyone will appreciate this vision, and some people might find the universe in which Anderson frames this tragicomic farce pretentious. Or they might find the "retro" special effects and the use of models in many exterior scenes (like the observatory in the Alps) ridiculous. I personally found that appropriate, because even the real sized sets look like models in The Grand Budapest Hotel. And that might be the reason why it transmits us the sensation that the characters are toys controlled by a kid with too much imagination in order to let logic and "reality" interfere with his vivacious fantasies. Sure, not too many kids could accompany their games with a perfect score from Alexandre Desplat or with an army of famous actors ready to fill in even the smallest roles just for the sake of being a part of Anderson's game (Was it just me, or did I really see George Clooney for a fraction of second?). In conclusion, I wouldn't consider it an excellent film, but I enjoyed The Grand Budapest Hotel pretty much, and I recommend it to those who want to visit an extravagant universe which is always conscious of its duties as a film.
The only film I had seen from director and screenwriter Lisa Cholodenko was Laurel Canyon, a romantic drama I liked very much because of its performances and because the screenplay used quite an unusual situation to represent a classic story about heartbreak and personal fulfillment.In other words, strange ingredients for a familiar recipe, something which worked very well.And exactly the same applies to The Kids are All Right, Cholodenko's most recent film, another intensely honest and personal "slice of life" with excellent performances and an "indie" sensibility which brings a lot of natural emotions.The sub-genus of the family drama always runs the risk of plunging into the conflicts from the characters too much, forgetting that they should take part from a consistent story, which keeps our interest beyond of "look, the pretty people also suffer".The Kids Are All Right perfectly keeps that precarious balance between drama and narrative, because even though the story is relatively simple, the emotions and the evolution from the characters impulse it on a realistic way, without making us feel that co-screenwriters Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg are manipulating our feelings.There certainly are distressing moments, surprising revelations and even unexpected humor...but they never feel gratuitous, but as integral parts from the personalities which clash with each other during the movie.As I mentioned on the first paragraph, the performances from The Kids are All Right are brilliant.Julianne Moore and Annette Bening have such a good chemistry with each other that it is easy to forget the lesbian angle when the inherent problems from marriage (any marriage) appear after 20 years of coexistence between their characters.Josh Hutcherson and Mia Wasikowska are also perfect on their roles, and I have to mention that I did not expect to see such a good performance from Wasikowska.Unfortunately, her role in Alice in Wonderland was completely darkened by the visual whims from director Tim Burton, but her work in The Kids are All Right shows that she is an actress with a lot of talent.And finally, Mark Ruffalo never makes the spectator to loose the empathy in his character, despite his bad decisions and questionable ethic.The only fail I found in this movie is that there are a few scenes which feel a bit out of place.But that is not a very important fail, and it does not avoid me from enthusiastically recommending The Kids are All Right as an excellent family drama with enough emotional realism and narrative value to make it very different from the lachrymose dramas made in Hollywood which only exploit the feelings from the spectator on a cheap way.
Some months ago, I read the comic The Secret Service, and I loved it. Its story is absolutely perfect: very dynamic, internally consistent and with the precise degree of humor in order not to be taken too seriously despite its violence and catastrophic global threats. Oh, and it also had an abundant number of "geek" references to delight the fans of comics. Therefore, I was very interested in watching the film Kingsman: The Secret Service, and even though I found it entertaining, it didn't live up to the high expectations set by the comic, mainly because co-screenwriters Matthew Vaughn (who was also the director) and Jane Goldman decided to "improve" the story altering abundant elements and breaking the balance of the well built characters. But, well... those complaints will only be relevant to the few people who read the comic, so I will now try to focus myself on the movie itself. The basic premise of Kingsman: The Secret Service is interesting: a centennial secret organization of expert British agents dedicated to the protection of society, not due to a mandate of the Crown, but due to a moral duty; and since they are independent from the government or political institutions, they avoid harmful influences which could corrupt their noble mission. Colin Firth brings an excellent performance as the classic "knight spy", and he also displays a wide dose of charisma. On the other hand, Taron Egerton feels a bit insipid and not very charismatic as the apprentice Eggsy. And it was obviously a pleasure to see Michael Caine as the leader of the organization. The violence is quite bloody, totally justifying the "R" rating and giving us an idea of what action cinema can be like when it doesn't care about commercial interests which prefer a pre-teen audience. On the negative side, the screenplay feels occasionally too erratic, seeking the correct proportion between the two sub-plots (the investigation of missing celebrities and Eggsy's training), but not always achieving it. Another thing I didn't like was the superficial way in which the villain was written; the character has so many affectations that they destroy any sensation of purpose or threat. In conclusion, I think I would place Kingsman: The Secret Service at the same level of Kick-Ass, which was also directed by Vaughn: in both films, the action is pleasantly bloody, not all the characters are well written, and even though the concept is interesting, it's not always handled with enough ingenuity to take full advantage of it. Nevertheless, I think I can give a moderate recommendation to Kingsman: The Secret Service as an entertaining action film, despite not being totally satisfactory. And besides, it served for me to lower the expectations for future cinematographic adaptations of other extraordinary comics (Saga, Sex Criminals, Alias). It's an unavoidable fact I will have to accept. The fans of Howard the Duck's know what I'm talking about.
I do not know whether it is a cosmic coincidence or a genuine social tendency but, for whatever the reason it is, the "friends with benefits" concept is currently fashionable in Hollywood. The film Friends With Benefits is the third one in less than a year (after Love and Other Drugs and No Strings Attached) to deal with that premise. These three films had the intention of subverting the conventions employed in the romantic comedies, by presenting a more present and less idealized vision about the personal relationships. However, they all ended up falling into the clich√©s they tried to avoid.Before watching Friends With Benefits, I was interested in only one thing: director Will Gluck, who was previously responsible of two competent comedies (Fired Up and Easy A), besides of the fact that he was the creator of the excellent TV series The Loop, Andy Richter Controls the Universe and Grosse Pointe. However, Friends With Benefits is a misstep in Gluck's career, because even though it tries to be sharp and irreverent, it does not innovate on what we have seen in many other romantic comedies, at the same time I found it tedious.As for the two main actors, let's first focus on the positive element: Mila Kunis, who brings an adequate performance as an independent and released woman. On the other side of the coin, Justin Timberlake is the worst element from the whole film. I was never interested at all in his career as a musician, but I liked his work as an actor in the films Alpha Dog and The Social Network, besides of his frequent appearances in Saturday Night Live. However, his performance in Friends With Benefits is horrible, mainly because he fatally fails at generating the emotions which should define his character. In fact, it does not even seem like a character; it's just Timberlake saying his lines from the screenplay without any conviction.In conclusion, I cannot recommend Friends With Benefits because of its many irritating fails, starting by Timberlake's performance and the fact that the screenplay is terribly boring. I hope Gluck to recover himself from this false move in his next project.
Absentia is a magnificent horror film, because of its extraordinary screenplay, excellent performances and perfect direction. In summary: a hidden gem which deserves to be discovered not only by the fans of the horror genre, but also by any lover of cinema.Like in the best horror films, the screenplay from Absentia is fascinating even before incorporating the supernatural elements. Actress Courtney Bell transmits her character's internal conflict between her loyalty to her missing husband and the promise to start a new life with a touching realism. Katie Parker also brings a perfect work as her sister, who has a dark past. And I think that Dave Levine is also worthy of applause as Detective Mallory. Director and screenwriter Mike Flanagan built the movie with elegance and subtleness, revealing the factors of the drama while we are finding out the characters' nature. The screenplay is developed organically, without any dramatic formulas nor narrative short cuts.And then we have the delicious twists from the screenplay, which gets increasingly disturbing as we find out certain additional details, with which we can start creating our own hypothesis about the main mystery. When the film finally gets into the horror field, Flanagan keeps the same discipline, offering us moments of a perfect suspense but without revealing too much, something which keeps the tension and the interest until the film's last frame. And the fact that Absentia achieved all this with a minimum budget makes it even more admirable.I definitely have huge interest in watching Flanagan's next films, with the hope of finding out that Absentia wasn't a product of chance, but of huge talent and genuine artistic vision. So, in conclusion, I give Absentia a very enthusiastic recommendation as one of the best films I have seen in recent years.
I did not have too much expectations for Flawless because the heist movies are like a clich√©.The only reason I went to see it was because I knew Michael Caine,one of my favourite actors,appeared in this film.But,when the movie ended,I was very satisfied.Flawless resulted to be a very good thriller.The best element from this film is the ingenious screenplay.It is very well structured and there are some twists which make the movie really unpredictable.It also makes a good character development.I am not a fan of Demi Moore but I admit that,with the correct director and material,she can be a competent actress,as we can see on this movie.Caine,as always,brings a brilliant performance.The fails I found on this movie are two.There are some plot holes and,before leading to the satisfactory ending,the movie makes a trick.I would have preferred to see that trick on a less conventional way.But,in spite of that,Flawless is a very entertaining and interesting thriller which tells an ingenious story.I took a nice surprise with this movie.
Yes, I know...another idiosyncratic "indie" comedy with picturesque characters, "first world" problems and that kind of humor which is so appreciated in Sundance, Toronto and similar "serious" festivals. However, at the difference of other films cooked on the same mold, Our Idiot Brother is genuinely funny, honest and intelligent, despite including some clich√©s from "indie" cinema. In summary, an entertaining film worthy of a recommendation.Even though the situations raised by the screenplay of Our Idiot Brother aren't precisely original or complicated, they fulfill with their function of illustrating common problems in modern relationships, where the white lies and "social filters" can be accumulated until completely eroding the confidence (and trust) between couples or members of a family.And then, we have the excellent performances from most of the cast of Our Idiot Brother. Paul Rudd is perfect in the leading character, who can be described as a modern version of Forrest Gump, adding an avocation to marijuana and with a dog as the love of his life. Emily Mortimer makes a wonderful work as a housewife who is overwhelmed by the routine, and so insecure for her marriage that she feels herself guilty for her husband's apathy. Elizabeth Banks is completely credible as a woman who is so relentless in hr struggle for occupationally ascending that she ends up ignoring those things which affect her excessive ambition (including herself). The only weak spot of the cast is Zooey Deschanel, who feels kinda forced as the free and artistic spirit who might not be as spontaneous as everybody thinks...nor as lesbian as her girlfriend, extraordinary played by Rashida Jones, thinks she is. Steve Coogan is an expert in playing insufferable characters, and in this movie, he proves once more why he is so good at it. Adam Scott makes a solid work as a sensitive and intelligent man who would be the perfect boyfriend for any woman...if it he didn't lack of a medical insurance. And finally, T.J. Miller brings a credible and likable performance.In conclusion, Our Idiot Brother made me have a very good time, and I think I can recommend it to all kinds of spectators, instead of only to the fans of "indie" cinema. This film couldn't occupy the stratum of independent films such as Little Miss Sunshine, Juno or (500) Days of Summer, whose success crossed to the mainstream cinema; nevertheless, I think it can definitely be appreciated by a wide audience because of its accessible humor and likable characters.
After reading such positive commentaries about Zombieland, I was very interested in watching it.However, even though the movie ended up being entertaining and funny, I have to say that I expected much more from it.I liked the film Shaun of the Dead very much, and even though Zombieland pretends to occupy a similar niche, it is very far away from reaching that level of excitement, suspense and intelligence.However, it works well as a funny comedy disguised as a horror film, which provokes laughs not only because of the interaction between the characters, but also because of its interpretation of the zombie cinema.The screenplay shows a true affection for the horror genre, and it uses good part of its development to make a satire without any malice of the movies from the genre and its fans.Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin bring good performances, even though the characters they interpret are a bit hollow and generic.Columbus' personal story and his difficulty to interact with the rest of humanity work well as a reflexive analogy of modern world, where social and emotional isolation can be the best tools to survive.The background from the rest of the characters is not very good, and it goes from the predictable (a family tragedy in Tallahasse's past) to the forced (Why do the girls need so many tricks to get what they want?).I think that the film needed to go a bit further on that element.Another fail from Zombieland is its lack of "soul".I admit I had a good time watching it, and I liked the experience overall.However, there is no suspense, or danger sensation or anguish for the characters.The problem is that the dramatic level from the film feels cold and lacking of tension and real consequences.Even one of the most important deaths from the movie is used as a joke, instead of as a drama.Sure, I laughed on that moment, but it was another wasted opportunity to establish additional levels in the narrative which would have made of Zombieland something memorable or unique.In summary, I had a good time while I was watching Zombieland, but once it finished, my brain was already forgetting it.However, I think it deserves a recommendation, mainly because it is entertaining and it offers good moments of humor.
Director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu is very acclaimed, but I didn't like his films Amores Perros, 21 Grams and Babel (as for Biutiful, I haven't seen it), because I noticed in them a certain affectation and arrogance which suggest more emphasis on displaying their narrative juggling than on telling an interesting story, and that distracted me in enough degree to avoid my submersion into the plot. However, in the case of Birdman, his most recent film, everything is so extraordinary that I didn't have any problem in accepting the story and following the tortured characters, who are very human and credible despite their deep dysfunction. The whole cast of Birdman makes a brilliant work. Michael Keaton brings a perfect performance in the leading role; I have always considered him an excellent actor, and I like to see him finally getting the recognition he had always deserved. Besides, Keaton is very well supported by the great performances from Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Amy Ryan and Edward Norton. What is more, Birdman delights us with an amazing display of style and technical virtuosity, simulating that the film was shot in a long continuous shot, with the camera in constant movement and, at the same time, precisely controlled to complement the tone of the scenes and the emotions of the characters. I was particularly left impressed by the re-definition of close-up achieved by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, getting the camera close to the face of the actors in order to capture every detail, every eloquent expressive feature, but making it feel intimate and natural, instead of claustrophobic. Some cynical person might say that the use of complex technology and extensive digital manipulation is ironic in a film which is dedicated to exalt the purity and passion of the theatre. However, I took that contrast between shape and substance as a naughty satirical contradiction about both mediums. In conclusion, Birdman is a fascinating movie, which definitely deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation. In my humble opinion, Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's creative vanity could finally find the perfect vehicle to transcend its motivation and end up being a memorable and extraordinary artistic expression, which is beautiful to the senses and satisfactory to the intellect.
One of the genres which seem the most easy to parody is the "blaxploitation", because its exuberant "afros", heroic macho postures and "funky" music from the 70's now seem anachronistic and even innocent.However, those elements are not enough to make a tribute to that iconic cinematographic style; besides of its stylish details, there is a distinct but difficult to precise "taste"...it may be the indubitable racial pride from its stoic heroes; or the tacit message that the White Man ("whitey") will always press the black race for fear to the potential it could get if it had authentic freedom; or maybe it is the absence of cynicism what magically becomes this simple stories into the purest distillation of "cool" I have seen on screen.I think the film Balck Dynamite captures that "taste" pretty well, at the same time it is very entertaining; however, some of the humor from it does not work very well.I suppose that the comparisons between Black Dynamite and the excellent Undercover Brother will be unavoidable, because they do not only walk on the same stylish field, but their stories also have elements in common.However, there is a fundamental difference: Undercover Brother is a caricature of the "blaxploitation" cinema which appropriately exaggerates every detail from the genre, while Black Dynamite is a very competent action film which occasionally has unnecessary humor on the screenplay.Do not misunderstand me...Balck Dynamite certainly made me laugh because of its correct mockery of the clich√©s established on classic movies such as Shaft (1971), Foxy Brown and Superfly; however, there are other occasions in which the humor feels out of place (Was it necessary to show the ghost of Abraham Lincoln?).Anyway, I liked this movie pretty much, specially thanks to the presence in the leading role of actor Michael Jai White, whose overflowing charisma, histrionic talent and genuine ability for the martial arts (those who have seen his "lost scenes" in Kill Bill 2 will perfectly know what I am talking about) should make him to work on more movies.I think that (if we do not count his short role on The Dark Knight), the most famous movie he has been involved in is the mediocre Spawn, where he did not have the opportunity to show his dramatic ability.I hope that his perfect development in Black Dynamite will open more doors in the career of this talented but underrated actor.In the supporting cast, we have Arsenio Hall and the brilliant character actors Bookem Woodbine, Phil Morris and Tucker Smallwood bringing energetic and credible performances.And the fans of Pam Grier's will be impressed by Sally Richardson, who seems a worthy successor of the feminist and racial icon director and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino made a tribute to in Jackie Brown.Black Dynamite is not a great film, but I enjoyed it pretty much, so I recommend it with confidence.
Usually,when a movie based on a video game economically fails,it is invoked that it was because of the lack of fidelity between the adaptation and the original source.I think the reason is much more simple : the stories from the video games are usually bad.As an aficionado,I have witnessed the evolution of this art,from the repetitive and simple old games (Pong or Space Invaders) to the complex stories of video games with an universe of characters and related events which are incomprehensible for the ones who have not studied the causes and consequences,counselors and disciples and a big etcetera...in other words,infinite and self-indulgent sagas like Final Fantasy,Metal Gear Solid or Castlevania.But,although the stories are weak and incoherent,that video games work perfectly good because their intention is not telling a story,but to develop an entertaining and addictive mechanic of game which is easy to learn but difficult to dominate,which stimulates the practice and compensates the dedication.In other words,all the subtle elements which represent the interactivity.So,when stories like that are taken to the big screen,all that worked perfectly good in a game is automatically lost on the adaptation,so the result are not usually good movies.I had time to think all that while I was seeing this pathetic action film called Max Payne because although the screenplay tries to evocate the style of the game,I did not feel even a pinch of all the emotion and satisfaction the video game produced on me.Without the interactive element,the story is reduced to a collection of predictable scenes which we have seen an infinite quantity of times on other movies : the anti-hero looking for revenge,fighting to clear his name at the same time he fights against villains who are endorsed by a corporative,governmental or something like that organization.One of the elements I found irritating on this movie was the use of the slow-motion because it seems desperate to create impact and emotion with that...but it fatally fails on that aspect.The performances are completely irrelevant.This is the kind of movie which seems to forget about character development,a natural development of things and,the worst fail of all,telling a solid story.This is the kind of movie I hate.Also,the violence in this movie is completely insipid because it practically does not show any blood.A very big difference with the video game,where the violence was graphic and completely realistic.I am honestly tired of this type of action cinema which shows insipid violence,which is all style but nothing of substance,a lot of movement and quick edition but nothing of emotion and which tries to distract us with action scenes to make us forget of the pathetic screenplay.Max Payne is a disastrous movie and I truly hated it.One of the worst movies from 2008.
The great Orson Welles (1915-1985) is mostly famous as the director of the legendary Citizen Kane, and as the writer, actor and producer of the remarkable radio adaptation of War of the Worlds, which caused panic in the United States in 1938, when many people thought it was a real broadcast which announced the extraterrestrial invasion.But before all that, Welles founded the theater company Mercury in 1937, where he started to tune his acclaimed style.And very few things show it better than his ingenious adaptation of Julius Caesar, William Shakespeare's iconic work, in which he moved the action to Mussolini's fascist Italy.The film Me and Orson Welles weaves reality and fiction in order to tell us the adventures from Welles and his company during the preparation of that staging.The result is interesting and very entertaining, but not perfect.Me and Orson Welles is not a biography of Welles or a serious analysis of his innovative version of Julius Caesar, but it should have may been like that.I liked this film pretty much, because the performances are good and the screenplay is always very interesting.But the plot covers so many interesting stuff that I did not feel it deepened on it as much as I would have liked.However, despite that, the film is very good, because it has various positive elements.Claire Danes brings conviction and enthusiasm to her character, at the same time she adapts herself very well to the movie's style.Zac Efron brings a decent performance; however, he gets darkened on various occasions by Danes and specially, Christian McKay, who steals the show as Welles.The force from his performance and his overwhelming presence make him the central figure from the movie, even when he does not appear on scene.Before watching Me and Orson Welles, I had the slight awe that director Richard Linklater's melancholic and vanguard style was not going to fit very well on a period film (as it had happened in The Newton Boys); however, it fortunately resulted to be very compatible in here, because it keeps a naughty wink to classic Hollywood conventions without loosing the dynamism and structure required to attract modern audiences.So, I think this movie deserves a safe recommendation, because even though it is not great, I enjoyed it pretty much.
I do not know why,but I had the feeling Role Models was going to be a bad movie.However,I decided to watch it because I usually like the work of Paul Rudd and Sean William Scott.I took a very nice surprise with Role Models.This resulted to be a funny and very entertaining comedy with some honesty on the screenplay.I think Role Models can be considered as a twisted version of the sub-genus "teacher inspiring his/her students",but with lessons about female boobs,instead of poetry,literature,dancing or whatever.So,we can expect the typical elements from this kind of movies : initial distrust between teacher and pupil; the gradual acceptation of the mutual values; and then the cathartic conclusions,in which the lessons both bands learned are tested.And it is refreshing to see that the movie does not loose its irreverence on that moments,so they do not feel cloying.And,besides,those elements have a touch of honesty which makes them more credible.The performances are competent.Rudd and Scott repeat the same character they have always interpreted,but they do it very well.Elizabeth Banks,Christopher Mintz-Plasse,Bobb'e J. Thompson,Jane Lynch and Ken Marino fit on their characters and they also bring solid performances.Role Models is not a great movie at all,but I cannot deny it kept me very entertained the whole time.I can recommend this film as a funny comedy which is not exclusively based on vulgarity for making us laugh and which has some touches of honesty on its screenplay.
I guess it was unavoidable...another movie about an agreeable loser whose life changes when he discovers he is the heir of a powerful legacy which brings him magical powers, which are used by him in order to win trust in himself, conquer the girl of his dreams and, sure, save the world of sinister villains who want to destroy it.Why do they want to destroy it? Because they are villains.Why are they villains? Because they want to destroy the world.And that is the maximum dramatic deepness The Sorcerer's Apprentice aspires to.Besides of being superficially based on the rich Arthurian legends, The Sorcerer's Apprentice has the doubtful distinction of being a remake of a famous Disney film...or, better said, a remake of the most famous scene from the classical Fantasia, where we saw Mickey Mouse losing the control of various cleaning implements as a consequence of practicing magic without his master's permission.Clear that that nice scene did not have car chases, or alternative rock, or references to Star Wars.The problem is that the screenplay from The Sorcerer's Apprentice feels very forced, at the same time it has many elements we have already seen too many times.The Sorcerer's Apprentice is one of those apparatus movies with many turns which do not lead to anywhere.After the introduction of the characters, the screenplay falls into a routine which combines the lessons from the "master", the shy approaches from the "hero" in order to get closer to his loved one and the appearance every 10 or 15 minutes of the villain in order to generate a little bit of drama... or, in other words, to produce another over the top special effects sequence to generate some excitement.Needless to say they did not provoke that on me, since I found them to be as boring and insipid as the rest of the film.Even though their characters lack of deepness, I have to say that Nicolas Cage and Jay Baruchel show a good level of credibility and enthusiasm on their roles.And Alfred Molina is absolutely wasted as the villain.In conclusion, The Sorcerer's Apprentice is a boring, mediocre and disposable film experience, so I cannot recommend it.In my humble opinion, this is another failed imitation of Harry Potter, but at least, it is not as bad as Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief.Unfortunately, that is one of the best things I can say about it.
Right at Your Door is an excellent movie for various reasons.First of all,its premise is fascinating and truly original.Also,that premise is perfectly developed.The characters are also a strong point from this movie because their behaviour is completely natural and credible and they act as normal people would on that situation.Chris Gorak made an excellent work as a director because he could extract perfect performances from the small cast and he could create a perfect atmosphere which automatically makes the spectator to "enter" in the movie.This film deserves admiration because,in spite of its minimum resources,it produces a big impact on the spectator; not to mention,this is a movie which was made with passion and with talent.The only complaint I have against Right at Your Door is that some elements from the screenplay feel a little bit forced.But that fail is not too important.Right at Your Door is an excellent movie which deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation.
It seems hugely ambitious to resurrect the biblical films from yesteryear, but director Ridley Scott had already shown his expertise with "peplum" cinema in Gladiator. And Exodus: Gods and Kings ended up being a very entertaining film which tells us an epic religious story with a modern sensibility, where the mystical aspect is kept on the periphery, always present but open to interpretation. Christian Bale brings an excellent performance as Moses, taking total possession of his character and perfectly navigating the thin line between divine prophet and fanatic partisan. Unfortunately, various supporting characters aren't well developed by the screenplay, and as a consequence, some brilliant actors (such as Aaron Paul, Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley) are wasted in their roles. Joel Edgerton makes a solid work as Rhamses, credibly expressing his character's internal evolution through the story, equally produced by the pressure of power and the arrogance of feeling himself a virtual human God with absolute power over his people. Special mention: the kid Isaac Andrews, playing an enigmatic role I won't reveal, even though he steals every scene he's in. Needless to say, we can't have a biblical epic without an impressive visual style, and Exodus: Gods and Kings completely fulfills with that requirement, but always keeping a good balance between spectacle and realism. Unlike the mediocre Noah, which had had an excessive use of digital flourish, Scott keeps the images as mundane as possible, and as a consequence, the extraordinary work from the studio Double Negative feels like a genuine complement of the story. The views of Egypt during the peak of its prosperity are amazing, but not very striking. And the same applies to the more "mythological" elements from the film, such as the plagues and the "split of waters". In other words, everything is seen as it would be in the real world... or at least, as "real" as we can expect in a Hollywood interpretation of the Bible. On the negative side, the emotions from Exodus: Gods and Kings feel a bit distant. There isn't much dramatic weight in the Hebrew Exodus or in Moses' internal growth. Even the conflict he has with Rhamses (his cousin) lacks of strength, and when the catharsis moment comes, it feels a bit forced as an emotional climax. However, I prefer a kinda cold film, instead of an excessively sentimental or falsely cloying one, something which would have been fatal in a film like this. In conclusion, Exodus: Gods and Kings kept me very entertained, and I almost didn't feel its 150-minute running time. I'm not interested in watching it again, but it was quite a pleasant experience, and I consider it worthy of a recommendation.
The enthusiasm, fans and good will director and screenwriter Richard Kelly earned with his first film Donnie Darko were extinguished with his following film, the misunderstood Southland Tales, a bizarre drive through the alternative "future" of the United States full of unusual performances, humor and messages.Since I liked Donnie Darko and Southland Tales very much, I was very interested in watching The Box, his most recent film, which is based on a short (very short) story from legendary author Richard Matheson, and I had the incognito of how Kelly was going the extend the story without losing the essence from the original work.Fortunately, the result was pretty good.To start with, I liked the manufacture from The Box very much.The setting of the story in 1976 has narrative purposes (which I am not going to reveal), and two things which influence are the wonderful cinematography and production design, whose contrasts between warm pastel tones and cold exteriors bring a unique visual identity to the movie.Kelly takes the biggest advantage from that aesthetic in order to complement his solid direction, and even the most colorful scenes have an air of melancholy and anxiety which stresses the ethic disjunctive from the main characters.Talking about the characters, we have James Marsden in one of the leading roles, and I think that another actor should have had his part.It is not that Marsden brings a bad performance; the problem is that he falls short on a few scenes which required a bigger emotional impact.On the other hand, Cameron Diaz is perfect on the other leading role; it is easy to note she absolutely comprehended the tone from the story.And on a supporting (but important) role, we have the brilliant Frank Langella, and he made a very solid work with his character.As for the story, I enjoyed the gradual building of the mystery pretty much, until we lead to the ending, which is satisfactory, but at the same time, a bit predictable because of some forced elements we see before it.Despite of that, I liked The Box pretty much, and I recommend it as a pretty interesting experience.
I have never been a fan of Michael Jackson (1958-2009).In mid-80's, during the peak of his fame, I was interested in a different type of music than the "pop" one.But, sure, even without being a fan of his music, I cannot deny the impact he has had on the popular culture, and even on the worldwide social structure.It may be something impossible nowadays, but unfortunately, 25 years ago, there were radio stations which were exclusively dedicated to "white" music, promoting racial segregation and intolerance.But with the huge success of the disc Thriller, many of those stations had to change their politics in order to satisfy the listeners.I even have to admit that, even though I am not a big fan of "pop", I liked the video-clip from Thriller very much, thanks to John Landis' brilliant direction and the excellent make-up effects from the great Rick Baker.Now, a quarter of century later, the "king of pop" has gone and we have as a honest tribute to him, the documentary This Is It, directed by Kenny Ortega, who had been a Jackson's collaborator from many decades ago, and whose access to the rehearsals of what was going to be Jackson's new tour do not only let us to have a very interesting look to the organization of a monumental event, but also a simultaneously critical and affectionate "eye" to "MJ", his multiple advisers and his dancer's creative process.All that is accompanied by musical interpretations from the artist's biggest hits, which may not feel as polished as they might have been seen on the real tour, but which definitely feel intense and very entertaining.The truth is that that focus results much more interesting than showing a simple concert.Leaving aside his troubled personal life, his obsession with plastic surgery and eccentric behaviour, here is where we can see Jackson's value as an artist, his passion for the music and the amazing charisma which made him one of the most important interpreters from 20th century.But for having achieved that, Ortega avoids any controversial situation; the ones who are going to see This Is It expecting a sensationalistic parade of gossips and scandals will feel disappointed.So, in summary, This Is It did not make me to become into a fan of Jackson, but it made me have an exciting and very entertaining experience, in spite of having a few fails (for example, I think it should have been deeper and more critical on some moments).So, I recommend this movie with confidence, even if you are not a fan of Jackson.
Outlander is a movie about vikings against aliens.Yes, you read it well...vikings against aliens.I do not remember having ever seen something like that.And besides of that originality, Outlander is interesting, very entertaining and even deep.The story from Outlander has some forced and predictable elements, but despite that, it is very well structured and developed by co-screenwriters Howard McCain (who was also the director) and Dick Blackman.The characters are archetypal heroic figures in the line of traditional Nordic epics; in fact, the screenplay has various parallels with Beowulf (the poem, not the mediocre animated film).The actors show a lot of energy and enthusiasm with their characters: Jim Caviezel is very well as the main character, because he feels simultaneously precise and credible; and John Hurt and Sophia Myles also show conviction on their characters.The battle scenes are genuinely exciting; and if we combine that with McCain's solid direction, the competent performances, the interesting characters and the dynamic screenplay, we have a very entertaining experience as a final result.On the beginning from this review, I mentioned that Outlander is a deep movie; it may not be a philosophical premise, but it deserves credit for offering concepts which go beyond the requirements from the story.As examples, I can mention the concise but adequate explanation about the main character's human appearance; or the revelation about the monster's motivation, which adds an interesting narrative level to the movie.In summary, I can recommend Outlander as a very entertaining film, which is much more satisfactory and exciting than many Hollywood blockbusters.
When I was young,my holy trinity of TV series was composed by Lost in Space,Ultraman and Star Trek.When the time went by,I kept appreciating the first two ones because of their fast entertainment and the nostalgic factor...but in Star Trek,I found additional levels which made me to comprehend why the science fiction can express interesting ideas and provocative concepts in order to stimulating the imagination and waking up the curiosity of the spectator about the universe which rounds on him/her.So,I have to admit I am a "trekkie" who has gone to conventions (without a disguise) and who has seen every movie and every single episode from all the series belonging to this franchise (by the way,my favourite one has been The Next Generation,and the one I have least liked is Voyager).However,I am not one of those fans who take their fanaticism to semi-religious extremes,studying the continuity of the Stark Trek universe and remembering every single detail.We do not have to forget that,more than anything else,Star Trek must work as an entertainment,and when its appreciation is replaced by academic precision,I think it looses one of its main virtues.I think we should take that attitude to analyze the new Star Trek movie,because it works wonderfully as an entertainment.This resulted to be an excellent film for many reasons.First of all,this movie is tremendously entertaining on every scene,so it never becomes boring.This movie does not get the narrative heights from the best moments of the saga,but I do not consider that as a fail...after all,the main intention from the movie is re-establishing the Star Trek universe for a new generation,introducing the characters,their motivations and the relationship between them,and the movie perfectly achieves that.The cast is perfect and director J.J. Abrams obtained amazing changes of rhythm,emotion and tone which,on some way,they do not alter the consistency of the story and of its characters.Besides of that,Abrams shows great talent for generating emotive moments and exciting action sequences.The only fail I found on this movie is that,near the ending,a situation has a forced solution.I will not reveal more because I may ruin the movie to some people.In spite of that,I liked this movie very much.Star Trek is an excellent entertainment,and it left me very satisfied.I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm,because I am sure you are going to have a great time with this movie,being or not being a "trekkie".
I had low expectations before watching St. Vincent. The "angry old man who becomes attached with a kid" premise is so trite that it would seem impossible to take it seriously in a 21st century film. That seems too corny and old-fashioned, and I had the hope that St. Vincent would offer something to make it different... but that didn't happen. However, to my surprise, the film works pretty well despite that, mainly thanks to the excellent performances. Bill Murray makes an absolutely credible and expressive work in the leading role, bringing his character life and identity. Melissa McCarthy has a relatively short screen-time, but she realistically transmits the difficult balance between domestic life and her demanding work as a nurse. The kid Jaden Lieberher makes a very solid work, Naomi Watts is perfect as the European prostitute, and Chris O'Dowd brings sincere warmth as a priest. In conclusion, St. Vincent isn't a particularly innovative film, but it knew how to take advantage of its cast and its well-known formula, evoking honest emotions through a mature and measured narrative, culminating into an emotive ending which doesn't feel corny, but justified and satisfactory.
It is not a good augury to examine the tortuous road the film Crossing Over followed until its release.Originally made as a 2 and a half hour movie, Crossing Over was kept "in the shelves" for almost 2 years, while director and screenwriter Wayne Kramer was fighting to preserve his vision; he eventually had to bow himself and accept to edit it into a 113 minutes movie in order to avoid a straight-to-DVD release.And even like that, it only enjoyed a ride on art-house cinemas and film festivals, where it did not receive a very good answer before being exported to the rest of the world, where it was released in cinemas on some countries and straight-to-DVD on other ones (like mine).Unfortunately, the bad augury is justified...Crossing Over is a mediocre and tedious movie.I must be alone on this, but I liked the film Crash (2004) very much; I understand why its message and its characters upset to some people, but I liked the performances, the tone and the ingenious way in which co-screenwriters Paul Haggis and Robert Moresco took the structure of "intercconected stories" to bring it a fresh and dynamic twist.I mentioned all that because Crossing Over is basically Crash, but without that energy and dynamism.Its didactic intention is irritating and all the characters are a living clich√©.Maybe, Kramer should have left his movie untouchable, instead of submitting himself to the whims from a distributor.I do not know if Crossing Over would have been better with 40 additional minutes, but I consider Kramer to be a great director who made very solid work in the past and, because of that, I will give him the benefit of the doubt.The screenplay from this film has many important fails, since there are too many trembling and instructive conversations; sudden changes of attitude; stupid reactions; too many improbable coincidences; and finally, the narrative structure is badly distributed.Nevertheless, I cannot deny the performances from this film are very solid.Summer Bishil and Jacquline Obradors are perfect on their roles; Harrison Ford brings his best performance in many years; Ray Liotta brings good intensity to his role; and Ashley Judd is also credible.However, Crossing Over is a boring and uninteresting movie, which I would put on the same level of a melodramatic soap-opera.Nonetheless, I keep having faith on Kramer's future projects, since his previous work warrants a second chance.
Fantastic Mr. Fox is a brilliant animation film with a charming "retro" animation, a fascinating screenplay and sparkling voice acting from the whole cast (the members who stand out are, by my point of view, George Clooney, Meryl Streep and Bill Murray).Fantastic Mr. Fox is based on a book written by Roald Dahl (1916-1990), one of the few authors who have enjoyed quite a luck with the film adaptations from their books.Movies such as The Witches, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) respected on a big degree Dahl's unusual tone of prose, oriented to children but never condescending or simpleton.Fantastic Mr. Fox is an addition to that honourable group thanks to the irreverent humor co-screenwriters Wes Anderson (who was also the director) and Noah Baumbach brought to the screenplay, stylishly merging the adventure destined to the childish spectators with commentaries on adult subjects.The first thing which strikes in Fantastic Mr. Fox is the rudimentary style of "stop motion" animation employed to bring the characters to life.This old technique has been replaced in the two last decades by the more efficient digital animation, but even the few movies which are still made with "stop motion" (such as Coraline or The Corpse Bride) show a perfect manufacture which is mistake-free and polished to the point of sterility.On the contrary, Anderson and the effects supervisor Tim Ledbury chose a more simple and organic system which stresses the craft value of that discipline, and it makes the "mistakes" (such as the characteristic "rippling" which is noted on the models as a consequence of its manipulation during the animation by hand) to take part into its charm and personality.And the same applies to the ingenious models which work as scenarios and backgrounds, which are full of funny details which do not obstruct their work of creating an imaginative and consistent set.However, Fantastic Mr. Fox offers much more than attractive images.Its screenplay is surprisingly mature for a family film, and even though its characters are anthropomorphic animals, they are not used as excuse to reduce the level of the narrative.On the contrary, the adventures of Mr. Fox are exciting and very entertaining, but what I mostly liked was the dynamic with its wife and son, as well as its interaction with friends, enemies and the rest of the community.The result is an absolutely fascinating film experience.The only fail I found on this movie is that a few elements from the screenplay are not very well polished.But that minor fail did not avoid me from enjoying Fantastic Mr. Fox very much.I totally recommend it, because even if we ignore its multiple levels of narrative deepness, we basically have an hilarious comedy with nice characters, brilliant dialogs and a hugely entertaining screenplay.We really need more animation movies like this one.
Splinter is a truly creepy movie which has a perfect atmosphere and which is full of positive elements.The best element from this movie is the excellent screenplay,which makes a detailed character development and which proposes a fascinating menace in its monster,showing an ambiguous origin and devastating effects.I also liked the way in which it is shown the relationship between the characters very much,because it evolutes on an unpredictable but realistic way.In other words,the suspense is provoked on a natural way,and that makes the spectator to feel a delicious suspense,because it is impossible to predict what can happen next.Something many independent filmmakers do,is developing the story on an only location,because that lets them to exploit their low-budget,avoiding costs on technical team.However,not all of them count with the necessary creativity to conciliate their economical attitude with an interesting story.Fortunately,Splinter is one of that cases because its economical manufacture is perfect for creating the desolated atmosphere the movie requires.The performances are above the average of what we are accustomed to see on the straight-to-DVD movies.Director Toby Wilkins made a brilliant work,because he brought a relentless rhythm and precision,at the same time he could create a perfect atmosphere,he could bring the correct style to the movie and he could extract very competent performances from his small cast.It would be very interesting to see his next projects.The only fail I found on this movie is that some special effects could have been a little bit more polished.In spite of that,I liked Splinter very much.This is one of that gems from the fantastic cinema which occasionally appear,so I recommend it with confidence.This is an excellent horror movie which brought me an intense and enormously entertaining time.
Quantum of Solace, the previous James Bond film, had been a disappointment, mainly because its screenplay had been so "sophisticated" that it ignored the excitement this iconic character should produce on us. Fortunately, co-screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan didn't forget that important element, and as a result, Skyfall is an intense and very entertaining action film.What I liked the most in many James Bond films was Judi Dench's performance as M; that's the reason why I liked seeing her as a more active participant of the story in Skyfall, instead of being relegated to the elegant office where she occasionally scolds Bond for not following the rules. I think I like the M character so much because she's the only one which evokes the genuine espionage cinema, where the intrigue and suspense are more important than the action and the explosions. Fortunately, Purvis, Wade and Logan rescued those old values, and even though there are very good action scenes in Skyfall, what I remember the most after having watched it are the dramatic moments and the competent performances from the whole cast. Daniel Craig keeps being completely credible as Bond, while Naomie Harris is adequate as a rookie agent and Javier Bardem is able to perfectly transmit an air of threaten combined with vulnerability, specially during the extraordinary scene in which his character is introduced.I also liked the way in which Purvis, Wade and Logan initiated the screenplay with an epic tone of a global scope, and they then gradually reduce the scale to an intensely personal conflict, concentrating the suspense and the impact of the action while they support the characters development. On a more abstract level, Purvis, Wade and Logan dissected the essence of Bond himself, and they ended up rethinking many traditional elements of the saga, but leaving the door open to future innovations and adventures. And besides of all that, they introduced naughty winks and references to Bond's legendary past and its most iconic elements: the Walther PPK pistol, the shaken (not stirred) Martini, the obligatory visit to the casino and, of course, the Aston Martin DB5.However, even though I liked the screenplay pretty much, I also found some inconsistencies, logical fails and narrative holes which occasionally "took me out" of the film. I can't name them all because I would be revealing considerable spoilers, but I think I can mention two instances which are quite representative of the mentioned problems. Example 1: the initial sequence is concluded with a tragedy which could have easily been avoided with one or two words nobody thought of saying. Example 2: eventually, the screenplay takes us to a computer hacking scene which is so ridiculously false that it makes Swordfish look like a realistic film. Nevertheless, I enjoyed Skyfall pretty much, and I can definitely recommend it as a solid, exciting and very entertaining action film.
At least I can say this: every Transformers movie has been better than its predecessor, something which defies the downward trend from practically any other sequel. But on the other hand, I do not want to suggest the fact that Michael Bay is maturing as a director, nor that he suddenly comprehended narrative elements such as "rhythm" and "coherence". No; in any case, Bay is just a foreman of a technical team whose hard work makes its best to rescue the weak screenplays from these films. That sounds like an insult, but it in fact is a recognition to the logistic talent which has not been shown by many filmmakers in this time of Hollywood excesses. And Transformers: Dark of the Moon is definitely excessive...but that is precisely what makes it moderately entertaining despite its mediocrity.Screenwriter Ehren Kruger decided to take the easy way by repeating the same formula from the two previous movies: the Autobots and the Decepticons fight to each other in order to obtain a "mcguffin" which will bring them huge power, while the humanity looks terrorized, the government makes stupid mistakes and a small group of soldiers and civilians desperately fights in order to put the balance in the side of the "good ones". It would have been absurd to expect something more ambitious or intelligent from this movie, so it is convenient not to analyze that very much. However, the scale of the battles and the epic tone form every scene (not to mention Steve Jablonsky's music) were enough for me not to get bored with the movie.The human actors from Transformers: Dark of the Moon do not have very substantial material to work with once more. But I liked some exchanges between the giant robots. Their dialogs keep being badly written, but the conviction and intensity brought by the actors who made the voice work were enough to bring some dramatic force to those artificial characters. My favorite voice work is the one from the great Leonard Nimoy.Talking about Spock, I liked the multiple references to Star Trek as well as some "easter eggs" Bay put on the screen (including the most employed background actor in the world). Those details made the intermediate hour, which is a bit tiring due to the slowness with which the supposed "conspiracy" is revealed, more tolerable. And it is obligatory for me to mention the magnificent special effects from Industrial Light and Magic and Digital Domain. Their work is simply perfect, at the same time they highly surpass the narrative virtues from this movie.I decided to watch Transformers: Dark of the Moon on its 3-D version (more because of a schedule convenience than because of my personal taste), and even though that did not contribute to the experience very much, it could achieve something unexpected: moderate Bay's frantic style. I guess that the 3-D style requires more discipline and planning at the time of the filming, and the result is that the action scenes feel better directed than in the previous films mainly because they are clearer. They are not a chaotic combination of chrome, gears and sparks anymore, but well choreographed battles between the giant robots.In conclusion, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a mediocre movie, but it is better than the two previous films, and it kept me moderately entertained despite the many fails from its screenplay, so I can give it a slight recommendation.
Brick Mansions is a remake of the entertaining French film Banlieue 13, which was basically an exhibition of "parkour" structured around a screenplay inspired by Escape from New York. Brick Mansions moves the action to the United States, and adds Paul Walker as a co-star in order to have a famous name; and from the original film, it preserved the presence from David Belle in the role of an ex-convict with a golden heart whose incredible "abs" and acrobatic ability are indispensable for him to navigate the dangerous territory of Detroit, where the story is developed (even though, ironically, most of the film was shot in Canada). What it couldn't preserve was big part of the violence; it seems as if director Camille Delamarre didn't want to risk himself to an "R" rating, and he diluted the most extreme parts in order to obtain the more commercial "PG-13". Anyway, I found Brick Mansions mediocre, but moderately entertaining, despite the hollow characters and a tangled and improbable screenplay whose main function is finding excuses for the frequent fights, shootouts, car chases and, of course, the "parkour" scenes where Belle and his disciples can display their physical ability. Walker was given the dramatic scenes, and he made an adequate work, even though his character is quite similar to the one he developed in The Fast and the Furious saga. But anyway, since Brick Mansions is one of the last films from his filmography, there's no doubt that his character in here is consistent with the rest of it, and once more, he proves the histrionic growth he achieved, from his beginnings as a bland gallant until becoming a decent actor. For the rest, Brick Mansions didn't bore me, but it's mediocre, and I found Banlieue 13 much more intense and entertaining. Besides, I didn't like the decision of dubbing Belle's dialogs. I guess his accent was considered too French. Maybe, if he had been an Austrian, they would have let him speak English despite nobody understanding a word from him...
The film Mission: Impossible 3 had faced two difficult problems...bringing a new life to a franchise which seemed extinct, and making the audience to forget about Tom Cruise's notorious TV outburst (not to mention his controversial religion and supposedly arranged marriage). Personally, I liked Mission: Impossible 3 pretty much, even though many people considered it was nothing more than a long (and very expensive) episode of the TV series Alias; however, it earned enough money in order to guarantee the making of another sequel which, on some way, feels like the preamble of a future reboot with a new group of secret agents. In that aspect, Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol works reasonably well at combining fresh faces with old acquaintances and reducing the emphasis on Cruise in order to focus on the whole team. However, on the narrative level, Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol did not leave me completely satisfied because of the various weaknesses from its screenplay.In other occasions, I complained about the spy movies with too many explosions and very few espionage, but I think that the Mission: Impossible saga occupies a unique niche, simultaneously defined by the modern action cinema and the "hi-tech" intrigue from the original TV series. That is the exact combination employed by Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, and the result is competent...even though it never reaches the necessary levels of exuberance or ingenuity in order to make it genuinely memorable. In other words, the screenplay is built by classic pieces from the franchise: the tense infiltration into an impregnable fortress...the disguises...the gadgets with an incredible technology...and the elaborated stunts accompanied by the iconic theme song by Lalo Schiffrin (re-interpreted once more by Michael Giacchino). Unfortunately, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol did not make too much effort in order to distinguish itself from what we saw in the past.Besides, the screenplay has that modular and disjointed structure which has become almost obligatory in the action genre, with a lot of movement, constant sensation of urgency, but few or none narrative sense. The screenplay takes us from Budapest to Moscow, then to Dubai and then to India in pursuit of the "mcguffin" in turn, but the order of the scenes could be exchanged with each other without affecting the story. The shape drives the substance, when it should be the opposite. And then we have the villain, poorly interpreted by Michael Nyqvist, exacerbating the fact that his character is a bit artificially written (you don't know how much I missed the bombastic villain interpreted by the always brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman in Mission: Impossible 3).After all those complaints, you might be thinking I hated Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, but the truth is that it kept me entertained the whole time. Besides, I liked the establishment of the new team of agents. Cruise feels enthusiastic and credible in his role. Paula Patton also makes a competent work (even though I found the typical scene in which her character must seduce a villain incredibly forced and unnecessary -in my humble opinion, that scene is the lowest point in the whole movie-), while Simon Pegg is appropriate as the comic relief. And finally, Jeremy Renner brings another one of his intense performances. As a group, the four actors have a good chemistry with each other.Another important player from Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is Brad Bird, a talented director of animated films (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles and Ratatouille -Wow!-) who made his live-action debut in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol with a solid result, because he employed the dynamic and methodic cadence from the classic action cinema, accelerating the rhythm whenever it is necessary, but without overwhelming us with closed takes or confusing us with excessive edition. In conclusion, I liked Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, and I can give it a moderate recommendation, despite the fact of not being a particularly memorable experience.
On many aspects,Seven Pounds reminded me to the movies directed by Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu.But that is not saying too much because I do not like the depressing films I√±√°rritu directs too much ,because I find them too simple and hollow when they pretend to be deep and complex.As all the movies by that Mexican director,Seven Pounds tells its story on a non-linear style,which immediately creates suspense for slowly revealing its chain of causes and consequences; and it also rounds on a tragic event which affects various lives.But what makes Seven Pounds way superior to any of the I√±√°rritu's movies is that the story,when it is finally decoded,is much richer and it generates a bigger emotional impact than I√±√°rritu's forced films.Seven Pounds is a very interesting film which offers many positive elements.The best element from this film is that the slow deployment of information,emotions and relationships automatically holds the attention on the spectator and it made me wonder what was going to happen next.The performances from Seven Pounds are not bad,although they all have the aura of "I am acting" which affects so many dramas of similar style.I mean,the actors do not make a bad work on constructing their characters,but they do not feel natural or spontaneous.Maybe,the reason of that is that the drama is so intense and tortuous that very few actors could represent this kind of characters without having suffered similar situations.They say acting is 90% imagination but it is easy to speculate that talented actors (like the ones from this movie) could have difficulties in representing scenes which are completely outside of their human experience.In order,some people could plead that the performances were not completely solid...by my point of view,the actors did their best effort in adapting to the extreme material,and I appreciate their professionalism,although the final result was not 100% credible.As a good point of comparison to evaluate Seven Pounds,I can mention the film The Pursuit of Happiness,the previous collaboration between director Gabriele Muccino and actor Will Smith.Both movies deal with painful personal issues and they manipulate the emotions from the spectator a little bit,but both have a touch of honesty which made me excuse that easy trick and,as a final result,I could enjoy them pretty much.The fails I found on this movie are two.For one sight,some moments do not properly "connect" with the spectator while some attitude changes on the supporting characters are a bit sudden.However,those fails are compensated until a certain point,because a few seconds later,we will discover another surprise,another mystery or another character which makes richer the main enigma from this movie.Seven Pounds is not a great movie,but I cannot deny it kept me very entertained and interested,not to mention it provoked an emotional impact on me.I can recommend this movie with confidence.
I think that the current trend of the "pseudo-documentaries" in the horror genre obeys to two main factors: first, it allows the addition of a stylish variation to all those rancid and stale formulas which seemed worn by such a repetition (like the masked killer, haunted house, "torture-porn", etc.), which acquire a varnish of innovation when they are disguised as "true events". And in second place, this trend allows the making of movies with an intentionally bad manufacture, something which is simple when there are not too many available resources. After all, why worrying about the illumination, the cinematography or the "mise en sc√©ne", when they can simply put a group of amateur actors in front of the camera and call that "documentary"? Sure, there have been some pseudo-documentaries which took advantage of the opportunity to create something interesting (like Cloverfield and Lake Mungo); but most of those films take that as an excuse to lower the standards of the genre even more (Paranormal Entity might be the clearest example). I think that the film Apollo 18 is on some intermediate point between both extremes, because even though I found its screenplay absurd, repetitive and occasionally a bit tiring, it generally kept me moderately entertained because of the realism of its "verit√©" aesthetic and the attention to every detail shown on its production.The screenplay from Apollo 18 is something like an hybrid of Alien, Sunshine and Moon, even though with all the fantastic elements reduced in order to increment the realism from the story. That might be the main reason why the film did not leave me very satisfied, and it even bored me a little bit during its most "exciting" moments. The trailers of Apollo 18 promised a horror film, but the truth is that it lacks of the necessary impact in order to provoke an emotional or even visceral impact. Even the "scares" feel forced in the documentary context (not to mention the difficulty of accepting the fact that the characters keep filming when any sensible person would have dropped the camera in front of the first sign of danger). Another problem is that the performances feel bland and not very credible. It was undoubtedly a good decision to pick unknown faces not to ruin the "realistic" premise, but I think they should have picked actors with more talent and charisma.Having said all that, I have to give Apollo 18 a slight recommendation because of its solid recreation of the lunar mission. The version of the Moon presented by the movie might not be totally faithful from the scientific point of view, but it is more than enough for us to accept the premise and visually transport us to the satellite we had only seen in brief clips from the NASA and in sci-fi movies which had only showed various stones on a sandy field. I know that I should not be giving a movie even a slight recommendation only because of its special effects, but they are so good in this movie that I am going to make an exception, also stating the fact that the movie achieves a few good moments of tension during the first half. However, I regret the fact that the visual talent from this film could not adorn a better (and more terrifying) story.
Most of the reviews I had read about The Dissapearence of Alice Creed were focused on actress Gemma Arterton's nudity, and they suggested that this film was a simple vehicle for this British star, maybe in search of a recognition as a "serious" actress. However, The Dissapearence of Alice Creed ended up being a wonderful thriller thanks to its intelligent screenplay, perfect direction and brilliant performances.Arterton, Eddie Marsan and Martin Compston make a fantastic work at bringing their characters to life despite the facts that the film's short running time and frantic rhythm do not let too much time to deepen into their characters' past. However, the actors perfectly transmit everything we have to know, and as the story evolves, we have the revelations of the complex network of causes and consequences which make The Disappearance of Alice Creed to be deliciously unpredictable and exciting. It is truly remarkable to see what director and screenwriter J Blakeson could achieve with such a modest film. In summary, this film left me infinitely more satisfied than many Hollywood inflated spectacles from the same genre. In other words, we are in presence of another triumph from independent cinema which gives a lesson of narrative economy and technical efficiency to Hollywood.Speaking of which, the movie's real star is Blakeson's screenplay, whose previous work for The Descent: Part 2 did not indicate this level of quality. Besides, he shows the same precision and consistency as a director by creating a magnificent atmosphere of tension and by extracting perfect performances from his cast. In conclusion, I very enthusiastically recommend The Disappearance of Alice Creed as a hidden gem which leaves perfectly clear that first-class cinema does not need big investments of money nor Hollywood stars; having big talent in front of and behind the cameras is more than enough. I hope Hollywood is taking down notes, but I unfortunately doubt it.
First of all, I have to make the warning that, despite its title and colorful poster, Taking Woodstock is not a modern recreation of the epic festival celebrated in August from 1969.In fact, the film does not include even an original song from Woodstock, neither bands nor scenes of the concert (well, it includes one of them, but it is not focused on the concert itself).The purpose from Taking Woodstock is much more modest, because it puts the attention on the experiences of Elliot Tiber, a Jewish young man who made the concert possible when he contacted the organizer from the event with the owner from the farm where the concert would eventually be made.That sounds trivial, and it in fact is like that; but for two hours we can see details about the organization from the festival; the effect the "hippie" spirit had on Tiber and his family...and the terror from the community when they realized that the event would be much...MUCH bigger than they had ever imagined.The people who always wanted to know about those details may enjoy this film.But I am not one of them, and I found Taking Woodstock to be a horribly tedious experience.I suppose screenwriter James Schamus thought that the story of this film seemed as a good idea...a story about the Woodstock festival, but told from behind the stage...or, better said, behind the farm, where we could supposedly appreciate the personal and human angle from the event, and maybe making us to be witnesses of the efforts made by hundreds of people to make something iconic and memorable, which truly changed the world.But the horrible result from the movie is very far away from that, and it is reduced to a simplistic melodrama saturated of clich√©s, hollow characters and apathetic performances which do not bring too much energy or credibility.Besides, as many antiquated expressions Schamus included in the screenplay ("Far Out!", "Groovy!"), that is not enough to evoke the "hippie" ideology from that time, or the exuberant freedom (some may say "anarchy") which woke the festival up.I think that this movie needed a more focused and much less diffuse screenplay, which had a concrete purpose instead of simply showing disjointed scenes with poor narrative sense and unfunny "humor".What is more, the cast is absolutely lacking of motivation, with one exception.To start with, we have the bland Demetri Martin on the leading role.I have to say I could never swallow this comedian very much, at the same time he aspires to the niche of "likeable loser" which is perfectly exploited by Jesse Eisenberg and Michael Cera.However, Martin absolutely lacks of any presence, credibility...and congeniality.Emile Hirsch is absolutely lost with his character, and even the usually brilliant Imelda Staunton feels bland and forced on her character.The only exception I previously mentioned is Liev Schreiber, who is the only member of the cast who shows personality and conviction on his character.In summary, Taking Woodstock is a tedious and terribly uninteresting film experience which I do not recommend by any means.I suppose there are hundreds of interesting stories related to Woodstock; unfortunately, this is definitely not one of them.
Due to the fact that The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was the only release in cinemas this week in my country, I decided to go to see it despite not having any interest in it, having hated the first film from the saga and having never seen the second one, subtitled Prince Caspian. And even though I did not end up hating The Voyage of the Dawn Treader as much as the first film, I still found it to be a tedious and unsatisfactory movie.I read the first book from the saga from which this movies are based on (The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe) during my adolescence, when I was too old to get interested in the story from that book. But beyond of that, I think author C.S. Lewis (1898-1963) was one of the first promoters of the horrible ideology "it does not care if it makes sense as long as it is for the children". In other words, the book The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is full of arbitrary events, unjustified surprises and characters who come and go without any other motive than rescuing Lewis for some problem he could not (or did not want) to logically solve. So, for better or for worse, the films The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader decided to keep the same focus, something which might be appreciated by the fans of the books...but not by me.The Voyage of the Dawn Treader has many action scenes and practically constant special effects; those two things try to convince us that something important and special is happening on the movie, when in fact they are used in order to disguise the fact that they are simple moments of a doubtful relevance and not too much connection with the rest of the scenes. On the positive side, the special effects are well done, and I liked Simon Pegg's voice acting as Reepicheep.There were moments from The Voyage of the Dawn Treader in which I was genuinely about to fall asleep (yes, even during some action scenes). So, I cannot recommend it based on my personal experience, even though I perfectly understand the attraction it can provoke on little children or on the fans of the books.
I have liked the movies directed by Tom Tykwer pretty much.He won worldwide fame in 1998 with his frenetic movie Run Lola Run.And,although the rest of his career has gone a little bit unnoticed,I think he improved with every new movie (my favorite movies by him are Perfume : The Story of a Murderer and Heaven).And although The International is one of his least obtained movies,I found it exciting and very entertaining.It can be alleged that a movie like this one,which shows the evilness of the international banks,came in the best moment,but I am not totally sure it is like that.One year ago,it would have been surprising to see the favorite product from banks is not money,but debts.The recent worldwide crisis has made that thing well known,so I think The International looses a little bit of impact...although the movie compensates that with many positive elements.Although the movie has some jumps of logic and convenient coincidences,it offers enough doses of atmosphere and suspense to make of it a very entertaining experience.The International has some unexpected twists and the conviction from the actors on those scenes also helps.I also appreciated the dynamic development from the story.Tykwer made a good work as a director.The meditative moments never feel boring and the action sequences are well filmed and perfectly choreographed.I have to mention that the movie's intention is not to be an action movie,but a methodical spy thriller which has some action scenes.Clive Owen has been doing very similar characters to the one he performs in this movie on recent years,but his development is always competent.Naomi Watts also brings a solid performance but,by my point of view,the best member of the cast is Armin Mueller-Stahl,an excellent character actor who has an impressing presence and style.His character in this movie is similar to the one he performed in Eastern Promises,but he shows a completely different personality in this movie,which is a sample of his great talent.I can recommend The International with confidence.As I said,it is one of Tykwer's least obtained movies and it is not excellent,but I had a very good time watching this movie.
Director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the modern titans of worldwide animation cinema, even though his films have not had as much diffusion as they would deserve.Unfortunately, his most recent film Ponyo on a Cliff, suffered from the same destiny because, at least in my country, it was released on very few cinemas and with zero publicity.That's a shame, because Ponyo on a Cliff is an excellent animation film which tells a very imaginative story, which is simple on its shape but complex on its depth.Ponyo on a Cliff does not obey to Hollywood formulas, there are not any musical numbers or well defined villains.It simply tells an ingenious, deep and hugely entertaining story.It would be a mistake to compare it with the Disney film The Little Mermaid only because both are based on the traditional fable from Hans Christian Andersen.They are so different with each other that it would not have any sense to say Ponyo on a Cliff is "better" (although I definitely enjoyed it much more), because it is based on a different value system, where selling toys or satisfying marketing requirements is not important...the emphasis is on showing the vision of a true artist like Miyazaki, whose amazing imagination forges a story of an unusual and unpredictable structure, but with human and realistic characters who are easy to identify with.The only fail I found on this movie is that some details feel a bit forced.In spite of that minor fail, Ponyo on a Cliff deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation for many things but mainly, because it is full of magic and imagination.It may not be Miyazaki's best movie (I think that one is Princess Mononoke so far), but still, this is an excellent film worthy of admiration.
7 years ago, producers Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson obtained an unexpected economical success with the film My Big Fat Greek Wedding, a mediocre romantic comedy with ethnic "taste" and very limited creativity.Now, My Life in Ruins tries to reproduce the formula with the same main actress...and other clich√©s.My Life in Ruins is a bland and boring comedy with a cloying screenplay and a forced message about the magic of love.My Life in Ruins is the kind of film which is usually found on a plane trip or filling space in the daytime of some TV channels destined to women.Its superficial romance is absolutely inoffensive; its basic humor does not require any effort in order to be assimilated; and its ending is completely insipid.It is easy to note there was not much effort put in this movie.Two of the few good elements in this movie are the decent performances from Nia Vardalos and the great Richard Dreyfuss.The rest of the cast is anonymous.I do not recommend My Life in Ruins, because I found it to be a boring and insipid experience.
From the first minutes of Australia,director Baz Luhrmann makes us believe the film is going to be about the "stolen generations",a shameful period in the Australian history,which had been portrayed in the excellent film Rabbit Proof Fence.But half an hour later,it is obvious that in fact,Luhrmann's intention was making his own version of Titanic (with touches of Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz),using the same tools that made of that one,the most successful film in the History of cinema : a tiring forbidden romance between two people,set on a historical drama,with humor based on the culture crash and a lot of epic images...which do not dissimulate the weakness of the screenplay and the lack of strong characters.Australia is a bland movie which bored me pretty much.Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are excellent actors who shine when they work with a good screenplay and a director who knows exactly what he wants.Unfortuanately,they are wasted on this movie.The screenplays is weak : the story never flows naturally,it does not have a good rhythm and it occasionally tries to provoke emotion with poorly done scenes of tragedy,drama and romance.Do not misunderstand me...I liked Luhrmann's previous work very much (from the brilliant Strictly Ballroom to the extraordinary Moulin Rouge,without forgetting his very innovative interpretation of Romeo + Juliet).But,I think he made the first false move of his career in this movie because he cheated to his style,aspiring to make an epic film,when his talent is more appropriate for intimate and intense stories made with an unusual visual style.In other words,all the contrary to what his most recent movie resulted to be.I wish him better luck on his next project.The only two elements I appreciated on this movie are its spectacular cinematography and the special effects,which are very well done.I do not recommend Australia,a movie full of epic images but without honest emotions or dramatic weight.In my case,Australia resulted a boring experience.
I am not a fan of boxing, but I understand the irresistible attraction it exercises on many people, including filmmakers who try to capture all the drama, pain and passion generated into the ring in the big screen. Boxing is an undoubtedly difficult sport, which cannot be practiced by anybody; and even though it requires many sacrifices, it can also offer extraordinary rewards (at least under Hollywood's affected interpretation). So, the best movies about boxing have a perfect combination of emotion, drama and action...as we can now see in The Fighter, an extraordinary film which departs a little bit from the formula, but without ignoring the traditional elements which can make this sub-genus to be cathartic and satisfactory.In films like Rocky, Cinderella Man and The Wrestler, the fight in the ring is a metaphor of the real fight from the main character, either if it is for going out of poverty, for showing his personal value or for recovering the dignity which was snatched to him by life in other aspects. But in The Fighter, the fights are a peripheral element, because the real conflict is not on the ring, but in the modest suburbs from Lowell, Massachussets, where the characters must face emotional disputes and take hard decisions which will deeply affect their future as well as their family. Do not misunderstand me...the fights are fantastically filmed, and they brought me great moments of hope, tragedy and suspense. But the most memorable scenes (at least by my point of view) were not the punching, falls and miraculous recoveries, but the dramatic confrontations from the main character with his brother, his mother, his trainers, his girlfriend, and other people who only wanna see him triumphing, even though they do not coincide in the way he must take to achieve it.Before watching The Fighter, I was fearing that it would be a simple boxing rehash of the brilliant film The Wrestler, which was directed by Darren Aronofsky; and my fears were accentuated when I found out that Aronofsky himself was a co-producer of The Fighter. However, after having watched this movie, I have to say that there is nothing to fear of...even though both films have a vaguely similar story, their style and atmosphere are very different. The only things they have in common are the high quality from the performances and the emotional impact they provoked on me. Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale bring excellent performances, and the acclamation they both received is absolutely deserved. The supporting cast also made a perfect work, starting by Melissa Leo and Amy Adams as the mother and the lover (respectively) from the main character. I also liked the work from Jack McGee very much. And finally, the unknown actresses who interpret the 7 daughters from the Ward family also made a brilliant work, and they bring some of the most dramatic and also some of the most humorous moments from this movie.I also liked the previous work from director David O. Russell, but I think that The Fighter is definitely his best movie so far. One of the things I most liked from The Fighter is the style employed by him, which is fluid and dynamic but at the same time incredibly thorough, capturing the big dramatic moments as well as the small and eloquent details which fill in the narrative holes from the story's periphery with a casual precision, enriching the narrative and increasing the dramatic weight from every scene. It is like watching a story through a filmmaker's eyes; it supposedly should be always like that, but while I was watching The Fighter, I noticed that that is unfortunately something that rarely happens. In conclusion, The Fighter is a splendid film which deserves a highly enthusiastic recommendation for succeeding so much in every single aspect.
Like many other romantic comedies, Love and Other Drugs tries to sell us the relationship which arises between opposite extremes who hate to themselves on the beginning; and, sure, both extremes are interpreted by attractive actors, something which could make the situation to be more credible. Unfortunately, the love which arises between their characters is so forcedly written that it ends up being difficult to make it credible to the spectator.However, the circumstances which lead both characters to meet with each other are a bit different to what we are accustomed to see in romantic comedies. The man works as a pharmaceutical representative from the company Pfizer, and he tries to sell products like Zoloft and Viagra at any cost, without caring about their secondary effects, high price or their doubtful usefulness in medical treatments. Meanwhile, the woman suffers from a severe condition which requires many drugs, and as a consequence, the movie makes an analysis on the marketing attitude from big pharmaceutical laboratories and the doubtful ethic from some doctors, contrasting them with the real suffering from the patients. That aspect from the movie is moderately interesting and very serious, while the romance and cheerful behaviors from the main characters break that tone with insipid comedy. The final result is that Love and Other Drugs feels like an imbalanced movie whose different tones do not combine well with themselves.I appreciate the fact that Love and Other Drugs tried to do something more or less different into the romantic comedy genre. But the combination of serious and light subjects does not feel natural, and as a consequence, the movie did not leave me very satisfied. Besides, the comedy aspect from this film did not make me laugh too much. Anyway, I think that Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal deserve credit for their competent performances. The rest of the cast does not have too much material to work with, so the actors simply do what they can with their roles.So, despite being such an irregular movie and not being very satisfactory, I think Love and Other Drugs deserves a slight recommendation mainly because of its good intention of doing something a bit different. However, I would have preferred the movie to either find a much better balance of its styles or to extirpate the romantic comedy angle. In summary, it is not bad, but it kinda left me with a bitter taste.
I am ready to declare director and screenwriter Rod Lurie as a successor of Oliver Stone.I am not talking about the bland Stone who made Alexander, W. and Nixon, but about the excellent filmmaker who took dry premises and told fascinating stories, such as the ones from JFK, Natural Born Killers, Born on the Fourth of July and Wall Street, out of them.Like Stone, Lurie has been keeping a low profile on recent years, but most of his films (Deterrance, The Contender and now Nothing But the Truth) have that intense energy and tenacious conviction which make them hypnotic, substantial and hugely entertaining.Nothing But the Truth was unfortunately not exhibited in cinemas from the United States due to economical problems from its distributor.Luckily, its release on DVD will give it more diffusion to benefit itself and the audience, because this is a fascinating political thriller, which has an emotive human centre and lacks of partisanship, and in which the ambiguous politics from the North American government stop being abstract words in order to become into tangible situations which affect the lives from many people.On the beginning of Nothing But the Truth, we are informed that the story is fictitious; however, it is clear that it is inspired on the real case of Judith Miller, a reporter from The New York Times who was imprisoned for not revealing the source which reported Valerie Plame as a secret agent from the CIA.In fact, I had never understood the relevance of that news, but Nothing But the Truth considerably helped me to understand its meaning and consequences.Whatever the way it is, I dare to say that Lurie used the Miller-Plame case as an excuse to build a tense story in which the eternal disjunctive between national security and individual freedom is examined.Even though it is easy to feel on the side from the main character of Nothing But the Truth, the movie refuses to bring us an easy solution, because it is evident the government must protect the secrets which may favor the "political elite", but which obliquely also protect the population, who live their ordinary existence without noticing the disgusting decisions required to keep it safe from internal and external threatens.On that level, Nothing But the Truth is incredibly honest and real.The only fail I found on this movie is that the ending is a bit predictable.However, that does not avoid me from recommending this fascinating and intelligent political thriller which has many layers under its surface, at the same time it offers excellent performances from Kate Beckinsale, Vera Farmiga and Alan Alda and solid direction from a filmmaker who has already consecrated himself as a provocative but fair voice in the contemporary ideological cinema.
Absentia is one of my favorite horror films, and that's why I was very interested in watching Oculus, director Mike Flanagan's following movie. And even though I didn't like it as much as Absentia, Oculus is a brilliant sample of supernatural horror with an excellent screenplay, solid performances and moments of a delicious suspense. The "haunted mirror" concept isn't new in the fantastic genre, but co-screenwriters Flanagan and Jeff Howard found an interesting variant which plays with our perception and disorients us until we lose the dividing line between "reality" and fantasy. That mechanic ends up employing a few narrative traps, but it's always subject to an internal logic which avoids any ramblings. Besides, that requires very precise performances, because the reactions from the characters will be our guide to navigate the story, which alternates between past and present in order to portray a family in crisis, who might possibly be a victim of supernatural events, or of the bad decisions from a couple jaded by marriage. That duality is the indispensable emotional hook for the characters to come to life, instead of being simple puppets from the screenplay. Karen Gillan brings a competent performance as a woman whose passion for proving her parents' innocence might take her to extremes of pathological mania. As her character's brother, Brenton Thwaites also makes a solid work while having a good chemistry with Gillan. As their childish counterparts, we have Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan making an excellent work as kids who are terrified by their parents' collapse. Finally, Rory Cochrane and Katee Sackhoff play the previously mentioned husbands with an appropriate ambiguity. Regarding the horror elements, Flanagan keeps himself away from the classic tricks of the genre, creating an atmosphere of tension and anguish which is increased as it plunges us into the mystery of the mirror. So, even though I didn't find Oculus as good as Absentia, I can enthusiastically recommend it as an excellent horror film which explores new alternatives in a genre which urgently needs them. Besides, Flanagan has proved that he's definitely not a "one-hit wonder".
As well as The Girl Who Played With Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is not as good as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, but it definitely is a very good movie on its own merit, and it definitely deserves a recommendation, with the warning that it will be incomprehensible if you have not seen the two previous movies. In summary, I think that The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is a very satisfactory conclusion of the trilogy.Even though some people might think that concluding the trilogy with a sober legal thriller is anti-climatic, the movie kept me very interested the whole time. Most of the movie is developed in rooms, cells and offices, but that did not avoid director Daniel Alfredson from keeping a dynamic rhythm. Besides, the screenplay shows a good dominion over its considerable number of characters, and it never falls into improbable tangles or absurd extremes of melodrama.Two complaints I have against this movie is that there are a few scenes which feel a bit irrelevant; and that the story is so complex that it occasionally saturated me of information, because as it plunges us into investigations, conspiracies and intrigues, we find more and more names, places and relationships, and I felt myself slightly lost in a few occasions for not recognizing a complicated Swedish name, or the face of someone I had already seen. Sure, that could be a problem more from my brain than from the movie. Besides, I understand that, since it is the adaptation of a book, we can be sure that there will be a certain level of condensation of the story in order to keep the movie's running time on a reasonable level. And I think that the final result was pretty good, because the film kept me very entertained and interested.As for the cast, our old acquaintances Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace bring perfect performances in the leading roles once more, and I also liked the work from Lena Endre, Annika Hallin, Anders Ahlborn, Jacob Ericksson and specially Micke Spreitz. However, the story is the film's main star, and despite not being an excellent film, I liked The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest pretty much, even though I felt some melancholy when it ended for knowing that the late author Stieg Larsson (1954-2004) will not write anymore about the adventures from the characters Lisbeth Salander and Michael Blomkvist.
The black-and-white cinematography and the minimalistic screenplay might suggest Nebraska is an art-house film. But there's nothing to worry about, because screenwriter Bob Nelson and director Alexander Payne bring an abundant level of emotion to every scene, making the film to transcend the family melodrama niche which is so common in independent cinema. The great Bruce Dern received deserved acclamation for his extraordinary performance in Nebraska, and the rest of the cast also brought an excellent work, highlighting Will Forte, who shows a considerable dramatic talent he had rarely shown during his years on Saturday Night Live. Nebraska isn't a movie for every taste, and I understand why some people could consider it slow and boring, but I found it to be an extraordinary film, with an unexpected deepness behind its ordinary characters, prosaic situations and mundane settings. I'm not an unconditional fan of Payne's, but I definitely think Nebraska is his best movie so far.
We have finally reached the ending of The Hobbit saga, and even though The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the film I have liked the most of the trilogy, it made me think that the adaptation of the novel would have worked better in two films, instead of three. I think the character Bard and the Lake-town should have been introduced in the first film; less time should have been invested on the goblins' mines; and, frankly, I also think that the crusade of the midgets should have been more agile and better focused on Thorin's evolution, because until now, on the ending the saga, it earns the dramatic weight it should have had since the beginning of the story, instead of being interrupted and diverting through uncountable directions and moments I now feel useless inside the total framework of the saga. But, well... that applies to the whole trilogy. Specifically speaking about The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, I found it satisfactory and very entertaining with exciting action sequences and good moments of melancholy, hope and redemption. The actors make an excellent work in their roles, starting by Richard Armitage, who perfectly transmits the obsession his character has for the kingdom of Erebor. Martin Freeman also makes a solid work, credibly balancing the virtues and occasional malice from his character Bilbo. Lee Pace brings many nuances to the arrogant King Thranduil, while Aidan Turner and Evangeline Lilly make a credible work and have a good chemistry with each other, even though I think the inclusion of the romantic sub-plot between their characters is a bit arbitrary. And Ian McKellen brings his usual conviction and imposing presence to Gandalf. As for the special effects, settings and art direction, the work from Richard Taylor and Weta Digital keeps being very good, even though they occasionally waver when simulating the human movement during impossible or big scale situations; despite the quality of the images, they don't always deceive the eye of the spectator. In conclusion, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a solid conclusion of the trilogy, solving some of its problems, tying loose ends and finding the dramatic gravity which should have also been present in the two previous films
A dancer spins so fast that he perforates the floor from the runway where he dances.A ballet dancer rehearses at her home and she knocks the members of her family with the feet during her swift pirouettes.The dance teacher's surname is Camelto√© (with an accent on the "e" to make it sound French).And, as anachronistic as it sounds, we also have a pie in the face.That is the general level of the jokes you will find on this repulsive "movie" called Dance Flick.And we also have in here the obligatory parodies of current events, celebrities and mostly musical movies, even though some of the parodied ones have nothing to do with the musical genre, such as Twilight.However, considering the inexistent quality from this sub-genre (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans), it should not surprise me that co-screenwriters Keenen Ivory, Shawn, Marlon, Craig and Damien Dante Wayans (the last one was also the director) were desperate to generate any laughs.Needless to say that they did not achieve that.The thing which mostly surprised me from Dance Flick is that its producers invested money on the rights from songs such as Fame, Maniac and Superfreak.Sure, we do not hear the original versions in here, but their brief inclusion on such a cheap and improvised movie called my attention.Dance Flick is one of those movies which are so bad which provoked me nausea and made me to wanna puke.Do not waste your time and your money on such a piece of crap like this one.
The trailers of Abduction suggested the film would be a teenage version of The Bourne Identity, and that ended up being quite true. The screenplay combines action and espionage with a character in a desperate search of his authentic identity, while sinister figures try to capture him. However, I found Abduction more similar to Disturbia. They both "borrow" stories used in previous movies and rethink them in a light version destined to the contemporary spectators, with young actors in the leading roles, action and some romance. And, as well as Disturbia, Abduction ended up being better than I expected, because even though I found it mediocre, it kept me moderately entertained because of its charismatic performances and adequate direction.20 years ago, director John Singleton made an impact in Hollywood with his first film Boyz 'n' the Hood, but his following filmography was rather irregular, with him trying to find a niche where he could thrive without betraying his sensibility. Abduction is far from being his best movie (in my humble opinion, that one would be Shaft -2000-), but his direction is fluid, something which helped me to endure the weak and predictable screenplay from the movie. The villains are totally generic, while the tracks the main character follows in his investigation are incredibly absurd and arbitrary. Besides, the screenplay includes a few moments which provoke involuntary humor.The main attraction of Abduction for many people is the presence of Taylor Lautner in the leading role. He might not be an excellent actor, but he shows charisma and a good scenic presence. And his physical ability makes him a credible "action star".Some people will hate Abduction because of Lautner's presence in the leading role; other ones will adore it for that same reason. I do not belong to none of those extremes, but I think the film deserves a slight recommendation, because even though the film is mediocre and forgettable, it kept me moderately entertained while I was watching it.
In the last 5 years, I have seen so many "realistic" criminal thrillers that I tend to mix them up in my memory (examples: A Walk Among the Tombstones, Dead Man Down, Safe House, The Town, Homefront, Killing Them Softly, Takers, The Last Stand, Bullet to the Head, Brooklyn's Finest, Contraband, etc.). It might be because they are all similar with each other, or because my memory is as consistent as a wet piece of bread. Anyway, I estimate that in a few weeks, the film The Drop will incorporate itself to my diffuse memory of tough mobsters, stoic semi-retired murderers, and corrupt policeman. But while that happens, I definitely appreciated the astute screenplay of The Drop, as well as its solid performances and oppressive atmosphere of a criminal underworld lacking of honor or glamour. The Drop focuses its attention into the dynamic of a New Yorker neighborhood whose inhabitants occupy different levels of intersection with organized crime, either tolerating its influence on daily life; plunging into it in order to earn easy money; or, in the main character's case, keeping himself aside and avoiding fatal mistakes, something which includes antagonizing some Chechen mobster or falling in love with the wrong woman. The basic points of the story are quite common (ambition, loyalty, betrayal), but the most interesting things are the detailed performances, the texture of the characters and the naturalness of their experiences. In other words, as much the plans get complicated and the suspense is incremented, the focus of the film is on the persons. What takes me to the perfect performances from the whole cast, starting by Tom Hardy, bringing deepness and a good control over the emotions to his character. In his last performance, James Gandolfini makes a nuanced and credible work as an ex-mobster who was once on top... until a more aggressive generation without the "old school" honor came. And Noomi Rapace brings a brilliant performance, perfectly displaying strength or vulnerability, according the the requirements of every scene. The supporting cast also makes a good work, and director Micha√´l R. Roskam brings energy and spontaneity to the film. As I previously said, I don't expect The Drop to remain in my memory for a long time, but I liked it pretty much, and I recommend it as a well written and elegantly executed thriller.
Even though I liked The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo very much, I wanted to keep my expectations for The Girl Who Played With Fire low, because at being a sequel I considered that it was not going to equal the innovation from the first film, or that it was going to repeat the fascinating development of the relationship between the two main characters.And even though that I was right on both things, I have to admit that The Girl Who Played With Fire is a solid movie on its own, with an ingenious and complex screenplay and with a good atmosphere of suspense.The central mystery from The Girl Who Played With Fire might be a bit more conventional than the one from The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, but that does not avoid it from being a very interesting film.And I have to mention that you should definitely see the first film before watching this sequel, not only to appreciate the dynamic between the two main characters more, but also to understand the motivation from characters who occasionally act against any common sense.I think that The Girl Who Played With Fire fulfills with its intention of enriching the narrative from the first movie by introducing new characters and enough revelations which genuinely make it a continuation, without losing the attention of the subjects which had already been established.The Girl Who Played With Fire kept me interested the whole time, but I understand why some people could find it boring, because the methodic rhythm from this film can be translated as parsimony, because the movie tells the mystery from the screenplay without any unnecessary melodrama or forced clich√©s.Sure, there are some fight and some action scenes, but they are not used to satisfy commercial requirements, but to serve as integral parts from the screenplay.So, you do not have to expect a Hollywood style action film, but a tense thriller with the taste of European "old school".As for the leading actors, Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist back to bring excellent performances in this sequel; as for the supporting cast, I liked the performances from Lena Endre, Per Oscarsson and specially, Mikael Spreitz.On the negative side from this film, I have to mention some forced coincidences in the story, some scenes which do not seem to totally fit in the movie and an instance of the classic "talkative villain", who is always useful to tie the loose ends from the screenplay.Nevertheless, despite those fails, The Girl Who Played With Fire ended up being better than I expected, and I liked it pretty much, so I think it is worthy of a recommendation.
The Muppets have been an important part of my life. Their "golden age" is identified to the '70s (when the successful TV programme The Muppets Show was transmitted), and even though I hugely enjoyed that period of the characters, I think I enjoyed them even more during the '80s, when the TV ecosystem was still flexible enough to hold such unpredictable and experimental series as Storyteller, Dog City and The Jim Henson Hour. However, two tragedies came during the '90s...Jim Henson (1936-1990)'s death and the subsequent acquisition of the Muppets by the emporium Disney. Since then, we had only seen them in some mediocre movies (such as Muppets from Space and Muppet Treasure Island) and TV specials (such as It's a Very Muppet Christmas Movie) in which Henson's "voice" was completely absent (literal and figuratively). In summary, it seemed that the spirit from the Muppets had been diluted by the corporative influence from their new owners.Fortunately, co-screenwriters Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller, along with director James Bobin, could reunite enough influence in order to create a new film, simply titled The Muppets, with the objective of resurrecting the characters, introducing them to a new generation and bringing their original sense of humor back. And it is a pleasure for me to say that The Muppets could perfectly achieve everything it proposed to itself, and it left me wanting to see them more frequently, as long as this same level of energy, humor and "muppetosity" can be kept.The screenplay from The Muppets is hugely entertaining and very funny. Besides, the classic concept of "let's save the theater" works perfectly in order to motivate the characters, create drama and keep us in suspense till the end. On some way, I missed some original voices (unfortunately, Frank Oz refused to participate in this movie, and some of the classic performers, such as Richard Hunt, are currently retired), but the puppeteers who replaced them show a lot of "spark" and enthusiasm. What is more, there are various musical numbers in this film, and they are amazingly an integral part of the narrative.In conclusion, The Muppets made me laugh, made me cry, and resurrected my taste in Henson's legacy, which is in good hands for the first time in many years. Personal anecdote: before the movie started, I saw the trailers of family films which are soon to be released. They were animated by computer, they looked identical, and they sold the same rancid humor, the same pre-fabricated characters and the same frantic action in order to distract the children. On the opposite, The Muppets does not have too much action, it has minimum special effects, and its characters possess much more life and personality than any digital creation. Its sense of humor is intelligent and does not insult the spectator, the emotional moments feel honest, and it is definitely the best comedy I have seen in various years. In summary, a magical and completely unforgettable film experience.
The slasher flick is an old formula in the horror genre but there are very few movies which give new life to that sub-genus.Well,Hatchet is one of them.This is an excellent slasher film for many reasons.For one sight,I admired how the screenplay takes the typical clich√©s of this kind of movies and it gives new life to them.In other words,the screenplay takes the clich√©s for becoming them on something original and fresh.The characters are also very likable and I felt tense for their destinies,something very difficult to achieve on a horror film.Plus,the performances are superior than the standard of the horror genre.The special effects are perfectly done and they result truly grotesque.The violence is pretty bloody and brutal and there is not any place for the insipid violence we are accustomed to see on Hollywood commercial crap (like the remakes of Shutter and The Eye).Besides,director Adam Green achieved a very good atmosphere on this movie.Hatchet is an excellent horror movie.It is not a masterpiece from the genre,but it is not very far away from it.If you are a fan of the horror genre,I totally recommend this enormously entertaining and intense film.I liked it very much.
Foremost...Bad Robot? The producing company from the "geek" icon J.J. Abrams made a romantic comedy? Well, to be fair, the first Abrams' famous work was the TV series Felicity, so he is not a rookie in that genre. In second place, Morning Glory is not exactly a romantic comedy, but a comedy set in the world of the news, with which it pretends to bring us a look into the doubtful ethic and bad practices from an industry which basically puts ratings and image above any journalistic integrity. And even though screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna and director Roger Mitchell obviously wanted us to compare it with classics such as Network or Broadcast News, the truth is that Morning Glory has so little dramatic weight and is so light that it does not go beyond from being a moderately entertaining but mediocre movie.This is my theory: McKenna watched various episodes from the series 30 Rock (or for the case, The Mary Tyler Moore Show), she liked the dynamic between the characters and she thought: "This could work as a film with some famous actors and good production values". The problem is that McKenna is very far from having the talent from Tina Fey and her team of screenwriters, so Morning Glory feels like an insipid copy with a sense of humor which feels too obvious in various occasions, some tiring routines which seem extracted from any soap-opera and a poor ending which solves everything arbitrarily and tries to move out feelings with the typical "big gestures".However, I mentioned on the first paragraph that I found this movie to be moderately entertaining, and I think that the main reason of that is because of the cast. Rachel McAdams is a competent actress with the virtue of naturally fitting into the roles of a "normal woman" (something which does not apply to more glamorous stars), as we can see in this movie, at the same time that she rescues many scenes with her spontaneity. Patrick Wilson is adequate as the main character's love interest. Harrison Ford shows more energy in his character than what he has been using to recently, and he made his character to be likable. And I also liked the enthusiastic performances from Diane Keaton, John Pankow and Jeff Goldblum.In conclusion, Morning Glory is a mediocre film, but the performances, a few funny moments and some interesting observations about the news world make it passable and worthy of a slight recommendation.
According to the legend, in 1978, director Steven Spielberg's lawyers had the intention of suing a then young and unknown director called Joe Dante for having stolen too many elements from the successful Jaws in his modest film Piranha. But when Spielberg saw the movie, he recognized the fact that Dante had talent, and instead of suing him, he gave him work, forming a relationship which would eventually bring us films like Gremlins, Gremlins 2: The New Batch and Innerspace. I do not know if that anecdote is true (I doubt it), but it is one of the reasons why Piranha has survived in popular conscience (at least in the ones from geeks like me) during more than 30 years as a respected cult classic, more attractive for being a product from its time than for being a remarkable horror film.Do not misunderstand me...I consider Piranha to be hugely entertaining and with a good sense of humor, but I cannot deny that it shamelessly copies to Jaws, not to mention the many other films about killing animals which preceded it. For better or for worse, its recent remake called Piranha 3D did not try to change the formula, and it limited itself to decorate it with modern digital effects, abundant naked bodies and a "meta-humor" level. And I have to say that the result is very entertaining.Director Alexandre Aja impressed many people (including me) with the brutal "psychological slasher" High Tension, something which was enough for Hollywood to call him to make the competent remake The Hills Have Eyes (2006), which had a moderate success, so he could make his next movie, the tedious Mirrors, which is also a remake (in this case, of a Korean film). More recently, following his apparent vocation, he made this remake of Piranha, in which he did not employ his habitual aggressive style, but something more accessible and funny, something which worked very well in here.It is obvious that the relentless stupidity from Piranha 3D is an integral part from its humor, because I found the logic from the film (for example: What did the piranhas eat during the centuries they were waiting for their freedom?) and the "heroic" scenes (for example: Will it be efficient to kill piranhas with a shotgun?) to be hilarious. The first hour from the movie is efficient, because of the way it shows the characters and their sub-plots. But when we lead to the attack from the piranhas (during the last 20 minutes more or less), the things get much better, and the film becomes into a perverse comedy full of very black humor, and the constant parade of unlikely situations, blood and frantic action make it exciting and hugely entertaining. In summary, I think that Piranha 3D is a simple and honest B-movie in the best tradition from the 70's exploitation, totally conscious from its defects, and absolutely compensating them with the recipe of blood, violence and gratuitous nude scenes.And I think that that formula is the main reason why Piranha 3D deserves a recommendation with the warning that it is necessary to understand the intention from this film. Personally, I had a very entertaining experience with this movie, mainly thanks to the violence, the humor and the 3D effect.
A popular formula in the juvenile comedies from the 80's was the one of the classic "loser" who tries to fall in love with the perfect and unattainable girl by using diverse tricks.She's Out of My League transmutes that premise, something which could have offered some originality and new opportunities of humor.However, the inversion of roles is a simple trick to distract us from the many archaic clich√©s from the screenplay, seasoned with the addition of unfunny scatological jokes.And even though I liked the work from the actors, that was not enough for rescuing She's Out of My League from being a horrible movie.The biggest fail from She's Out of My League is that I did not find it to be funny at all; for many profanity and vulgarity the characters say or do, there is not real ingenuity in their commentaries.Worse yet, there are too many scenes of arbitrary "humor" which arises every time that co-screenwriters Sean Anders and John Morris feel that the story is losing impulse or energy.Among them I can mention the frequent discussions that come from nowhere and do not lead to anything concrete, except to saying things such as "go sh*t your hands" or "snatch parade".I am not bothered by the vulgarity itself; I just disliked the fact that it is used as a replacement of humor by two screenwriters without any spark or personality.As I mentioned on the first paragraph, the only thing I liked in this movie is the competent work from the actors, from Jay Baruchel and Alice Eve in the leading roles, to Debra Jo Rupp, Lindsay Sloane, Jessica St. Clair and Krysten Ritter in supporting roles.Pity that these actors are caught in such a bad movie.So, despite the performances, I cannot recommend She's Out Of My League, because I found it to be a tedious and irritating juvenile comedy which replaces humor by vulgarity and genuine emotions by dramatic devices from a rancid manufacture.
Oliver Stone is one of my favorite directors, and I think his best creative period was during the '90s, when he made such memorable films as Natural Born Killers, JFK and The Doors. In those movies, Stone saturated our senses while hypnotizing us with intense narratives of an imposing strength. His most recent film, Savages, isn't nearly among his best ones, but I found it entertaining and worthy of a moderate recommendation.Savages is a "sweaty noir" with modest narrative aspirations and few interest in transmitting some social message, or in satirizing the portrayed situations. Sure, I would have preferred something as deep as Born on the Fourth of July, or as over the top as Any Given Sunday...but anyway, Savages managed to keep me entertained, mainly because of Stone's exuberant and febrile style. I also have to say that Savages shouldn't be taken as a realistic tale, because even though it deals with the brutal effects of "narc-wars", it doesn't pretend to be a hippie version of Traffic, but a stylized psychedelic fable with too many coincidences and dramatic affectations in order to be taken seriously. The "heroes" aren't good; they are just less evil than the villains; and their destiny is only guided by the whims from the screenplay, as we can see during that double ending which looks like a bad joke.However, I think the weakest element from Savages is Blake Lively's poor performance. She's completely incapable of displaying honest emotions, so she isn't credible at all, and she doesn't inspire any interest in her character. Fortunately, the rest of the actors makes a good work. Benicio del Toro is genuinely frightening as the hit-man Lado, because of all the evilness he's able to transmit just with his look. John Travolta is perfect as a corrupt D.E.A. agent who is incapable of controlling a situation he himself created. And I surprisingly liked Taylor Kitsch's performance; I had previously never swallowed this actor, but his work in Savages is solid, and he also has a good chemistry with Aaron Johnson.Going back to negative elements from Savages, the screenplay presents some problems of logic and structure (this film is based on a novel, so the reason of those problems could be because of an excessively condensed and superficial adaptation). Nevertheless, I think Savages is a competent film, and I can moderately recommend it mainly because of Stone's direction and the performances (with the exception of Lively's).
The venerable novel A Christmas Carol has been taken to cinema on many occasions (a quick search here on IMDb displayed more than 20 results, without considering the ones which use a different title), and even though I have not seen all the adaptations, I did read the book.The most recent film based on that novel shows fidelity to the original text...at least when it adheres to the formal narrative and does not loose the control because of its advanced (but failed) technology.Even though the film kept me moderately entertained, it did not leave me very satisfied.Before watching Disney's A Christmas Carol I had to decide between watching it at a cinema where it was exhibited dubbed to Spanish, but with the visual 3-D effect; or other one with the normal projection on 2-D, but with the original voices of the actors.I decided for the second option, and in spite of Robert Zemeckis' hollow direction, I found some solid dramatic moments thanks to the excellent voice work from Jim Carrey, Colin Firth, Gary Oldman, Fay Masterson, Fionula Flanagan and the great Bob Hoskins.Pity that the visual cast from the movie looked like living corpses, without any soul or conscience.Disney's A Christmas Carol is Zemeckis' third 3-D whim (his last "real" movie -Cast Away- was almost 10 years ago!), and I do not know if it is tenacity, ego or obstinacy what does not let him learn the clear lesson: it does not matter how much he spends on technology and visual magic, he is still very far away from duplicating the emotion a human performance generates.There are some nice images on this movie; but digital actors do not replace their real counterparts.An hybrid method (like in 300 or Sin City) may have achieved a better result, because he would have been able to have vast digital scenarios, but with the advantage of showing real actors who hold the story with deep and credible emotions.Or, he should have imitated Pixar and reject the photo-realism on favor of cartoonish, but much more expressive, characters.The result in Disney's A Christmas Carol is better than The Polar Express and Beowulf, but it still feels as a cold and distant experience.However, I think this movie deserves a slight recommendation because of the solid voice work from the cast, its fidelity to the novel and not being boring.But, the final experience is mediocre and forgettable.I hope the Ghost of Unnecessary 3-D visits Zemeckis in order to let him see the obvious reality he is avoiding.
I didn't like the film The Purge mainly because of two reasons: first, I'm already tired of the "domestic invasion" sub- genus; and second, it was impossible for me to swallow the ridiculously absurd premise of one night a year when the laws are suspended, and the government authorizes the people to do anything they want, kill or steal anyone they want, without any legal consequences. All that happens because, apparently, the "purge night" reduces the crime and the unemployment during the rest of the year, strengthens the economy, and leaves the clothes with a pleasant smell of lemon, or something like that. Anyway, I found it an excessively improbable idea, and besides of that, it was a starting point for another trite story about a group of delinquents who invades the home of a normal man, who feels obliged to defend his family, blah, blah, blah. But well, that was in The Purge, which had enough economic success in order to justify the making of a sequel, called The Purge: Anarchy. Did they find a fresh and more credible angle for this second film? No. This time, the action is developed all over the city, with numerous characters whose contradictory motivations impulse the story in different directions; and of course, with an almost infinite number of colorful villains who end up being as disposable as the heroes. However, that doesn't make the film more credible. Despite their attempts to survive, the characters constantly make bad decisions, create unnecessary conflicts to force the drama, and choose the worst moments to make revelations or radically change their attitude. And the least I say about the "social commentary" about the intolerance from the rich ones to the poor ones, the better. That might have been a valid message if the film had kept itself consistent with its ideals, or if the characters had been enough interesting for us to care about their future. But that would represent too much effort, so the film simply limits itself to show violent scenes over and over again without any creativity. And to worsen the situation, The Purge: Anarchy isn't even very gory. There are violence, shootouts and explosions, but very few blood. Maybe, if the film had exaggerated the gore as much as the drama, we would have had a hollow, but moderately entertaining film. But we didn't have that luck. Instead of that, we have an incredibly boring parade of scenes without any suspense, uninteresting characters, and insipid action which doesn't generate any excitement. In conclusion, The Purge: Anarchy is an atrocious horror film, and I definitely recommend you not to waste your time or your money in this piece of junk.
In my humble opinion, there are only a few directors who achieve transforming narrative formulas and technical processes from modern cinema into genuine cinematographic art, reflecting a personal vision which does not simply fit into the commercial requirements from the medium, and which also transcends the simple popular entertainment in order to become into something different, which is on some way more valuable thanks to their intention of affecting our spirit with ideas or feelings expressed through pure narrative.In short, those few directors have the ability of creating dreams they share with the spectator...something which will not be necessarily satisfactory or pleasant for everyone, but which is undoubtedly different to what we are accustomed to experience as passive spectators in the cinema.In the list of those brilliant directors, I could include David Lynch, Guy Maddin and Terry Gilliam.With The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, his most recent film, Gilliam brings us another excellent movie, which, as most of his films, may not be for everyone, but which I personally found to be absolutely fascinating.The story from The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is almost incomprehensible, and I understand that the bizarre screenplay and the strange characters will be difficult to assimilate by the casual spectator.However, I was truly hypnotized the whole time I was watching this film, mainly because of its dream-like tone, which reminded me of the strange dreams-hallucinations I had under the effects of the fever due to some debilitating sickness.Besides, the film is saturated of Gilliam's characteristic rampant imagination, from the prosaic juxtaposition of middle-aged and modern elements to the hallucinating drives through imaginary worlds inspired in the psychology from their owners.That unstoppable imagination is also expressed with many special effects, which are well done.Before speaking about the actors, it is obligatory for me to mention the Heath Ledger (1979-2008)'s tragedy, and the effect his unexpected death had during the production of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.Many people will prefer to remember The Dark Knight as Ledger's last performance, but his performance in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is credible, and much subtler than the one of the Joker, because he has to keep his emotions under the surface in here.Needless to say he does it very well, and he shows a lot of conviction as Tony.Due to Ledger's death during the filming, Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell worked as his "substitutes", and I have to say their presence was very naturally integrated to the unpredictable screenplay.As for the rest of the cast, the great Christopher Plummer is perfect on his character; that also applies to Tom Waits and Lily Cole.And, finally, Verne Troyer surprised me with his performance, because he shows unexpected emotional levels I would have never imagined due to his slapstick work in the Austin Powers movies or in the TV series Jack of All Trades.In summary, I found The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus to be a fascinating hallucination.Needless to say, I enthusiastically recommend it if you like Gilliam's work; and those people who have not had the pleasure of watching movies like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Twelve Monkeys or The Adventures of Baron Munchausen will find a great introduction to the mind of one of the few honest and audacious contemporary directors who never loose the fidelity to their personal vision.
A Walk Among the Tombstones is a modern noir which makes a tribute to the classic novels written by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, whose tough and tenacious anti-heroes unraveled complicated mysteries while questioning the existence of the good in a cruel and amoral world. A Walk Among the Tombstones (based on a novel with the same title written by Lawrence Block) visits the formulas from this genre, and restores it the drama without making it feel like a parody (even though there are a few winks to the classic literature which inspired it). Liam Neeson brings a solid and charismatic performance in the leading role, and Dan Stevens has a brief role, but he brings intensity and conviction to it. I would also like to mention Brian "Astro" Bradley and his performance as TJ, a homeless boy who "adpots" the main character as an inspiration and father figure. Bradley's competent performance makes that character the soul of the film. On the negative side, the screenplay includes a few elements which feel either a bit forced or out of place. Nevertheless, A Walk Among the Tombstones is a very competent thriller which deserves a recommendation, specially to those who like traditional noir, or those who always had the curiosity to know it, but never had the patience to watch black-and-white films such as The Maltese Falcon or (my favorite one) The Big Sleep.
Let the Right One In received an impressive acclamation in festivals from around the world, and although that can presage a deception, I have to say that Let the Right One In completely fulfilled with the high expectations I had before watching it.We are in presence of those movies which transcend a genre, because although it can be considered as a vampires movie, its narrative complexity and emotional strength surpass that niche of the horror genre and make of it an excellent dramatic movie, whose supernatural elements are subject to the realistic and emotive relationship which works as a basis from the story.John Ajvide Lindqvist's screenplay (which is based on his own book) is brutally honest, and it never falls on hollow sentimentality or fake romantic fantasies.His management of the vampire mythology is simultaneously serious and subtle, avoiding the movie to become into a "goth" spectacle or a clich√© collection.But although the screenplay is brilliant, it would not have taken such a good life if it was not for Tomas Alfredson's magnificent direction, which leaves many portions of the story to be developed into the spectator's imagination.Alfredson knows that it is not necessary to explain every detail or show every dialog or situation, because what is shown gives us the necessary clues to fill in the holes.Alfredson also created a perfect atmosphere, he used a slow but never boring style to tell the story and he could extract extraordinary performances from K√•re Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson.The special effects are perfect, on some moments almost ethereal, but brutal when they should...particularly at the ending, with a scene I will not forget in a very long time.The only fail I found on this movie is that a few things could have been a bit more deepened by the screenplay.But, in spite of that, Let the Right One In is an excellent movie which receives a very enthusiastic recommendation from my part.
In spite of its famous cast,Smart People did not receive too much support from the distribution company Miramax,and after a short ride across a few film festivals,it was finally released on DVD without too much publicity.That is usually a very bad signal,but I think that the problem with this movie was not precisely its quality,but the strange tone from the story and the unusual characters,which do not let it to be easily qualified.I do not think this is a bad movie,but I did not find it very satisfactory either.The plot summary from this movie looks like one of those films which balance humor with drama,at the same time they teach us some truths about human nature.In other words,something like Little Miss Sunshine or Juno,but with the emphasis put on the mature male spectators.But Smart People is too pretentious and solemn for getting that satisfactory combination between humor and drama.The best element from this movie is definitely Thomas Haden Church repeating the same characters he always interprets : a rough but good-natured man who has more knowledge about humanity than all the pretentious "intellectual" people who round on him.I have to admit that Church has a lot of talent for that kind of role,so I do not care if he always repeat it.Dennis Quaid is an excellent actor,but on this movie,he does not seem to be very interested in his character.Ellen Page brings a solid performance,and her character in here is very similar to the one she made in Juno.But,as Church,it does not bother me if she repeats this kind of role,because she is very talented for it.I think there have been better movies about men facing the mature age (American Beauty and Wonder Boys are my favourite ones from this sub-genus),but in spite of being pretentious,not very satisfactory and excessively slow,Smart People deserves a slight recommendation because it does not lack of a certain grade of interest.In summary,I did not like this movie too much,but I did not dislike it either.
After the time travel, I think my favorite sci-fi sub-genus is "the end of the world".My favorite stories about the subject are confined to literature (Blood Music, from Greg Bear; and Earth Abides, from George R. Stewart), but in cinema, I always enjoyed the concept of an almost empty planet Earth, whether it is done with minimalistic images (like in the Mad Max saga) or visualized with epic special effects (like The Day After Tomorrow).I do not know if I enjoy those stories due to the latent misanthropy which makes me yearn a free of human infection planet Earth, or if simply because it is a provocative concept, which many directors and screenwriters have taken advantage of in order to examine the humanity on its purest condition, reduced to the fight for survival and the preservation of the species.Anyway, the film Carriers belongs to that sub-genus, and even though it did not leave me totally satisfied, I think it is enough interesting in order to deserve a recommendation.Due to the coverage Carriers had in the magazine Fangoria, I expected to find a post-apocalyptic horror film at the style of Resident Evil: Extinction or (with a lot of luck) the general work of director George A. Romero.Now, after having watched it, I think it is much more precise to describe Carriers as an intense drama, because its screenplay ignores the fantasy in order to completely focus on the decay of modern humanity, and the replacement of the "civilization" for a values system in which the compassion and the altruism became into obsolete and almost dangerous artifacts, since they obstruct the objective of survival with emotions.So, before watching this movie, you do not have to expect to see battles against zombies, head-shots, cannibalism or supernatural elements.Carriers limits itself to reflect (with success) one of the most basic fears expressed in fantastic cinema: the man is the man's worst enemy.However, I have to say I lead to all those conclusions during the second half of the film.During the first half, I was upset by the stupidity from the characters, their irritating attitudes and the lack of logic from the screenplay.For example, who chooses an elegant Mercedes Benz as a vehicle to explore a post-apocalyptic world? Why do the main characters only have one gun to defend their lives and forecasts? The movie suggests that that the main characters kept themselves alive during a long time (maybe years) thanks to various rules they established as a code of conduct, so why do they behave as undisciplined children when they find a possible refuge? In the end, there are many similar scenes, in which the creation of the drama sacrifices the consistence from the screenplay.For the rest, the performances are adequate, and the atmosphere of isolation and aridity is well created.Despite its fails, Carriers is an interesting movie, and I recommend it if you wanna have a good time of post-apocalyptic suspense.Besides, it creates good expectations for the future work of co-directors √Ålex and David Pastor, who made their debut with this movie.
I have many times mentioned the apparent death of juvenile comedies in the hands of straight-to-DVD films, whose low production costs allow the cinematographic studios to win money with any piece of crap which includes unknown jesters, some female models without any objection of unnecessarily getting naked, and the obligatory "funny" scenes full of rude things which stopped being funny 30 years ago. So, it was very pleasant for me to see a very competent juvenile comedy such as Easy A, which borrows concepts and subjects from some classic movies of the genre with intelligence, personality and efficient humor.The synopsis of Easy A might sound like a combination between Mean Girls and the TV series iCarly, but in fact, the screenplay takes the story from the classic novel The Scarlet Letter (or, better said, from its multiple film adaptations) as a model in order to illustrate the hypocrisy from the society and the pressure experimented by women for respecting unrealistic behaviour standards. However, it is not very necessary to over-analyze the story from this amusing comedy because, independently from its valid message, what best works are the competent performances and Bert V. Royal's sharp screenplay, which takes the typical premise of "teenager trying to loose her virginity" and brings a creative twist to it. And that is one of the best things I can say about a movie which belongs to a genre that is usually full of clich√©s and pre-fabricated structures.And among the best elements of the movie, I have to mention Emma Stone, who is perfect in the leading role; I hope to see her in much more leading roles. The supporting cast also brings very good performances, from Stanley Tucci and the great Patricia Clarkson as the main character's ridiculously liberal parents to Dan Byrd as an homosexual young man with an unusual proposal for the main character and Amanda Bynes as an ultra-religious student. I also liked the performances from Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow. On the negative side of the cast, Aly Michalka feels a bit over the top in her role, while Penn Badgley feels bland and a bit out of place as the main character's love interest.And even though Easy A concludes satisfactorily, there is a dramatic "explosion" before the ending which involves too many characters and therefore, dilutes the force from the message and feels a bit out of place into such a focused narrative. However, that is not something terrible, and it did not avoid me from enjoying this film pretty much the whole time.
It will be more efficient to talk about Hachiko: A Dog's Story dividing it on two different aspects: on the one hand, the intention and the message of the story it tells; and on the other hand, its attributes as a cinematographic work.That is because, even more than with any other movie, I am afraid of losing any objectivity thanks to the combination of a canine theme and my obvious predilection for dogs.The story from Hachiko: A Dog's Story is based on a true event (which was previously adapted to the screen in a Japanese movie from 1987 I have not seen), something which makes it more touching.The main reason I liked this film pretty much is because I saw many attitudes and virtues in the dog from this movie I have admired in my experiences with animals during my life.And sure, even though Hachiko: A Dog's Story will be better received by those who love dogs, I think it is impossible for it not to take a few tears even on casual spectators who do not have a particular affection for the canine species.Or even in those who prefer cats (I am not judging them).And besides, the movie is very entertaining, even though there are some redundant scenes which do not add too much to what we already know.Another fail is that some details from the screenplay feel a bit forced.For the rest, I liked Richard Gere's performance, Lasse Hallstr√∂m's direction and, most of all, the screenplay, because it never betrays the characters and it does not explode the sadness from the story with cheap sentimentalism, since instead of that, it shows a sober and honest portrait of the level a relationship between a dog and its owner can get, something which will not surprise anyone who experimented genuine connection with a pet.In summary, I enjoyed Hachiko's: A Dog Story pretty much, and because of that, I recommend it with confidence.
Before watching Water for Elephants, I expected to find another predictable and disposable adaptation of a book written by Nicholas Sparks, or something like that. However, the quality of the production, some good performances and the colorful circus environment made the experience to be tolerable in my case. Nevertheless, I found the film to be mediocre and occasionally a bit boring, and its main problem is that the central romance never feels sincere nor passionate. However, the film kept me moderately entertained in general, and it ended up being better than I expected. Oh, and it is effectively based on a book, but not one from Sparks, but from Sara Gruen, which I have not read, so this review is exclusively based on the way in which screenwriter Richard LaGravanese and director Francis Lawrence interpreted the story.Among the solid performances which help Water for Elephants to be tolerable, I have to mention Christoph Waltz's. His work in here is absolutely credible and energetic. I also liked the performance from the great Hal Holbrook very much; maybe due to his advanced age he does not accept as many roles as he used to, but he has not lost even a pinch of his talent and amazing presence. I just wish he had more screen-time. And Ken Foree is very well in a brief but intense role in which he confirms his talent outside the horror genre.However, the main reason many people will go to see Water for Elephants is due to the presence from Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson in the leading roles. However, I could rarely feel the supposed love which links their characters with each other and inspires them to fight against adversity. I generally like Witherspoon's work, but for some reason, I felt her a bit cold and distant in this movie. As for Pattinson, I did not dislike his work in other movies (with the exception of Eclipse), but he does not seem to be very interested in his character in Water for Elephants.Nevertheless, Water for Elephants did not bore me (with a few exceptions), and despite being mediocre, I found it better than I expected, like I previously said. I could not totally swallow the central romance and the ending is a bit absurd, but I think it deserves a slight recommendation, at least because it avoided to fall into the lachrymose and bland routine from films like Remember Me or Dear John.
The British film The Descent (in my humble opinion, one of the best ones from the horror genre in the previous decade) provoked some controversy during its release in the United States, because the distributors from that country apparently felt that the North American audience was not going to accept the depressing and fatalist conclusion written by Neil Marshall (who was also the director), and they decided to omit some scenes in order to give the movie a not completely happy, but more optimistic and predictable, ending.Needless to say that the fans from the film (including me) were against that, and the original ending was eventually restored on DVD (at least on the "director's cut").Because of that, I think it is something weird that the sequel of that film is continuation of the "false" ending almost nobody liked.But besides of that, I think The Descent: Part 2 is a mediocre horror film, but it at least is moderately entertaining.One of the things I most liked from the original The Descent is that, even without the monsters, it would still be a solid thriller endorsed by the well defined personalities from its main characters and the tense relationships developed between them.The Descent: Part 2 tried to incorporate a similar narrative endorsement, but it ends up putting more emphasis on the "bug hunt" than on the integrity from the story, so the whole experience feels hollow and lacking from the deepness from the first film.Nevertheless, the gory moments and the competent performances were enough for me not to get bored with this movie.So, I think that, despite being mediocre and forgettable, The Descent: Part 2 deserves a slight recommendation.I think that what most bothered me from this film is that it is based on a premise which is contradictory and disrespectful of the first film.
The best element in the last two films from the Shrek franchise was the supporting characters; and even though I would have preferred to see a spin-off of the Donkey, the chosen one to start its own franchise ended up being the Puss in Boots, whose first film seems to have been cooked on the same mold as Shrek...a lot of adventure, some romance and abundant "meta-humor" focused on the clich√©s of the fairy tales. And even though Puss in Boots is not nearly as ingenious and original as the first two films from the Shrek franchise, I at least consider it an entertaining family comedy with appropriate voice acting, excellent animation and a main character with enough charisma.The screenplay from Puss in Boots is well written, because of its adequate character development and appropriate balance of drama, humor and adventure. On the other hand, I found the action scenes a bit dull. They are not badly done, but they feel as forced interruptions of a narrative which would have may worked better with a subtler style...almost like a spy story. But with two cats and a new humanoid.In spite of that, I had a good time while watching Puss in Boots, despite the final experience not being very memorable, because of the competent screenplay, adequate voice acting from Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek and Zach Galifianakis, and an excellent animation which shows consistency with the caricatured style employed in the Shrek franchise. In conclusion, I think Puss in Boots deserves a moderate recommendation.
In the past,we have seen some movies about tense relationships between neighbours and now,the film Lakeview Terrace,adds some racism to that formula,giving an additional dimension to what could have been a simple thriller.This is an entertaining movie but there some some serious fails on it.Let's see the positive points first.I am not a fan of director Neil LaBute (specially,after he made the stupid and totally unnecessary remake of The Wicker Man),but I always appreciate the attention he puts to character development,and,on this movie,the main character Abel Turner has a strong and very well done development,showing very precisely his intentions and motivations.But,Samuel L. Jackson's brilliant performance also helps to the character because he is completely credible.It's truly incredible the range Jackson has as an actor because as the racist cop from this movie,the villain from Jumper or the intense artist from Black Snake Moan (just to mention three examples),Jackson completely becomes on them,giving them identity and own life.Also,on bad movies like The Man or the previously mentioned Jumper,he results one of the few positive elements.But,as I mentioned,this film has some important fails.The performances from Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington are completely generic and anonymous.These two actors can never become on their character and Jackson devours them with his great presence.But the main fail from this movie is that it fails on its social commentary.The racist subjects are used by some movies to challenge the spectators and making them to discuss about that subjects.I think films like Crash,To Kill a Mockingbird or the brilliant Rabbit Proof Fence achieved that difficult point.But,on this movie,it seems an excuse to complicate a simple story and to disguise that the villain,in spite of his racism and paranoia has the reason of many things.The result was that it was impossible for me to be on side of any character because I felt antipathy to the "heroes" because they are just bad neighbours.I mean,shedding cigarette butts on your neighbour's house? Completely unacceptable.Having sexual intercourse at the sight of other people? Totally inappropriate.Also,there are some forced scenes on this movie (like for example,the conversation next to a swimming pool).In spite of all that negative elements,Lakeview Terrace kept me entertained and it never bored me.It's not a bad option if you just wanna have a good time.
The Water Horse is not a bad movie but what most bothered me from it is the lack of originality.This movie is a rip-off of E.T. because the story is practically the same.Instead of having an extraterrestrial,we have the monster from Loch Ness.Besides this movie is too long and there was a moment in which it bored me a little bit.Still,this is not a bad movie.With a few exceptions,the movie kept me moderately entertained and the special effects are totally amazing.Alex Etel shows a lot of charisma on his role and this young actor proves his excellent performance in Millions was not a chance.I hope to see Etel in more movies.The rest of the cast is competent,but nobody stands out too much.In spite of all that good elements,I found The Water Horse as a mediocre rip-off of E.T. which is too long and which does not change too much the structure from that movie.I think I can give The Water Horse a slight recommendation for the good elements I mentioned but I would not recommend it with too much enthusiasm.
I honestly did not know what to expect from Lost Boys : The Tribe.Some sequels made straight-to-DVD result pretty good,like Wrong Turn 2 : Dead End or Species : Awakening.Other ones result pretty bad,like Hollow Man 2 or The Butterfly Effect 2.Fortunately,Lost Boys : The Tribe belongs to the first group.Although this sequel does not equal the excellent first part,I had a very good time watching it.The best element from this movie is the dynamic rhythm,which makes it very entertaining and not boring at all.The special effects do not appear too much but they are well done.Also,almost all the actors made a good work.Besides,the ending is satisfactory.The fails I found on this movie are two.For one sight,the screenplay is a rip-off of the original film.And,for the other sight,the actors who interpret the villain roles are not credible.In spite of that,I liked Lost Boys : The Tribe pretty much.This is a very entertaining rip-off and I enjoyed watching it.
I started to have interest on filmmaker Eric Red's career in the 80's,thanks to his work as a screenwriter in Near Dark (which may be my favourite vampire movie,by the way) and in The Hitcher.Then,in the 90's,he made solid works as a director in the films Body Parts and Bad Moon.Unfortunately,some legal trouble in which he was involved kept him far away from cinema for various years,but I am glad to see that he is back with 100 Feet,a very entertaining horror film which may not be great,but which is pretty intense and is endorsed by a solid performance from Famke Janssen.This movie works very well as a tense supernatural thriller which builds up the tension in a solid way for finally leading into an extravagant but satisfactory ending.As I previously said,Janssen is very competent on her role.Her performance is credible and realistic on every scene.The rest of the cast is also good.The always entertaining Bobby Cannavale totally fits on his character of a New York policeman.Ed Westwick and Michael Par√© are adequate on their roles.Something which also deserves to be mentioned is an extraordinarily grotesque scene of violence.That will be a delicious moment for any fan of gore (like me).There are some fails on this movie.On the one hand,while almost all the jump moments are well constructed,there are a few which are a little bit cheap (like the one which shows the cat jumping).And a few elements feel forced.In spite of that,I had a very good time with this movie.I recommend 100 Feet with confidence and I hope Red will not last another 12 years for bringing us his next movie.
Even though the general quality of animation cinema in Hollywood is quite poor, I had some interest in watching Despicable Me, because its voice cast included some solid comedians (Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Will Arnett, Russell Brand and Kristen Wiig), so I thought they would bring their personality and humorous instincts to what seemed to be another bland family story.And they made a good work, but to my surprise, the film also ended up being entertaining and nice.I guess I am not the only member of my generation who is tired of the modern childish entertainment, designed by marketers, psychologists, lawyers and pedagogues in order not to "trauma" or impress the children too much, or inevitably damaging their frail minds (at the same time they are prepared for the delights of the consumerism).So, I always appreciate the slight efforts of films which dare themselves to introduce a little bit of "edge" in the shape of black humor, funny misanthropy or a simple subtext which will not be understood by little children.And even though Despicable Me does not posses a high level of subversion or audacity, it at least adds a healthy dose of those elements to its predictable story, and those brief moments of twisted laughs are what I most enjoyed from it, along with the voice acting.On the other hand, the screenplay feels a bit weak and inflated with the accustomed filler of slapstick humor.There are scenes which work well, but other ones lack of imagination, and their only purpose is introducing noise and action in order to liven the slowest moments from the story.For the rest, co-directors Pierre Renaud and Chris Coffin drive the film at a good rhythm, and I also appreciated some deep details from the screenplay, like the relationship between the main character and his mother, Dr. Nefarius' seriousness and the satire of a bank which finances arch-villains to their own benefit.I think that I liked Despicable Me for those interesting details, and not so much for its cloying main story, with adorable (translation: a bit irritating) who soften the heart of someone who is not really bad...only misunderstood.However, I think this movie deserves a recommendation because, even though the final experience is not very memorable, I cannot deny it kept me entertained the whole time.
The police corruption has been a recurrent subject in cinema from its beginnings.Classic films such as Scarface (1932) or The Asphalt Jungle reported the reality of the cops who are seduced by the easy way of crime, betraying the trust from the people and the law they swore to protect.However, in that times, the corrupt cops were the villains; but the perspective changed in the 70's thanks to movies like Shaft and Electra Glide in Blue, which showed that the ethic and the rectitude could become into obstacles in order to combat every time more violent and crafty criminals.We can suppose that those anti-heroes arose as a consequence of the dissatisfaction people felt with the authorities, and with the sad reality that the pure and incorruptible heroes of yesteryear were not credible anymore.Needless to say that real life has gotten worse in our century, and the cinema has adapted to that with films (and TV series) where the line between heroes and villains is every time more diffuse.All the previous paragraph takes me to Brooklyn's Finest, a cop flick in which director Antoine Fuqua runs a similar field to the one he visited in Training Day 9 years ago.The result is competent and interesting, but not highly memorable.Brooklyn's Finest has a provocative premise, and thanks to screenwriter Michael C. Martin, we have many interesting scenes of moral disjunctive, fights with the conscience and impossible decisions.But the problem is that that structure feels a bit diffuse, and I could not find the point in common which impulses the three stories this movie tells (besides of the ethical conflicts the three main characters face).In other words, I was interested in the characters and their dilemmas, but the secondary scenes which may add texture and "realism" to the story tired me a little bit, because they divide our attention without a justifiable cause and they unnecessarily stretch the movie.In spite of that, I liked the film, mainly because of Fuqua's solid direction, which is always disciplined and absolutely free of any tricks which are not necessary in order to create suspense.As for the cast, Ethan Hawke feels a bit over the top in his character, while on the other hand, Don Cheadle is perfect as a cop whose divided loyalty is not because of simple ambition, but because of the lessons life has brought him in both sides of the law.Richard Gere could interpret even asleep the character of a veteran who is tired of fighting an endless war, but I think he keeps doing it well.As for the supporting cast, I liked the performances from Will Patton as the classical "suit" who only wants results; Ellen Barkin as a cop/politician who is more interested in her career than in the fulfillment of justice; and Wesley Snipes, who makes his return to mainstream cinema after various years of starring in atrocious action movies made straight to DVD.As a comparison point, I liked Brooklyn's Finest more than Pride and Glory, but less than Narc and Dark Blue, because they had had more concise and compact screenplays.However, despite the fails from the screenplay and the fact it is not highly memorable, I can recommend Brooklyn's Finest as an interesting cop flick with good performances and interesting ideas.
Even though I'm not accustomed to watch trailers on the Internet, I saw some promotional scenes from Brave some months ago, and I was left quite impressed, not only because of the quality of the animation, but also because it promised a new facet from the studio Pixar, more mature and sophisticated, but without losing the family values it has always cultivated. However, the movie ended up being less ambitious, because even though the screenplay ventures into archetypes and settings which hadn't been visited by Pixar before, I found the narrative mechanic a bit weak because of its low levels of energy and conviction.Brave is the closest that Pixar has ever been to the "fairy tales" genre, a province which seemed exclusive of Disney. They might have taken such a time in order to venture into this kind of story due to fear of offending their eternal distributors; or it might have been because the traditional schemes of princesses, magic and romance didn't fit into the studio's sensibility. Whatever the way it is, Brave is much more entertaining than any "fairy tale" made by Disney in the last decades. Co-screenwriters Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman, Steve Purcell and Irene Mecchi (Andrews and Chapman were also two of the co-directors) craftily avoided any hyper-modernized value, as well as the romance which almost always decreases the dramatic potential from the female main characters, who aren't defined by their own merits, but by how desirable the gallant who wants them is. In that aspect, Brave is as independent as the main character, and I appreciated the fact that the story doesn't round on Disney clich√©s, but on a realistic and sincere relationship between mother and daughter. Let's say that Brave shows us the female sight of Finding Nemo, in which an adventure provoked the rethinking of the attitudes between a father and his son, and helped them to comprehend better with each other when they both expanded their points of view. But I think that Brave is more valuable as a "life lesson" to families who go through the tense period of the "adolescence vs. menopause" conflict, something which reflects the fact that Brave reaches a good level of maturity, because it's appropriate for the kids, but also with a message which transcends the laughs and the adventure.In the visual aspect, Brave is Pixar's biggest triumph, and the work of the artists who made this level of reality and beauty possible is worthy of admiration. I'm not only referring to the landscapes, special effects and characters' animation, but also to those tiny details which reveal more about the animators' artistic sensibility, than about the technique they employed. As for the voice acting, some actors exaggerate the guttural Scottish accent too much in order to emphasize the comedy (Billy Connolly in particular), but most of the cast perfectly transmits the emotions of the story, and brings genuine life and personality to the characters.Now, after two paragraphs of praise, I have to go back to the reasons why Brave didn't leave me completely satisfied, and why I consider it one of Pixar's least achieved films. I liked the establishment of the story and its resolution, but the intermediate part of the screenplay has a low level of energy, and it limits itself to follow a bland and prefabricated path until leading to a good ending. I didn't find those manifestations of ingenuity we are accustomed to see in Pixar cinema. The witch in the woods, the issue of "destiny" and the fatuous fires, the antics from the red-haired triplets...all these elements work well into the mechanic of the story, but they never achieve the level of amazement and richness this re-interpretation of the fairy tales should have provoked. Do you remember the lump in the throat when the old man's house elevates in Up, or the palpable anguish in the smelting in Toy Story 3? Brave could never capture me to that level in its characters' adventures. And even though I liked it, I was left a bit disappointed for not having found something more "special". I don't know...maybe, I went to see this film with excessively high expectations. In conclusion, I can recommend Brave as a competent animation film; but I think that more attention should have been put on the screenplay, in order not to make the intermediate part look like filler.
The election period in the United States has traditionally been a fountain of humorous material exploited to the maximum by the comedians, most of them on TV, but also in cinema, as we can see this year in the film The Campaign, directed by Jay Roach, whose filmography includes some excellent comedies (the Austin Powers trilogy)...and other deeply irritating ones (Meet the Fockers, Dinner for Schmucks). I would also like to point out that The Campaign isn't Roach's first incursion into the political field, because he also made the TV movies Recount and Game Change, which both made a brilliant work in portraying the pressures and vices from a presidential campaign from a serious and (more or less) impartial point of view. Could The Campaign achieve the same but in a humorous context? I don't think so, but I can't deny I found the film entertaining nevertheless.I think there's an excellent political satire hidden in some place of The Campaign. The general premise of an inept lout who is transformed into a charismatic candidate manipulated by the economical elite is very interesting; and even though it's not completely original, I think it's appropriate to occasionally remember it in order to recognize it whenever we find it in the real world (something which undoubtedly happens with a sad frequency). However, the few intelligence from the screenplay is diluted by the coarse and vulgar humor employed as vehicle of the message. I have to admit I laughed in various occasions (specially during the "Our Father" scene), and I definitely found some ingenuity in the creation of absurd but credible situations (at least in the filthy context of contemporary politics)...however, for every scene that works, there's five or six which only provoke whining, specially due to the tendency the actors show to "play the fool". I think this is a very subjective point in any comedy; but in my personal taste, the humor always works better when the actors take their roles seriously and let the comedy to naturally flow from their attitudes and reactions. When they try to force the laughs with a physical or verbal affectation, they lose spontaneity and, specially, destruct the reality of the characters in order to transform them into caricatures.And besides of that, I found the screenplay of The Campaign too innocent and predictable, taking a safe route until leading to a happy ending. So, I guess that not all the political satires can be as subtle and effective as Wag the Dog or In the Loop; however, I can give a moderate recommendation to The Campaign as an entertaining comedy, despite not being very memorable.
Believing that not enough horror films built with "actual footage" have been made, The Vicious Brothers decided to join the movement directing the movie Grave Encounters, whose repetitive scenes and hugely boring development are the main elements which make it crappy, and one of the worst pseudo-documentaries I have seen.The screenplay lacks of any interesting elements, and it foists us with endless scenes of screams, frantic camera and confusing images of long corridors where nothing happens. And are we supposed to get "scared" by that? Worsening the situation, the performances are horrible, and the supernatural elements are increasingly arbitrary and absurd. The Vicious Brothers tried to provoke suspense with the "home video" trick, and needless to say that they couldn't achieve it, while the characters are so irritating that I was glad when they started to get killed.In conclusion, Grave Encounters is a pathetic "horror" film with bad performances, confusing direction and a very poorly written screenplay. In summary, don't waste your time nor your money with this piece of junk.
During the last decades, a tacit competition to see who makes the most over-the-top, ridiculous and impossible action film seems to have been declared.In the 80's, someone decided to destroy the barrier of credibility and good taste, and that audacious decision opened many filmmakers the door to letting their imagination fly, creating some excellent movies from that genre (like The Terminator), but also some horrible ones (like Rambo III).The curious thing is that both categories are completely exchangeable to the spectators' likes, and while some ones consider the exaggeration as the maximum nutrient to the aficionado of the action cinema, some people consider the realism as something more important, because when the exploits from the hero or the villain exceed the most extreme possibilities from real world, they take the risk of falling into the caricature and the parody, subtracting seriousness, impact and emotion to the story.However, we also have films like Crank: High Voltage, which do not seem to care about the difference between both styles very much.I enjoyed the film Crank a lot, and now its sequel is also very entertaining, although I would consider it to be inferior.The best elements from this sequel is that it has an excellent rhythm and a good sense of humor.Besides, co-directors and co-screenwriters Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor found a very good balance between ridiculous exaggeration and consistence.In other words, there is not even a micro-second of the movie which could be considered as credible...but Neveldine and Taylor show enough discipline not to violate the intern logic from the movie, and not to take us out of it with absurd human feats (this last thing had happened, for example, on the film Shoot 'Em Up).And when we add all that to a very black humor and an amazing visual style, we have a film which does not stop at anything to keep us excited and entertained the whole time.The fails I found on this movie are on forced moments: the most clear example is the public sex scene between the main character and his girlfriend, but I can also include the appearances from the character with Tourette syndrome and the slightly offensive ethnic babbling from the character interpreted by Bai Ling.Crank: High Voltage is the closest I have seen to the intensity and involvement of a video-game, because it becomes the experience of cinema into something dynamic and energetic thanks to its spontaneous madness and unpredictable situations.I recommend this film as an exciting and very entertaining experience.
Despite its bad reputation, the horror cinema has always worked as a reflection of the collective conscience, expressing the particular fears from the historical period in turn (from the "atomic horror" of the '50s to the consumerist zombies of the 2000s). That might explain the gradual twist the genre is taking in recent years, leaving the juvenile and highly sexualized characters behind in order to focus on families in danger. The tendency might simply be a new trend in Hollywood; but on one way or the other, it also reveals the insecurity we are feeling into an increasingly uncertain social, political and economic environment, where the old shrine of the home doesn't feel as inviolable as before. The most recent horror film which explores these subjects is Sinister, and even though it's not a very memorable experience, its efficient combination of styles and good dominion over the suspense are the main reasons which make it worthy of a moderate recommendation.What I liked the most in Sinister is the semi-realistic treatment brought by co-screenwriters Scott Derrickson (who was also the director) and C. Robert Cargill, focusing the first half on the main character's domestic drama, whose erratic behavior naturally evolves while the fear is being elevated, first because of his family's economical future, and then because of his life itself. His wife tries to support him and stoically stands her husband's emotional ups and downs, as well as his tendency to drink too much. Derrickson and Cargill took their time in order to establish the situation; and when the paranormal phenomenons finally appear, they don't feel like forced intrusions from the beyond, but as a logical extension of the family crisis, and of the pressure his character feels in front of his dilemma. On the negative side, we have some absurd and improbable elements in the screenplay, such as the inexplicable appearance of the Super 8 films (Did nobody revise the attic of the house in which a quadruple murder happened?), the arbitrary way in which the characters take the supernatural manifestations (that long scene in which Ellison walks through the house with a baseball bat almost made me laugh), and the obligatory "explanation" offered by the classic professor who is an expert in occultism (revealing the murderer's identity is only useful in order to disguise the absence of concrete explanations).Going back to the positive elements from Sinister, we have the solid performances. Ethan Hawke feels intense and honest in the leading role, while Juliet Rylance also feels credible and has a good chemistry with him, perfectly creating the illusion that they are a couple who have been sharing good and bad moments for years. The kids Clare Foley and Michael Hall D'Addario aren't given too much to do, but they still managed to bring decent performances. On the other hand, I didn't like the excessive use of shocks accompanied by thunderous noises...I don't think such a cheap resource was needed in order to make us jump in our seats. Nevertheless, Sinister is a competent horror film which managed to keep me entertained.
If we recycle scenes from films like Old School,Anchorman,Kicking and Screaming,The 40 Year Old Virgin,Talladega Nights,Knocked Up,Walk Hard,Blades of Glory and more films from that style and we join them with the tiring premise of childish adults trapped on a stupid premise,we would have Step Brothers as a result.This is a very irritating comedy which enormously bored me,which almost did not make me laugh at all and that it copies scenes from many movies.I still remember the days in which Will Ferrell used to be a brilliant comedian in Saturday Night Live but,from many years ago,he has been wasting his talent on irritant comedies like this one (with the exception of Blades of Glory which,in spite of being mediocre,was moderately entertaining).When a comedy does not make me laugh more than two or three times,then,it is on a serious problem.Step Brothers is one of that comedies.I found this film irritating,unfunny and,the worst sin of all,very boring.I do not recommend this film at all.
At first sight, Unknown might look like an extra-official sequel of Taken, the popular action film in which Liam Neeson interpreted an ex- secret agent in a desperate search of his daughter. However, it is not like that; Unknown has some action scenes but its atmosphere and elliptical screenplay make it more similar to Hitchockian thrillers such as Breakdown, Arlington Road or Memento. I am making that comparison regarding style and subject...but not quality.The "man without a memory" is a familiar concept in suspense cinema and literature; Unknown combines that formula with the other old classic of "mistaken identity" in order to create an interesting and well raised mystery, with a competent but occasionally a bit absurd execution. On the technical aspect, director Jaume Collet-Serra orchestrates the fights, car chases and moments of tense calm well. However, even though I did not dislike the screenplay, I have to say that I felt it a bit generic, with pre-fabricated scenes we have seen in better thrillers. Sure, its ending is more or less ingenious, but besides of that, there is not too much originality in this film.Neeson brings a competent performance as the intelligent but confused main character; Diane Kruger is adequate as his sidekick; the great Bruno Ganz shows a good level of passion and intensity as detective J√ºrgen; and January Jones is the only weak spot from the cast, because she brings an excessively forced performance.In conclusion, Unknown is an entertaining, well directed and (with the previously mentioned exception) well acted thriller which kept me interested despite some moments which feel a bit dull; but its general lack of originality and abundance of clich√©s extract identity to it, something which does not make it highly memorable. In conclusion, Unknown is a movie which will not make you feel like wasting your time, but which is not indispensable for you to invest it on it either.
I do not like prejudging a movie before watching it, but I am a human being, and there are various occasions in which yielding to the temptation is unavoidable. In the case of The Tourist, there were various things to prejudge: to start with, it is the North American remake of a French film I have not seen called Anthony Zimmer...and we already know that the Hollywood adaptations of European material do not tend to be very good. In the second place, it represents the debut in the United States from German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, whose extraordinary movie The Lives of Others was enough to open him the doors of Hollywood...and we already know that those migrations rarely produce good results. And last but not least, the leading characters from this movie are interpreted by two attractive and hugely popular actors, something which usually means that not too much attention was put into the screenplay, because the mere presence of Hollywood stars would supposedly be enough to keep us entertained and interested. I wish that The Tourist had challenged those low expectations, but it unfortunately ended up being at that level, stealing us 103 minutes from our lives with a tedious story, null chemistry between Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie and an atmosphere which pretends to be sophisticated when it in fact is repetitive and excessively simple. In summary, The Tourist feels like an insult to the spectator.I suppose that The Tourist aspired to be a modern version of director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980)'s cinema, because besides of having an international intrigue, mistaken identities and a femme fatale, it also has the central subject of an innocent man trapped into a conspiracy he barely understands, from which he is only going to escape by using his ingenuity and a courage he did not expect to posses. And even though I have never been a big fan of Hitchcock's, I think that The Tourist falls very short with that ambition, because to start with, I did not feel suspense or interest in the two main characters, at the same time that I found the romance between them to be absolutely artificial. The screenplay is simultaneously ridiculous and very predictable, with arbitrary events which do not try to push the narrative, but whose only intention is showing us Jolie using a new dress, another weak sequence of action or more "humor" at the expense of the Italian police.In conclusion, The Tourist is a horrible waste of time, and I suggest you not to make the same mistake as me, and to avoid it any cost.
It is probable that few people have read the book Dorian Gray, but I am sure that most of the people know the premise: a man sells his soul in exchange to look forever young and healthy while his portrait grows older; at the end, he will have to pay a very high price for that privilege. The easy moral lesson from the story tends to darken two fundamental elements: author Oscar Wilde (1854-1900)'s brilliant prose, full of sharp and cynical (but true) observations; and the deep emotional arc from the main character, whose reflections on human nature bring substance (and to some point, justification) to his transformation from a fresh and naive young man to a monster whose corruption goes beyond than any redemption. The most recent film version of Dorian Gray could preserve those valuable elements, and it ended up being an excellent adaptation of the book, adorned with modern techniques and a classic sensibility.This is the third movie based on a Wilde's work directed by Oliver Parker (the previous ones were An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest), but Dorian Gray is very different from the other ones, because it has nothing of their light humor in order to present a Gothic horror story set in the complex Victorian environment. And Parker made a very solid work in recreating both things, because we can find a competent recreation of that period, complemented by a perfect atmosphere and good moments of violence and tension. However, the best elements from this film are the brilliant performances from Ben Barnes, Ben Chaplin and Colin Firth. The film could preserve various great phrases from Wilde's work, and it was a pleasure to hear them from those actors' mouths. Besides, they are absolutely credible on their roles.In conclusion, I very enthusiastically recommend Dorian Gray (2009) mainly due to its high level of energy, dramatic ambition and the magnificent performances from Barnes, Chaplin and Firth. The only thing I can say against this movie is that a few changes made by screenwriter Toby Finlay feel a bit unnecessary. However, that small fail did not avoid me from enjoying this excellent movie very much.
I had some hopes before watching the movie 9, because besides of being based on a very interesting short film, it seemed to me that the movie was looking for a more sophisticated and mature tone than many of the simpleton and disposable animation movies made for the children.Now, after having watched the movie, I think 9 achieved that, but only on the visual aspect, because the story is excessively frivolous and emotionally hollow.However, the name of Tim Burton over the title (who undoubtedly was a commercial "given-name" for the film) will disappoint the people who are looking for something solid, since this film clearly is not.9 is a movie based on visual concepts, production design and scenic choreography.The concern from director Shane Acker for generating attractive images makes him to loose the narrative flow from the movie.As a result, the dramatic scenes are bland and inconsequential, and I could never feel the characters' motivations.There are many things which feel irrelevant in here; for example, the good ones are good because the screenplay says so, and the villains are bad because they are ugly.The characters from 9 are so poorly developed that I did not have any interest in their adventures.And, of course, there are various action sequences with elaborated chases and "cool" moments in slow motion.However, none of those scenes generate any passion or suspense.So, 9 is an attractive film in the visual sense; however, the story is boring and bland, so I cannot recommend it.It is a shame to see so much effort in the visual aspect wasted on such a mediocre film.
It's never a good signal when at the beginning of a movie we see the logo of the Worldwide Federation of Wrestling.I do not wanna judge the aficionados of that activity,but that organization has produced films of minimum quality (like the pathetic The Marine),where their only intention was to promote a wrestler.I understand the connection between wrestling and cinema (specially,on the action genre).After all,on an activity which depends of the popularity,we can be sure that the big figures will be people with great charisma,like Dwayne Johnson,who is,at the moment,the person who made the most successful transformation from a wrestler to an actor.Now,it is the time of wrestler Steve Austin in the movie The Condemned and although he does not have the same talent as Johnson,he has good presence and an appropriate sense of humor.I did not expect too much from this movie but I liked it and it resulted to be better than I expected.In spite of the extremely simple screenplay and its lack of originality,I had a good time watching The Condemned; after all,this movie does not intend to be excellent, but a fast food plate which is enjoyed during a time,for completely forgetting about it 10 minutes later.And the movie fulfills that humble intention.As I said,Austin fit very well on his character and the rest of the cast also makes a good job,specially the always entertaining Vinnie Jones.Since the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game,we have seen many rip-offs of the concept "human hunt" : some movies,like The Running Man,are hollow action films without too much substance; other ones,like Battle Royale,put unusual deepness and meaning to the violence.The Condemned belongs to the first style,but it fulfills that well,so it could keep me entertained.I recommend this film.It is very far away from being great but it is clearly entertaining,well directed and it shows unusually brutal violence without excusing for that,while more expensive films show totally insipid violence so that teenagers can see them (craps like Max Payne and Babylon A.D. come to my mind).The Condemned is a forgettable but entertaining experience.
The most commented thing about Boyhood was the ambitious strategy to shoot it through 12 years in order to reflect the characters' real growth, particularly the one from the protagonist Mason Evans. On the beginning of the film, he's 6 years old, and through Boyhood, we see him mature until he's 18 years old, sharing representative moments in the development of his family, but they are not necessarily big and apparatus events... just the small details and turns of the destiny which forge his character and outline his future. The result is fascinating, distilling the old "slice of life" concept into something so real, intense and emotional that it's difficult to describe the experience. I don't know what kind of pact with the devil director Richard Linklater made in order to find actor Ellar Coltrane, on whom he bet the film's success. He had to be a good actor since his childhood, keeping like that during his adolescence until becoming an adult. However, Coltrane brings a wonderful performance, and he has a perfect chemistry with the rest of the cast. Like the title suggests, Boyhood is subject to the kid/teenager/young adult Mason's point of view, but it has an extensive cast who made a perfect work during the 12 years of shooting. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette occupy their roles with absolute naturalness, and they credibly transmit the evolution of adults who were parents when they were too young, and had to learn some tough lessons during their lives. Lorelei Linklater plays Mason's sister, and the film would have probably been equally interesting if it had been "Girlhood", because her performance is as honest and credible as Coltrane's. I would also like to mention some supporting actors who leave their mark with brief but excellent performances: Marco Perella, Jenni Tooley and Zoe Graham. So, Boyhood is a simultaneously intimate and epic film, not because of the scale of its production, but because of the ambition of its narrative. And it doesn't only tell us the story of a family, but it also reveals Linklater's growth as a director. Boyhood resonates with the echoes of other excellent films from his filmography: the warm romanticism from Before Sunrise; the juvenile frustration from SubUrbia; the philosophical stances from Waking Life; and the enthusiasm of School of Rock for modern music as a valid artistic discipline (well, I might be stretching the analogy a bit with this last one). After saying such many compliments, I have to point out the fact that I would have occasionally preferred a more concrete dramatic arc. In some ways, Boyhood is like the sitcom Seinfeld: "about nothing". And even though "nothing" ends up being "a lot", I would have occasionally preferred kind of a more conventional structure in order to give more shape to the narrative. Nevertheless, Boyhood is a fascinating and unique experience which deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation.
Whatever the reason it is (uncertainty about the future, apocryphal Mayan prophecies or simple commercialism), the films about the end of the world are currently fashionable, and even though various filmmakers take advantage of the opportunity in order to invest millions of dollars in special effects, there are also other ones who can't have an access to that, and as a consequence, they have to be more creative to tell thematically similar stories, but focused on the most intimate aspects of the catastrophe, exploring the different reactions before the collapse of society or the imminent extinction of humanity. The film The Divide belongs to that more modest category, and the result is interesting, but not totally satisfactory.The subject explored in The Divide isn't new, but it's developed with quite a cruelty, appropriately claustrophobic locations and a screenplay which explores the darkest and most disturbing corners of human depravity under unexpected circumstances. But, besides of showing us the drama and fights between the survivors, the main point from The Divide (as well as the one from other post-apocalyptic films) is balancing the virtues and vices of humanity, in order to evaluate if the "end of the world" represents the deserved extinction of a warlike and suspicious species, or an unavoidable rebirth which offers the hope of correcting the mistakes from the past.In The Divide, I liked the conjunction of characters and narrative, even though I think it could have been shorter. I found the first half hour from the film fascinating, because it established the situation on a clear and convincing way, perfectly displaying everything that is at risk, and bringing us some clues which suggest a more complex and interesting mystery. However, the rest of the film is accommodated on a "downward spiral" of sadism, violence and anguish which ended up tiring me a little bit occasionally. There are some unexpected moments and characters who defy our expectations with their behavior, but in general, the story is developed exactly as we expected once the "good ones" and the "bad ones" are defined. And the mystery about the (global?) catastrophe is abandoned in order to put the focus into the atrocities perpetrated for the sake of the common welfare and the group survival. I would have preferred a more abbreviated edition and maybe a more equilibrated balance between the internal and external factors which affect the characters.The performances from The Divide are generally good, but they fall into the exaggeration during the most extreme moments from the screenplay. The problem might be that the actors didn't have points of an emotional reference in order to interpret such grotesque scenes, and that's why they ended up taking their performances to caricature levels during those moments. Nevertheless, despite my complaints, The Divide kept me interested in general, and I think that that's enough to make it worthy of a moderate recommendation.
Back in 1996, Tom Hanks made his debut as a director with the mediocre That Thing You Do!. Now, 15 years later, he decided to make his second movie as a filmmaker with Larry Crowne, which despite not being something brilliant, kept me very entertained, and I appreciated its intention of recovering a honest, kind and inoffensive style of comedy, which seems extinct nowadays.The publicity of Larry Crowne suggests the film is a typical romantic comedy; however, the truth is that the screenplay aspired to something more complicated, which does not exactly fit into the romantic formula, but which neither stays very far from its established subjects. Let's say that the couple meets, falls in love...and nothing else. There are not any lachrymose revelations nor unexpected twists; we simply have the gradual revelation of compatible spirits whose attraction with each other is not exactly physical or sexual, but the result of solitary lives who might improve a little bit with some intimate contact. Besides, I guess that the relaxed ending might disappoint to those who were expecting a big romantic gesture, or a declaration of eternal love. However, I liked that minimalistic tone, as well as the pleasant humor which rounds around this passive love story.But that is not all, because parallel to the incipient romance, we witness the main character's evolution...with which the screenplay also takes a very interesting road. Larry Crowne is not one of those movies about the "loser" who becomes a "winner" thanks to the magic of love, the popularity or the use of phrases such as "be yourself". The main character is the same person on the beginning and at the end of the movie; but the things he lives introduce subtle changes in his attitude, his comprehension of the world, and even his nature, leaving us the impression that his evolution is just starting. And now that I think so, I guess that that is the point from the movie: sowing the seeds of the change of the main character and making us to imagine his future flowering.As for the performances, I do not have any complaints either. Hanks makes a solid work in the leading role, and I also liked the work from the supporting cast, highlighting Cedric The Entertainer, Malcolm Barrett and George Takei. Finally...Julia Roberts, who co-stars the movie with Hanks. I am not a big fan of hers, because there were various films in which I did not like her performances (two examples: Erin Brockovich and Dying Young). However, there have been a few occasions in which she was able to bring competent works, like in Larry Crowne. Her "Hollywood star" status never interferes with her performance in here, which I found honest, detailed and totally credible.The complaint I have against Larry Crowne is that some scenes feel a bit repetitive. For the rest, I enjoyed this film pretty much despite not being something excellent, and I think it deserves a recommendation because of its many positive elements.
23 years after Bird, director Clint Eastwood went back to the biopic genre focusing his attention on a certainly fascinating person, who is rounded by a diffuse cloud of urban legends which should be dissipated: John Edgar Hoover (1895-1972), director of the F.B.I. from 1924 to 1972 (in fact, it could be said that he was its founder, because the "Investigation Bureau" was a minor branch of the Justice Department back in that time), who is more famous because of his legendary paranoia and rumored homosexuality than because of his genuine achievements. The film J. Edgar tried to show us Hoover's multiple facets, but in its effort of moving away from the morbidity and the scandal, it ends up being too bland and cold in order to capture us into its diffuse narrative.The screenplay from J. Edgar constantly jumps forward and backward through time, visiting important moments in Hoover's career, but refusing many times to bring us the necessary context in order to appreciate the main character's evolution (or corruption) through time. It seems that this film was exclusively made for scholars of Hoover; or maybe to people around Eastwood's age who lived the events portrayed in the film in the news. But as a casual spectator, I felt frequent frustration for not finding the narrative thread to give the story cohesion. The impression J. Edgar left on me was the one of one of those biographies from History Channel, in which the narrated passages were deleted and only the actors' recreation is left. The result is moderately interesting...but also incomplete and not very satisfactory.Leonardo DiCaprio brings a brilliant performance in the leading role, and he is well complemented by the solid works from Judi Dench, Naomi Watts and specially Armie Hammer. Those performances are the main reason why I consider J. Edgar worthy of a slight recommendation. However, when the movie ended, I was left with the impression that if I had only read Hoover's biography during some minutes on Wikipedia, the effect on me would have been absolutely the same.
After the highly acclaimed film Crash (2004),the sub-genus of "interconnected stories by unique situations" experienced a boom.The Air I Breathe belongs to this sub-genus and,although it is not completely satisfactory,I found it interesting.Let's see the fails from the movie first.On many occasions,the screenplay believes it is more intelligent than what it really is,so there are moments which do not feel too natural.Plus,there are various moments which could have easily been deleted,because they do not add too much to the story.I would have preferred to see a less pretentious and more concise narrative.However,I liked this movie.It kept me entertained and interested,and the whole cast brings honest and credible performances.The ones who mostly stand out are Forest Whitaker and Kevin Bacon,by my humble point of view.The Air I Breathe is a good movie and although it is not memorable at all,it kept me entertained while I was watching it.If I had to compare it to other movies from this sub-genus,I liked it more than the forced (and overrated) Babel,but less than 11 : 14,which I still think it's the best one from this niche,for the fact that the story is the most compact and ingenious one.I recommend The Air I Breathe with the warning that you do not have to expect something special.
Some "investigators" are taking the avalanche of movies and TV programmes about the presence of extraterrestrials (whether they are aggressive invaders, benign guides or enigmatic observers) on Earth very seriously.According to the "experts", all that is part of a conspiracy whose objective is making the people to gradually accept the idea of the extraterrestrial life, so that the world does not panic when the governments from the world will reveal the "truth".I found those theories to be fascinating, but needless to say I do not believe in them.Or, better said, I partially believe in them, because I am convinced of the existence of a message behind many movies about alien invasions.And the message is: "Hollywood is incapable of creating new ideas".I think that Skyline is the most recent sci-fi film about an alien invasion with that message.Seriously, the number of elements Skyline steals from other movies is authentically unbelievable.I think Skyline is one of the most unoriginal films I have seen this year.However, still with that, it would have been possible to enjoy it if the direction and the performances would have produced some emotion or suspense; unfortunately, co-directors Colin and Greg Strause drive the movie with an unusual reluctance, while the actors bring horrible performances.But I have to admit that the special effects are competent.By the way, there is a curious story behind those special effects.The Strause brothers are the founders of the digital studio hy*drau"lx (no, I am not crazy; that is the real name), which also made the special effects of the film Battle: Los Angeles, which will be released next year.I will explain it better: the Strause brothers had the shamelessness of co-directing a low budget film about aliens invading Los Angeles (Skyline) while they were making the special effects of a multimillionaire production about aliens invading Los Angeles.I do not know if that shows tremendous synergy or scandalous disloyalty.Anyway, the fact is that I found that anecdote much more interesting than Skyline.But let's leave aside those gossips from "the industry".I found Skyline to be ridiculous, mediocre, predictable, hollow and stupid.However, the special effects and the involuntary humor made the movie bad instead of atrocious.So, I cannot recommend it, unless you have never seen Independence Day, Starship Troopers, Signs, District 9, Cloverfield, War of the Worlds (any version), Mars Attacks, Day of the Triffids, Invasion, Lifeforce, Battlefield Earth, Plan 9 from Outer Space or any other movie about an alien invasion from which Skyline steals elements of.
During the first minutes of You Kill Me,I thought I was going to see something like a semi-sequel of the very competent Sexy Beast,because that movie also shows Ben Kingsley in the character of a violent gangster who has to spend some time out of his environment,interacting with "normal" people who result to be more strange than the criminals he deals with.However,the similarities end there,because although it offers solid performances and some good moments of black humor,You Kill Me is very far away to getting the quirky tone and wild humor from Sexy Beast.You Kill Me is an entertaining film but it does not stand out too much.I usually like black humor comedies because their cruelty and cynicism make the laughs more "tasty"...at least when the screenwriter knows how to balance those elements.You Kill Me tries that but,although it has some good moments,You Kill Me never gets particularly funny,and that's its biggest fail.I did not laugh once,although I occasionally smiled because of the surrealism of the situations and the bizarre attitudes from the characters.The performances are the best element from this movie,at least by my point of view.Kingsley brings a credible and detailed performance.T√©a Leoni is entertaining on her character.Luke Wilson is not as good as Kingsley and Leoni but he still brings a good performance.I also liked the short appearances from Dennis Farina and Philip Baker Hall as "old school" mafia bosses.John Dahl (who has directed episodes to my favorite TV programmes,which are Dexter,Californication and Battlestar Galactica)'s direction is sober but solid.The conclusion from this movie is adequate but,having said that,I have something to point out...another scene in airport in which someone wants to stop the lover before getting into the plane ? Did screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely really think that clich√© keeps being romantic ?.In spite of my complains,I had a good time watching You Kill Me although I found it completely forgettable.With some many serial killers comedies (as examples,I can mention the sympathetic The Whole Nine Yards or the hollow but very pleasant The Big Hit),this film needed much more humor,intelligence and energy to really stand out.In summary,You Kill Me is an entertaining and sympathetic movie,but there is nothing special on it to make it memorable.
The film Juno polarized the audience, because while some ones hated its convoluted dialogs and doubtful message, other ones admired its performances, distinctive sense of humor and the emotional ambivalence from the screenplay, which never lost the focus on the characters' humanity. I belong to the second group, and that's why I was very interested in watching Young Adult, another collaboration between director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody. However, even though I liked this film, it didn't leave me completely satisfied because of its lack of narrative impulse and its truncated ending.Cody has assured the fact that Young Adult isn't a semi-auto-biographical tale, but it feels so personal that I expected to see the typical "Where are they now?" signs during the credits; that's why I disliked the ending to be so rushed and convenient. On the positive side, Charlize Theron brings a brilliant performance in the leading role; her work is so sincere that she makes her character likable...well, I don't know if "likable" is the right word; it might be a combination of compassion and morbidity. Patton Oswalt also brings an excellent performance, and the best scenes of the film are the ones shared between Theron and him. I would have liked to see more scenes between their characters together.Unfortunately, the "romantic" angle from the screenplay (if the obsession the main character has with her ex-boyfriend can be considered "romantic") occupies too much time, and only leads to the forced ending I previously mentioned, which looks like a trick to solve the story in the simplest way, and which I don't even know how to interpret...Is it a happy, ironic or depressing ending? As for Reitman's direction, I found it elegant, precise and with a subtle visual style which enriches every scene without unnecessary ornaments.In conclusion, Young Adult disappointed me a little bit, but I consider it a good film in spite of that. And even though this is definitely not among the best things Reitman or Cody have done, I think it deserves a moderate recommendation mainly because of the extraordinary performances from Theron and Oswalt.
Let's Be Cops is a tedious and unfunny comedy with an extremely improbable screenplay with illogical and forced twists and a "message" which is as fake as the police uniforms worn by the main characters. But the worst thing of all is that it never made me laugh, despite the natural geniality from Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. I have always liked the chemistry these two actors have cultivated in the TV series New Girl. And even though they try their best in Let's Be Cops, the poor screenplay doesn't bring them enough support. Nina Dobrev is just employed as a pretty face in her role, while Natasha Leggero is betrayed by the ridiculousness with which her character was written. In conclusion, Let's Be Cops is a bad comedy, and I can't recommend it, despite the effort brought by Johnson and Wayans Jr. to their roles. Besides, this movie wasted a good opportunity to make a genuinely incisive and intelligent satire of modern policemen.
The contrast between drama and comedy can bring excellent results when it's handled in the proper way (let's remember Away We Go and Up in the Air), but it can also fatally fail if it crosses to the field of the exploitation or the bad taste. The film 50/50 generally makes a good job and it could achieve some narratively intense moments; but I also have to say that I found it a bit dishonest and not as funny as it believes it is. Or, for the case, not as dramatic, even though it certainly portrays a difficult situation which would have worked better if it had been raised on a different way.The trailer of 50/50 makes it look like a Judd Apatow-style vulgar comedy, but in fact, that aspect of the story is relatively brief, and it's limited to some scenes which show Seth Rogen's character saying profanity, trying to coax girls and generally showing his habitual routine of a vulgar but well intentioned lout. 50/50 is mainly carried by Joseph Gordon-Levitt's excellent performance, which shows a very honest sensibility. That is one of the main reasons why 50/50 isn't one of those gratuitous dramas which try to inspire pity for their characters; besides, the screenplay portrays the main character as a stoic, realistic and focused person, who must find the exact balance between the hope of survival and the assimilation of his possible death. That's not a pleasant nor easy to express subject, but screenwriter Will Reiser generally handled it well.However, Reiser made two traps in order to unnecessarily sweeten the situation: the presence of the dog Skeletor and of the character of a rookie therapist who helps the main character to psychologically cope with the difficult trance he's living. Anna Kendrick brought a competent performance in that role, but the character feels forced. What is more, I have personally lived painful periods in my life due to illnesses suffered by relatives and friends, so I don't agree with the lightness with which 50/50 portrays some subjects. Nevertheless, I think I can give a moderate recommendation to 50/50, because I found it interesting despite not being completely satisfactory.
On the beginning of The Eagle, the mystery of the Ninth Legion, composed by 5000 Roman soldiers who disappeared in the 2nd Century AD during a military incursion in the UK, is quickly told. So, I thought that the film was going to be a rehash of the same story we saw portrayed in the excellent film Centurion. However, it was not like that, because The Eagle pretends to be a pseudo-historical sequel which analyzes the mystery 20 years later, and focuses the epic narrative to a pair of individuals who run the same dangerous location looking for redemption.Director Kevin Macdonald's filmography includes some brilliant movies (One Day in September, Touching the Void and The Last King of Scotland), and even though The Eagle is not nearly as good as those films, I think it represents a good addition to his filmography. However, pity that he brought one of the leading roles from the film to Channing Tatum, an ex-model who became an "actor" because of his looks, and not because of his non-existent talent. Tatum is a bit more tolerable here than he was in other occasions, but his performance still feels insipid and listless. Nevertheless, the other leading role is fortunately interpreted by the talented Jamie Bell, who brings a solid performance in his role.Now, I have to make the most important warning about The Eagle: it is not an action film. Sure, there are some epic battles on the beginning and at the end, but I would estimate that the 95% of the film is composed by dramatic scenes. There are some moments from the film which get a bit dull, but I generally found it well written.So, in conclusion, I think I can give a moderate recommendation to The Eagle, because despite not being very memorable, some dull moments and Tatum's performance, it generally kept me interested.
From 1995 to 2005, I was an avid player of the video game Need for Speed, captivated by its excellent graphics, remarkable tracks design, and specially, the extraordinary "gameplay", perfectly balanced between exaggerated unreality and strict simulation, achieving a game easy to learn but difficult to dominate. However, the games from that franchise never distinguished themselves for their stories, so I preferred to go to see the film Need for Speed with the same low expectations I went to see other films based on video-games. And, on some way, that was the proper attitude; this film has various pros regarding its technical and stylistic aspects, but its screenplay is quite elementary, not to mention that it also has laughable dialogues and some comic-relief moments which provoke more irritation than laughs. The automotive action scenes are pretty well shot and edited, with a minimum of digital interference and with well planned stunts which don't stretch the credibility from the audience too much. Another important pro from Need for Speed is the solid performance from Aaron Paul, who shows credibility and considerable presence in the leading role. And even though his character belongs to the "silent tough guy" stereotype, Paul refused to take the easy way, and instead of that, he brought quite an intensity to his performance, creating a dramatic tension which wasn't even dreamt by screenwriter George Gatins. So, in conclusion, Need for Speed kept me entertained because of Paul and the well shot action scenes, despite the various cons from the screenplay.
Need for Speed is a great movie with a very enjoyable storyline and a very talented cast.The story is certainly nothing new or original,and the trailers don't make it seem like its going to be any different to the Fast and Furious movies but it is very enjoyable and dosen't feel like a carbon copy of previous car related films.What made this movie for me was its extremely confident cast,I am a huge fan of Aaron Paul,because of Breaking Bad of course,and I didn't think he would be able to deliver the same level of great acting as he does in Breaking Bad,but,while Tobey Marshall is certainly not Jesse Pinkman,he still delivers an outstanding performance,he clearly has a great movie career ahead of him and this is his first film since Breaking Bad finished,and there's no doubt he has more great performances ahead of him.I also really enjoyed Imogen Potts and Dominic Copper's performance,these are two actors I've heard of,but haven't seen in anything previously,but after seeing them in this I look forward to seeing them in more films.After he is let out of prison,Tobey Marshall sets out to seek revenge against the man who framed him for the death of his friend.
The well-known trick of using documentary techniques in horror cinema (as we have seen in Paranormal Activity, The Fourth Kind or The Blair Witch Project) can accentuate the suspense of a movie, or plunge the spectators into the drama from the characters, or even bring a varnish of realism to the story which, in the best of all the cases, will make the audience to accept the fiction work as something real.But what that technique will not rescue is a screenplay which stumbles too many times against its uncertainty and ambiguity, as we can see in The Last Exorcism.The Last Exorcism starts well, because it presents us an interesting character whose moral ambiguity is manifested on his contradictory attitudes with religion; on the one hand, he does not have any inconvenience in exploiting the faith from the people for his own benefit; but on the other hand, he seems to have the honest intention of helping them on spiritual issues.But those interesting narrative aspirations collapse when the film starts to put its focus on the horror itself, and we find that it does not have the value nor the intelligence to say something new nor transcendent.When the exorcism starts, the film falls into the oldest clich√©s, exacerbated by the poor work of "hand-held" camera, a technique which seems easy but which in fact requires big challenges of edition and cinematographic language.Unfortunately, director Daniel Stamm only used it as an easy short cut to obtain suspense, and so we have scenes of panting and confusing movements which felt irritating on a few occasions.Despite all that, The Last Exorcism kept me moderately entertained, and I could appreciate some of the ideas from the screenplay, the competent performances (specially the ones from Ashley Bell and Louis Herthum) and the good atmosphere.I think that those things make this movie passable and worthy of a slight recommendation, despite not being very satisfactory.
I'm already tired of these poorly raised futuristic dystopias, which don't show any interest in genuine science fiction, and only work as the basis of trite teenage fantasies where the main characters always discover they are "the chosen one", or that they are "special" in some way. The Maze Runner is another one of those films, even though its good manufacture and competent performances make it worthy of a slight recommendation. Based on a series of novels written by James Mashner, The Maze Runner is kinda like Lord of the Flies with monsters, and with the obligatory sinister conspiracy as the background of its elementary narrative. There aren't many surprises or creativity; just the same formula as always, but executed with enough gravity and melodrama to keep the audience slightly interested (as "audience", I'm talking about embittered old men like me; but I don't pretend to guess the effect or acceptation this movie can have with the teenage audience it was obviously made for). As I previously said, the actors make a good work, bringing credibility to their clich√©d characters of hero, villain, mentor, ally, etc. (Is there someone who didn't guess during the first 10 minutes who was eventually going to die in order to prove that "things are for serious"?). Despite its abundant logical holes, The Maze Runner develops a more or less interesting mystery, but when we finally reach to the explanations, they are absurd and excessively forced. In conclusion, I wasn't left very satisfied by The Maze Runner because of its lack of ingenuity, clich√©s and weak conclusion, but it managed to keep me moderately entertained because of its performances and Wes Ball's adequate direction. Besides, I have to say I found The Maze Runner superior to Divergent, Beautiful Creatures and The Hunger Games; I know that that isn't something very enthusiastic to say, but we can't demand too much from this kind of films.
Starship Troopers is a film I liked very much,not only for the spectacular special effects and the enormous entertainment it had provoked on me,but also for the fierce and simultaneously subtle social satire about the North American culture and patriotism.The sequel made straight-to-DVD of that excellent film was entertaining,but it was far from reaching the level of its predecessor.Now,Starship Troopers 3: Marauder is better than the second part,although it is still miles away from the first film.I appreciated that,on this movie,the satire came back but I felt it a little bit excessive and obvious.I think that a more subtle satire would have worked better.Also,some elements of the screenplay do not feel too natural.In spite of that fails,I liked Starship Troopers 3.It kept me entertained all the time and it did not bore me at all.Ed Neumeier made a good work as a director because the action scenes are pretty well filmed.As for the special effects,they are adequate.Starship Troopers 3 is a good film which entertained me.But,on the other hand,it is not even near to the original film and the satire does not work completely well.Still,I recommend this movie because I had a good time watching it.
I have never been a fan of author Dr. Seuss (1904-1991)', so I don't care about the changes his book The Lorax suffered with its adaptation to the big screen. However, the problem is that the film Dr. Seuss' The Lorax is another noisy, empty and unbearable animated hyper-commercialized confection which employs its ecological moral in order to disguise the same clich√©s, situations and characters which infest the contemporary animation cinema. In short, this film is the most recent example of the painful mentality "What does it matter? It's for kids".Dr. Seuss' The Lorax is an anti-corporative film made by huge corporations which try to celebrate the nature with cloyingly artificial and over-designed images. This film offers a boring screenplay; the obligatory action scenes which don't contribute anything to the story; the typical references to popular culture; and atrocious musical numbers which desperately try to be "cool" despite their total lack of energy or ingenuity.The animation itself from Dr. Seuss' The Lorax is moderately well done, but that doesn't save it from being a pathetic film which bored me to tears. In conclusion, don't waste your time and your money with this piece of junk.
I found The Expendables better in concept than in execution, because its screenplay lacked of cohesion and it seemed to have been built with action scenes filmed at random, according to the availability from the famous cast. However, The Expendables 2 is much better than the first film, and despite having a few holes and inconsistencies in its screenplay, I found it very entertaining...not to mention that there's more opportunity to make the previously mentioned stars shine, and also adding some new friends to the party...The best element from The Expendables 2 is Simon West's direction. Thanks to him, and at the difference of the first movie, the scenes "stick" well with each other, the action sequences are well filmed, and there's a constant feeling of excitement. As for the actors, they all have a very good chemistry with each other. Dolph Lundgren fits well as the "comic relief"; Nan Yu is a very appropriate female addition to the team; and Liam Hemsworth makes a competent work as a rookie mercenary who is still unsure of the work he chose. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger have more significant roles than in the first film, but they still feel like supporting figures more valuable for their cultural importance (and one-liners) than for their utility in the screenplay. And finally, Jean-Claude Van Damme brings enthusiasm as the typical '80s villain: arrogant, affected...and bad actor (this last aspect might have been accidental, but it suits his character well).The action from The Expendables 2 is appropriately violent, over the top and bloody. It was a pleasure to find blood jets, decapitations and other displays of special effects which have unfortunately been quite absent in the action cinema from recent years, which has almost always been condemned to the bland "PG-13" due to commercial reasons (I don't think films such as Battleship and Lockout would have been much better with the addition of head-shots and arterial explosions, but they at least would have looked less insipid). In conclusion, The Expendables 2 ended up being much better than the first film, and I definitely recommend it as a very amusing action movie.
The premise from Sex Tape seems taken from a bad sitcom, and unfortunately, the level of humor is at that level during the whole film, with the addition of abundant bad language in order to justify the R rating... because its other aspects would barely reach a PG-13. Director Jake Kasdan once made excellent films (Orange County, The TV Set), but his style doesn't fit into the vulgar adult comedies, as we can see in Bad Teacher and now Sex Tape. In fact, the work he has done for TV (in series such as New Girl, Californication and Ben and Kate) is much more compatible with his indie sensibility. Sex Tape is basically a parade of tedious scenes lacking of any humor, generic discussions about marital problems, and such lazy and predictable narrative decisions that they prove the classic mistake of trusting too much in the actors in order to solve the problems of the screenplay. Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz make their best effort, but they are not endorsed by the material, and the same can be said about the supporting cast, where we find solid actors such as Rob Corddry, Ellie Kemper, Nat Faxon, Jack Black and Rob Lowe totally wasted. I won't spend more time talking about this horrible "comedy". Instead of wasting your time and your money in this piece of junk, I would recommend you to invest those 94 minutes into some episodes of New Girl, Californication or, why not?, giving another chance to Ben and Kate, so that we, the fans of that underrated sitcom, don't feel so alone.
The Book of Eli is set on a post-apocalyptic future, various decades after a nuclear war devastated the planet, extinguished the civilization and led to the emergence of societies where the things which predominate are the law of the strongest one and an economy based on exchange, pillage and slavery.In summary, we are in front of a thematic and visual recreation of the video game Fallout 3, something which is not strange, because Gary Whitta, the screenwriter from this film, was the editor of the magazine PC Gamer in mid-90's, when I religiously read it.Talking about religion, The Book of Eli includes allusions to faith and spirituality, adding some interesting metaphoric possibilities; and even though I was not bothered by its manipulation of Christian concepts, I was disappointed by their lack of logic and consistency, something which becomes the movie into a "deus ex machina" from the beginning to the end.Very few actors possess the necessary gravity and dramatic weight to interpret a character such as the one of Eli, and I think Denzel Washington made an excellent work at combining humility, purpose and a subtle air of threaten which says a lot about his personality and relentless will.Thanks to Washington, even a few tedious scenes become a bit more tolerable, because even though there are some good sequences of action and suspense, there are some occasions in which the screenplay lazily crawls, because it regurgitates ideas and situations we have already seen too many times.How many times do we have to be "surprised" when the lonely hero defeats multiple attackers who thought he was an easy prey? Does it keep being necessary to have the villain based on James Bond's generic enemies? Gary Oldman seems (at least on paper) as a good antagonist for Washington; however, he is absolutely wasted in The Book of Eli, since the screenplay only gives him bland dialogs and the classic threats we have seen from all kind of miscreants since the beginning of cinema.And as for Jennifer Beals and Mila Kunis, the screenplay does not let neither of them to do very much.What is more, I did not like the ending very much, because I found it to be a trap, since it explains some things at the same time it sacrifices the common sense and it contradicts some of the subjects it exposes.However, I think The Book of Eli deserves a slight recommendation, mainly because it kept me moderately entertained, with a few exceptions.
Recently,there have been horror films (for example,Vacancy or The Hills Have Eyes) which show a lot of sadistic and graphic violence which results pretty intense.But,that films do not result too satisfactory because there is not enough endorsement on the plot.In other words,although the violence results graphic and very well done,it never produces emotional impact on the spectator.And Frontiere(s) also belongs to that.The gore this movie shows is simply delicious and I have to say the film kept me entertained for its intensity.But,the gore never produces emotional impact because there is not enough character development or deepness in the story.Also,the villains do not have a clear purpose for what they do...they just like to kill people.Also,some actors do not result credible on their roles.But,not everything is bad on this movie.The element I most appreciated from this movie is that it has some social commentary in it.This movie has an unusual politic level for what we are accustomed to see on horror films and,on that aspect,the movie tried to go a little more far away.This movie never bored me and I always appreciate when a horror movie is not afraid of showing extremely bloody violence because that helps for increasing the level of intensity.In summary,with more deepness on character development and if the villains had a porpoise,Frontiere(s) would have been an excellent horror film.But,it is not like it,and the movie is an entertaining but hollow horror film.
I honestly did not know what to expect from this remake,back-to-start or recreation (or whatever it is) from Friday the 13th.The saga counts of 10 movies (11 if we consider Freddy Vs. Jason) and although that movies could not be considered particularly good,I have found some of them to be enormously entertaining.In the films I liked from this franchise,their stupidity avoid that films to be taken seriously,so it is better to consider them as hollow movie candy's without any message which have the only porpoise of showing original and bloody deaths.However,director Marcus Nispel (undoubtedly by order of his mentor and producer Michael Bay) decided to take the known premise seriously and adding psychological elements to Jason.The result is a well intentioned but mediocre repetition of the formula,which kept me moderately entertained,but which is much less satisfactory than almost all of the previous films.As I said,on the films from Jason I liked,the best element was that they did not take seriously to themselves while Nispel (who had done a pathetic job with the tedious remake of the excellent film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) thinks the character is so serious and scary that his presence will be enough to keep us scared to death.Surprise! I does not result frightening at all looking at Jason walking threateningly with a machete on his hand.I still think Kane Hooder is the best Jason who has ever existed but,on this movie,Derek Mears made a good work.He has an always mysterious presence.Jared Padalecki also made a good work.He shows dramatic presence and credibility which make his character more credible.The worst fail I found on this movie was the violence.With all the advance on practical and digital techniques,I supposed this movie was going to be memorable on the gore aspect.Unfortunately,it was not like that.Nispel shows a little bit of blood,which is well done,but it is nothing we have never seen done with much more enthusiasm on very entertaining movies like Final Destination 2 and 3,Dawn of the Dead (2004),Wrong Turn 2 : Dead End or Feast.The ending of this movie is frustrating.During the final battle,it seems something subversive or unexpected is about to happen...but on the last moment the movie does not risk to go too far away and the characters make something completely stupid so that the franchise goes on.In spite of all the fails I mentioned,I have to admit Friday the 13th kept me moderately entertained.But the final experience is mediocre and it is extremely far away from the best films of the franchise which,by my point of view are Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter; Jason Lives : Friday the 13th Part VI; Jason Goes to Hell : The Final Friday and my favorite one : the absurd but enormously entertaining Jason X.
At this point, Jason Statham is not an actor, but a cinematographic genre. His name itself conjures a very particular kind of movie, in which we always find a tough guy, generally working outside the law, and employing brutal violence in order to defend himself from his enemies while an innocent person needs protection, even if that makes him violate his strict code of conduct. The film Blitz fits into that description, even though it incorporates some variations which make it different...but less entertaining.The main difference between Blitz and the other movies starring Statham is that the emphasis is not on the action, but on the methodic investigation of murders. Sure, Statham's character in Blitz beats many people and there is a (foot) chase through the slums of London, but this film's tone is more the one from a cop drama than the one from an action film. The problem is that I did not find the previously mentioned investigation very compelling. To start with, there is not too much suspense about the identity from the guilty one; the screenplay reveals that, along with his motivations, too soon. So, the rest of the movie is dedicated to a "cat and mouse" routine in which the main character and the villain exchange the roles of hunter and prey with each other.As for the supporting characters, some of them are simple cannon fodder and obvious victims in order to wake the main character's rage; however, the actors who interpret them make a good work, and that makes us care to some point about their characters' destiny, despite being a bit hollowly written. As for the villain, I appreciated the fact that the screenplay presents him on a realistic way, and not as a caricature.In conclusion, Blitz kept me moderately entertained, and I did not dislike it. However, I cannot say I liked it very much either, mainly because the screenplay should have employed a more interesting premise, as well as some deepening on some aspects. Nevertheless, I think I can give Blitz a slight recommendation.
Back in early 80's, the original Clash of the Titans re-interpreted the Greek mythology at Hollywood style with the help of competent special effects designed to attract the fans of Star Wars.Personally, the film did not leave me very satisfied because I found it narratively inert, and the only thing I remember from it are the special effects from the great Ray Harryhausen, which may look primitive nowadays, but they undoubtedly overflow charm and craft skills.Now, 29 years later and with all the digital effects almost 100 million dollars can buy, director Louis Leterrier offers us a remake of Clash of the Titans, which makes some updates in the attitude from the characters and brings a secular and humanist message.However, I did not like this film at all, mainly because of its very weak screenplay and its confusing action scenes, which are boring instead of exciting.Leterrier has a good previous filmography composed by action films which ended up being better than I expected.As a disciple of director Luc Besson, he made The Transporter and its first sequel, which were ridiculous but entertaining and with good touches of humor.When he integrated himself to the Hollywood machinery, he made the excellent Danny the Dog, which is in my humble opinion, the best North American film Jet Li has been involved in so far; and he also made The Incredible Hulk, which I liked it more for its solid performances and interesting characters than for its special effects.However, with Clash of the Titans (2010), he makes his first false move.To start with, this remake makes the mistake of putting more emphasis in the images than in the narrative, and in the leading role, we have Sam Worthington bringing a bland performance, because he never generates enough credibility with his character.As for the rest of the cast, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Alexander Siddig over-act to the point of the parody, and they scream their dialogs as if every phrase they said was "THIS...IS...SPARTA!".Finally, the few actresses from the movie are used as mere ornaments.However, the worst thing of all is that the screenplay is absolutely lacking of any emotion or suspense.Every single character is absolutely disposable, and they all lack of humanity or at least identifiable personalities.And I still have not mentioned that this film has the worst Medusa in film History...yes, even Uma Thurman was more credible in that character when she made a fool of herself in Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief.In summary, Clash of the Titans (2010) is a tedious film experience (specially, during the action sequences...I almost feel asleep while I was watching them...and consider I watched this film in 3D).It is obvious that the intention of this film was not entertaining us, but being first in the box-office for a week, so that something good can be mentioned on the cover from the DVD, which will surely come out in a few months.
Repo Men is based on the book The Repossession Mambo, written by Eric Garc√≠a, and its story shares elements in common with the film Repo! The Genetic Opera.Both movies are set in dystopian futures where a big corporation sells artificial bodies in order to extend the life from ill people.However, those individuals who cannot pay the monthly from their new "spare parts" receive the visit from collectors who, without any hesitation remove the bodies in order to return them to the organization.But while Repo! The Genetic Opera was a musical, Repo Men is more similar to Minority Report (adding a little bit of Blade Runner and big doses of bloody violence), due to its fatalist vision of the future and its fractured social satire which does not go as far as it should.The classic subject of "friends in opposite sides from the law" is a popular formula in cinema because it includes the interesting moral disjunctive of "friendship or duty?".Nevertheless, in order to work well, it must be supported by a credible relationship between the main characters, and that is one of the main problems from Repo Men.Forest Whitaker and Jude Law are good actors, but the dynamic created by the screenplay between their characters is very forced, and it spoils what should be the emotional axis from the story.In fact, their characters work better when they become into antagonists, because we do not have the artificial humor and irritating dialogs which are initially employed to establish their relationship.However, I found the movie to be moderately entertaining, specially because of its violent scenes, which are much bloodier than I expected from a mainstream film starred by famous actors.Repo Men pretends to incorporate a little bit of social commentary into the story, by satirizing the ruthless custom from the public health system from the United States.The problem is that co-screenwriters Garrett Lerner and Garc√≠a seemed undecided in the level of parody they should have employed, and as well as we have genuine moments of humor, we also have scenes of an undefined purpose, where we do not know whether they wanted to make us think or if they simply wanted to incorporate violent scenes.Besides, the film has a lack of cohesion during some parts from the first half, something which made it a bit tiring during those moments.I think that Repo Men would have worked better with a more sober style to analyze the future from public health instead of using an unstable combination of blood, black humor and ambiguous social morals which rarely feel fresh or well planned.Anyway, I think Repo Men deserves a slight recommendation because it is moderately entertaining and because of the solid performances from Law, Whitaker and Liev Schreiber.Alice Braga and the great Carice Van Houten do not have too much material to work with, since they are given the roles of disposable romantic interest and generic nagging wife, respectively.In conclusion, Repo Men is not a bad film, but it could have been better.
I was honestly not very interested in watching Giallo, because I had the fear of taking another huge disappointment from the once brilliant director Dario Argento, due to all the very negative reviews it received. However, I finally decided to watch it, in order to see if it truly represented another nail in Argento's career's coffin or if he was going to redeem himself by my point of view. Unfortunately, Giallo ended up being the former.The title Giallo (which means "yellow" in Italian) refers to the cinematographic genre which takes elements from the classic "noir" (murders and pretty women) and adorns them with abundant blood, violence and pervasive sexuality. Argento was one of the pioneers of "giallo" in the 70's with films like Four Flies on Grey Velvet, The Cat o' Nine Tails and Deep Red. Unfortunately, Argento's attempt to return to that sub-genus with Giallo failed on every single level, specially on its pathetic screenplay which did not provoke any interest in me, and not only because of the antipathetic and predictable characters, but also because there is not even an authentic mystery to solve. The identity from the killer is revealed way too soon and the obligatory "surprising" ending is so abrupt and predictable that it looks like a bad joke.But well...the truth is that Argento's biggest talent during the best moment from his career never was on his screenplays, but on his nightmarish vision and imaginative direction, whose influence can be noticed in such diverse filmmakers like Tim Burton and Quentin Tarantino. So, if Giallo had followed that style Argento used to employ, it could have might lessen to some degree its many narrative fails (for example: the murderer has flashbacks of events which happened...before his birth! That's having good memory!). However, Argento's direction in here is absolutely apathetic and listless, something which exacerbates the bad screenplay.The words "apathetic" and "listless" also apply to Adrien Brody's performance in this film; I consider him to be an excellent actor, but he was obviously not very interested in his character. On the opposite, Elsa Pataky and Emmanuelle Seigner are adequate on their roles. However, I think Giallo is an atrocious film which made me feel like wasting my time. If you are a casual spectator who wants to venture into Argento's filmography, avoid the pieces of junk he has been doing recently and watch his classical movies (personally, my favorite ones are Inferno and the previously mentioned Deep Red). And if you like independent thrillers about serial killers, I recommend you the excellent (and very underrated) WAZ.
Tusk attempted to combine horror elements with the characteristic humorous sensibility from director and screenwriter Kevin Smith, and the result is an atrocious film which isn't scary when it should, and doesn't provoke any laughs when it attempts to. Tusk basically consists on a poorly executed pastiche of ideas of an uncertain tone, whose only purpose is satisfying a "private joke" which wasn't even funny to start with. But, well... I guess Smith has earned the privilege of shooting whatever he wants (at least inside the parameters of indie cinema), and he had been promising the making of a horror film for many years. That's why the disappointment was double... Smith finally obtained the necessary resources to make a horror film... and this is the best he could do? Among the very few positive elements from Tusk, I can mention the adequate performances from Haley Joel Osment and G√©nesis Rodr√≠guez. The least I say about Johnny Depp, the better; I think he brings the worst performance of his career in this movie. And the dialogs, which were the best element in various Smith's films, are painfully artificial; it's hard to believe they were written by the same person who once wrote the fresh and honest dialogs from Clerks or Chasing Amy. I think that, in this film, Smith was a victim of the "Tarantino Syndrome", whose main symptom is thinking "everything I write is brilliant". I like various films in Smith's filmography, and I will keep looking forward to Clerks III; but unfortunately, Tusk belongs to the pieces of junk of his filmography, along with Jersey Girl and Cop Out.
Director Jim Sheridan's filmography includes various excellent films (The Field, The Boxer, In America and Brothers -2009-). That's the reason why it was very weird for me to see his name associated with such a weak and unsatisfactory film as Dream House. Sure, the conflicts Sheridan had with the producers of this movie were recently revealed, as well as his disagreement with the changes made without his permit, which took him to the extreme of requesting his name to be retired from the credits (something which was rejected by the Directors Guild). However, none of that "industry gossip" decreased my enthusiasm for seeing what this talented director would do with a horror story. Nevertheless, I ended up hating the film, and besides, I would not consider it from that genre.The screenplay from Dream House is absolutely tedious and uninteresting. In spite of that, Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, Naomi Watts, Marton Csokas and Elias Koteas somehow managed to bring decent performances.Going back to the initial subject...What happened to Sheridan in here? I am not sure. I would like to think that the "suits manipulation" was what ruined the film, but I could not see even a remote trace of Sheridan's talent in Dream House. My theory is that Sheridan did not feel himself very comfortable with the thriller genre, and as a consequence, his work in Dream House feels like the one of an insecure rookie who limited himself to film what the screenplay says, but without any vision nor style. In conclusion, I genuinely wasted my time watching Dream House, and I suggest you to avoid this psychological thriller completely lacking of any suspense at any cost.
Burlesque is a clear consequence of the success of the TV series Glee...a movie without a defined story and focused in over-produced musical numbers with excessive costumes and a lot of "drama", but null narrative value.I kinda tolerated the first half hour from Burlesque, because its ridiculous "dramatic" moments provoked some involuntary laughs on me. Unfortunately, the rest of the film was very boring, due to the fact that it simply recycles what we have seen in like 100 similar movies. In fact, Burlesque has some alarming similarities with Showgirls, but it does not have the sordid atmosphere or the relentless satirical humor from that misunderstood movie. Thinking about it well, I think it would be more appropriate to compare Burlesque with Glitter, Honey and Center Stage 2, because its weak narrative is at the same level of any cheap soap-opera. So, all that would have made the musical numbers from Burlesque to be its redeemers, right? Unfortunately, they are so insipid and tedious that they are among the worst elements from this movie.As for Christina Aguilera, her performance in here is atrocious and she does not show even a remote level of charisma. As for the rest of the cast, I liked the energetic performances from Cher, Stanley Tucci and Peter Gallagher; the other actors (Cam Gigandet and Kristen Bell particularly) bring such wooden performances that their characters ended up being irritating to me.In conclusion, Burlesque is a bad movie with a weak screenplay, bad performances (with the exceptions of Cher, Tucci and Gallagher) and musical numbers which have an absolute lack of attraction. In summary, a waste of time.
Even though it was very popular in the '80s, I don't have any affection for the TV series 21 Jump Street. I simply know it as the project which made Johnny Depp and Richard Grieco famous (well, the term "fame" is very relative in the second case), so I went to watch the film adaptation 21 Jump Street with absolutely neutral expectations. However, to my huge surprise, this ended up being a hilarious comedy with a simultaneously simple and intelligent screenplay, and which also changed my opinion about an actor I previously couldn't swallow.To start with, we have the perfect chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, who make their likable "bromance" totally credible. Besides, they both bring a lot of enthusiasm to their performances. Hill had already proved the fact that he's a good actor; but the true revelation of this film is Tatum, who had deeply displeased me in the other movies I saw him in with his inexpressive face and bland presence. However, he takes absolute possession of his character in 21 Jump Street, and he made me laugh with quite a frequency in this comedy. And during the brief emotive moments from the film, I found him sincere. I'm truly surprised by the work he made in here.Another big pro from 21 Jump Street is the screenplay. Instead of taking itself seriously, like other films based on TV series did, the film doesn't loose the opportunity to laugh at its TV origin, at the clich√©s which infest the cop cinema, and at the common stereotypes from juvenile comedies. Besides, it perfectly develops the main characters and the evolution of their dynamic. What is more, Hill and Tatum had the support of an excellent ensemble of comedians in supporting roles who make even the most irrelevant character memorable; among them, I can mention Ellie Kemper, Dave Franco, Rob Riggle, Chris Parnell and the great Nick Offerman.The only thing I can say against 21 Jump Street is that it looses a little bit of cohesion near the ending. Nevertheless, I had a great time while watching this film, and I enthusiastically recommend it as an excellent comedy with a cynical and acid screenplay which constantly made me laugh.
Pedro Almod√≥var is a brilliant director and, with the exception of La Mala Educaci√≥n, I have liked his films very much, mainly because of their realism, which feels as a complaint against humanity, instead of the simple and hollow entertainment we are accustomed to see in Hollywood cinema.Now, with the magnificent Broken Embraces, I think Almod√≥var has made his best film to date.Almod√≥var's direction in this film is full of passion, and his precise work is mostly noticed on the extraordinary performances from the cast.Pen√©lope Cruz is truly amazing, and the same applies to Llu√≠s Homar.Jos√© Luis G√≥mez and Blanca Portillo also bring perfect works.I also enjoyed the references Almod√≥var made to various classics of worldwide cinema very much.The references I am talking about are not only found on the story (which rounds on the world of cinema), but also on naughty moments which duplicate famous scenes from classic films (I recognized homages to directors Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles and Luis Bu√±uel).However, Broken Embraces is not only a "greatest hits".Those homages are perfectly integrated to the phenomenal screenplay, which has a lot of impact and intensity.Broken Embraces is a true masterpiece, and it deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation, because this is one of those gems the seventh art brings to us on some occasions.I think this is Almod√≥var's most mature and polished work to date, and I am very interested in seeing how his career will follow after this extraordinary film.
Do not misunderstand me...I like to see a Mexican going through the cultural barrier to infiltrate himself in the "star system" from Hollywood.I only wish that screenwriter and more recently also director Guillermo Arriaga would prove different things.He only did it once, with the excellent film The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, and he may back to do it in the future, but for now, his debut as a director The Burning Plain, employs his classic formula: a tremulous drama of a simple narrative unnecessarily complicated by a fragmented structure in order to simulate ingenuity and deepness...exactly the same as his previous screenplays for Amores Perros, Babel and 21 Grams.I am not against the non-linear narrative style.In many occasions, it brought unusual and fascinating movies as a result (such as, for example, Pulp Fiction or Mulholland Dr.); but when the trick is an end by itself, the experience becomes into a dull march to the final revelations, where the relationships between the characters and the connections of causes and consequences are finally concreted.The problem in The Burning Plain is that those revelations can be figured out much before the screenplay deigns itself to confess them, so we only witness scene by scene of drama, betrayal and suffering, hoping for something (whatever it is) to make us get interested in the movie.And, in my case, that "something" never came, so the result was a pretentious, boring and unsatisfactory film.However, I have to admit Arriaga could extract excellent performances from his cast.Kim Basinger and Charlize Theron made a remarkable work, and I think that Jos√© Mar√≠a Yazpik, Tessa Ia and Joaquim de Almeida are also worthy of applause.Their performances are so good that I wished they had better material to work with.However, I cannot recommend The Burning Plain, because I found it to be tedious from the beginning to the end.
The fact of only thinking about a movie which deals with two cops making an "odd couple" makes me snooze. Most of the films belonging to that sub-genus are pieces of crap such as Hollywood Homicide, The Man or Showtime. That's why I took a quite pleasant surprise with the film The Guard, which proves that there's no need to re-invent the formula in order to make a very entertaining film with likable characters (who aren't caricatures), funny humor (simulataneously subversive and affable) and an ingenious screenplay, in which the suspense and the anguish don't dilute the comedy.Besides of the precise screenplay (which includes some genuinely unexpected turns) and the hidden connections between the characters, the best thing of The Guard is witnessing the ups and downs in the relationship from the two main characters, opposite extremes regarding preparation, methods and even physical appearance; but identical in their tenacity to make the justice be respected (even if they don't share the same definition of that word). The "odd couple" films tend to rely on the same jokes and the same conflicts and contrasts in the characters' nature; The Guard also occasionally employs those clich√©s, but it does it with an astute sense of humor which suggests a hidden level of satire to the movies from the same sub-genus.What I can say against The Guard is that some details could have been better polished, while other ones feel a bit forced. Nevertheless, I think The Guard works very well in various levels mainly thanks to the various attributes from the screenplay and the perfect performances from Brendan Gleeson and Don Cheadle, who can both perfectly balance the humor and the drama. The "bad guys" are also interesting thanks to the solid performances from Liam Cunningham, Mark Strong and David Wilmot, who didn't forget to bring humanity to the villains they interpret. In conclusion, The Guard isn't a great film, but I liked it pretty much, and I recommend it.
I have never had a phobia against the germs. I have lived with dogs my whole life (I am currently living with three), so my interactions with urine and stool can be described as "frequent". However, the panic which was untied in my country during 2009 due to an epidemic of H1N1 left me with some residual paranoia which now makes me to take conscience of the things I touch when I am in public places, like the bank, the supermarket or the cinema. However, my weak precautions did not avoid me from getting sick a few times a year by catching a cold, an influenza or some of its colorful variants...something which makes me think that the situation portrayed in the film Contagion is disturbingly realistic and credible, specially due to the fact that director Steven Soderbergh presents it in a sober and minimalistic tone.Even though it would be easy to compare Contagion with other films about catastrophic epidemics (such as Outbreak and Carriers), I found its spirit and intention closer to The Andromeda Strain (1971), due to the cold and impersonal style with which it examines the biological threaten, without ignoring the human drama, but without exploiting it in order to provoke easy emotions. And on the technical aspect, Contagion reminded me of Traffic due to its exploration of parallel sub-plots with a semi-documentary style which is exempt of the classic Hollywood artifice. That strategy keeps the story on a constant movement, forcing us to draw deductions, tie loose ends and anticipate to the chain of causes and consequences. So, challenging us to follow its rhythm, the film compensates its lack of a conventional structure, where we would have probably found pre-fabricated villains and perfect heroes trying to save the world. On the opposite, Contagion shows us that the pandemic is not necessarily spread because of Machiavellian manipulation, but simply because the social, political and economical system is full of contradictions in all its levels, which are manifested with a bigger strength in the moments of crisis, when it is already too later in order to correct them.As for the actors, they perfectly understood, with one exception, that the drama must flow from the situation, and not necessarily from their reactions, so as a consequence, they show an absolute control during scenes which could have become into dull sentimental revelations or unnecessary "duel of performances". On the side of the scientists, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard and Jennifer Ehle transmit the urgency from their mission and the pain of knowing that despite their characters' effort for finding a cure, millions of people will die, without the need of words. Jude Law is perfect as a rebel and controversial "blogger" who pretends to know "the truth", despite being contaminated with his ego and ignorance. I also liked the works from Enrico Colantoni, Bryan Cranston and the great Elliott Gould very much. The only actor whose performance I did not like is Matt Damon, who feels a bit forced and over-acted in his role.Besides of Damon's performance, another thing I can say against this movie is that a few elements from the screenplay do not feel polished enough. Nevertheless, I liked Contagion pretty much, and I can recommend it as an entertaining and very interesting film.
In this century, there has been a fracture in the juvenile cinema, dividing it into two different cinematographic styles: on the one hand, we have cheap vulgar comedies made straight-to-DVD, dedicated to the classic "teenagers looking for sex" formula. And, on the other hand, we have "indie" melodramas which take the emotional turbulence provoked by the end of childhood and the beginning of adult age seriously (such as It's Kind of a Funny Story and The Art of Getting By). I personally prefer the juvenile films from the '80s and '90s, in which both aspects were combined (Weird Science, Clueless); but anyway...if I have to decide, I definitely prefer the "indie" side because those movies tend to be better written, acted and directed. What takes me to The Perks of Being a Wallflower, a very good juvenile drama which offers us realistic characters trapped into an internal and external fight expressed with honesty and a solid emotional impact.It's risky to let a novelist write the screenplay and direct the film based on his novel, but in the case of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, novelist/screenwriter/director Stephen Chbosky made a good work in every aspect, starting by the selection of actors. I hadn't swallowed Logan Lerman in some previous occasions (The Three Musketeers -2011-, Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief), but his work in The Perks of Being a Wallflower is extraordinary, carefully modulating his character's multiple facets in order not to make him look like a stereotype; what takes me to one of biggest pros of the film (and from the novel, I guess): the characters are complex and possess an own voice, rejecting the habitual labels of the genre, and as a consequence, we won't find the typical villain sportsman, virginal girlfriend, "mean girls" or buffoon friends.Ezra Miller brings an excellent performance as a sensitive and very friendly young man despite not fitting into the obligatory school niches, while Emma Watson brings a perfect melancholic sensibility to her character. Nina Dobrev is totally credible as the main character's older sister, occupied into her romantic drama but still vigilant over her younger brother; despite having few scenes together, Lerman and Dobrev perfectly evoke the fraternal love/irritation dynamic. The adult characters are a bit generically written (starting by the anonymous paternal figures who only exist as a complement of the domestic environment), but I liked the performances from Paul Rudd and Melanie Lynskey.Nevertheless, the best element of The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the screenplay, unpredictable enough in order to keep our attention, but respecting the "coming of age" structure which invites us to revive that complicated period in human life. On the negative side, I would mention the last 10 or 15 minutes, when the drama is suddenly incremented in order to bring us a dose of forced psychological conflict which wasn't necessary to complement the well raised narrative. Some people are saying that The Perks of Being a Wallflower is "21st century's The Breakfast Club", and even though I wouldn't agree on that, I appreciated its ability to portray the transition to maturity on a credible way, examining the fears and insecurity of getting into that unknown territory. In summary, I liked this movie pretty much and I consider it worthy of a recommendation, but I wouldn't put it into my "hall of fame" of juvenile cinema.
The Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters took the well known clich√©s of Asian horror cinema (female ghosts, mysterious murders, family curses) to build a story which was not too original on its premise, but fresh on its execution.That movie had also offered a simultaneously dynamic and parsimonious tone, solid performances, an excellent atmosphere and an unexpected and very ingenious twist in the end which does not leave any plot holes.Now, we have the obligatory North American remake (called The Uninvited), and I had very low expectations for it, in sight of all the negative experiences I have had with other remakes of Asian films (like the ones of Shutter or The Eye).However, The Uninvited resulted to be much better than I expected, and I enjoyed the experience in spite of knowing the twist in the end, which I considered to be something essential to receive the impact from the story.The screenplay from The Uninvited makes a good adaptation of the original story, because it keeps fidelity with it.The Korean film had established a dark and rural atmosphere which was more appropriate for telling the story; however, that does not mean I did not like directors Charles and Thomas Guard's work, because they create a good dramatic atmosphere.But on the negative side, this remake looses a little bit the tension which had been perfectly crafted on the original film.I think the best element from The Uninvited is its performances.Emily Browning and Arielle Kebbel show a good chemistry with each other, and they feel natural and credible on their roles.I have always liked the work of actor David Strathairn, but I think he is bit wasted on this movie, because he has little to do with his role.Elizabeth Banks is very competent on her role, and she proves she is not only talented for comedies, but also for dramatic roles.And finally, I would like to mention the brief appearance of Don S. Davis (1942-2008) in one of his last performances.I liked A Tale of Two Sisters much more than it, but on its own merit, The Uninvited works as a competent horror film which may not be highly memorable, but which offers solid performances and enough suspense to have a good time.
In sight that the main trilogy of American Pie was destroyed by the repulsive sequels made straight-to-DVD which had nothing to do with the sharp tone of the first three films,the producers of Sex Drive took an opportunity and they used it,trying to show the rude humor and over the top characters which made the first American Pie film memorable.And although they surpassed the level of mischief and bad taste from that film,they fell short on the emotional and funny aspects.Sex Drive is a very bad juvenile comedy which bored me very much and did not make me laugh with one or two exceptions.There is not one clich√© which is not used in Sex Drive or scenes which we have never seen on another movies : the embarrassing sexual situation discovered by the parents of the main character,the intolerable older brother who tortures him (James Marsden representing the only good element from this movie...I think he was the one who made me laugh on the previously mentioned exceptions),the younger brother who has more experience than the rest of the characters and the predictable ending in which happiness is nearer than what all the characters think.With the exception of Marsden,all the actors are anonymous and completely unfunny...they never put enthusiasm to their characters.The worst element from this movie is that it is not funny,specially if you have seen all the sexual juvenile comedies which were made after the success of American Pie.I cannot explain to myself how this movie got a release on cinemas,when it deserved to be one of those pathetic juvenile comedies made straight-to-DVD (like Cougar Club,Pledge This,Dorm Daze and other ones which I have fortunately forgotten).So,I suggest you to avoid this enormously boring and unfunny juvenile comedy because this is not worthy of your time and your money.
I honestly wasn't very interested in watching Hugo, because even though I admire various films directed by Martin Scorsese, the fact that a filmmaker who is mostly famous for portraying the New York criminal scene with a devastating rawness decided to make a family film full of fantasy seemed very strange to me. However, Hugo ended up being much better than I expected, and it has enough positive elements in order to consider it a very good film.I have to say that I wasn't liking Hugo very much on the beginning. The idealized Parisian setting created by Scorsese and his production designer Dante Ferretti is impressive, but it also transmits a very marked artificiality. Come on, I even found the movement from the extras, as well as the picturesque details from the railway station, excessively forced. However, when the screenplay changes its course, ignoring its eponymous main character in order to focus on Monsieur George, Hugo takes a very different personality, and that is the point when I started liking this film pretty much, until leading to a perfect ending.And I would also like to mention the excellent performances, starting by Ben Kingsley's as the old man who can't hide his greatness behind his embittered exterior and intolerant attitude. Asa Butterfield is absolutely likable and credible as Hugo Cabret, while the great Chloe Moretz brings honesty and spontaneity to her role. However, Hugo's main star is Scorsese, who displays his solid narrative sense and passionate direction once more.Despite having some complaints against it, I think Hugo is a very interesting experience which is worthy to be watched on the big screen, and not only because of its visual spectacle (the 3D is pretty good, but I wouldn't consider it indispensable in order to appreciate the movie), but also because of the message it transmits about the cinema as an artistic expression. And, on its simpler shape of a family film, Hugo fulfills with its intention of touching, entertaining and teaching us.
I have always thought that the cinema was not designed for bringing us History lessons.As much as "based on actual events" a movie can be,I think it is a mistake to look for genuine veracity on a product which was mainly created for entertaining the spectators and making profits to its studio,distributors,etc.The best we can expect on a "based on a true story" movie is a semblance of anecdotes which respects the true events with some manipulation on the narrative for making the story more interesting (two examples which come to my mind at the moment are The Right Stuff and Valkyrie).I would not consider the film Defiance to be part of that group,because although it makes a good effort to show us a fascinating (not to mention controversial) historical event,I think the screenplay should have been better structured and the subjects it pretends to deal with should have been more deepened.Director Edward Zwick has pretty much experience on the war cinema,as his filmography has covered conflicts like the North American Civil War (Glory),the First Persian Gulf War (Courage Under Fire),the Japanese Rebellion from 19th century (The Last Samurai) and even an hypothetical urban guerrilla in the streets of New York (The Siege).So,there is no reason to be surprised on the tense and well filmed battle sequences from Defiance.Meanwhile,Daniel Craig,Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell bring excellent performances.However,the screenplay (co-written by Zwick and Clayton Frohman) lacks of focus and intensity.The first half hour is efficient,but after that,the story starts to rumble trying to find (without success) a narrative road which connects to the various angles from the story.So,the impression I had is that Zwick and Frohman did not know if they had to focus on the romantic ties from the refugees,on the conflict between the three main characters or if everything is a filler to pass the time on the moments we do not see battles against the Nazis.The result is diffuse and a bit boring on various moments,so I was near to loose the interest.I do not know if the movie should have been shorter and omit so many details which do not add to the story too much or being longer in order to examine every single aspect on detail.However,I think Defiance deserves a slight recommendation because of the excellent performances and competent direction.On its most basic shape,Defiance is a very modest combination of the Jewish heroism from Schindler's List (but far from reaching that emotional impact) and the insurgent action from Black Book (but without the energy and enthusiasm from its screenplay).In summary,I found Defiance to be moderately interesting in general,but not very satisfactory on the whole.Rating : 6.5
Another action film produced by Luc Besson? Sure, why not? After all, his B-movies factory brought us various amusing films (such as Taken and The Transporter and its first sequel), which did not have big narrative ambitions, but which had enough violence, stunts and drama in order to work as entertainment which does not require any effort from the spectator in order to be assimilated. And all the same can be said about Colombiana.The screenplay from Colombiana does not offer anything new, and it limits itself to show us situations and subjects recycled from similar films; but director Olivier Megaton's interesting visual style, along with the conviction shown by actress Zoe Saldana in the leading role, rescue the movie and capture our attention with the help of solid action scenes, which do not have any credibility but are well choreographed and even ingenious to some point...even though they occasionally fall into the ridiculous by feeling such convenient (for example, the scene of the sharks). Anyway, Megaton brings a good rhythm to the movie, something which was enough to keep me entertained.The performances from Colombiana are adequate, and the member of the cast which most stands out by my point of view is Amandla Stenberg, who appears during the first half hour of the film interpreting the main character when she was a young girl. I almost wished that the entire film was focused on this girl who stabs criminals, jumps from buildings and leaves her violent persecutors behind. It might have been like that hypothetical sequel of The Professional I have always imagined, with a girl as a killer.In conclusion, I can moderately recommend Colombiana as a decent action film which fulfills with its purpose of bringing the audience a while of hollow entertainment. In summary, entertaining but not very memorable.
I have almost always enjoyed the movies from director and screenwriter David Mamet,because of their ingenious ideas,sharp dialogues and detailed performances.However,there were a few occasions in which I was not completely satisfied with the mechanic of the stories.In other words,on various occasions I could note the gears from the story turning in order to getting to the specific point Mamet wants to lead.That's not a fatal fail,and that does not avoid them from being excellent movies,but that thing makes them to be a little bit rigid.Redbelt represents a significant thematic innovation on his career,offering a very interesting re-interpretation of the martial arts movies; or,better said,from the concepts of honour and nobility on which are based some of the best movies from that genre.Besides,in Redbelt,Mamet left his old tricks aside,so because,of that,the movie feels less rigid than other films from his filmography.As a final result,we have a fascinating movie and I think it is one of his best films,by my humble point of view.Redbelt is the nearest to an action movie directed by Mamet.Spartan was near from that genre,but I think this time we have a more concrete combination of suspense,story and violence.Of course that by saying "action genre",I am not talking about hollow male fantasies with invincible heroes and a lot of special effects.Mamet is more interested on the intellectual aspect of the action and I think the best confrontations from this movie are on the main character's mind.What takes me to the great Chiwetel Ejiofor.In his relatively short career,he has consecrated himself as one of the best contemporary actors; one of those interpreters who have talent for facing any role,like the exuberant travesty from Kinky Boots to the shy concierge from Dirty Pretty Things.I hope to see someday his huge talent to be recognized by awards,but what is more important than that is that he always brings phenomenal performances,as we can see on Redbelt.His acting on this movie is simultaneously detailed,deep and credible.The rest of the cast is also very solid,and the members who mostly stand out are Tim Allen,who surprised me very much with an excellent performance,and Emily Mortimer,who is simply perfect.The screenplay is brilliant and the best element from it is the way in which it shows the interactions between the characters.The only fail from it is that the ending is a little bit predictable.But that is something minor in sight of all the positive elements from this movie.Redbelt is an excellent movie which deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation because of its great screenplay,its perfect performances,and for being very entertaining from the moment it starts to the moment it ends.
France has brought us some excellent horror films in the last 10 years, such as Haute Tension, A l'interieur and Martyrs.La Horde is not as good as those films, but it still is a very entertaining horror film with a good level of intensity.Inside its apparent simplicity, the premise from La Horde includes basic elements to create human conflict and drama which adequately complement the classic conflict about humans against zombies.Without being very ambitious in the narrative aspect, co-screenwriters Arnaud Bordas, Yannick Dahan, Benjamin Rocher and St√©phane Mo√Øssakis (Dahan and Rocher were also the co-directors) include some interesting parallels between policemen and criminals, whose intentions might be different, but not so their brutality against zombies...and against the people who stand in their efforts to survive.By the way, the zombies from La Horde are not slow and melancholic in the style of the films from director George A. Romero, but fast and relentless in the style of 28 Days Later and the remake of Dawn of the Dead.And I think that was a good decision, because in the context of this film, it makes the action to be more dynamic and shocking, accelerating the rhythm from the movie and showing some fierce scenes of bloody violence.On the negative aspect from this film, I would have liked to see some more deepening in the development from some of the characters.For the rest, I enjoyed La Horde pretty much despite not being a great horror film.
That Awkward Moment is an incredibly repulsive and execrable movie, and even though I seriously considered leaving the cinema various times while I was watching it, I didn't do that in order to evaluate all the things this film did wrong. Or, better said, all the things it didn't even attempt to do well. That Awkward Moment obviously attempted to be a romantic comedy for men, combining the frank sexual discussions from Sex and the City, the vulgarity from American Pie and the picturesque New York setting from Friends. However, the result is an antipathetic and tedious collection of clich√©s which is absolutely lacking of laughs, romance or the slightest comment about modern relationships. It would seem that director and screenwriter Tom Gormican learned the routines by heart, but didn't comprehend their meaning. It's distressing to see the actors uselessly trying to bring their "sparkling" dialogues to life, or looking for laughs with their grotesque adventures (The artificial penis fell into a champagne cup! Jo, jo, jo!). But the worst thing of all comes when the unavoidable dramatic moments come... those were the only moments in which I laughed a little bit, watching Zac Efron trying to "act" and prove he's now a serious performer, far from his Disney past, and ready to show his rear and say the "F" word as many times as possible. My apologies to his female (and male) fans; Efron might be attractive, but in That Awkward Moment, he looks like a parakeet saying the lines someone wrote for him. In sight of recent brilliant deconstructions of romantic cinema, such as About Time and The Spectacular Now, the existence of That Awkward Moment is even more unacceptable, because it ignores the evolution of the genre in order to treat the spectators like idiots; as if the jokes about masturbation or Viagra were new or relevant. In summary, stay very far from this piece of junk.
On some way, Never Let Me Go is a science fiction film, but not in the futuristic and epic style we are accustomed to see in modern cinema, but of the philosophical and cerebral kind which takes advantage from a fantastic setting in order to examine the human condition from innovative points of view. Because of that, I think it is more appropriate to describe Never Let Me Go as an extraordinary drama which is full of narrative layers, which will undoubtedly have different interpretations according to the personal ideology from every spectator.Basically, Never Let Me Go is an intense romantic drama which is brilliantly acted and perfectly directed. The emotions this movie evokes are absolutely honest, and they are perfectly expressed by the triplet of main actors. Or, better said, from the sextet, because the performances from the kids Charlie Rowe, Izzy Meikle-Small and Ella Purnell on the beginning of the movie are as good as the ones from Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley. Casting director Kate Dowd is definitely worthy of applause for having found kids who are not only physically very similar to their adult counterparts, but also excellent actors on their own merit. As for Mulligan, Garfield and Knightley, they shine in every scene they appear, because their expressions and reactions feel totally honest and occasionally touching.On its sci-fi aspect, Never Let Me Go analyzes a classic ethical dilemma in modern medicine. Even though the word "clonation" is never mentioned, it is obvious the fact that the story searches the answer to the eternal question "how human are the clones exclusively created as organs deposits for benefit of their "original" ones? Fortunately, Alex Garland's magnificent screenplay (which is based on a book written by Kazuo Ishiguro) does not fall into the crude spectacle or moral simplicity of (for example) The Clonus Horror. In fact, Never Let Me Go is as free of "science" as possible, because it puts the focus on the characters' emotions and on the fascinating points of view from every one of them. That parsimonious examination of feelings and personalities tends to make the movie slow, but never boring, because the brilliant screenplay and excellent performances constantly impulse the story.In conclusion, Never Let Me Go is an exceptional, fascinating and highly recommended film. Unfortunately, it was quite ignored by the critics, but I hope that it will eventually find its audience, because after all, it does not matter if the film is drama, sci-fi or romance: quality is quality, and Never Let Me Go has it on every single aspect.
The last time director Gus Van Sant had made a commercial movie was in 2000,with the underrated Finding Forrester.After that,Van Sant took an experimental route with the films Gerry,Elephant,Last Days and Paranoid Park.I had interest in watching Milk,because I wanted to see what was Van Sant's return to commercial cinema going to be like and if screenwriter Dustin Lance Black was going to get the correct balance between reality and entertainment.The result is not a great movie,but it was a very interesting experience in my case.And the movie fulfilled with my expectations because this was a very good return from Van Sant to the commercial cinema while Black could get that difficult balance.I have always respected the histrionic technique from Sean Penn but,on almost all the movies he participates,his performances feel very studied (specially,on I Am Sam and Mystic River),so he looses spontaneousness.In other words,I do not see the character; I see Penn making a detailed performance.However,I cannot deny his work in Milk is extraordinary.This is one of the few occasions in which Penn completely becomes into his character,so he does not seem to be acting.I also appreciated the way in which the movie exposes the issues it examines.Harvey Milk (1930-1978) was a tenacious defender of gay rights but Black went a bit more far away than showing that,making a message about the tolerance we should have for any ideology.Besides,he shows how the popular culture immediately hates what is different.Now,let's go to the negative points.I do not know if it was because of Penn's brilliant work but the supporting cast,with the exception of Josh Brolin,feels weak.Emile Hirsch,Diego Luna and James Franco cannot bring their characters to life,so their development is not too solid.Besides,the screenplay looses a little bit the focus on some occasions.Now,let's go back to the positive points.Van Sant showed with the right grade of fervor Milk's private life and his speeches.Van Sant does not present him as a saint of immaculate attitude and noble intention,but as a normal person who searches for a fairer treat for any person.I also found very interesting that Van Sant is not afraid in showing naturally the romantic swings from Harvey Milk,as well as the moderately graphic details of his homosexual conquers.But,thinking it well,that's exactly the point of the movie : you never have to hide your personal preferences,even if they are different to the "moral majority".That audacious attitude from this film made me think about another films which examine the fight for the gay rights,like Philadelphia and The Laramie Project,whose characters are gay in theory,but not in the practice.They take that attitude maybe because they are afraid of scaring the spectator with a less subtle and more realistic content.So,I admire the audacity from Van Sant and Black.Another thing I appreciated on the ending is the ambiguity Black put to it.It would have been very easy to suppose that Milk was murdered because of his sexual orientation,but there are some clues which made me suppose the porpoise of the murder was politic,and not repressive.I do not think it's an excellent film as many people do but undoubtedly,Milk is a very interesting film worthy of an enthusiastic recommendation.
Some years ago,when the animation studio Pixar announced the increment on its volume of production,many of us had the fear that the effort of making one movie per-year (instead of making one every two or three years) would reduce the quality of the screenplays.The results partially confirmed that.Cars and Wall-E were solid films,no doubt,but by my humble point of view,they were not as polished as the other films from Pixar,but Ratatouille was great,and it's my second favourite movie from this studio (the first one is The Incredibles).So,I did not know what to exactly expect from Up.The result was another excellent film by Pixar.This movie is funny,very satisfactory and owner of a remarkable dramatic deepness.The main character is among the best ones from the history of Pixar,because he is very rich on the psychological detail.The visual aesthetic from Up helps to conciliate the fantastic and realistic elements from the story very much.The design of the characters complements their personalities and makes them as expressive as any human being.The moment from the movie in which the house is floating with the help of thousands of balloons is truly extraordinary.What I mostly appreciated from this movie is that its authentic beauty is on the story and its message.The title from this movie is very appropriate...I lead to the conclusion that it does not only refer about the house going "up",but also to the emotional evolution from the main character.The action scenes from this movie are very exciting and funny,because they put an old man and make him a hero,who results much more interesting than many heroes from blockbuster action films.The fail I found on this movie is one : near the ending,the screenplay has a forced element; I think that should have been done on a more natural way.But,that is not a too important fail,and the only reason I noted it is because the movie establishes a very high standard of narrative quality.Up is an excellent movie which is highly recommendable for people of any age.I liked Ratatouille and The Incredibles a little bit more than it,but Up is one of the best movies I have seen this year so far.
I found The Lord of the Rings cinematographic trilogy an extraordinary adaptation of essential novels from fantastic genre. After that, director Peter Jackson made the excellent remake of King Kong and the tedious The Lovely Bones, which was completely lacking of any emotion and narrative force. Fortunately, Jackson redeems himself with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, a very entertaining epic film...even though not lacking of some insipid passages and more characters than the necessary.The screenplay of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is chronologically set 60 years before The Lord of the Rings, and as a consequence, it doesn't follow the same characters from that trilogy. Some of them have brief cameos, but we won't find the same dynamic between races nor the balance of heroic archetypes. And the 13 "leading" dwarfs are peripheral figures, reduced to their most basic identity trait: the fat one, the funny one, etc. The only exception is Thorin...pity that his personality doesn't go beyond his superficial function. For better or for worse, the "Company of Dwarfs" are extras in their own story (so far). On the other hand, this lets Ian McKellen and the great Martin Freeman carry with the dramatic weight of the film, and they are both completely credible in their roles while having a perfect chemistry with each other.Then, we have Jackson's solid direction, which competently balances the personal drama with the visual spectacle. The special effects widely surpass the ones of The Lord of the Rings trilogy (naturally, the studio Weta had almost 10 years in order to improve their technology), but I occasionally kinda missed the employment of more practical effects, specially regarding creatures and enemies. On some moments, I felt the action scenes exceeded the requirements of the story and crossed to the "see what we can do now" field. On the positive side, Jackson shows a precise control over the tone and atmosphere, orchestrating light "comic relief" scenes without decreasing gravity to the serious moments of introspection and personal growth.I'm now going to invest some time in writing about the controversial system of 48 frames per second employed in the shooting and exhibition of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Against my custom, I decided to watch this film on "HFR 3D", and I have to admit that the quality of image was phenomenal, much better than any other thing I have ever watched on a big screen. On the other hand, I keep disliking the 3D, because I think it darkens the image and overshadows the colours. However, regarding the HD system at 48 frames per second...I'm totally convinced. In conclusion, I didn't like The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey as much as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but I think it made a very good work at introducing us to another facet of Middle Earth. So, I can definitely recommend it as a very solid and entertaining film. Having said that, when will Jackson make the "independent horror film" he has been promising for years? I like the fantasy, but I want to see him back to the territory of Bad Taste and Dead Alive as soon as possible.
I went to see Bride Wars to the cinema because there was not any other option,since I had already seen all the movies which were been exhibited at the cinema I went.Bride Wars is an atrocious and pathetic "comedy" which enormously bored me; but I had somewhat predicted the movie would cause that reaction on me,because it bares some resemblances with the sadly popular TV programme Bridezillas.If someone is lucky enough to have never seen an episode of Bridezillas (I have only seen the first one),that programme shows the extremes to which some women lead into for having the most spectacular and memorable (translation : vulgar and of an extreme bad taste) wedding in history...or,better said,on that week.Bride Wars could have easily been an episode from that pathetic TV programme.Besides,the level of quality of both (which is minimum) is more or less at the same level.If you have seen the trailer of this film...well,you have already seen the movie.The characters completely lack of any development and the conflict is extremely stupid.I think this movie is made for the female spectators because the "troubles" they have to face would be irrelevant for the men.So,although I found it as an irritating movie,I think some women will feel identified with the things the movie shows.But,that is not an excuse for presenting a so poor story.There is not a scene on this movie which is not predictable.And if all that bad elements were not enough,we have a disastrous direction.The main problem from this movie is that the it completely lacks of intelligence,good humor or credible performances.I usually like the work of actresses Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway and,although they have some likable chemistry when they are together,they do not have too much else to do.Bride Wars is a pathetic movie.Do not make the same mistake I did and do not waste money on this piece of crap.
By this moment, my brain should have already developed a defense mechanism against any new romantic comedy starring Kate Hudson, but it always seems to happen the opposite, because I always find excuses to go to see them. In the case of Something Borrowed, the excuse was the presence in the cast from Ginnifer Goodwin and John Krasinski, whose habitual styles of comedy suggested something a bit different to any other "chick-flick" of a similar manufacture. And I have to say that Something Borrowed ended up being an entertaining romantic comedy, specially thanks to Goodwin's performance.Goodwin brings a good and likable performance in here, and I think that she made the movie to seem better than what it really is. Krasinski also makes a competent work. Pity that the screenplay brings his character a forced romance which works as a sub-plot. Screenwriter Jennifer Snyder could keep some suspense about the destiny from the main character's romantic future, but after all, the formula is not very different to the one used in uncountable romantic comedies.As for the performances from the rest of the cast, Colin Egglesfield feels a bit insipid as the gallant, while Hudson makes a competent work as the strident and narcissistic "best friend". In summary, Something Borrowed is not a highly memorable film, but it made me have a good time while I was watching it, something which does not happen to me very often with a romantic comedy, so I consider it worthy of a moderate recommendation.
The noble North American soldier who only wants to save lives.The elegant diplomat whose speeches of freedom and democracy hide something more sinister.The tenacious reporter looking for big news which could change the course of the war.The enigmatic CIA agent who offers secret information at the same time he hides important data.And finally, the mercenaries who are in fact the personal army from the corporations which get benefits with the war.All that sounds familiar to you, does not it? All those ones are the clich√©s we have been seeing flourishing from some years ago with the films that, directly or obliquely, round on the political, ideological and military conflict between the United States and various nations from the Middle East.Green Zone is one of the most recent films from that style, and it has the typical clich√©s from the sub-genus.The result is not bad; the problem is that it has many elements we have already seen too many times.At this stage, I am a bit tired of finding ANOTHER film which denounces the government of the United States as the enemy in the conflict with the Middle East.Films like Lions for Lambs, The Kingdom, Traitor, Syriana, In the Valley of Elah, Grace is Gone, Stop-Loss, Rendition and Body of Lies have already examined the causes, effects, context, etc. from the conflict, and Green Zone does not bring anything particularly new or unique.Besides, Paul Greengrass' direction abuses from the "verit√©" style (hand-held camera with constant movement, frenetic edition and phobia for the tripods), so there were moments in which I could not notice what was happening during the action scenes.As for the positive side from this film, we have a moderately interesting screenplay by itself; and also the actors, who show an adequate level of credibility and energy on their roles.So, in summary, the biggest fail from Green Zone is that it comes too late to the group of films about the North American invasion to Iraq.But besides of that, I also found the film to be mediocre.Nevertheless, I think it deserves a slight recommendation because, despite all my complaints, I have to admit it did not bore me.
Planes, Trains and Automobiles is one of my favorite comedies, and even though Due Date is not an "official" remake of it, it definitely has the same premise of two completely different men trying to reach to the same place by every possible mean, provoking laughs because of their contrasting personalities and the adventures they suffer while they are meeting to each other, until they start to appreciate with each other.However, there is one big difference between both films, because while Planes, Trains and Automobiles had an affable tone, Due Date is frequently cruel, uncomfortable and even offensive...however, I do not mention those three things as something negative.Due Date is one of those comedies which are funnier because of their actors than because of their screenplay.Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis have a very good chemistry with each other, and they make the evolution of the relationship between their characters totally credible.And besides of that, they have a natural charisma which makes their characters to be likable to the spectators.I will not deny that there are some scenes in which some spectators will feel in the limits of tolerance during some of the many irreverent scenes from Due Date.But I suspect that those who laughed with Observe and Report, Role Models or Pineapple Express will not have any problem with the rude humor from Due Date.In the negative side, I have to say that that the supporting actors are absolutely wasted, and I think it was a mistake to use famous people in characters which could have been filled by extras without creating unreal expectations.If I know that Jamie Foxx, Michelle Monaghan and Danny McBride appear in a comedy, I expect them to have a substantial participation, or at least really funny scenes; but no...they are simply there to inflate the profile from the movie.And I also have to say that Due Date is a bit disappointing in the narrative aspect, because the screenplay feels too predictable, and it cannot transcend the old formula of "odd couple", so we have various clich√©s we have already seen too many times.In conclusion, I have to recommend Due Date, because I have to admit that, despite all my complains, it made me laugh in various moments, and it kept me entertained.However, I did not find the movie to be very memorable, and I did not find it nearly as funny as The Hangover, the previous movie from director Todd Phillips.
Like In the Valley of Elah, The Messenger is not specifically about the Iraq war, but about the effects it provokes on the soldiers who survive it physically, but not emotionally. And in a cruel paradox, the story from The Messenger follows two of that soldiers who have the difficult work of reporting to the family of dead military in combat. That may sound as an obvious and sentimental drama; however, the truth is the opposite, because the screenplay tells a deep and honest story about salvation and hope.Woody Harrelson is mostly famous for his "crazy" characters, and he sometimes exploited them for funny effects (for example, in 2012 and Zombieland). Some people might think that the role of the tense Captain Stone in The Messenger was given to him because of that, but I think that would be a mistake; the febrile look and vehement attitude he brings to his character are not simple tricks to bring the typical soldier who is mad because of the war to life, but useful tools to make us feel the tortuous emotional road his character lived, and which left him with an insensible exterior...but with turbulent interior emotions which threaten to explode behind his disciplined appearance. Ben Foster also brings an intense performance, tacitly showing the serious emotional injuries from his character, and at the same time, the hope of recovering the humanity he lost during the war. The interaction between the characters from Foster and Harrelson evolves in an organic way thanks to the excellent work from both actors. And I also liked the performance from the great Samantha Morton, who backs to show her amazing versatility in this movie.I also appreciated the way in which director Oren Moverman lets the camera to naturally flow during many scenes by long minutes, letting the actors to completely plunge into the scenes and, as a consequence, achieving moments of an unusual dramatic potency which do not feel forced, but honest and spontaneous. However, I have to mention the presence of some scenes which feel a bit boring and unnecessary.Nevertheless, despite not being a great film, The Messenger deserves a recommendation as a deep and very interesting characters study with perfect performances and solid direction.
The fans of director and screenwriter George A. Romero (including me) had been expecting his return to the zombie films for a long time.After the "holy trilogy" of Night of the Living Dead (1968), Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Day of the Dead (1985), we had to wait 20 years for his return to the zombie sub-genus with the brilliant movie Land of the Dead, which was followed by Diary of the Dead (which I also liked very much), and now, Survival of the Dead, which despite of being one of Romero's least achieved films (by my point of view), I still found it to be a very interesting variation in the zombie sub-genus, mainly because, following with the director's tradition, the emphasis is on the human conflict, and not necessarily on blood and violence...even though they are not neglected either.My theory about Survival of the Dead is that Romero wanted to make a western about rivalry between families, territorial disputes and taciturn anti-heroes.However, his career is anchored on the horror genre, and it would have been impossible to get funding to make a western on that style in the actual worldwide economical environment.So, Romero decided to alter his idea a little bit, setting the story in the living dead universe with the purpose of making it more commercial and attractive to contemporary spectators.I do not know if that theory is true, but Survival of the Dead is very distant from the zombie films we are accustomed to see nowadays, something which is a double-edged sword, because as well as the movie can attract a more diverse audience, it can also alienate to the most traditional fans of the horror genre.Personally, I liked it pretty much mainly because of Romero's solid direction and because of its realistic and deep characters.On the negative side from the movie, I can mention some strange narrative decisions and scenes which feel out of place in the context of this film.Complementing Romero's vision, we have a cast composed by unknown actors who possess enough talent for transmitting the emotional weight from their characters, either in the moments of family drama as well as those ones which show the dehumanization brought by the fatiguing fight for survival.Survival of the Dead reminded me to some point of those melancholic westerns which were made during late 60's, when the genre had exhausted the simple visceral pleasures of "good vs. evil" and started to explore the psychology of the inhabitants from the "new frontier".Something similar to that could have been Romero's purpose with Survival of the Dead: not repeating the classic formula of humans against zombies, but examining individual stories in the context of the global catastrophe, where some ones transcend their limitations in order to face the adversity, and other ones fall into the typical human vices in order to protect themselves from those things they do not understand.And that is what I mostly appreciate from Survival of the Dead...it might not be a great film, but few zombie movies inspire those kind of deep reflections.Nevertheless, besides of its multiple levels of deepness, Survival of the Dead offers various scenes which will be enjoyed pretty much by the fans of gore (like me).But the presence of an authentic filmmaker behind this movie makes it better than many contemporary zombie movies.As I previously said, I think this is one of Romero's least achieved films, but I still think it is worthy of a recommendation, specially due to its ambition of doing something different into the zombie sub-genus.
The Thing (1982) isn't only one of my favorite films from director John Carpenter, but also one of the best horror films of the '80s, because it combines solid performances, extraordinary special effects and an intelligent screenplay which exploits the paranoia and fatalist atmosphere of the short story Who Goes There?, on which it was roughly based, to the maximum level. Besides, The Thing (1982) was one of the very few remakes which surpassed the original film, because an adaptation of that story had already been made in 1951, under the title The Thing from Another World. And even though The Thing (2011) isn't nearly as good as the two previous versions, I consider it a decent horror film.Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. brings a dynamic rhythm and some identity to the film. And even though the atmosphere he created is much lighter and less claustrophobic than the one achieved by Carpenter in the previous version, he could get a moderate level of suspense.Before watching this movie, I had some doubts about the use of a young North American actress in the leading role, because that seemed like a weak attempt to attract the teenage audience and justify the use of the English language in a cast full of Scandinavian actors. However, Mary Elizabeth Winstead immediately earns the spectator's confidence with a solid performance which evokes the vulnerability of a typical "final girl", the pragmatism of a scientist who has to face the unknown, and the conviction of an actress who doesn't underrate the fact that she's starring in a horror film (ie, Winstead had already brought competent performances in the fantastic genre films Sky High, Final Destination 3 and Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World).The rest of the actors makes a functional work, even though the abundance of thick beards, hirsute hairs and coats makes many of them very difficult to distinguish with each other, and as a consequence, it's difficult for us to care about their deaths. Speaking of which, the special effects of The Thing (2011) are quite well done, even though they don't reach the insane beauty and elegance we saw in Carpenter's film.I felt the rhythm from The Thing (2011) a bit rushed. The characters accept the situation too quickly and they take precipitated decisions which feel like short cuts taken by the screenplay, and not as natural reactions of people subject to an abnormal situation. Nevertheless, I had a good time while watching this film, and I can give it a moderate recommendation despite not being very memorable.
The title from this movie (Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole) is useful to describe some of its fails: the phrase "Legend of the Guardians" evokes the uncountable films of generic fantasy which confuse excessive solemnity with genuine dramatic deepness; and the subtitle "The Owls of Ga'Hoole" evokes the forced "gimmick" of setting the story in a bizarre society of owls in order to give it a different identity than the competition.So, as a result, we have a tedious story about heroes and villains, but with owls of any kind.However, as much as I disliked Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, I have to mention that its technical aspects are very good, because the settings, the owls, the atmospheric effects and the illumination feel absolutely natural.Nevertheless, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole uses its technical expertise in order to disguise a trite, predictable and uninteresting story, which is built on the basis of the same clich√©s and archetypes we have already seen too many times: from the underrated main character who fights against its insecurity in order to triumph on its mission, to the wise mentor who intuits the potential from the main character, without forgetting the obligatory "comic relief" and the villains lacking of any deepness and description beyond their evilness.In conclusion, it is a pity that the solid technical work from the Australian studio Animal Logic was wasted in an ordinary and bland story which bored me to tears.So, I cannot recommend this movie, because I feel like I wasted my time and my money watching it.
I think Peter Jackson is one of the best contemporary directors, because he belongs to the reduced "club" of filmmakers who have shown their talent on opposite extremes of cinematographic art, and as well as he found huge success with his epic movies of The Lord of the Rings, he also won the devotion from a group of fans (I am one of them) who consider his horror movies (Bad Taste and Dead Alive) as high points from the genre.As a matter of fact, I consider The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a magnificent example of adapting a literary work to the cinema, distilling the story to its basic components without losing the essence or the emotional weight which made the original work memorable.So, I received a big disappointment with The Lovely Bones, his most recent film, since it ended up being a failed and boring adaptation of a book, which falls on the classic mistake of respecting the shape and ignoring the substance.There was pretty much material to make of The Lovely Bones an intense and provocative movie.The problem is that co-screenwriters Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boyens did not know what story to tell, so the screenplay arbitrarily combines a maternal drama with the investigation of a crime, the suspicions from the victim's sister, the twisted life from the murderer, the psychic kid who sees the ghost from the dead girl and the metaphysical adventures from the victim in the "intermediate space", where she can see our world and at the same time influence the structure from her magical spiritual environment.The problem is that all those stories do not feel interconnected or well balanced.It was may more necessary a more energetic cut of characters and content in order to refine the story and find a common axis which unifies the tone and intention from so many narrative slopes, but without losing the central subjects of family redemption, "karma" and triumph over adversity.In less pretentious words: the jumps between all the stories are so abrupt that we do not get interested in any of them.As for the performances, on the one hand, Saoirse Ronan, Stanley Tucci and Rose McIver bring excellent performances; but on the other hand, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon feel too forced on their characters.I do not think Jackson was the right person to make this movie; I will keep considering him as a great director, but I think that a different sensibility was needed to this movie.So, I do not recommend The Lovely Bones, mainly because I think this is an unsatisfactory and boring movie which lacks of humanity.I wish Jackson better luck on his next project.
I had optimism before watching Godzilla (2014) because director Gareth Edwards' previous film was the excellent Monsters, in which he showed big ingenuity and talent in order to conjugate an interesting story with fascinating images, working with a very low budget. And now, with hundreds of millions of dollars to his disposition, Edwards attempted to make a visually impressive and narratively attractive film. And he achieved that to some point, but not enough in order for Godzilla (2014) to be a completely satisfactory film. Among the pros, I can mention everything related to Godzilla and the other monsters. Edwards made the good decision of keeping the point of view on a human level, and as a consequence, the battles overwhelm the audience with their epic scale and vast scope. But the most important thing is that the creatures have personality, and feel like authentic characters relevant to the story, instead of being anonymous instruments of devastation. And, well, the special effects are amazing, specially to those of us who grew up watching the Toho Pictures movies with disguised men crushing Tokyo models. On the negative side, the monsters have more personality than the humans. Godzilla (2014) keeps the emphasis on the people, and that denies us to see the monsters in action various times. That would have been pretty laudable if the human characters had been more interesting, or if they had fulfilled their purpose as emotional axis of the story; unfortunately, it wasn't like that, and I wasn't very interested when I was seeing the hero trying to communicate with his wife, or the soldiers fighting for getting the technological "mcguffin" which would solve all their problems. Instead of retaking the intellectual conflict from the original Gojira (like I was expecting), the screenplay employs many clich√©s from disaster cinema, including the obligatory family separated by the catastrophe; the hero with unavoidable "daddy issues" he has to solve before saving the world; the military in the bunker with concerned faces; the scientist nobody listens to; the wise Japanese man who recites maxims about the balance of nature and the arrogance of humanity; and, of course, the dog in danger. The performances feel weak, and the screenplay saturates us with information, filling the scenes with too many characters, locations and situations which end up confusing with each other without advancing the story. In conclusion, Godzilla (2014) is an entertaining film on its own merit; but as the heiress of a huge cultural legacy, it disappointed me a little bit, because even though it captures the spirit of "kaiju" cinema, it didn't show the evolution I expected with the huge resources it was made.
The legal thriller has never been one of my favorite genres, but I can undoubtedly enjoy its movies when they know how to employ the classic tools of logic, analysis and deduction in order to illustrate us about the complicated relationship between "law" and "justice", specially when they are endorsed by an interesting story and characters who make us believe the importance of the subjects they are dealing with. In other words, I prefer them to be more like Amistad or Paths of Glory, and less like Erin Brockovich or Runaway Jury. The recent film The Lincoln Lawyer presents an unusual case, because it knows how to employ the traditional elements from the genre in order to show us the adventures from a very peculiar lawyer; however, its structure and dramatic mechanisms are more similar to the detective cinema, with the lawyer also serving as the investigator of a horrible crime. That combination ended up producing an interesting and very entertaining experience, which works equally well on the two previously mentioned aspects.The concept from The Lincoln Lawyer is quite interesting, and it offers a good alternative to author John Grisham's monopoly and his tales about urban corruption or picturesque "rural Gothic" (by the way, this film is based on a book written by Michael Connelly, an ex-criminal reporter from Los √Ångeles who supposedly based the main character on various "automotive lawyers" who are active in that city). Even though The Lincoln Lawyer does not possess the characteristic melodrama and sophistication from Grisham, it does not pretend to be realistic either, but an idealized interpretation in which the female attorneys are very cute, the collaborators are very picturesque and every case is easily solved by the main character's contacts and his "golden tongue". Nevertheless, that does not avoid the movie from having a very well structured screenplay which kept me in constant suspense thanks to the unexpected plot twists and the violence threatens against the main character.Matthew McConaughey brings a very competent performance, simultaneously exuberant and modulated, and with the authentic nature from his character hidden (but not invisible) behind the arrogance and narcissism. McConaughey had been involved for various years in either mediocre or bad films, which made me to forget about the good actor from films like Frailty and Amistad. However, it was pleasant to see McConaughey again in an interesting role in a solid film, at the same time he proves that he can be efficient whenever the material endorses him. As for the supporting cast, Marisa Tomei, John Leguizamo, Bryan Cranston, Josh Lucas, Michael Pe√±a and the great William H. Macy also bring credible performances.So, in conclusion, The Lincoln Lawyer is a very good thriller which deserves a recommendation thanks to the solid performances, the interesting screenplay and Brad Furman's energetic direction, which keeps the precise balance of style and discipline in order to take us through the story with vigor, but without any unnecessary ornaments.
The television work from producers Sid and Marty Krofft (H.R. Pufnstuf, The Bugaloos, Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, Electra Woman and Dyna Girl) was kinda popular during the 70's, but I never liked their programmes.I even found their most famous work, Land of the Lost, to be a failed and tedious combination of hollow childish stories and serious science fiction subjects.Because of that, my expectations for its film adaptation was very low...and the film was unfortunately on level with my expectations.The original TV programme was weak and absurd, but the film is even worse, because I frankly found it to be idiot.Land of the Lost is a mediocre and boring "comedy" whose screenplay lacks of any suspense, imagination or consistence.This is another movie made with the eternal excuse of "it does not need to be a good movie because it is for kids".One of the few things I appreciated on this movie is that Danny McBride made me laugh in 2 or 3 occasions.Land of the Lost is a genuinely stupid movie, and I do not recommend it, because it makes the worst of the mistakes: being boring.
Horror is my favorite movie genre and, maybe because of that, I use to see its movies with a bit of indulgence, excusing the repetition of structures, subjects or stories if they feel natural on the plot.But even with that positive predisposition, I usually dislike the horror sub-genus of "evil kid", because I generally find the movies to be poor and repetitive (however, of course there are some exceptions).The cause of the evilness can be psychological, paranormal or genetic; the villain can be a boy or a girl; and the adults will live cheated by the apparent innocence from the kid, until it is too late.My point is that, for every movie which adds creativity and ingenuity to this sub-genus, there are dozens of predictable and clich√©d rehashes which try to scandalize us with the evil acts from a boy or girl.Fortunately, Orphan is one of those movies which add something new and creative to the formula, at the same time it has a good rhythm, some genuinely creepy scenes and an excellent twist in the end.Peter Sarsgaard's performance on this movie is a bit bland, but the rest of the main cast makes a very good work.Vera Farmiga shows energy, conviction and credibility.The same can be said about Isabella Fuhrman, who brings a detailed performance as the evil Esther.I also liked the audacity from director Jaume Collet-Serra (who made a huge improvement after the tedious remake of House of Wax, his previous horror film) pretty much, because he is not afraid of showing graphic and disturbing scenes, at the difference of so many insipid Hollywood filmmakers who work on the horror genre.I think the best element from this movie is its twist in the end, which is absolutely ingenious, unexpected and does not feel forced at all.Besides Sarsgaard's performance, another fail I found on this movie was that 3 or 4 elements feel recycled from other movies, and they take a bit of credibility to the generally very solid screenplay.In spite of those fails, I liked Orphan pretty much and I took a very nice surprise with it.It may not be an excellent movie, but it perfectly fulfills its intention of bringing a very entertaining time which produces a few creeps.
I didn't know what to exactly expect from the film Don Jon. I knew what its premise was about, but I didn't know whether it was going to be a comedy, a drama or an irreverent romance forged by the raw realities of modern relationships, based more on technology than on feelings. Fortunately, Don Jon ended up being all that and even more, supported by perfect production values, audacious ideas and an ambitious spectrum of messages. Besides, this movie represents the debut as a director and screenwriter from actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and I think he made a pretty good work behind and in front of the cameras. His performance is based on the clich√© of the "guido" from New Jersey, but with enough deepness in order to rescue his character's humanity, making him likable despite his vices. Scarlett Johansson also brings an excellent performance as the woman who could open the main character's eyes... even if her motivation is more selfish than it seems. I think I hadn't seen such a good performance from her since Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and I think this is a good opportunity for people to remember her talent, instead of exclusively focusing on her figure. What takes me to the best element from Don Jon: its sober and impartial analysis about sexuality in the digital era, distorted by manufactured fantasies which inundate the popular entertainment, whether it's in the shape of online porn or Hollywood chick-flicks. In conclusion, I wouldn't consider Don Jon as an excellent film, and it has a few negative elements (the screenplay stumbles a bit on some occasions, and some characters cross the line of the ethnic caricature), but I liked it pretty much, and I recommend it with confidence.
Since I am a teenager I am fascinated by the literature about conspiracies (which has increased with the popularity of the Internet), and even though I cannot deny all those absurd theories about UFOs, subway empires and famous assassinations entertain me, I find those which bring to light historical events so outlandish they seem fiction, but they were verified with reasonable credibility, to be much more interesting.Among those events I can mention the MK-Ultra program from the CIA (mental control and programmed killers); the classic operating COINTELPRO (the "war against the hippies"); and of course, the Stargate Project, with which North American army explored the military use of extrasensory perception, and in particular a discipline called "remote vision".The real story (at least according to its description on the books Psi Spies and Remote Viewers) is simultaneously exciting, tragic and funny, and it had the perfect potential of being told in a movie.Unfortunately, The Men Who Stare at Goats fatally failed on that, because it could not find the precise tone from the narrative, so it ended up feeling like a bad and incomplete joke whose conclusion never comes.To be honest, I do not have too much faith on the "remote vision" and other developments in "psychic war" the members from the Stargate project got.But, from the social and political point of view, I think a much more interesting story about this exotic combination of "new age" philosophy and aggressive military mentality could have been told.However, the decision to simplify The Men Who Stare at Goats made it to be a bad comedy which deleted the mystery and amazement it could have generated with the simple description of the psychic training...and with the questioning of the governmental criterion.One of the few things I liked in this movie was the solid work from the cast.Besides of George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey, I think the supporting cast (which includes the excellent character actors Stephen Lang, Robert Patrick, Glenn Morshower, Nick Offerman and Stephen Root) is also worthy of mention.However, in summary, I cannot recommend The Men Who Stare at Goats, mainly because the screenplay has a poor structure, doubtful intention and, the worst thing of all, weak comedy which never made me laugh.And when a comedy does not make me laugh at all, we are in serious trouble.
Contraband is a remake of the Icelandic film Reykjav√≠k-Rotterdam (which I haven't seen), but for practical effects, it's identical to many cop/criminal thrillers we have been seeing in the last 5 years (such as Brooklyn's Finest, We Own the Night, Armored, Takers or Pride and Glory). The result is a tedious thriller with a lot of elements we have already seen too many times.The screenplay from Contraband shamelessly combines elements from the previously mentioned films. What is more, I found its first half hour so unbearable that I considered taking the DVD off, specially when I found Giovanni Ribisi (an actor who is equally capable of bringing good and bad performances) making a pathetic imitation of Gary Oldman in True Romance. However, I decided to resist the torture and keep watching the film, which improved a bit after that. But it didn't improve too much; instead of finding the rest of the film unbearable, I simply found it boring.Mark Wahlberg doesn't show too much charisma nor conviction in the leading role from Contraband. On the opposite, I liked the performances from J.K. Simmons and Ben Foster. As for Kate Beckinsale, she's just employed as a pretty face and generic damsel in danger.In conclusion, I can't recommend Contraband. I found it tedious, and what is more, it looks like a "collage" of recycled scenes from other films (from the typical assault to an armored truck, to the obligatory shootout in the street, which have both become an element of rigor after Heat employed them).
Miracle at St. Anna starts like this: retired black soldier Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) is watching the film The Longest Day on TV, which shows John Wayne (1907-1979) heroically fighting on World War II.To the display of North American value and fervent patriotism from white soldiers, Negron says: "We also fought on that war".The next day, he goes to his modest work, which consists on selling stamps in the postal office.Then, a familiar face appears behind the window...and Negron kills him with an old German gun.After that provocative beginning, I was expecting to see a movie overflowing of the classic racial message from director Spike Lee.However, the ideological excess quickly disappears when the story becomes into a tapestry of cultures and events which do not only celebrate the black soldiers who fought in the war, but also to the brave members from Italian resistance...and even some honourable Nazis who followed orders, but without forgetting the human compassion, and without blindly accepting the ravings from the F√ºhrer.However, those interesting elements also make the movie a bit tiring on some moments.At diverting the attention on tangential situations and individuals to the black regiment, screenwriter James McBride looses the focus on some occasions, and that makes the movie to get a bit boring on those parts.The sub-plot of the "magic" kid is particularly irrelevant and useless, as well as the rivalry between two soldiers for the love of a woman.I know that the dramatic slopes are valid tools frequently employed in Lee's movies; but the result in Miracle at St. Anna was not as good as, for example, in Do the Right Thing or Summer of Sam.On the positive side from Miracle at St. Anna, we have solid performances, good setting and brutal and realistic battle scenes, which may not reach the level from Saving Private Ryan, but which generate appropriate intensity, chaos and suffering.I mentioned on other occasions I am a fan of Lee.I understand why his usual position, which is simultaneously challenging and explosive, makes his movies difficult to assimilate by many people.But I think his big talent as a director is undeniable, even if we only take his least political movies (like 25th Hour and Inside Man).Miracle at St. Anna is clearly one of the least achieved films from his career, but that does not mean it is bad at all.In fact, I think the film deserves a recommendation because it is well done and it is generally interesting.However, I cannot deny that with more focus on the screenplay and a stricter edition, this movie could have been much better.
Following the example of The Last Exorcism, The Devil Inside combines two prosperous tendencies of modern horror cinema: the satanic possession and the pseudo-documentary. In none of both aspects the film is very good, but I have to say I found it tolerable at least.The Devil Inside combines a documentary style with a Catholic conspiracy and the conflict between science and religion. And sure, we also have the classic symptoms of possession, such as insults, contortions, revelation of personal secrets, and the antiphons between the priests and the possessed ones, the first ones demanding for the liberation of the tortured soul, and the second ones laughing at Christian faith. Speaking of which, I at least appreciated the fact that there isn't a priest questioning his vocation in this occasion...even though one of the characters of course has a History of personal suffering with the exorcisms. However, the agile rhythm of the movie, along with some unexpected gory scenes, avoid it from being boring.What I most disliked in The Devil Inside is the ending, which looks like a bad joke, specially when it makes us visit a certain URL in order to obtain more information. Really? I had already heard about "crossed promotion" (and let's remember that The Blair Witch Project might have been the first movie in joining the film experience with the digital one), but in the case of The Devil Inside, it just looks like a marketing trick, or even worse yet, an excuse from co-screenwriters William Brent Bell (who was also the director) and William Peterman in order for them to avoid the hassle of writing a coherent and satisfactory ending. In conclusion, The Devil Inside is a mediocre horror film, but as I previously mentioned, I found it tolerable, so I think I can give a slight recommendation to it.
I had low expectations before watching As Above, So Below, and maybe because of that, the film ended up being better than I expected. This is another film which employs the "terrified young people walking through dark halls" formula, but the premise is interesting, the locations evoke an appropriate lugubrious atmosphere, and John Erick Dowdle's dynamic direction brings energy and tension to the pseudo-documentary technique, achieving an entertaining horror film, despite not being very memorable. Perdita Weeks looks too young to play a university professor with multiple degrees, but her pretty face is certainly pleasant to look at. However, her performance feels bland and a bit forced, and the same can be said about the work from the rest of the cast; Ben Feldman, Fran√ßois Civil, Marion Lambert and Ali Marhyar don't bring too much credibility to their roles either. On the positive side, I liked the fact that As Above, So Below took a supernatural focus, instead of relying on humanoid monsters, masked maniacs or cannibal cavemen. That decision works well in the context of this film, and some good moments of tension are achieved, seasoned by the constant claustrophobia of the tunnels, caves and passages. Going back to the negative elements, the screenplay includes some improbable elements, and the hand-held camera ruins some scenes by clouding the flow of the exploration, specially when the slow advance from the characters becomes into terrified escapes, and we don't know exactly what they are escaping from. So, it's not an excellent horror film, but As Above, So Below managed to keep me entertained, and comparing it to the two other films I have seen about the Paris catacombs (Urban Explorer and Catacombs), I think this is the best one, something which might not be a big compliment, but which is enough to make it worthy of a moderate recommendation.
Director, screenwriter and actor Jon Favreau decided to make Chef, a film in which he travels through the United States satisfying his obvious gastronomic hobby. The result of that personal whim is an entertaining film, despite the seasoning of clich√©s from the kinda indigestible screenplay (ugh... I promise not to use any more culinary references in this review). The "crisis of the middle age" subject isn't very new, and it has been better handled in other films, either dramas (American Beauty) or comedies (The Hammer). In Chef, it is used to lubricate the gears of the story, but it doesn't feel particularly credible. And, well, that applies to many elements from the film, from the chef's "friend with benefits" to the forced sitcom homilies which solve everything during the ending. There's a persistent artificiality contaminating the whole movie, and even though that's not enough to ruin the experience, it "took me out" of the film in various occasions, invalidating various dramatic moments which lost impact and credibility. Fortunately, the agile direction and solid performances were enough to keep me entertained during this film. Favreau makes a good work in the leading role, and he's well complemented by Scarlett Johansson, Dustin Hoffman, Sof√≠a Vergara, Robert Downey Jr., John Leguizamo and Oliver Platt. I would also like to mention the perfect performance from the kid Emjay Anthony, who displays an exact combination of maturity and innocence and has a good chemistry with Favreau. So, despite its rancid narrative ingredients... (no; sorry, I can't say that). Despite its worn-out formula and pre-fabricated situations, Chef is an entertaining film, and I consider it worthy of a moderate recommendation.
I belong to the hundreds of fans of director Sam Raimi who enjoyed the critical and commercial success he received after leaving the horror genre aside.In The Quick and the Dead,he made an excellent western which was very well received in general.Movies like A Simple Plan and The Gift showed to a lot of people the talent he has working with serious and dramatic stories,while with the hugely successful saga of Spider-Man,he became a super-hero story into a worldwide phenomenon.But,exactly like all those fans,I had been waiting for a long time his return to the horror cinema,in sight of the excellent Evil Dead trilogy.Fortunately,Raimi also missed working with that genre,and we now have him back with Drag Me to Hell,a very entertaining movie which tells a frenetic story with a lot of action,energy and the characteristic visual language Raimi used during the 80's.Drag Me to Hell fulfills with the intention of offering us a fierce combination of thriller,supernatural horror and very black humor.Raimi's direction is perfect,as always.He orchestrates every scene with a lot of precision,and he never fails at provoking reactions on the spectator...that reactions can be shocks or macabre laughs.Alison Lohman was an excellent election for the main character,because she feels completely credible and she perfectly adapts herself to the style from the movie.The same can be said about Lorna Raver,and although Justin Long does not have much to do,he brings an adequate performance.The fails I found on this movie are not too important,but something I will complain about is based on the huge expectation I had about Raimi's return to horror : I think he diluted some elements a little bit in order to make a more accessible film.I would like to think that he felt tied by the corporative titan Universal Pictures is,but the truth is that Raimi had absolute freedom about what he wanted to do (according to reports on the magazines Fangoria and Rue Morgue).I do not wanna say the movie is bad for lacking of blood or things like that,but I felt that as a "light Raimi".But,that is exclusively based on the expectations I had in sight of Raimi's work on the Evil Dead trilogy,and it is not a very objective way to analyze a movie.On its own merit,Drag Me to Hell is a very entertaining film which represents a solid return from Raimi to the horror genre.And,if you are a fan of this director,you do not have to expect an extraordinary horror movie,but a very competent one which is hugely superior to almost all the rest of the contemporary Hollywood movies from that genre.Rating: 8.5
Inside the avalanche of vulgar and "post-modern" (or whatever they are) comedies inspired or produced by Judd Apatow, Role Models was one of my favorite ones, because I didn't only find it funny, but also honest in the interaction between its characters and in the structure from its narrative (besides, it made a tribute to the music band Kiss, something which always helps). Since then, director David Wain preferred to focus himself on TV (including the excellent "micro-series" Children's Hospital); and this year, he went back to cinema with Wanderlust, which despite being moderately entertaining, I found it mediocre, and much less funny and sincere than Role Models.I found Wanderlust too frivolous and convenient, when it could have taken advantage of th opportunity to examine (with humor) the pros and cons of the hippie rebirth, whose proposal of a simple and community life evokes the ideas from the "social revolutionaries" of the 60's. Unfortunately, co-screenwriters Wain and Ken Marino preferred to stay on a much simpler level, with obvious and superficial jokes which don't have the endorsement of a real message behind the humor. Sure, it was easier to put naked men in uncomfortable situations, and expect the audience to find that automatically funny.The moments in which Wanderlust made me moderately laugh didn't come from the scenes the film considered funnier (for example, the forced appearances of the novelist/oenologist/nudist, or the classic "freak-out" from a serious and repressed person who accidentally took hallucinogenic drugs), but from small moments of personal revelation. Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston bring charisma to the leading roles, but the screenplay doesn't give them very substantial material to work with. The actors who stand out during the previously mentioned moments of personal revelation are Marino, Michaela Watkins, Kathryn Hahn, Malin Akerman and Jessica St. Clair.So, I think I can give Wanderlust a slight recommendation, even though it didn't leave me very satisfied, mainly because I found the humor excessively easy and predictable. Something I didn't like very much either was that, near the ending, Wain and Marino tried to add artificial drama through external and internal factors, like if they realised the fact that there isn't a concrete story too late, but only a chain of humorous sketches with the general subject of "natural life vs. civilization". Nevertheless, I have to say that Wanderlust managed to keep me moderately entertained despite my various complaints against it.
First of all,the main question : is Jennifer Chambers Lynch as good as a director as her father,David Lynch ? Of course not,but in Surveillance,she has brought us a very competent thriller,at the same time she has improved very much since her previous (and first) film,Boxing Helena,which was,by my humble point of view,a diffuse,boring and incoherent film.In Surveillance,Lynch presents elements used by her father on some of his works,like corruption in a small town,eccentric FBI agents investigating a crime and two actors (Julia Ormond and Bill Pullman) who worked with him.I appreciated that in Surveillance,Lynch did not copy the style of her father for establishing an own identity which works pretty well on the context of this movie.After various decades of abuse,the serial killer sub-genus has finished very worn-out and it is not easy to find an original angle.What I mostly appreciated from Surveillance is that it finds an unusual focus for telling a serial killer story.The story from this movie is very well structured and it always held my interest.The cast is also a positive point of this movie,because everybody bring entertaining and energetic performances.I think that the field in which Lynch best works in is on the direction of actors.The fails I found on this movie are two.First,there are some occasions in which the movie believes to be more intelligent than what it really is.And second,the ending results a little bit predictable.In spite of that,I had a very good time watching Surveillance.The intense violence,the generally solid screenplay and the brilliant performances kept me very entertained.After all,it does not matter if Lynch is the daughter of one of my favourite directors,because she has won my respect and my desire to watch her next projects after the very competent work she has made on this movie.
I like to see the films made "by geeks, for geeks" booming, but I am also conscious of the fact that they will eventually loose their aura of innovation, and then, their intrinsic fails will be more evident. But anyway...for the moment, we can keep enjoying them only because of their reflection (and even validation) about the geek lifestyle, in which the obsessive interest in comics and science fiction is presented as something natural and even likable, instead of being used to identify immature and anti-social characters, like it happened in the past. There are no doubts...the geeks (like me) are triumphing and taking power of the popular culture...but every ascent implies a future fall.And I think that the film Paul might be a presage of that fall. Do not misunderstand me...I liked it, and it made me laugh, not only because of the constant references to Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Aliens (among many other cultural icons), but also because of the chemistry between the main actors, the solid performances and the honest questioning of the religion in general. However, leaving the geek factor aside from a moment, the premise feels forced, the screenplay suffers from an irregular tone, and the use of two "buffoon villains" deflates any notion of suspense and emotion (not to mention credibility).The previous times that Simon Pegg and Nick Frost worked together in cinema were the excellent Shaun of the Dead and the very entertaining Hot Fuzz (and in TV, they both worked in the extraordinary series Spaced). However, they were not accompanied by director Edgar Wright in Paul, and as a replacement, we have Greg Mottola. His style is not always compatible with the geek humor from Paul, but he could keep a dynamic rhythm which makes the movie never boring. Besides, Mottola could extract competent performances from his cast. As I mentioned on the previous paragraph, Pegg and Frost have a good chemistry with each other, and their individual work is also solid. Kristen Wiig is perfect as Ruth Baggs, the repressed peasant who accidentally joins herself to the main characters' adventure. Jason Bateman is very well as the villain; pity that his character is accompanied by two inept assistants. Bill Hader and Joe LoTruglio managed to bring decent works in that characters; the problem is that the buffoonery with which their characters were written contradicts the "realistic" tone from the story and, as I said before, they ruin the suspense with their antics. And finally, we have the digital character Paul, which I did not find as credible as Gollum or the "prawns" from District 9. However, I could easily accept it as a "real" character thanks to the subtle animation from the studio Double Negative and Seth Rogen's competent voice work.In conclusion, Paul is an entertaining film, and that is the main thing which makes it worthy of a moderate recommendation. However, if Paul had lacked from its geek elements (for example, if the alien was a fugitive from the Law, or a Mexican trying to cross the border), I think that the screenplay would have not been enough to sustain the film. That is what I meant on the first paragraph: when the geek movies stop being enjoyable for that simple fact, it will be more difficult to excuse their fails and appreciate them for their narrative values.
I will say it from the beginning: after months of waiting for its release, The Expendables ended up being a huge disappointment.During those months, I tried my best to keep my expectations on a moderate level, convincing myself that the mere presence of various stars from the action genre would not magically produce a good movie.There were too many unknown variables, starting by the quality from the screenplay, the level of action and the chemistry between the actors.And when I finally saw it, it surprised me to see that the film's main weakness is Sylvester Stallone's work as a director and a co-screenwriter.And it was very unexpected because his previous film, Rambo, was exactly what The Expendables wanted to be but it could not: an entertaining tribute to the 80's action cinema, but with a modern sensibility and even glimpses of social relevance.It is not very original, but the premise from The Expendables sounded like a good vehicle to the actors and to bring us a good amount of action.Unfortunately, co-screenwriters Stallone and Dave Callaham could not find the focus from the screenplay, so we have to stand the weak efforts from the screenplay in order to find a narrative thread to unify the story.The result is a tedious parade of scenes which do not feel as integral parts from a story, but as weak vignettes on a desperate search of meaning and motivation.I have the impression that Stallone separately filmed scenes with the many stars, according to their availability, and he then joined the screenplay along with Callaham without too much logic.Thereby, we have the remembrances from the veteran Tool, which seem to establish a subject about redemption which stays in the air, because it does not have a satisfactory resolution; meanwhile, Christmas has sentimental problems with the attractive Lacy, which is a mere excuse to introduce another disposable fight with generic louts; and Ying Yang simply wants more money; that is the beginning and the end from his character.All that leads me to one question: What the hell were Stallone and Callaham thinking? I think they trusted in the fame from the cast (which includes Stallone himself) too much, so they assumed that we would be so amazed to see them sharing the screen that we would ignore the very poor screenplay.Speaking of which, I have to mention...The Scene.Much talk has been made about the scene shared by Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis in the film, but unfortunately, I have to mention it was also a letdown (at least in my case).Besides, I did not find the action scenes to be very well filmed, since Stallone fell on the common mistake of the confusing edition, which made me difficult to understand what was going on in various occasions, and as a consequence, I confused the characters in the frenzy from the battle.Among the few things I liked in this film, I can mention Jason Statham's charisma and Eric Roberts' solid performance as a villain.Unfortunately, they were not enough to rescue this boring film.In conclusion, The Expendables is a very mediocre film, and a very big disappointment.And that is a pity, because this film had the potential of being a lesson to many modern filmmakers from the action genre; instead, it ended up being another generic action film.So, I do not think I can recommend this film, because it fails in many important elements.
As a fan of director Kevin Smith's, I had curiosity of watching Cop Out, but not too much enthusiasm, because the history has shown us that he is a better screenwriter than director, and that when he wanders from his traditional formula, the result is atrocious (let's remember Jersey Girl).So, Cop Out faced two important problems: the screenplay was not written by Smith, and the film had nothing to do with the style and formula he established with all of his films, with the exception of the previously mentioned Jersey Girl.However, I decided to give the movie a chance...but it unfortunately ended up being a truly horrible "comedy".Since his first film (the extraordinary Clerks), many people have been criticizing Smith for his poor visual style.Frankly, I have never been bothered by that characteristic (or lack) in his films.But what I discovered in Cop Out is that Smith's weakest point as a director is his ineptitude for keeping a consistent rhythm...an organic flow from the story which takes us from the beginning to the end with naturalness.Fortunately, in films like Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma, we had sparkling dialogs and intelligent humor in order to get distracted from the narrative inconsistencies.However, with such a poor screenplay like the one from Cop Out, Smith's limitations as a director are noticed, and they ruin the few attributes which could have beeen rescued from it.As for the cast, Tracy Morgan makes a competent work; pity he did not have a better screenplay to work with.Bruce Willis feels forced and bland in his character; this is not the acid and subversive Willis from Die Hard, but the irritating and affected Hollywood star from Live Free or Die Hard.In the supporting cast, the solid actors Adam Brody, Kevin Pollak, Seann William Scott and Rashida Jones are absolutely wasted on their roles.So, in summary, Cop Out is an irritating and pathetic film experience that I do not recommend by any means.I understand the ambition that impulses Smith to transcend his niche, and I respect his value for testing with new genres (if "odd couple of cops" can be considered as "new").However, his talent is limited to a defined range, from which he should not stay away.I hope that he learns the lesson, so that he does not make pieces of crap like Jersey Girl or Cop Out anymore.
I found Taken an entertaining action film, whose main attribute was Liam Neeson's solid and intense performance. However, Taken 2 was one of the most unnecessary and weak sequels in modern cinema. And now, Taken 3 concludes a trilogy which shouldn't have been such, and with a premise which is so diluted and distant from the original film that it could have another title, and nobody would notice the difference. Besides of that, producer Luc Besson assigned this third film to director Olivier Megaton, who had already done atrocious works in La Sirene Rouge, Transporter 3 and Taken 2 (I think his only decent movie is Colombiana). Megaton's direction is incredibly lazy and listless, and the characters are simple puppets of the screenplay completely lacking of any emotion or relevance. Despite the poor work material he had to work with, Neeson still managed to bring a competent performance, credibly transmitting the suffering and justice (or revenge) wish his character has. As for the PG-13 action sequences, they all display a ridiculous saturation of cuts, extreme close-ups and such frantic movements that they obfuscate the flow of the scenes and ruin the (hypothetical) choreography of the fights. While those "exciting" scenes of confusion were boring me to tears, I was thinking the fact that the problem doesn't only come from Megaton's horrible direction, but also from Besson, who didn't want to invest too much money on choreographers and good stunts; so, in order to hide the mediocre manufacture of those scenes, Megaton cut them in bits, hoping the movement and frenzy would at least bring the impression of dynamism and energy. However, that didn't work (assuming my hypothesis is correct, something I ignore and I'm not interested in finding out). In conclusion, Taken 3 is an awful and tremendously boring action film, and I suggest you not to waste your time and your money in this garbage. I'm going to keep looking for my action doses in straight-to-DVD B cinema, where the lack of resources isn't employed as an excuse of the fails, but as a stimulus to overcome them with talent and style.
My expectations before watching The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo were neutral, but I ended up taking a very nice surprise with it, because its hypnotic narrative and memorable characters hooked on me from the very beginning.I have not read author Stieg Larsson's books which join the Millennium Trilogy, but after experimenting his very intelligent interpretation of the "noir" (even though it was on film format), I will definitely do it, and that is one of the best attributes from this excellent film.Even without having read the book, I could perceive the methodic rhythm and indescribable richness from a good novel in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which is not built as a collection of sequential scenes, but as a complex chain of human, logical and emotional connections, whose evolution is satisfactory on many levels, even when the story has a few forced coincidences.However, I can excuse that fail when the movie offers so many positive elements, from Niels Arden Oplev's efficient direction to the detailed and fascinating characters and screenplay.As for the actors, Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace bring great performances, because they are so plunged into their characters that we never see two actors, but two real people living real situations.Besides, this movie has perfect moments of tension and interesting narrative slopes.While I was watching The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I could not avoid to compare it to The Da Vinci Code, whose intellectual pretensions collapse due to its arbitrary puzzles, capricious modular structure and prefabricated characters.On the contrary, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo offers a logical and really ingenious deductive process which is based on the common sense.So, in conclusion, this brilliant thriller deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation.
I think that there has not been any film franchise which leads to its fifth part with the original level of quality,specially on the horror genre.Friday the 13th Part V : A New Beginning; Halloween 5 : The Return of Michael Myers; Nightmare on Elm Street 5 : The Dream Child...all that fifth parts were simple rip-offs of an established formula which were made with the only porpoise of making more money for the studio which produced them.Now,Saw V clearly belongs to that mercenary group of films which sacrifice quality and coherence for continuing the economical success.The first Saw,which was an excellent movie,established a very interesting villain who had understandable motives for what he did.Saw II was a decent sequel; I did not like the third part; and Saw IV was entertaining but nothing memorable.But,now in this fifth part the formula is simple routine,so it was very tiring.Saw V has a boring structure but the weakest point from it is that you have to remember every single detail from the other movies to completely understand what is happening.I honestly do not remember everything with a so detailed precision.That fail also appeared on Saw IV but,on this movie,it is worse.I think that for completely understanding the plot,you have to be a very big fan from the other movies.For one sight,I appreciate this movie is dedicated to that fans,compensating all their attention to the details.But,for the other sight,it is not fair to think that this film will only be viewed by the fans,so the people who decide to start in the Saw franchise with this film will not understand anything,so they will not enjoy it too much.As I said,although I saw the other films,I do not remember every single detail from them so,in my case,the final result was an extremely confusing movie.Also,this movie never provokes suspense on the spectator and we do not care too much for the destinies of the characters because they are not well developed by the screenplay.Let's remember Saw I,which had had a very thrilling,solid and logic story endorsed with ingenious twists and surprises.Now,we have all the contrary and the final result is a more bloody but much less entertaining and satisfactory film.Continuing with the tradition,Saw V is very gory (although Saw III and IV had shown a more sadistic and graphic violence)where we can appreciate a lot of impressing digital effects.But the problem is that all that blood does not produce any emotional impact on the spectator because of the poor script.In other words,this movie never reaches a dramatic connexion with the spectator.I do not recommend Saw V.I am starting to lose interest on this franchise.
I am not in Facebook.I do not have any interest in subscribing myself there, but I am not against that website either.I simply do not need a Facebook account because I am not a very sociable person.So, I went to see The Social Network knowing that I would have difficulties to appreciate a stylized movie about the origins of that phenomenon, and about the conflicts its success provoked between the young men who founded it.Fortunately, the excellent performances, the sharp dialogs from the screenplay and David Fincher's solid direction were enough to keep me entertained during the movie...despite the fact that the story is a bit predictable and too flat.I simply did not find the story The Social Network tells to be very interesting.And that problem comes from the fact that knowing the origins of Facebook is not something that particularly captures my attention.I can think of half a dozen (at least) people and events which are more transcendent in the evolution of the Internet that I would preferred to see dramatized (for example: Tim Berners-Lee, Steve Wozniak, Google, id Software, Kevin Mitnick, The Pirate Bay and the creation of ARPAnet).Oh...but we would have a problem there.Those hypothetical movies would only attract a minority of people, while Facebook is popular in a huge percentage of the world population, making the potential market of the film to be tremendously big.And I also have to mention the highly discussed historical inconsistencies from the screenplay.I guess that the events which happened in the reality are still less interesting, besides that they would not be compatible with the dynamic and elegant dialogs written by Aaron Sorkin.I perfectly understand the use of dramatic license in order to "improve" a story; however, that feels a bit hypocritical when it is applied to such recent events.If the origins of Facebook are something so important...why not sticking to the facts, instead of changing things? Nevertheless, this movie kept me entertained.Fincher drives the movie at a good rhythm, and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth takes the digital cinematography to levels I had never seen.I particularly liked the brief sequence of a boat race, in which Fincher and Cronenweth use a similar technique to the "tilt-shift" to bring it a truly innovative appearance.The dialogs from the screenplay are well written; their naughty complexity and their precision fit very well, at the same time that the actors take the maximum advantage out of them with their perfect performances.In fact, I think that one of the things I most appreciated from The Social Network is that it incremented my interest in future movies where we are going to see some of these actors, from Andrew Garfield as the new Spider-Man to Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander in the remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.So, in conclusion, The Social Network is a good movie, but I would have liked to see its attributes in a film with a more compelling story.In other words: it entertained me, but it did not fascinate me.
Once more,director Michel Gondry offers us his frustrating combination of visual genius and narrative weakness.During two decades,Gondry has won his place in the club of directors which elevated the video-clips to art.They are traditionally used as a commercial tool,but in the hands of that elite of directors (which also includes Tarsem Singh,Chris Cunningham,Mark Pellington and a long etcetera) it recovers the magic which on some day generated those moments of music conduced by a simple narrative.On that aspect,Gondry stands out working with independent artists as well as for rock stars.But when Gondry tries to apply that magic to his movies,we see the results are not completely solid,because that films are covered in style and visual creativity but they fall short on ideas and emotions.The exception to that is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,whose solid screenplay survived the visual manipulation from Gondry.But,although they are not bad films,the rest of his filmography (Human Nature and The Science of Sleep) lack of totally solid stories,so the result is not too satisfactory.Be Kind Rewind is also an example of that.Although the cast is solid,the theme is sympathetic and Gondry's direction is full of visual creativity,the movie does not result too satisfactory,because the story feels weak and,on many times,forced.There are some moderately sympathetic ideas on this movie but their combination is excessive and arbitrary.The movie has some funny moments and the ways in which movies like RoboCop,Ghostbusters and Die Hard are remade on digital videos by the main characters are entertaining..However,I have to add that that moments can already be seen on the trailer.In summary,the best moments from this movie can already be seen on the trailer.The biggest fail from this movie is the ending,because it results predictable and cloying.But,this movie is not bad.I appreciated the global message from it,Gondry's creative direction and the performances from Jack Black,Danny Glover and Mia Farrow.The only member from the cast who did not convince me too much is Mos Def.Be Kind Rewind is not a bad movie and it kept me moderately entertained.But the final experience did not leave too satisfied,principally,because the screenplay is not completely solid.I hope that,like it happened in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,Gondry will find a very solid screenplay to endorse his always creative direction in his next movie.
Body of Lies has an interesting story.But the problem is that the movie tells that story using a formula we have seen on a lot of similar movies and,at the same time,that reduces its originality and it makes it occasionally confusing and pretentious;the formula I'm talking about contains this elements : well done action sequences where we do not precisely know what is happening to simulate chaos,discussions in offices where people talk about the ethic of violence and the visit to sophisticated locations where the bosses of both sides discuss about the cruel reality of their actions.And by that structure,it is discovered the ideology of different cultures.Body of Lies has many good elements and it does not have particularly bad elements...the problem is we have already seen a lot of movies which expose the same message,the same controversies and very similar structures and characters : the Arabian terrorist whose mission makes sense when we see it from his point of view,the high range officer who takes decisions from his comfortable office of Washington and the agent who has good intentions but questions some of his actions.So,after seeing that subjects so many times (on films like Lions for Lambs,Rendition,The Kingdom or the excellent Syriana,just to mention some examples),I am starting to get a little bit tired of it.That's the reason why Body of Lies did not completely satisfy me.In spite of that,I liked Body of Lies.Director Ridley Scott has talent for telling stories which let him to combine the styles he is best at : realistic and graphic action orchestrated with a good visual style and dramatic moments endorsed by solid casts.In Body of Lies,Scott does not get a result as good as the ones he got in movies like Black Hawk Down or Gladiator but still,he gets a competent result.The cast is another positive point of Body of Lies.Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe show conviction on their characters and they totally fit on them.But I think the best members of the cast are Mark Strong,who perfectly builds his character,and Golshifteh Farahani,whose work is very credible.Body of Lies is a good movie which kept me interested and entertained but I have seen its message and its kind of structure so many times that I was a little bit tired.If this movie was the first of this style,I am sure I would have liked it more.In summary,Body of Lies is a good effort which came too late.
I did not expect Pathology with big expectations.But,when I finished watching this movie,I was surprised because I did not expect to like this movie pretty much.This is not a great horror film but it is a very competent film and clearly superior to the average from the horror genre.The main premise behind this movie (doctors who kill their patients for entertainment) is excellent and pretty original.The screenplay developed that premise pretty well.The scenes of violence are very well done.In this movie,the violence is shown on a brutal,cold and tremendously cruel way.In other words,the violence feels extremely real and there were moments in which it truly disturbed me,something that does not usually happen to me.Director Marc Schoelermann obtained a very good atmosphere.The fails I found on this movie are two.For one sight,Milo Ventimiglia did not fit with his character too well.I think it was needed an actor with more intensity for his role.And,for the other sight,some elements from the screenplay are very forced.But,in spite of that,I liked Pathology pretty much.It is not an excellent horror movie but it kept me a little bit disturbed and very entertained.I think this film deserves a recommendation,at least you are a sensitive person.
When I was a kid, the black-and-white short films of The Three Stooges made me laugh, but I eventually discovered Harold Lloyd's (1893-1971) "sophisticated" comedy and the verbal stunts from the Marx Brothers. Since then, my appreciation for Larry, Curly and Moe's adventures considerably decreased. However, I had curiosity in watching the film The Three Stooges, because I wanted to see what sensibility co-directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly were going to bring to it. The result is entertaining, but not very memorable.On some way, The Three Stooges (2012) perfectly achieved its purpose: making a modern version of the trio in which contemporary elements are combined with an amazingly faithful recreation of Larry, Curly and Moe. However, I don't know whether many contemporary spectators will keep laughing with this archaic and over the top style of comedy, which makes Jim Carrey's antics look like routines of sober Aristophanean comedy. Talking about Carrey, I remember the fact that The Three Stooges (2012) had originally been conceived as a dramatic biopic in which the turbulent personal lives from Moe Howard (1897-1975), Larry Fine (1902-1975) and Curly Howard (1903-1952) would have been narrated (Carrey was going to play Moe); but after a decade of failed starts and economical trips, the focus of the project changed, other actors were hired, and the result was this comedy, which is moderately funny even though it might have worked better as a short film. There's a reason why The Three Stooges episodes lasted for only 10 or 15 minutes...For the rest, the special effects are appropriately "retro"; the performances from the supporting cast go from the good (Jane Lynch, Larry David and Jennifer Hudson) to the bad (Sof√≠a Vergara, Craig Bierko and some reality show celebrities I won't reveal); and the film managed to keep me entertained, despite not being something remarkable or highly memorable.
Since over two decades ago,it has been contemplated the idea of making an adaptation of the comic Wonder Woman (a creation from the psychologist William Mourton Marston).The most recent attempt was made by director and screenwriter Joss Whedon,until the classic "creative differences" between the filmmaker and the Warner Bros. studio finished the project when it was on pre-production (I suppose the writers' strike during late-2007 and early-2008,plus the recent economical crisis,have also influenced on that).However,on the straight-to-DVD universe,an excellent animated version of Wonder Woman was made.Like some other animated movies made straight-to-DVD (like Justice League : The New Frontier and Superman Vs. Doomsday),Wonder Woman has been made with little resources but a high level of creativity and fidelity to the original comic.I have found this humble animated film to be way superior to some "real" movies about superheroes,whose elevated budget for some reason avoids them of making something innovative or unexpected.These straight-to-DVD films may not be too accessible to the casual spectators,because they are all designed to the comics reader who does not look for a "movie for kids",but a solid adaptation whose porpoise is not selling toys,but respecting the legacy from the character.And I admired to see that Wonder Woman took that attitude.In other words,we will not find on this movie the cheesiness and simple villains from the sympathetic TV series starred by Lynda Carter because the movie is completely respectful to the comic,which had offered subjects about mythology,honor,violence and the eternal battle between sex.I have to say I did not expect to like this movie so much.The most important elements from this great movie are a solid screenplay and a brilliant cast of voices.The screenplay was crafted on a mature and intelligent way.Plus,it is not afraid of including some decapitations and a more audacious language than the one we could expect on an animated movie.But the best element from the screenplay is that the personality,tone and style of the characters are so well defined that the movie achieved a dramatic level I did not expect to receive.As I previously said,the cast of voices is also brilliant.Keri Russell brings the necessary level of intensity and humor to the voice of the main character.Nathan Fillion also made a very competent work and finally,Alfred Molina made a brilliant work with the voice of his character (I would have never recognized it was his voice the one from the character !).The only fail from this movie is that the animation could have been a little bit more polished on some occasions.But,in spite of that,I liked this movie very much.As I said,I do not know if this is a movie for the casual spectators,but I recommend it with confidence to the people who decide to see a different animation movie.I found it enormously entertaining and very satisfactory.
Bromance: platonic romance between two "brothers" which goes beyond the friendship, but does not reach the homosexuality.I enjoy to see the flowering of that concept and of its manifestations on contemporary society.Of course that is not anything new; from Fred Flinstone and Barney Rubble to J.D. and Turk on the TV series Scrubs (not to mention the MTV programme with that title), the popular culture has portrayed those deep and complex relationships between men who comprehend with each other perfectly...even better than with any woman.According to some sociologists, the modern facet of the phenomenon is due to the work of feminist mothers, who during the 60's, 70's and 80's, raised children who were less susceptible to express their emotions; besides the stigmata of homosexuality has gradually disappeared, making the samples of appreciation between friends more acceptable.Whatever the way it is, it seems that the formula established by the comedies which round on a "bromance" is pretty simple, and it is based on men copying the clich√©s from the female behaviour.That is not a very innovative concept, but in the right hands, it can bring very funny results, as we can see on I Love You, Man.My expectations for this movie were low, because I expected to receive an avalanche of the typical scatological humor which seems to be nowadays rule, where the authentic ingenuity is replaced by simple "shock", with the mistaken belief that scandalizing the spectators is the same of making them laugh.I Love You, Man shows scatology, but it is endorsed by adequate observations about subjects like friendship or marriage.However, there are a few scenes which feel a bit forced.The cast is simply perfect, and not only because of their histrionic development, but also because of the fantastic chemistry they have with each other.Besides of the very funny interaction between Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, we also have the one between J.K. Simmons and Andy Samberg, which is also great.We also have Jon Favreau, Rob Huebel and Aziz Ansari on short but very good performances.And finally, I have the mention the solid work from three excellent female comedians: Rashida Jones, Jaime Pressly and Jane Curtin.I think I Love You, Man, Role Models and Zack and Miri Make a Porno represent a new wave of comedies, which endorse vulgarity with the intelligent humor of observation we used to see on more sophisticated movies.I would like to see more movies from this wave, because for the moment, the results have been very interesting.I recommend I Love You, Man with confidence.
I paid almost $30 in the Blu-Ray of My Name is Bruce...what a waste of money! I do not say that because the movie is bad (although it is not too good either) but because the high resolution should display the image of a movie,enhancing the details and enriching any level of visual experience.But,what happens when the movie is not decently filmed at all? The high definition becomes into an enemy,emphasizing the visual ineptitude of the director and showing every frame with unnecessary clarity.I am not sad nor amazed because in sight of the previous movie from director Bruce Campbell (The Man With the Screaming Brain),there was very little hope that he was going to correct his fails,in spite of having worked many times as an actor,with one of the most visually interesting contemporary directors (Sam Raimi).However,I have to admit that,many times,I have mentioned the images of a movie should not influence on the narrative,and if that applies for a lot of Hollywood movies which invest millions of dollars on hollow visual spectacle,I think it should be fair to give the same treatment to an independent movie,which has a minimum budget that is not able to contract expert cinematographers.And,now,having said all that for giving an appearance of objectivity,I have to admit that,in spite of being mediocre,My Name is Bruce kept me moderately entertained because of Campbell's characteristic humor and for laughing at a specific type of fans of him in which I felt totally identified.I think nobody could accuse Campbell of lacking of humor.This respected cult actor does not loose any opportunity of laughing at himself,at his career and at his fans,like me.The humor from this movie is not particularly intelligent,but the over the top personality from the actor/director was enough for making me occasionally laugh.I have to make the warning that I do not think that the casual spectators will like this film.So,I think I can give a slight recommendation to other Campbell's fans because,although the movie is mediocre,you can have a good time.As I said,I am not sure I can recommend this movie to the casual spectator.
I have not read the successful books written by Stephanie Meyer which inspired the film saga of Twilight.So, this review exclusively refers to my experience with the FILM Eclipse; if something else was necessary to know in order to enjoy it, screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg should have included it in the screenplay.As for the other movies, I found the first one to be an interesting introduction to the characters and their universe, but the final result was not very memorable.The second one added werewolves, another loving suitor for the main character and the mysterious Volturi Clan, but beyond of that, it did not add something very meaty to the narrative, and the result was mediocre.Now, Eclipse has a boring and terribly slow tone, at the same time the romance feels excessively forced.The screenplay from Eclipse is very weak on every aspect.The conflict keeps being basically the same: good vampires against bad vampires against werewolves, and Bella feeling undecided for her turbulent emotions and an important decision which could change her life.The new mythological elements are not particularly interesting, but at least they take some time off to the unbearable romance.As for the performances, they are all unnatural and extremely forced.The special effects are well done, and they helped to make the "final battle" a bit more tolerable.In other words, instead of being tedious, it was simply boring.I found Eclipse to be an innocuous, artificial, bland and very boring film experience, which also has horrible performances.So, it is redundant to say I did not like this movie at all.
With so many wars available as an inspiration for modern cinema, I like the fact that World War II keeps being visited with quite a frequency, because it was the last conflict with perfectly defined "good ones" and "evil ones", and with a concrete purpose which wasn't guided by ambiguous economic goals or questionable political interests. What I don't like too much is that, in 21st century, I generally keep finding the same clich√©s of the films I used to watch when I was a kid with my dad, in which John Wayne or William Holden played brave soldiers who didn't only fight the enemy, but who also represented the noble and fair North American ideals of post- war world. The difference is that, back then, it was considered propaganda, and nowadays, it's considered art... or sarcasm, according to the spectator's criterion. Anyway, the point is that Fury is a clich√©d and not very memorable war film, but nevertheless, I found it entertaining, mainly because of the solid performances. Brad Pitt brings a credible and charismatic work in the leading role, and he's well complemented by Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pe√±a, Logan Lerman and Jon Bernthal. Fury employs the same characters and situations from old war films, but its representation of the combat displays in detail the effect of the bullets and explosions over the human body, as well as the degradation of physical and psychological conditions in the line of battle. But the blood and devastation don't feel morbid or gratuitous, but as a reminder of the price many people paid for the sake of freedom (or whatever we currently enjoy). So, Fury isn't an excellent or particularly memorable film, but it managed to keep me entertained, and I can give it a moderate recommendation mainly because of its adequate balance of drama and action and the good performances.
I did not find it to be very memorable, but I understand why the film The Stepfather found a moderate success back in 1987.The slasher cinema cycle was on decadence, saturated with masked imitators of Jason Voorhess, whose idea of "innovation" consisted on using new kitchen utensils in order to commit the murders.So, in that context, it was different to present the appearance of the "stepfather", a sober, realistic and disturbingly normal villain.And besides, it offered two solid performances: one of them was from the always brilliant Terry O'Quinn in the leading role; and the other one was from Jill Schoelen as the "final girl", a promising actress who was proclaimed by some people in that time as the next Jamie Lee Curtis.22 years later, the remake of that film was made, and even though there have been worse remakes (like Prom Night or Black Christmas), it is still a lame and tedious movie in which I wasted my time.The only positive element I found on The Stepfather was the performance from Dylan Walsh, because he feels credible on his role.As the "hero", we have the bland Penn Badgley, who feels truly irritating.And sure, the absence of an attractive heroin (as in the original film) created the necessity of new "visual attractive"...a work which fell on Amber Heard, who was condemned to interpret most of her scenes using a bikini or underwear.Heard is attractive, but such an obvious and gratuitous strategy cheapens the movie, and it ends up leaving a bad taste...Was it really necessary to show so many discussions near the swimming pool?In summary, I do not recommend The Stepfather (2009) at all, mainly because the story never got me interested and the direction feels absolutely listless.
In one of her occasional appearances in the "indie" cinema in order to show us she is an also "serious" actress, Jennifer Aniston made an efficient job in the entertaining romantic comedy Management.And another reason I liked her appearance in here is that she will luckily attract more people to this movie and, specifically, to its real star: Steve Zahn.This solid comedian has been wasted on various occasions (Daddy Day Care and National Security are the clearest examples), and we have rarely seen him as a main actor.And Management is a good sample of what Zahn is capable of, thanks to the credibility and enthusiasm he brings to the role.On the beginning, I could not swallow the screenplay of Management very much, because besides of its rancid premise, it shows one of the worst clich√©s from romantic comedies: a cute woman who is attracted by the "loser" with doubtful attributes and little future.However, after that weak beginning, the film improves pretty much, because the romantic aspect becomes into a necessary catalyst which impulses something much more interesting: the emotional evolution from Zahn's character in order to escape from his comfortable nest and face the freedom and responsibilities from adult life.That is not a very original subject, but it was enough to bring substance to the laughs provoked by the dialogs and the interaction between the characters.As I mentioned, Zahn and Aniston bring good performances; as for her, I think her work in here does not equal the one she made in The Good Girl, but it is hugely better than the one she made in tedious mainstream films like The Bounty Hunter, Rumor Has It and Along Came Polly.I also liked the performances from Margo Martindale and the great Fred Ward; I only wish they had more screen-time.And Woody Harrelson brings realism and conviction to his extreme character, avoiding him to become into a simple caricature of a psychotic personality.In summary, Management may not be a great movie, and it is not very memorable.However, despite its fails, I had a good time watching it, and I think that it deserves a recommendation because of that.
Another exorcism movie "based on a true story"? Sure! Why not? At least, the presence from the acclaimed actor Anthony Hopkins is a quality assurance, isn't it? (Sarcasm).Despite having some good intentions, The Rite is a pretentious and boring movie which pretends to soberly evaluate the validity of demonic possession and the attitude the Church has about that phenomenon. Unfortunately, The Rite does not work as a horror movie nor as an analysis from that questionable situation; and it works even less when we compare it to other movies which did it much better, like for example, The Exorcism of Emily Rose.I respect the intention screenwriter Michael Petroni (who based his work on a book written by Matt Baglio) had of presenting a balanced vision of demonic possession and the exorcism. However, his intention of "scaring" us prevailed over any other thing, and he unfortunately could not find the previously mentioned balance as a consequence. So, The Rite is full of the typical clich√©s from the exorcism sub-genus, like the evil boy, the woman who screams curses and contorts her body, the priest with a faith crisis who sees "signals" everywhere, the possessed ones who know even the most intimate secrets from the exorcists...and a long etcetera. And besides, The Rite takes so seriously to itself that there are some occasions of involuntary humor, something which makes its "true events" to be even less credible (the satanic mule is absolutely priceless).The main attraction for many people to go to watch The Rite is undoubtedly the presence from Hopkins in one of the leading roles, and he brings an enthusiastic and expressive work. And even though he seems to loose the control near the ending, I would not blame him for that, but to the poor screenplay which betrays his character with a predictable twist. Colin O' Donoghue has the worst written character from the film, but he still managed to bring a decent and credible performance. And finally, the great Rutger Hauer is horribly wasted in his character.In conclusion, The Rite is a tedious rehash of the tiring clich√©s from the exorcism sub-genus, so I really do not recommend it.
Director Roland Emmerich has many haters, but I have to admit I generally like his work, because I think he has talent for making exaggerated and very entertaining epics, without forgetting the addition of a soft narrative substance to make us feel we are watching a real movie, and not only the "reel" of many special effects companies.However, Emmerich is not infallible, because on his filmography, we can find two pieces of crap like 10,000 BC and Godzilla.In my humble opinion, Emmerich's best movie so far is Independence Day.2012, his most recent film, is on some intermediate point between those two extremes, because in spite of being moderately entertaining and of showing extraordinary special effects, it fails on creating the drama which should endorse the catastrophe, so the final result is mediocre.As it is tradition on the disaster movies, it is not enough with seeing the deaths of millions of people; we need an emotional focus to capture the personal drama of the situation.For better or for worse, 2012 brings us many focuses, hoping that at least one of them is going to work and make us feel something...something to dissimulate the fact that the actors are only filling time in between special effects sequences.And this movie does not have bad actors...the problem is that they do not have motivation (or time) enough to construct honest or credible performances, and besides, the characters they interpret are not particularly interesting.Big part of the problem is on the screenplay, which is not able to integrate the individual stories on a consistent narrative.Sure, the most important characters eventually coincide in the same place and moment for the "dramatic" conclusion, but their travel to that point was so forced that we cannot take it seriously.And besides, we also have scenes of familiar conflict which turn a bit boring.In summary, 2012 did not leave me very satisfied, but I cannot deny it did not bore me for most of the time.However, I am perfectly conscious that most of the people who are going to see 2012, will not do that because of the actors or the story, but because of the special effects, and on that aspect, I have to applaud the brilliant work of the studios Digital Domain, Hydralux, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Double Negative, and like ten more houses of special effects, whose impressive work saturates the senses.So, 2012 deserves a slight recommendation because of its special effects and for not being boring for most of the time.However, the final experience is mediocre and easily forgettable.
Bridesmaids is a comedy with abundant vulgarity, frank discussion of sexual subjects and adventures with a questionable common sense; however, the subjects of friendship dealt by the screenplay, as well as its unexpected emotional impact, put it on a different category than the one from many contemporary comedies. And even though the result is not a perfect film, I have to say I found it funny, satisfactory and very entertaining.Even though Bridesmaids can be considered like a "chick-flick" to some point, I think that the film is closer to the style from Judd Apatow's filmography (who in this case was the producer). However, every single scene displays the sensibility from co-screenwriters Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, who besides of writing a vulgar comedy for women, also created realistic and well defined characters with a wide evolutionary potential. The main character from Bridesmaids (Annie) shapes the film and brings the necessary emotional component to impulse the story. On that way, the scenes with scatological comedy or slapstick take a very interesting dimension; as an example, I can point out the visit to the elegant dressmaker where the ladies will try their dresses on; I will not say how the scene ends, but it simultaneously works as a grotesque joke, as a hard shock to Annie's frail self-esteem, and as a point for her rival Helen. In other words, what makes the laughs from this film satisfactory is the fact that they are an integral part of the narrative.And besides of that, I have to mention the excellent performances, starting by Wiig's, who takes absolute possession of her character and makes the spectator to empathize with her. Besides, she has such a good chemistry with Maya Rudolph that the long friendship shared by their characters is absolutely credible. As for the character Helen, instead of making her a typical pre-fabricated villain, Rose Byrne brought humanity to her and makes her a figure of an ambiguous intention. And Melissa McCarthy steals the show, because she brings such a pure and sincere personality to her character which does not only feel funny, but also even touching.Director Paul Feig wisely drives the movie with a minimum stylish interference, letting the scenes to develop to their own rhythm and allowing them to extend themselves to see if the actresses find some improvised moment which adds unexpected laughs or lightens some melodramatic scene. However, at the same time, that makes a few scenes to get a bit repetitive (for examples, the problems on board of a plane). Besides, I think that the characters Rita and Becca had comic potential which was not enough explored.Despite those complains I have, I enjoyed Bridesmaids pretty much, and I can recommend it as a genuinely funny comedy whose occasional vulgarity does not interfere with its narrative duties nor with the feelings it expresses without falling into the cheap sentimentality. And I have not even mentioned the romantic aspect, which I found soberly managed and not cloying at all. Oh! And the excellent soundtrack full of female rock.
I respect the career which was forged by actor/director/producer/musician Clint Eastwood very much, from his humble origins as an actor in exploitation movies (let's accept it, the "spaghetti westerns" he was involved in are revered today, but in their moment, they were cheap Italian copies of a popular North American genre; and the films in which he interpreted the character Harry "Make My Day" Callahan belonged to the revenge cinema which was hugely popular in drive-ins and "grindhouses" during the '70s), to being an acclaimed director who received abundant awards and nominations. I respect Eastwood's redefinition as well as his evolution as an artist. Having said all that, I have to admit that I did not like Hereafter, his most recent film.Before watching Hereafter, I had a vague idea about its story, and my main concern was if it was going to degenerate into a simplistic religious pamphlet. And screenwriter Peter Morgan did not take that way...but I think I would have preferred that instead of the ambiguous and unsatisfactory "new age" tone he adopted. Maybe from a divine position, the movie would have had a defined posture and a specific message, instead of going round and round on the same concepts for two hours, until leading to a weak and excessively convenient ending which makes the narrative gears to squeak on their effort of unifying the three stories the movie tells and making us to exclaim "Oh, I now understood!". The only thing I understood is that a Hollywood-style ending was not compatible at all with a badly raised analysis of such a controversial subject like the supposed "life after death".Nevertheless, I have to admit that Hereafter has excellent performances. The kids Frankie and George McLaren are the actors who most stand out, and I really hope to see them in more movies. Matt Damon had the difficult task of making us to believe the reality from the psychic powers from his character, but he could make that credible because of the humanity he brings to his performance. C√©cile De France also feels natural and spontaneous in her role. And I liked the cameo from the great Derek Jacobi, in which he reminds us of the brilliant (and unfortunately underrated) work he has always made during his career.However, despite the solid work from the actors, I do not feel I can recommend Hereafter, because I found it to be a hollow, unsatisfactory and lacking of emotion movie full of weak spiritual homilies and which is not even sure on what ideology to take about the subject it deals with. I think I would have preferred to see the simplistic melodrama of a supernatural thriller, instead of the insipid spiritual drama Hereafter ended up being.
I am honestly not a big fan of director Ken Loach's.I respect his intention of examining the dark side from modern society as well as the injustices around the world.His strategy is translating the cruel reality with honesty which is not completely lacking of beauty and an elegant minimalistic style; but at the same time, I find his movies to be a bit hollow and occasionally dull and depressing.Nevertheless, I decided to watch Looking for Eric because I felt the curiosity of watching a comedy from this filmmaker, who is famous for his sordid and melancholic movies.Would it be authentically funny, or a failed experiment due to Loach's austere sensibility? To my surprise, Looking for Eric ended up being a very interesting combination of humor, social commentary, drama...and sports metaphors.I did not expect to find a sport subtext in Looking for Eric; if I had known that, I would have read something about the football player Eric Cantona before watching it, in order to understand his relevance better.The film establishes that he was a great footballer from the famous team Manchester United, but I did not know if his philosophical commentaries in the movie were part of the humor or if that was part of his real personality (I mean, he could be a troglodyte in real life, even though a scene during the final credits confirms his phlegmatic attitude).But well, even without knowing that, I enjoyed the conversations between him and the main character, even though some of them feel as simple self-help homilies we have seen in every kind of inspiring stories.However, that does not make the advices less valid; I would have simply wanted some exchanges to be more ingenious.For the rest, I liked this movie pretty much: the screenplay is well structured and very interesting; and its humor is not based on comic routines or the nonsense we usually see in TV, but on the picturesque characteristics from the characters.The actors from Looking for Eric are unknown, and following Loach's tradition in his selection of the cast, their cultural and social frame is similar to the one of the characters they interpret.Loach is famous for filming the scenes in a linear sequence, keeping secrets about the screenplay in order to surprise the actors and get unusually realistic and honest reactions out of them.The result in Looking for Eric is a perfect illusion that we are witnessing real lives from normal people, with problems of a variable importance, but which after all, affect them as much as they could affect to us.In conclusion, despite not being perfect, I found Looking for Eric to be a very solid film, simultaneously light and deep, whose laughs are more satisfactory because of the emotional resonance they evoke as well as for their contrast with the bitter situations the characters live (not everything are laughs in this movie; there also are some moments which are pretty dramatic).So, I think this film is worthy of a recommendation, at the same time it made me get more interested in Loach's future work.
I think this is a unique case in the History of cinema: a once successful franchise which ruined its reputation and lost the audience's good will because of various atrocious sequels made straight-to-DVD which took the title "American Pie" "in vain", without offering a slight glimpse to what made the first three films popular...and which now tries to get redeemed with a return to the big screen, employing the original cast? As a person with wide experience in straight-to-DVD sequels, I have to say that American Pie is one of the few franchises I find authentically execrable. The films American Pie: Band Camp, American Pie: The Naked Mile, American Pie: Beta House and American Pie: The Book of Love were an insult not only to the original trilogy, but also to the audience's intelligence and to the comedy genre, because the only thing they offered was gratuitous nude scenes rounded by some of the weakest and most predictable "humor" I have ever witnessed. And even though American Reunion ended up being fortunately much better than those straight-to-DVD films, it's a mediocre comedy which limits itself to recycle the jokes from the original trilogy, without proposing a new direction or displaying a different angle in order to take advantage of the characters' maturity. Sure, this movie offers us those hypocritical morals about the friendship and the happiness of a stable couple relationship...but that's the same thing preached by an uncountable number of romantic comedies.As for the jokes from American Reunion, half of them failed, while the other half made me laugh moderately. What I most liked in American Reunion was the character Stifler. Sure, he's employed as an example of immaturity, and of the tragic consequences of refusing to grow up...but he's the one who produced the previously mentioned laughs on me, while the other characters were learning bland "life lessons". Or the problem might be the fact that the contemporary style of comedy altered the standard of vulgarity and bad taste so much that nowadays only the most extreme material makes me laugh, while the emotional moments about personal growth and human interest look like time employed to teach me things I'm not interested in learning.One of the things I least liked in American Reunion was its sexism...and I'm not talking about the representation of women as sexual objects, but about the estrogen imbalance of the female characters. The film is almost exclusively focused on the men, while the actresses have an excessively reduced presence, a few of them even making cameos (Shannon Elizabeth, Natasha Lyonne). And even the ones who have significant roles (Alyson Hannigan, Mena Suvari and Tara Reid) don't have enough in order to bring their characters to shape, and they are just simple catalysts in order to alter the behaviour from their male counterparts. Anyway, I think I can give American Reunion a slight recommendation, because I spent a moderately entertaining time while I was watching it, despite its mediocrity. And I wouldn't be against the making of some more sequels to the big screen, with this same cast, even though I would prefer them to have better written screenplays, with an actual story, instead of a collection of forgettable vignettes which are sometimes moderately funny, while sometimes they aren't.
In 2007, I found the remake of Halloween directed by Rob Zombie to be a moderately interesting but mediocre attempt to bring new life to a franchise which undoubtedly lost any integrity and interest thanks to its tedious sequels.Two years later, Zombie made the sequel of his re-interpretation, and the result is incredibly atrocious and execrable.From the first minutes of Halloween II, I started to have serious doubts on Zombie's strategy, because the first scene of the film is an incongruent flashback which seems forcibly placed by him to provide work for his wife Sheri Moon.However, it is eventually revealed that that flashback is justified by a ridiculous and laughable "pay-off" at the end of the movie, which is by the way, straightly taken from Halloween 5 (Or was it Halloween 6? I do not remember very well).The screenplay from this movies is very boring, because it follows the sacrifice of generic victims.Besides, the villain completely lacks of any personality.Traditionally, Michael Myers has been the most inscrutable villain of slasher cinema, and although that kept him away from the "glamour" of Freddy Kruger and Jason Voorhess, at least that has given him an enigmatic air.However, in Halloween II, Myers has even less personality than on his previous appearances.Actor Tyler Mane brings an imposing physical presence to the character...but he cannot express any emotions with his movements and attitude.The best slasher movies (in my humble opinion, Scream and Halloween -1978-) make us to get interested in the destiny of the characters but,let's accept it, most of this movies try to put us on the maniac's side to celebrate his imaginative crimes and to enjoy the deaths of the victims.Zombie did not get even that simple level of entertainment, because his horrible screenplay and its paper characters did not produce on me the minimum visceral answer.Zombie's direction is also bad, because on many times, it is very difficult to note what is happening, at the same time, he brought a very boring tone to the movie.On the cast of the movie, the young main actors are reduced to antipathetic puppets.On the supporting cast, we have a group of semi-celebrities of fantastic cinema (Malcom McDowell, Margot Kidder, Caroline Williams and the great Brad Dourif) who are absolutely wasted in here.Halloween II is a terrible waste of time, so I really hated it.I suggest you to avoid this movie like a plague.If only I had done that...
In the screenplay of 22 Jump Street, the most important thing is the relationship between the two main character, as well as the challenges their friendship will face in the university setting, where they discover new interests which bring to light their personal differences and threaten to separate them forever. Needless to say that nothing is taken very seriously, and co-screenwriters Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman don't lose any opportunity to exploit the main characters' bromance in order to make constant homosexual allusions, at the same time they satirize the cop cinema, the "chick flicks" and the juvenile comedies. The problem is that the humor doesn't work in various occasions, and it almost always fails on its attempt to duplicate the freshness and affable subversion which made the first film so amusing. In other words, 22 Jump Street has the same ingredients as the original recipe, but the taste isn't the same. However, that doesn't mean that the film is bad. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill once more have a perfect chemistry with each other, creating likable humorous details and exploring bizarre tangents which are moderately funny either because of their audacity or incongruity. I suspect that there was a wide margin of improvisation during shooting, which Tatum and Hill took advantage of in order to create spontaneous moments of comedy where they laugh at the screenplay and themselves, generating enough smiles to rescue the film to some point, despite the mediocrity from a bland and predictable screenplay. I would place 22 Jump Street at the same level of The Hangover Part II: both faced the challenge of repeating the success from their predecessors using the same premise, and even though they didn't achieve it, they are moderately entertaining on their own merit and worthy of a slight recommendation.
It's never a good signal whenever a film is shelved for years. Unfortunately, that was the case of The Hole (2009), and its absence during such a long time made me suspect it was going to be a disappointment to the fans of director Joe Dante's (like me). Anyway, I could finally see this film 3 years after it was finished...and it ended up being better than I expected. In fact, it keeps Dante's characteristic style, as well as his habitual subject of juvenile adventure and secrets hidden behind the facade of a suburban paradise (well, a small town in this case). In summary, The Hole (2009) is an entertaining film, despite having various narrative problems.Dante is an authentic connoisseur of horror genre, but his jovial and light style has generally inclined him to family cinema, where he had his biggest economical triumphs in films like Gremlins and its sequel, Explorers and Innerspace. However, even his most innocent works include elements of horror or fantasy which bring a sinister tone in order to accentuate the amusement. The Hole (2009) fits into that description, because even though it belongs to the family niche, it's not afraid of creating some frightening scenes which could be scary to the childish audience. At the same time, its light tone might make the movie too soft for the fans of hardcore horror's, something which might explain why this film was shelved for quite a time...maybe, the problem wasn't the film itself, but the fact that it's difficult to "sell" to a particular audience.But anyway...that's a problem of the marketers. I found The Hole an enjoyable experience, with a simultaneously simple and complex story, full of mysteries without a defined explanation, but with perfectly clear and almost intuitive coincidences, specially if we share the perspective of the young main characters for a moment. On some way, The Hole (2009) could be compared to the film Super 8; their screenplays are different (besides of, obviously, the production values), but they both offer that likable preteen point of view which was handled by various films directed and/or produced by Steven Spielberg during the '80s, where the young characters were able to face situations the adults couldn't understand, or weren't able to accept. Unfortunately, in the case of The Hole (2009), the concept ended up being better than the execution. Screenwriter Mark L. Smith offers an interesting premise, but I think he didn't know where to take it, and as a consequence, we see a stacking of weakly raised scenes (such as the typical visit to the eccentric old man who might know more than he appears) and such predictable situations which stop being tributes in order to become clich√©s (for example, the working mother who is so busy that she doesn't realize what's going on at her own home), topped by an ending which pretends to be epic and cathartic, but without reaching the necessary emotional volume. As for the special effects, I found them quite mediocre.Nevertheless, I enjoyed The Hole (2009) mainly because of its competent direction and good performances. Chris Messoglia and Nathan Gamble have a perfect chemistry with each other, and Haley Bennett is totally credible as the love interest. So, The Hole (2009) doesn't represent Dante's triumphal comeback, but it proves that he keeps being a talented director, even though I would like to see him working with better screenplays in his future projects. And to the casual spectators, I think this film offers a good time of healthy family horror, not brilliant or highly memorable, but hugely superior to the bland and irritating "scary" films transmitted by childish TV channels around this time of the year. Personally, The Hole (2009) left me wanting to re-visit Dante's masterpieces (in my humble opinion, The Howling and Matin√©e), as well as his TV series Eerie, Indiana, designed for children, but not childish because of that. I wish we could find that description more frequently.
With the repulsive crap Swept Away,director Guy Ritchie's career went completely down.But,after that disastrous movie,Ritchie recovered his talent and enthusiasm with the very competent film Revolver.I know that movie has various haters,but I liked it pretty much for its dynamic style and the intelligence of its screenplay.That movie had also confirmed that his affinity for the gangster stories was still untouchable.Now,his most recent film RocknRolla makes that confirmation become a question : is this the only thing Ritchie can do ? .RocknRolla is full of style and "cool" scenes but I found the story redundant and a little bit boring.The complex story is not bad but during its second half I was not too interested on following it,not because I did not understand it,but because everything is so arbitrary which does not compensate the attention from the spectator with solid causes and logic consequences,but with contradictory events which come from nowhere and which try to be ingenious but which irritate a little bit.Still,not everything is bad on this movie.The frenetic ending works very well and there are some very entertaining scenes (like the one which shows the theft of a car).Besides,I do not think this is a bad movie.It just did not leave me too satisfied mainly,because the story is not very solid.Maybe,if I had not seen movies like Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,Snatch or Revolver (not to mention The 51st State,Smokin' Aces or Sexy Beast),I would have liked RocknRolla much more.But,having seen that movies,RocknRolla is more from the same and a rip-off of Ritchie's previous works (with the exception of Swept Away,of course).I hope Ritchie finds a new style on his next movie.I can give RocknRolla a slight recommendation for a few excellent scenes and because it is not bad.
I wasn't very interested in watching Trust because, on a glance, it looked like a Hallmark or Lifetime melodrama designed to scare parents, and to exploit the morbid "sexual predators" subject. And even though the film didn't end up being very memorable, I found it better than I expected because of its realism and sobriety.When Hollywood deals with the "sexual predators" subject and the risks of Internet, we can expect films closer to the horror genre than to the drama, something which might work as a sensationalist warning, but which is so over the top that it crosses to an abstract field and breaks the connection with the spectator. On the opposite, Trust never looks for the easy shock or the obvious moral. Well, it definitely has a didactic intention, but it doesn't scream it over our face; instead of that, it lets us gradually assimilate the risks of the Internet, as well as the "domino effect" created by a bad decision online. And it also shows us that the victims' vulnerability can go much further than the physical risk. It's a difficult and not very pleasant subject, but I think it has more validity than ever, specially because Trust doesn't portray the main character as a "bad girl" who was maybe "looking for it" (one of the worst customs of exploitation cinema). On the opposite, the film suggests the fact that even the best education and intentions can be exploited by a manipulative expert who takes advantage of the teenagers' emotional immaturity in order to get what he is looking for.On the other side of the coin, Trust didn't leave me completely satisfied. David Schwimmer's direction feels lacking of personality and narrative impulse, something which makes the film to have a kinda insipid tone. And the screenplay is so focused in meticulously following the main character's feelings that it looses the opportunity of developing the other characters better. In fact, there's an interesting angle in the father, and I would have liked co-screenwriters Andy Bellin and Robert Festinger to explore more detailedly the contradiction of his job on an advertising agency, where he designs clothes ads which pretend to prematurely sexualize the teenage models. Going back to the positive elements, we have Liana Liberato's brilliant performance, which handles a spectrum of overwhelming emotions with an extraordinary aplomb. And Chris Henry Coffey also makes an excellent work as the "predator", portraying him as someone apparently inoffensive but an expert in adjusting himself to the fantasies of his frail victims.I don't have any sons or daughters, but I remember my teenage years, and I'm sure that I would have laughed at a film like this, having believed that it was exaggerating or only aiming to scare, because nothing of that could have happened between the people I knew. But now, as an adult person, I can appreciate its message, and that's the one of the main reasons why I can give Trust a moderate recommendation as an interesting drama, despite some fails in the screenplay and Schwimmer's weak direction.
Since The Bourne Legacy is a sequel/reboot, I think I should make a summary of the saga which originated it. In 2002, The Bourne Identity revealed a new aesthetic in action cinema, more realistic and violent, but also more cerebral and loaded with intrigue in order to satisfy the spectators tired of the anachronistic muscular but idiot anti-heroes from the '90s. As for the sequels, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, I liked them more than the first film. Now, 10 years after The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Legacy represents a new start with a different actor, and I found the result moderately entertaining but mediocre.Co-screenwriters Dan and Tony Gilroy (the latter was also the director) overcharged the first hour from the film with abundant wordiness, secret codes and "techno-babble" in order to dissimulate the fact that The Bourne Legacy is a rehash of The Bourne Identity (and for the case, also of the two other films). For more high-level officials, political intrigue and governmental killers they added to the story, we basically have the clich√© "agent chased by his own government", who in some way has to ally himself to a cute woman in order to generate a certain romantic tension to work as an endorsement and motivation of the fights, chases and other action sequences. On the positive side, the element I liked the most in The Bourne Legacy is the presence of excellent actors bringing perfect performances in villain roles (Edward Norton, Donna Murphy, Albert Finney and the great Stacy Keach).In the leading role, Jeremy Renner is a competent replacement of Matt Damon, showing credibility and a good physical development during the action scenes. On the opposite, Rachel Weisz feels over the top and irritating in her role. However, the main complaint I have against The Bourne Legacy is Gilroy's direction, who took the bad decision of shooting almost everything using close-ups. In the case of the dialogue scenes, I suppose he wanted to register every dramatic detail in the actors' faces; but in the case of the fights and chases, the only thing he did was confusing us with fuzzy and undefined shots which bring a certain sensation of movement, but completely waste the choreography of the fights and the work of the stunts. I think that The Bourne Legacy needed a director with more practice in the action genre, such as Louis Leterrier or Simon West...after all, the screenplay is so simple that it didn't need a dramatic filmmaker, but just an efficient visual artist who knew how to use the camera in order to display the virtues of the film, and not only to hide its limitations.In conclusion, The Bourne Legacy is a mediocre film, but it didn't bore me, and I think that's enough to make it worthy of a slight recommendation. On the other hand, I think that the only purpose from this film was to exploit the fame of the "Bourne" name in order to get more money from us, something which kinda left me with a bitter taste. After all, if the franchise isn't profitable anymore for 20th Century Fox, they could continue the story without Renner in straight-to-DVD films with cheaper actors and less exotic locations. That might end up being the real Bourne legacy: a name which will keep earning money in one way or the other.
I frequently complain about comedies which neglect their screenplays because they trust the actors to afloat the story (two examples which come to my mind at this moments are R.V. and The Bounty Hunter).But I suppose that the simple law of probabilities gives that once in a while that bet can bear positive fruit, as the film Date Night shows us.Or maybe it was simply my admiration to Steve Carell and Tina Fey (and their respective TV programmes) what made me have a moderately entertaining time with what should have been a bad action comedy.Director Shawn Levy made some of my most hated movies from the previous decade (Just Married, The Pink Panther and Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian), and I dare to say that, without Carell and Fey, Date Night would have fallen on similar abysses of atrocity.As a proof of that, I can mention the multiple supporting roles, occupied by competent actors who cannot provoke even one smile.And when Kristen Wiig, Ari Graynor, Olivia Munn, Ray Liotta, Mark Wahlberg, James Franco and Mila Kunis cannot make us laugh, there is definitely something wrong with the screenplay.So, Carell and Fey carry the entire movie on their shoulders, and only their good chemistry and sparkling improvisation (as it is demonstrated on the "outtakes" from the end credits) rescue Date Night from being a bad movie.On the other hand, the apparatus action sequences, chases and obligatory scenes of public humiliations are the least entertaining things from the movie; but the personal conversations between Carell and Fey, their spontaneous reactions to the danger and their subtle gestures of surprise, admiration or anger were what made me smile during the poor development of the "mystery" which works as a framework of this typical romantic story in which two spaced people are required to re-evaluate to each other in order to discover the original attraction.The risk of basing this movie on the presence from Carell and Fey is that those who find them to be antipathetic will have a similar reaction to the movie (something which is possible, in sight of the moderated-low rating of their respective TV comedies).But as a big fan of 30 Rock and The Office, I moderately enjoyed Date Night despite its many fails.So, in summary, Date Night is a bad comedy which became into tolerable and moderately entertaining thanks to the two main actors.
The piracy which is so scary to the film studios is unavoidable to some point; but one of the factors which could reduce it is globally synchronizing the movie releases, not only in cinemas (the duplication and transfer costs would be prohibitive to small productions), but also in mediums of digital distribution, in order to have the biggest possible scope and bring everybody the opportunity to watch movies legally, in the device which is the most practical to the people, and paying a reasonable price, without having to wait months or years until the slow traditional process takes it to every country and city. As we have already seen, those delays stimulate the "black market" which simply tries to satisfy the people's wishes. How many times have we seen small vintages of DVDs with movies which haven't been released in cinemas in the streets? Independently of the legality of what they are doing, the "pirates" have the necessary agility and technology in order to fill in the holes left open by the studios due to their lack of vision and interest.What does all that have to do with the film Margin Call? For better or for worse, this movie decided to join the small but growing guild of movies which got released in North American cinemas at the same time they were released on Video On Demand and other digital platforms, having let its potential audience the flexibility of watching it on their TV, computer or even on portable mediums. I truly hope this strategy to be successful in the future, in order to be spread around the rest of the countries...but I suppose that the people will have the last word. The only thing I can assure is that Margin Call is an excellent film, highly recommended to be watched in any way you want to.Even though it's quite easy to identify the villains from Margin Call, the screenplay shows us that the guilty ones of the economical collapse from 2008 weren't only the most powerful people in the business, but also a global financial system based on fantasies and sustained by the complicity of all those of us who accept to jump on the bandwagon. So, even though it was very interesting to me to follow the internals of the high financial spheres in which our future is dictated, I think that the biggest value of Margin Call is metaphorical, because in every one of its characters, we can find parallels to the behaviour we saw in diverse governmental and private institutions which were involved in the scandal. And the saddest thing of all is that, either it's on a "micro" or "macro" level, the individual survival instinct seems to take precedence over the common welfare.I now have to mention the excellent performances from Kevin Spacey, Simon Baker, Zachary Quinto, Penn Badgley, Demi Moore, Jeremy Irons, Stanley Tucci and Paul Bettany, who all bring a real and sincere humanity to their characters. J.C. Chandor's direction brings an agile rhythm to the film, but without rushing the scenes. The only complaint I have against Margin Call is that a few financial concepts aren't explained on a completely clear to way to those of us who aren't familiarized with economical subjects. For the rest, Margin Call is a fascinating movie which I consider worthy of applause.
The Blind Side tells us an inspiring story in the kindest way, which endorsed by competent performances and good intentions, ends up bringing us a nice, conciliator and very entertaining time.The first thing I appreciated on The Blind Side is the absence of sermons and cheap sentimentality, something which avoids the movie to become into a lachrymose melodrama.Besides, the message from the movie is shown on a natural way, because it is filtered into the sober narrative.The Blind Side does not pretend to plunge us into the sordid reality of the North American social system, and it even finds moments of humor into the racist comments from some hateful characters.The main attraction for many people before watching the movie will undoubtedly be the acclaimed performance from Sandra Bullock, which made her win an Oscar.Did she really deserve it? I tend to think she did not, but I definitely enjoyed her work.In a big degree, Bullock repeats her classic routine of adorable mischievous, but on this occasion, she seasons it with a subtle intensity which brings weight and honesty to her character.I truly think this is one of the best performances from her career, and not only for the emotions she generates with her development, but also because she feels much more credible than the uncountable harebrained women she usually embodies in romantic comedies.The fails I found on this movie is that some funny moments feel a bit forced, and that it turns a bit artificial near the end.In summary, I think I can recommend The Blind Side with confidence, because it is a movie which fulfills with its intentions of inspiring, entertaining and even bringing us a slight lesson of humanity in order to appreciate everything we have a little more.
My expectations for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince were very low,not only because I am not a fan of the previous films,but also because I felt the book which inspired it to be horribly tedious and inflated,with chapter after chapter of hollow tragedy,improvised characters and weak "mysteries" which did not add too much to the story.Howevery,I finished taking a very nice surprise with this film.By my humble point of view,this is the best movie of the Harry Potter series,and screenwriter Steve Kloves could distillate a boring book on a dynamic and very entertaining screenplay which combines action,drama and character development very well.I had not been very satisfied with the work of director David Yates on the previous movie (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix) because he did not seem to be very interested on the material,so the film had felt very cold and lacking of any passion.Besides,his direction had not felt natural.However,I found his direction on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to be very superior,because he takes us very naturally from scene to scene,at the same time he shows much more passion and enthusiasm in here.My favorite element from the previous Harry Potter movies had been the presence of remarkable British actors,and this movie was not the exception.We unfortunately do not have Emma Thompson and Brendan Gleeson here,but those absences are compensated by the addition of the great Jim Broadbent,thanks to his very sympathetic performance.Michael Gambon is very competent as Albus Dumbledore.Alan Rickman has a short but juicy appearance and Maggie Smith has the opportunity of showing all her talent with a few intense dialogs.The young actors have improved with every new movie,and although I keep feeling Emma Watson is the weakest member from the main trio,she shows enthusiasm.However,the member of the young cast who mostly surprised me was Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy.His appearance is very short (I do not think it exceeds five minutes),but he perfectly shows the deepness from his character.I also liked the way in which the romantic aspect is treated,because it is shown on a subtle way.The special effects are brilliant,although this time we have less creatures and battles.Many people may feel disappointed by that,but I really appreciated,because the emphasis is more on the characters than on dragons,mermaids or little people.I found some fails on this movie.For one side,we have some superficial elements (like for example,a magic encounter with Dumbledore on the first minutes of the film or the Quidditch game).And we also have a few moments which could have been deleted because,although they are not boring,they do not add too much to the story.But,in spite of that,I liked Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince pretty much.I do not think it is a great film,but it kept me very entertained all the time.I think this movie deserves to be recommended with confidence.
I originally met the character Solomon Kane in the comics published by Marvel (and then Dark Horse); until after, I found out that it was in fact a literary creation from the legendary Robert E. Howard (1906-1936), who was also the creator of Conan the Barbarian and the father of modern heroic fantasy.But even with that illustrious origin, I never found the character to be particularly attractive.So, I went to see the film Solomon Kane with a bit of distrust, exacerbated by the bad omen that the movie was kept "in the shelves" for a few years before receiving a poor distribution around the world.To my surprise, Solomon Kane ended up being a very entertaining film with very good action scenes and a well written screenplay which constructed the main character on a quite interesting way.Director Michael J. Bassett has only two other movies in his filmography (the modest but excellent war horror film Deathwatch; and Wilderness, which I have not seen), and the idea of putting him in front of an ambitious multi-national co-production may sounded risky, but the truth is that he made a very solid work in Solomon Kane, because he could create good action scenes and an excellent atmosphere.As for the screenplay (which was written by Bassett), I appreciated the fact that it did not try to "modernize" the story; it would have been easier (and more economic) to move the story to modern times, but if the film had done that, it would have lost the heroic "taste" from the main character, as well as the historical content from Howard's tales, and his almost academic examination of the social contrasts during the puritan period in England.However, I cannot deny that the classic conflict between God and Satan, along with the many Christian references, could be interpreted as simple religious propaganda nowadays.It may have been an applauded style in Howard's time, but nowadays, it takes the risk of feeling outdated.Even though I enjoyed Solomon Kane pretty much, I found an important problem in it: its main actor.James Purefoy lacks of that magnetic presence which distinguishes the most memorable heroes from the big screen, at the same time his performance feels a bit bland the whole time.Besides, his physical characterization reminded me of Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, a situation which is a bit unfortunate for inviting comparisons to a highly superior actor who brought a brilliant performance in a similar role.As for the supporting cast from Solomon Kane, we have solid performances from the excellent actors Pete Postlethwaite, Jason Flemyng and Max von Sydow.Despite my objections about Purefoy's performance in the leading role, I found Solomon Kane to be a very competent adventure film, which is visually attractive at the same time it tells an interesting story.I took a nice surprise with this film.
I didn't know what to exactly expect from 3 Days to Kill, a film produced by Luc Besson and directed by McG. Both filmmakers once made audacious and innovative action films, but as the years went by, they seemed to have lost their "magical touch". Would 3 Days to Kill be a continuation of that tendency, or would it be a perfect combination of talents which would take them back to the top? I'm afraid that the answer ended up being the former. The "retired man (cop, thief, spy, plumber, etc.) who has to come back for one last job" premise is well known, and it can bring good results when it's properly handled. And the addition of family melodrama can be employed to humanize the hero. The screenplay from 3 Days to Kill employed all those elements, but they are so badly implemented that they end up hindering with each other instead of complementing. The spy intrigue is developed with an unbearable slowness and isn't interesting at all. The main character's relationship with his daughter seems taken from a bad sitcom, and it can never evoke credible emotions, not to mention that the girl is so whimsical and antipathetic that she doesn't inspire too many wishes in us to see her reconciled with her father. On the positive side, Kevin Costner brings a solid performance and shows a competent physical development during the action scenes. Despite him, 3 Days to Kill is a horrible action film, and a total waste of time. I know that many people hated the frantic style McG used to employ (I personally liked it), but it would have brought some life to 3 Days to Kill, avoiding it from being a pathetic collection of clich√©s, completely anonymous and without any energy.
Although I liked the film REC very much, I had distrust in the making of a sequel, because I did not feel the necessity to continue a story which had felt pretty complete on the first part.Besides, the ambiguous ending from the original movie had been enough mysterious and satisfactory not to require any more explanations.I guess that the only reason REC 2 was made was because of its economical potential.So, I have to admit I had very low expectations before watching REC 2...and unfortunately, the movie resulted to be worse than I expected.I hated REC 2 because I found it to be forced, weak and very boring.The characters shout a lot but say very little and the poor personalities from them are absolutely generic.The worst characters are a group of irritating young people, and their incorporation to the story only provokes even more intolerable shouts and hysteria.But the worst element from this crappy film is a horrible decision co-screenwriters Jaume Balaguer√≥, Paco Plaza and Manu Diez (the first two ones were also the directors) made: the unexplainable addition of an element which had not been present on the original film, and which completely changes the perspective from the story.I will not reveal what that element is in order not to say spoilers, but I think that was a huge mistake which clashes with what had been established on REC.On the one hand, I understand that Balaguer√≥, Plaza and Diez did not want to repeat the same story; but on the other hand, I cannot believe that was the only way to do that.So, in summary, REC 2 is an awful horror film which does not get even 1% of the quality and impact from the original movie.The suspense is inexistent, the screenplay is terribly boring and the characters are irritating, so I suggest you not to see REC 2 by any means.
Foremost, I have to say that the film The Equalizer has practically nothing to do with the TV series on which it was supposedly based. Leaving that aside, I found this movie entertaining, but a bit predictable and not completely satisfactory. I liked the TV series The Equalizer very much, because it was a refreshing anomaly in the cultural setting of the '80s. The great Edward Woodward played a mature and cerebral man, who was an obvious contrast with the frivolous TV heroes from that decade. Besides, The Equalizer seasoned the "case of the week" with a recurring mystery, exploring vigilante Robert McCall's enigmatic past. But well... that was during the '80s. Now, the only things the film The Equalizer has in common with the TV series are its title and the main character's name; for the rest, it's an entertaining but kinda generic action film with a practically invincible main character who only connects with the spectator thanks to Denzel Washington's credible and charismatic performance. Marton Csokas also brings a good work as an efficient "cleaner". Chlo√´ Grace Moretz is completely wasted in her role; what she does is practically a cameo of 3 or 4 scenes. The best element from The Equalizer is Antoine Fuqua's precise and stylized direction, which brings the film fluency and a good rhythm; on the other hand, the screenplay includes too many clich√©s and forced coincidences (apparently, all of McCall's friends have problems with the same criminals; How convenient!). Ironically, Washington is 5 years older than Woodward was in 1985, the year in which the TV series started... however, he looks 15 years younger, something which eliminates the "old man facing impossible obstacles" angle. Nevertheless, some villains call Washington a "grandpa", even though he looks younger than some of them. Lesson: despite the actor being good, he's not always the appropriate one to play a certain character. And an excellent TV series rarely survives the transition to cinema when the elements which made it memorable are ignored. Nevertheless, I can give a moderate recommendation to The Equalizer as a competent but not very memorable action film.
Five talented robbers steal a bank with an incredible precision and aplomb. "Everybody to the ground!", "If you cooperate, nothing will happen to you!", "Three minutes, boss!". The policemen arrive and surround the building, but the thieves have a very "ingenious" (translation: infinitely absurd) plan of escape. We then meet the policeman who is following the track from the robbers. Naturally, he is a tough and rebel veteran...but his methods work! His personal life is a mess, he is getting divorced and he cannot spend enough time with his little daughter. And the only reason he is not an alcoholic is because the film is rated PG-13.As you may have already guessed, Takers is one of many ordinary and predictable "crime thrillers", which steals elements from various movies, but mainly from classic films from the genre such as Point Break, Heat and The Usual Suspects. Nevertheless, I cannot deny that Takers kept me moderately entertained despite its mediocrity.The main reason this movie did not bore me is because director John Luessenhop orchestrates well filmed action sequences with a frantic style but which never get confusing. On the negative side, we have the various fails from screenplay written by Luessenhop, Peter Allen, Gabriel Casseus and Avery Duff (Were four persons needed in order to copy the screenplays from Brooklyn's Finest, Armored, Pride and Glory, Miami Vice -the movie-, Dark Blue and The Italian Job -2003-?). The only things which seem original are a few scenes related to the "hits" from the thieves, but if we have not seen them before is because they are so ridiculous they produce some involuntary laughs. And even though the structure of the story is more or less well handled, the characters are living clich√©s (Was that the traitor? What a surprise! I would have never imagined it if I had never seen 100 movies with the same dialog of "one more job and we retire"!).I cannot believe Hayden Christensen is still getting work as an actor, because his work in every movie is simply horrible; Takers is not the exception. The rappers T.I. and Chris Brown do not bring good performances at all either. On the positive side from the cast, Matt Dillon and Jay Hern√°ndez have a good chemistry with each other as the tenacious policemen chasing the thieves, and on the other side of the law, I can say the same about Idris Elba...and Paul Walker. He might not be a great actor, but Walker improved very much in the most recent movies he has been involved in, and I think that he has finally overcome the "stiff ex-model without any personality" phase.In conclusion, I have to admit that despite its various fails, Takers kept me moderately entertained, mainly because of the action scenes and because of some moments of involuntary humor. In summary, Takers is predictable and unoriginal, but not boring, and that makes it worthy of a slight recommendation.
After the economical failure of the film Edge of Darkness and the scandals from his private life, it would seem that Mel Gibson's career as a Hollywood star has finished. Fortunately, there are still some people who remember the talent which distinguished him in previous decades; and now, thanks to director Jodie Foster, we have the opportunity to confirm that that talent keeps being untouchable, because even though I do not think that The Beaver will resurrect Gibson's career, it definitely shows that he keeps being an excellent actor with the ability of bringing complicated and realistic characters to life.In The Beaver, her third film as a director, Foster shows a good narrative sense and a sober style which perfectly complements the actors' work. I think that that was a very good achievement in a movie like this one, which requires us to believe the main character's mental fracture, and to accept the beaver as a real and well defined character. And that is where Gibson's extraordinary performance comes in. His work impressed me mostly during the first scenes which reveal the beaver's existence, because even though they have an humorous tone, Gibson's work adds a subtext of anguish and desperation which feels devastating. There are a few moments where the movie looses its delicate balance between humor and drama; in fact, the intense emotional climax briefly falls into the involuntary humor; but the movie immediately recovers from that fails because of the performances and the solid control that Foster (as a director) shows over the difficult material.There is a sub-plot which kinda feels like a filler, in which we see the personal and academic problems from the main character's son, who runs a business of writing school works for students who pay for them. That curious occupation puts him in contact with a young woman, with whom starts an unexpected romance. I ignore how relevant that parallel story is, but that did not bother me very much, because it feels honest, and Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence bring solid performances.In conclusion, Gibson shows his range once more in this movie, thanks to the instinctive comprehension of his character. And even though Foster also brings a very good performance in here, it was her work as director what impressed me the most from her, because she could find the exact tone to tell an unusual story. I honestly went to see The Beaver with neutral expectations, but I ended up enjoying this film pretty much, so I can recommend it.
Many people adore director David Fincher, but I'm not one of them. I generally like his films, but I don't consider myself an unconditional fan of his. Gone Girl, his most recent film, is a very good addition to his filmography, because besides of having a refined style and various solid performances, it tells us a cleverly twisted and perverse story, where there aren't good or bad people, but different levels of victims. However, I found the first hour from Gone Girl a bit generic... the "husband accused of homicide" subject is kinda trite, like taken from an episode from Law and Order. But then, the twist comes, and the movie comes to life, filling itself with energy which is kept until the ending. I had previously never swallowed Ben Affleck as an actor, but I have to admit that he brings a credible performance in Gone Girl, and he's well complemented by Carrie Coon, Tyler Perry and Kim Dickens. As for Rosamund Pike, who plays the missing wife in flashbacks, her performance is irregular; she feels excessively feigned in some scenes, but in other ones, she transmits devastating levels of melancholy and hopelessness. One of the elements I appreciated the most in Gone Girl is the tense music from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Or I might be saying "soundtrack", because more than "music", Reznor and Ross created "aural landscapes" with percussions, noises and electronic cadences which twitch the nerves and make us participants of the anguish and concern all the characters experiment on a higher or lower degree. In conclusion, even though the first hour feels a bit generic, Gone Girl quickly recovers itself in order to bring us an intense, satisfactory and very interesting thriller, which I consider worthy of a recommendation. Besides, from a personal point of view, Gone Girl became another subsection in the long list of reasons why I prefer to be single.
How many times will writer Neil Gaiman recycle Alice in Wonderland ? I have three examples of that : the graphic novel A Game of You, the screenplay of the movie MirrorMask, and the short novel Coraline.And,thinking it well,the graphic novels The Books of Magic (with a male main character) and Death: The High Cost of Living (investing the oneiric world with the real one) could also fit on that category.But well...I guess we can ignore those repetitions if we consider them the as "recurring subjects" from the author.If someone has won the right of rethinking Lewis Carroll's formula is undoubtedly Gaiman,whose perfect domination of fantasy and its perfect balance with the real world has brought us literary masterpieces like American Gods,Good Omens and The Sandman.I was thinking all that when I had finished watching the movie Coraline.This movie is not great but I could forget of any comparison with Alice in Wonderland because I had had a very good time with its simple but at the same time deep story,its emotive moments,its correct observations and with director Henry Selick's visual magic.I am very happy to see Selick finally getting recognition,after being unfairly ignored for his solid work in the film The Nightmare Before Christmas,which is considered for many people,as a director Tim Burton's work,when in fact,it was Selick's.Honestly,I think Coraline is superior to The Nightmare Before Christmas for the simple fact the original material is more ingenious and that,combined with Selick's bizarre sensibility,it gets an appropriate balance between eccentric humor and disturbing fantasy.Fortunately,that sensibility is not out of control in Coraline (at the difference of Monkeybone) because,at working with Gaiman's short story,Selick had to "domesticate" his bizarre imagination and use it as a tool for telling the story.The result is very entertaining and with some creepy moments.I have two complains against Coraline.For one sight,some elements feel a little bit forced and out of place while there are a few moments in which the movie looses the focus of story.However,in spite of that,Coraline is a very solid movie which is not great,but it is very entertaining and I like to see a Gaiman's work very well adapted,specially after the disappointing Stardust.I recommend this movie with confidence because I liked it pretty much.
Among the nominations to the Oscars we can find every year a few "small" movies which pepper the overrated farce from the Academy with an independent and artistic "taste", like to show that their distinguished and indubitable members do not only pay attention to Hollywood products, but also to humbler films which did not enjoy of too much promotion or wide distribution.This year, it was the turn of An Education (along with Precious), and even though I liked it pretty much, I found it to be a bit slight and insignificant.However, I cannot deny it is a good quality entertainment.Screenwriter Nick Hornby adapted the book An Education: A Memoir with a good combination of elegance and narrative frugality, letting the characters to shine because of their own (positive or negative) attributes, without complicating the story with the clich√©s from romantic cinema.In summary, the things that happen are justified by the characters' actions, and not by pre-established formulas.Anyway, the best element from An Education is definitely the performances, and even though Carey Mulligan is receiving deserved attention for her excellent performance, she is not the only member of the cast who is deserving of applause.To start with, we have Peter Sarsgaard, who can perfectly balance the moral ambiguity from his character without making him a villain or making us to excuse his mistakes.Alfred Molina finds the ideal tone for bringing realism to his character.Olivia Williams and Emma Thompson are perfect as two teachers who do not wanna see the potential from a good student wasted for the sake of the "apron".Even Rosamund Pike, an actress whose previous work I did not like, made an excellent work as a cynical and pragmatic adventurer.In summary, I do not consider An Education as an excellent film, but it is definitely a very competent one which deserves a recommendation because of its interesting characters, valid message, honest emotions and, specially, for its brilliant performances.
The Human Centipede (First Sequence) was one of those films which divided the audience; some ones denounced it as a disgusting and offensive film, while other ones acclaimed it...basically for the same reasons. I belong to the second group, because I admired the audacity of the premise and its execution, the fascinating villain (wonderfully played by Dieter Laser), and Tom Six's measured direction, which obeyed the old "less is more" maxim and refused to bathe us in blood, letting the sordid tone of the film to slowly filter through our neurons until leading to the most hidden basements of the brain, where the memory of the film has stayed to live forever. That's why I had high expectations before watching The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence), and why it was condemned by the media even before its release, due to the extreme descriptions from its screenplay. Unfortunately, the result ended up being the exact opposite of the first film: a lot of blood and images of an indescribable depravity...but very few dramatic substance and even less narrative deepness.The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) doesn't bring enough motivation to the villain (and let's not even talk about the victims), so the film immediately falls into a boring routine of blood, sadism and violence which is translated as indifference. And the ending isn't satisfactory nor logical; it pretends to simulate artistic intention, when in fact, it feels whimsical and incomplete. On the positive side, Laurence R. Harvey brings a credible performance, as a victim (of his pathetic life) and a victimizer (as a murderer of innocent people).Six is preparing the third movie of the saga, The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence), and I hope he redeems himself going back to the memorable intensity of the first film. Or he might be a "one-hit wonder" who will never make a good movie again. Anyway, going back to the point, The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) is a tedious sequel which made me feel like wasting my time, so it's needless to say that I don't recommend it.
As I have already mentioned on various comments,I am an aficionado of horror cinema; however,I usually do not like the movies from that genre which pretend to be "based on true events".To begin with,Hollywood is a horrible historian,and every proclamation of truth on any genre is,on the best cases,superficial and subject to the needs from marketing (or,luckily,to the need of the narrative).And second,I am absolutely skeptical about everything related to supernatural events.Because of all that,I was not very interested in watching The Haunting in Connecticut,not only because all the marketing from the studio Lionsgate insists on proclaiming it portrays true events which happened to a family in Connecticut during mid-80's,but also because I knew the story included references to the famous "seances" from late nineteenth century,which have been discredited everywhere trick and cheats from liars who wanted to take advantage of the curiosity or the pain of people who are interested in contacting "the other side".The result is that The Haunting of Connecticut is a mediocre horror film,but not because of any of the previously mentioned causes,but because it uses a lot of tiring clich√©s we have already seen too many times.The start from The Haunting in Connecticut is pretty promising,because it has a sober and subtle style which efficiently produces an atmosphere of sadness and paranoia.Besides,the first supernatural events work well.But,unfortunately,after that solid start,director Peter Cornwell looses the control,and he brings us irritating edition tricks,screech sound accents and hollow thrills which feel too bland...the sudden appearance of a horrible face on a window,or the mirror which reflects a sinister figure,or the typical tense music which is accompanied with the exploration of a dark room.The performances are a positive element from The Haunting in Connecticut and they clearly help to the movie.The members who specially stand out are Kyle Gallner and Virginia Madsen.So,the performances and the beginning from the movie are the things which make it worthy of a slight recommendation.However,I prefer by far the very interesting documentary A Haunting in Connecticut,which is more humble but much more satisfactory than this mediocre movie.
Director Lucky McKee achieved instantaneous fame in the horror cinema with the phenomenal film May, but that happened in 2002, and since then, his work had been sporadic and nowhere near the same level from May. The film The Woods offered good atmosphere and interesting characters, but some aspects from the screenplay weren't completely satisfactory. And the episode he made for Masters of Horror (titled Sick Girl) was amusing, but not very memorable. So, I was very interested in watching The Woman; in the best of the cases, it could confirm the big talent displayed by McKee in May; and if not, it could be the signal we needed in order to stop having high expectations with his work. Fortunately, what ended up happening was the former, because even though I didn't like The Woman as much as May, it definitely preserves McKee's eccentric vision and his elegant visual style, at the same time it has a screenplay which combines sordid subjects with a mature and unexpectedly artistic execution which expresses a potent feminist message behind the horror of the images.McKee co-wrote the screenplay of The Woman with Jack Ketchum, who also wrote the novel The Girl Next Door (taken to the cinema in 2007), whose subject was quite similar, even though it was sadder and more fatalist. I don't know whether the chained woman is a fetish subject to Ketchum, or if simply he and McKee wanted to present a different interpretation of the same plot, but anyway, The Woman works as a horror film and also as a moralist fable which isn't afraid of delighting itself into lowest human instincts in order to bring us a lesson which is difficult to forget. In fact, what makes The Woman much better than other "torture porn" films is that the "villian" isn't really bad. Don't misunderstand me...the hypocrite lawyer is certainly repulsive, cruel and lacking of any redeemable quality...however, he feels that the attitude he has with women is perfectly normal and comprehensible; he doesn't mistreat them for malice, but because it's his duty as a man; in other way, who else could help them telling them what they have to do, and how they should behave? I think that that mentality is genuinely terrifying, not only because it justifies his perverse impulses (at least in his own opinion), but because it is unfortunately more common than what we would imagine. In other words, it will be very uncommon to find Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger in real life...but this kind of "justified" misogyny could come from our neighbors, and we wouldn't even imagine that.But anyway...I will leave the social paranoia to experts in criminal psychology (or whatever it is). The point is that The Woman is a disturbing but never exploitative film, and even though the ending reaches levels of gore and intensity which fully make it a horror film, I think its biggest value comes from the realism of the family drama, the characters' mute reactions, and its denounce of a retrograde mentality which hasn't completely extinguished. McKee's direction displays a sober dominion of cinematographic language and a slow, but never boring, rhythm, which allows the gradual increment of suspense and tension until the cathartic conclusion, which is simultaneously audacious, graphic and with the slightest touch of black humor in order to lighten the horrors we witness a little bit. The only thing I can say against The Woman is that Carlee Baker's performance as a teacher feels excessively forced. But for the rest, I have to give an enthusiastic recommendation to The Woman, with the warning that it's not a film for every taste. This excellent film is exactly what I needed in order to keep having high expectations in McKee's future work; I just hope he won't make me wait another long period in order to impress me again.
From Paris with Love left me with the impression of a severely edited movie in order to omit explanations, reasoning and other "boring" parts from the plot, only leaving explosions, shootouts and clowning from the absolutely hateful "hero".I do not know if that is what really happened or if producer Luc Besson, instead of hiring a good screenwriter, simply gave director Pierre Morel a list of scenes, so that he could join them as he liked.Anyway, the result is one of the most tedious and irritating films I have seen this year so far.From Paris with Love is definitely a big step back for Morel, whose previous movies Banlieue 13 and Taken may not were great works of art, but they were very entertaining and with a lot of energy.On the contrary, From Paris with Love is authentically atrocious.To start with, the screenplay is satisfied with casually mentioning the magic words ("narcotrafic" and "terrorism"), hoping them to be enough to justify the shootouts, fights and other actions from the ridiculous main character.While I was dying of the boredom with this movie, I was thinking that Morel and screenwriter Adi Hasak tried to make a parody at the style of Shoot 'Em Up or Crank: High Voltage.However, the style, direction and tone from those movies left clear that their purpose was satirizing the hollow and over the top contemporary action cinema.Unfortunately, there is not a single trace of ingenuity in From Paris with Love, or elements which suggest a deeper intention than dizzy us with its frenetic camera work and over-choreographed scenes.And no, the "royale with cheese" reference is not enough to redeem such a piece of crap; it simply reminds us that John Travolta used to participate in really good films before wasting his "rebirth" on films like The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 (2009) or From Paris with Love.And as for Travolta's performance in here, he brings another forced and over the top work, but as a hero instead as a villain this time.However, I do not consider him to be the only guilty of the disaster From Paris with Love is.The biggest problems of this film come from the inexistent screenplay.There was potential in the typical concept of the fresh rookie being initiated by the experimented veteran, specially in the setting of worldwide espionage.But, instead of taking advantage of those interesting elements, From Paris with Love preferred to take the easy way which does not require any effort or intelligence.In summary, the screenplay from From Paris with Love makes the one of the horrible Transporter 3 to look like a Greek drama in comparison.So, I suggest you not to loose your time on this pathetic and unbearable movie, when there is a lot more of excitement and entertainment on any episode of 24 or Human Target.
I confess that I usually find the erotic thrillers to be tedious and pretty laughable.However, there is a more "artistic" category I would call as "psico-sexual drama"; into the category, I would include films such as Closer; Eyes Wide Shut; Lust, Caution; and Crash (1996).That division is merely subjective, but I think it obeys to the obvious difference in the filmmakers' intention; let's say that while the erotic thriller simply relies on a soap-opera screenplay of passion and intrigue in order to justify the nudity from the cast, the "psico-sexual drama" is more interested in the causes of that passion and the consequences the characters suffer when they are unable to rationally control it.The film Chloe dangerously gets near the most sordid extreme from the balance, but the excellent performances and Atom Egoyan's sober direction are what rescue it.The screenplay from Chloe is not very original, and the "surprise" revelation from the final minutes is predictable.However, the film is interesting, specially thanks to the intense work from the three main actors: the great Julianne Moore expresses the deepest emotions from her character with minimum effort and maximum impact; Liam Neeson also brings a credible and very detailed work; and Amanda Seyfried displays the big histrionic talent she could not show in crappy romantic films like Letters to Juliet and Dear John.And besides of the performances, Egoyan drives the movie at a good rhythm and he could bring a good atmosphere to it.And I think that his work, along with the perfect performances, make Chloe to be worthy of a recommendation, despite the various fails from the screenplay and the fact of not being highly memorable.I do not think this one is among Egoyan's best films (which are, from what I have seen from his filmography and my humble point of view, Ararat and The Sweet Hereafter), but I think it is an interesting addition to his career.
The Pink Panther 2 resulted to be very superior to its pathetic predecessor (I am of course talking about the remake from 2006,and not about the original version from 1963).I do not know if in this three years I have become more stupid and that because of that,this sequel kept me in general,moderately entertained and it made me laugh on a few occasions,although the final experience from this film is mediocre.Although the screenplay from this film is undoubtedly better than the one for the first movie,I found it arbitrary and weak.For example : the movie begins with the theft of a joy.So,Minister Dreyfus (John Cleese replacing Kevin Kline) decides to call a group of very competent policemen to investigate the theft and finding historical relics which have also disappeared.Who will be the leader of the group? Stupid Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin).Why? Because he is considered to be the best detective in the whole world.Why? Because the screenplay says so.At least,the movies in which the great Peter Sellers (1925-1980) starred as Clouseau used some ingenuity to justify the accidental success from the Inspector in spite of his stupidity.These new versions make us to believe the premise without a reason because they think that narrative discipline is not important when there are many comedic routines.Besides,when this movie shows the romantic problems from Clouseau,it becomes a little bit boring.Fortunately,those insipid moments are constantly interrupted for showing the eccentric comedic routines from Clouseau,which go from the absurd verbal to the hilarious slapstick which made me remember the best years from Martin in Saturday Night Live (like the gag of the wine bottles).I think Martin's talent made this movie seem a little better than what it really is.Besides the previously mentioned Cleese,on the supporting cast we have Jean Reno,Emily Mortimer,Alfred Molina,Andy Garc√≠a,Jeremy Irons,Lily Tomlin and Bollywood superstar Aishwarya Rai.These actors give some credibility to this movie.Harald Zwart's direction is competent because he offers some sequences of good rhythm and choreography.Zwart has on his filmography some comedies,like the childish fantasy Agent Cody Banks and the bizarre farce One Night At McCool's.They are not extraordinary films,but they have resulted entertaining and much better than the abysmal comedies the atrocious Shawn Levy,who "directed" the first part of The Pink Panther,made.The Pink Panther 2 is a mediocre comedy and,although it resulted much better than the first part,that is not saying too much,because that film had been pathetic.But,I cannot deny this movie kept moderately entertained almost all the time and that it made me laugh on a few occasions.I can give this movie a slight recommendation.
I would not say Ghost Town is a bad film...I only found it to be mediocre.However,I think I found this movie to be a little bit better than what it really is because of the presence from the excellent British comedian Ricky Gervais,who makes his debut as a leading actor in a North American film.The screenplay has various weak elements and the humor is very below the level we are accustomed to see from Gervais.But,his natural charisma and talent make his character to be more interesting,and I am filled with enthusiasm about the idea that this movie could be the starting point of a more notorious and successful facet on Gervais' career.However,being realistic,I doubt it will be like that.I do not want to start with a pretentious comparison between British and North American humor to explain why I doubt that Gervais will find something more than a small cult of aficionados outside his native England.But it is easy to suppose that Hollywood will try to dilute and adapt Gervais' style,like it has done with other very talented people (like Colin Firth or Hugh Grant) who do not naturally fit with the rigid parameters of a "stars' factory".As I said,Gervais is competent on his role from Ghost Town,although he is not at the same level of other performances from him.Greg Kinnear is rather anonymous on his role,at the same time T√©a Leoni does not seem to be very interested on her role either.With the exception of Gervais,my favourite performances come from Kristen Wiig and Aasif Mandvi.Combining ghosts with romance is a moderately popular formula,and Ghost Town is a rehash of the same themes and resolutions we have seen on movies like Just Like Heaven or Topper.I can give this film a slight recommendation because I cannot deny it kept me moderately entertained,but the overall experience is mediocre.
After the vulgar humor from the atrocious Meet the Fockers, director Jay Roach made a more "sophisticated" (translation: equally unfunny) comedy in the shape of Dinner for Schmucks, the remake of a French film I have not seen. Dinner for Schmucks offers the combination of Steve Carell and Paul Rudd, which sounds theoretically likable, but in the practice it does not work because of the pathetic screenplay they have to work with, which is full of forced scenes which try to be funny but are irritating in fact. In many aspects, Dinner for Schmucks reminded me of The Cable Guy, in which we had also seen two talented comedians (Jim Carrey and Matthew Broderick) trapped into unlikeable characters and very forced situations. The rest of the actors neither have substantial material to work with; the worst victims of that are Jemaine Clement, Lucy Punch and Zach Galifianakis.In conclusion, Dinner for Schmucks is a lousy "comedy", which literally never made me laugh; instead of that, it only provoked tedium and irritation on me. My best recommendation is for you not to make the same mistake as me, so do not waste your time and your money in this film torture.
As I mentioned on various commentaries, I am not very fond of the romantic comedies, but I have seen enough of them to notice that the main couple to be pleasant characters is absolutely essential (a perfect example would be Some Kind of Wonderful, from director Howard Deutch).I think the film My Best Friend's Girl (which was curiously also directed by Deutch) is innovative because since the main couple is totally antipathetic (I do not mention that as a negative point, because it is evident the screenplay's intention was to do so), we have a funny and entertaining romantic comedy which offers a different angle.I generally cannot stand the routines from comedian Dane Cook, but I cannot deny his performance on this film is perfect.I do not think too many actors would have been able to constantly say rude things with so much energy and conviction.However, that realism cannot be seen on the screenplay because it is absolutely irrational to see a woman attracted to an extremely rude guy.Besides, a few things on the screenplay feel exaggerated.But, the main question is: is My Best Friend's Girl a funny movie? It was in my case, although some jokes failed a little bit.I do not wanna suggest that some insults from the movie offended me...as a fan of Chris Rock, George Carlin (1937-2008) and Eddie Murphy, I think I can appreciate the use of vulgar language on a funny context.I just felt some of the jokes were not naturally introduced into the screenplay.In spite of its fails and if you are not easily offended, I recommend My Best Friend's Girl as an entertaining and funny film which at least offers something moderately innovative, and with the warning that the final experience is not very memorable.
Director William Friedkin made The Exorcist and The French Connection,two masterpieces which have left an undeniable influence in the history of cinema.But,the rest of Friedkin's filmography went pretty unnoticed.I usually like his work,although he has made some false moves on his career (like Cruising and Blue Chips).Bug,his most recent film,is a good step on his career but it has some fails which avoid it to be totally satisfactory.First,let's see the positive points.I liked the ambiguous and dark tone from the movie because that helps to the spectator to get into the movie.Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon bring solid and credible performances.But,as I mentioned,this film has some negative points.I found the screenplay did not make its characters to have a natural evolution,so some elements of character development feel very forced.Plus,the ending of the movie is predictable.I expected a more enigmatic and solid ending but it results bland and,as I said predictable.Still,I liked this movie.It's far away from the excellence and although it did not leave me totally satisfied,it was an interesting experience for me,so I recommend it with the warning that it may not be for everyone.
I found the film Rock of Ages an artificial and excessively homogenate product which employs the music and lyrics, but not the spirit, from the music it supposedly celebrates (the one from rock bands such as Poison and Journey). The final result is a dishonest, poorly structured and quite boring musical film.There isn't even a pinch of originality in Rock of Ages; its screenplay is a pastiche of clich√©s which have been being used since the "juvenile delinquents" cinema from the '50s; the inclusion of an homosexual romance might seem innovative to some people, but I found it a transparent trick in order to ingratiate with contemporary spectators, and I couldn't take it seriously. So, the movie will triumph or fail depending on its musical numbers, and the nostalgia feelings they will wake in the audience. Unfortunately, the Glee-style mash-ups and the covers of '80s rock songs feel out of place in the mouth of actors with reasonably good, but not always appropriate for the musical genre Rock of Ages pretended to deal with, voices. And what's that genre? The movie doesn't loose any opportunity to satirize the archetypes of "hair rock", but it erratically changes its path in order to bring us honeyed versions of Waiting for a Girl Like You, More than Words or similar ones when the romantic scenes require so.Most of the performances from Rock of Ages are good, because of the credibility and enthusiasm the actors bring to those roles. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand make a solid work in their roles, while Catherine Zeta-Jones brings an appropriately evil personality to her role and Tom Cruise finds a good balance between satire and tribute to those rock legends who seem to be living in another planet. However, my favorite performance was Paul Giamatti's. Unfortunately, Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta feel excessively bland in the leading roles. In conclusion, I didn't like Rock of Ages, and I can't recommend it. If you want to see an excellent film which makes an authentic tribute to rock and roll, I recommend you School of Rock, Phantom of the Paradise or Almost Famous.
I generally like the work from comedian Seth MacFarlane, even though I admit that his humorous style tends to be repetitive, and it's also based on an unstable combination of surrealism and vulgarity which only occasionally works (positive example: the film Ted; negative example: the animated TV series The Cleveland Show). His most recent film, A Million Ways to Die in the West, is on some intermediate point of his career, because even though if offers some funny scenes, many of the jokes fail, or are so obvious that they lose the invaluable "surprise element" which might have saved them under different circumstances. Needless to say that a big part of the humor lies on the satire of clich√©s from the western cinema; however, we have seen better implementations of "western humor" in other films and TV series, from Blazing Saddles to The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., without forgetting the animated short films with Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam. Fortunately, we have some solid performances in A Million Ways to Die in the West, and they are the main reason why this film managed to keep me moderately entertained despite its various fails. Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson and Neil Patrick Harris are completely credible in their roles, and they transmit their enthusiasm to the audience, almost excusing the laziness from the screenplay, which might have needed a better refinement before being taken to the big screen. That's the con of having a same person as director, producer, co-screenwriter and leading actor... it is said that too many cooks ruin the dish, but it's equally risky to have a single chef making all the decisions and selecting all the ingredients. In conclusion, A Million Ways to Die in the West is a mediocre comedy, but at least, it kept me moderately entertained and it made me laugh occasionally, so I consider it worthy of a slight recommendation. Nevertheless, I think this film should have gone further on every level (either if it was making the screenplay rawer and more realistic, or taking the route of bizarre absurdism); and I also have to say that MacFarlane's performance isn't very good; however, I imagine he didn't want to delegate the task of kissing Theron.
I do not know how I am going to express the various pros and few cons from Inception without revealing spoilers.But well...I will try my best in order not to ruin this very interesting film experience to those who have not seen it yet.To start with, I liked the performances from Inception very much.Leonardo DiCaprio faces his character with naturalness and conviction...in other words, he brings his character to life.The rest of the actors make the same achievement.They are Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the main character's right-handed man; Ellen Page as an "architect" of dream-like settings; Tom Hardy as a talented counterfeiter; Ken Watanabe as the impassive Saito; Cillian Murphy, who perfectly dominates what is, in my opinion, the most difficult character from the film; and the great Michael Caine, even though what he does is practically a cameo.As good as the cast is, the main pros (and cons) from Inception come from the screenplay, which is a work of an unusual complexity which makes the spectator to pay full attention, and even though it may seem obtuse and matted, it in fact has a very precise logical sequence, which is structured with an attention to every detail.Having said that, I have to mention the presence of holes and inconsistencies which, in my opinion, avoid the film from being excellent.The most important problem comes from the action scenes.Do not misunderstand me...they are exciting and thrilling by themselves.However, they introduce too many rules in the world of dreams, and they make the "squeak" in the gears from the narrative to be evident, at the same time they distract our attention and interrupt the flow from the story.In order not to give too many turns about that point (since I would necessarily have to reveal spoilers), I will only say that the chases, shootouts and explosions feel forced, and they tend to obstruct a well designed and fluid story.However, even though I did not find it to be excellent, I think Inception deserves a safe recommendation for all the previously mentioned positive elements, and also because of Christopher Nolan's perfect direction.It is not a perfect film experience, but it is worthy to see it mainly because of the screenplay, because it is entertaining at the same time it leaves the spectator thinking.
Independently from her histrionic talent,Keira Knightley has a very long collection of different characters on her career and although she became famous for her roles on period films (like the trilogy of Pirates of the Caribbean,Pride and Prejudice and the overrated Atonement),I think her best roles are on "modern" films,like her performance as a murderer in Domino and the young football player in Bend it Like Beckham.The Duchess belongs to one of her period films.I did not have too many expectations for this film because I expected another period film with encircled dresses,ostentatious wigs and tremulous declarations of love and hate for getting various nominations to the Academy Awards.I always find that films too forced and pretentious.But I was wrong.The Duchess resulted to be a very good film which is not forced or pretentious at all.The best element from this film is the solid cast,where the member who mostly stands out is Ralph Fiennes.Although his character is a villain,Fiennes brings to his character a humanity which does not make him the devil.Hayley Atwell also brings an excellent performance because her character is always credible.The brilliant Charlotte Rampling is also completely credible on her role.Knightley brings a good performance but she is a little bit darkened by the perfect development of the rest of the cast.The other elements from The Duchess are also very good.The screenplay has many layers and it is very well developed.Everything flows naturally in this movie and nothing seems forced.The fails I found on this movie are two.For one sight,there are some boring moments which add nothing to the story,so they could have easily been edited.Another fail is that,on that moments,the movie looses a little bit the focus of the story.In spite of that,The Duchess is a satisfactory and,with some exceptions,very entertaining movie which could keep me interested.It is not an excellent movie but it deserves a recommendation.
I think I have finally understood what director Federico Fellini tried to express so many years ago. La Grande Bellezza is something like a modernized (and unofficial) re-imagination of La Dolce Vita, but at the difference of that classic movie, I didn't find it an indulgent artistic whim, but an interesting reflection about life and its multiple emotional and philosophical tangents. In order to achieve that, the movie invites us to tour through an existential labyrinth full of colorful characters and provocative situations which don't aim to tell a defined story, but to plunge us into a miasma of ideas, which are sometimes contradictory, sometimes naif, but almost always interesting. And of course, the value of the film doesn't lie on a magic message at the ending which clears all our doubts, but on a baroque tour which inspires us to find our own answers at the same time of the idealized main character. On the visual aspect, La Grande Bellezza displays a solid direction and an amazing cinematography, taking the maximum advantage of the picturesque Roman locations, full of historical gravity and urban frivolity. The cast makes an excellent work in their roles; they were absolute strangers to me, but apparently, Toni Servillo, Sabrina Ferilli and Serena Grandi are authentic cultural icons in Italy, which surely adds a "meta" level to the film, and reinforces the weight of the performances for those who know these actors' careers. Anyway, I found their work perfect, simultaneously affected and credible, and with that casual air which distinguishes the European style of acting. On the negative side of La Grande Bellezza, the screenplay tends to ramble more than the necessary during the last third, and as a consequence, some moments feel a bit boring. Nevertheless, I mostly enjoyed this film pretty much, and I would recommend it, specially to those who like art-house cinema.
I have never been interested in sports, but I remember that I stayed hypnotized when I discovered the Roller Derby in some cable channel back in mid-80's.That "sport" consisted in ferocious female competitors skating, brutally beating to each other, and suffering apparatus falls (I never understood the rules of the Roller Derby).And the setting of that confrontation was a futurist oval track which seemed to have been copied from the excellent sci-fi film Rollerball (1975).Nevertheless, my interest in the Roller Derby quickly vanished, and I supposed it had disappeared from Earth.However, thanks to the film Whip It, I found out that the Roller Derby is still alive.And even though I liked this movie, I found out that the Roller Derby does not fascinate me as it did quarter a century ago.The use of the Roller Derby as part of the story from Whip It might seem innovative, but in fact, its screenplay basically consists on the typical formula of growth and overcoming which has been used in many movies.Fortunately, director Drew Barrymore could assemble a group of actresses whose natural friendliness and instincts for the humor darken the lack of originality from the screenplay to some point.Ellen Page is perfect in the leading role, adding sincerity and an acid sense of humor to a character who deceptively seems easy to interpret.As Page's character's mother, Marcia Gay Harden finds a credible balance between unconditional maternal love and strong will.And I also liked the performances from Kristen Wiig, as a counselor and confident from the main character; Juliette Lewis as an arch-rival; and specially Alia Shawkat as the main character's best friend.I am afraid that Shawkat is starting to show the first symptoms of the "Judy Greer Syndrome", which will condemn her career to supporting comic roles for lacking of the required "sex appeal" to win leading roles which could take her to the stardom, something she would really deserve due to her big talent.Whip It is not the kind of comedy which provokes constant laughs; instead of that, it creates an atmosphere of friendly humor impulsed by the characters' personalities and the unexpected contrasts between the normal difficulties they have to face and the surrealism from the sport they practice.As for the negative elements, I have to mention the forced romance the main character has with a generic beau; and the presence of scenes which make the movie longer than it should, and of weak pauses which obstruct the narrative flow.However, despite its fails and the fact that it is not very memorable, Whip It kept me entertained most of the time, and I think that is enough to make it worthy of a moderate recommendation.
It is true that the robotics offers fascinating possibilities for the future, helping the humanity in dangerous or disgusting home-works.But on many aspects, I think that the advances in telecommunications and informatics made the automated utopia scientists predicted during the 40's obsolete.I do not wanna say the the Internet has deleted the necessity of robots; I simply wanna say that, at being a more economic, simple and accessible technology, it altered the road of society, as well as the expectations for the future's new facilities.In other words, I think that with the shared virtual worlds, social networks and instantaneous digital entertainment, the impulse for returning to the world of screw and nuts, replacing the digital world for a mechanic one, seems incomprehensible to me.With all the previous paragraph, I wanna say that, although I found the film Surrogates to be moderately entertaining, I think the future it shows is absolutely improbable, because it shows the big majority of the population using advanced robots of an almost perfect appearance as mechanic avatars, who make all their ordinary activities, from the job to the pleasure, while the human "operators" rest on their homes, controlling their substitute robots from high-technology beds which keep them isolated and "safe" from the real world. Or, explained more simply, it is like if our characters from World of Warcraft (but with a suit and tie instead of an armor) went to the office in our place, while we control them from our homes.Surrogates has the good intention of warning us against the uncontrollable use of the technology on our interaction with other human beings.But, as I said, I did not find the premise to be credible, so the message definitely looses strength and relevance, leaving us another moderately entertaining but mediocre sci-fi film with a lot of special effects, chases, explosions...and a not very solid screenplay.However, there are some positive elements which make Surrogates worthy of a slight recommendation.On the one hand, director Jonathan Mostow shows a good instinct for showing well filmed and choreographed action scenes.And on the other hand, although Bruce Willis plays the character of a beaten cop again, I think nobody does it better than him, so it is pleasant to see him on the role.As I said, the main fail on this movie is the screenplay, because although it is not bad, it does not seem to have too much conviction on the story and the premise.However, as I said, I think this movie deserves a slight recommendation in spite of being a mediocre experience, because it did not bore me.
In The Wind Rises, his last film as a director (let's hope he retracts himself once more), filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki decided to make a semi-fictitious biography of Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of the famous combat airplane Zero, whose speed and maneuverability made it an almost impossible adversary for the allies in the Pacific front during World War II. It's a complicated and dangerous subject which runs the risk of getting into into political postures, but The Wind Rises wisely minimizes the war elements in order to focus on topics which have been present in many Miyazaki's films: the simple pleasure of flying and the freedom which represents defying gravity and sliding through the clouds, whether it's on a broom (like in Kiki's Delivery Service) or with different experimental airplanes, like in The Wind Rises. Inspired since he was a kid by the feats from aviator Giovanni Caproni, Hirokoshi dreamt with flying airplanes, but his marked myopia couldn't allow him to do that. So, he decided to learn to design them, and during his university studies, he showed such a talent that he was quickly recruited by the setter Mitsubishi, where Hirokoshi found big triumphs and resounding failures, but always with the objective of the pure flight... even though his creations were used in less humanitarian circumstances. The Wind Rises includes some fantasy sequences, mainly focused on Hirokashi's dreams and "visions", where he imagines conversations with Caproni; leaving that aside, I think this is Miyazaki's most sober and realistic film. However, that didn't avoid him from delighting us with his habitual visual richness, the fluid hand-made animation (well, with a few digital incursions when the circumstances require so), and an amazing production design where even the most trivial details of daily life acquire an unexpected beauty. I would also like to mention the delicate handling of the political tensions during World War II. The alliance between Japan and Germany is portrayed like a necessary evil, implemented more for practical than ideological reasons. The scenes in which Hirokashi visits Germany in order to share secrets with European colleagues reflect a melancholy we can interpret as a regret for the mistakes of the past. It was fascinating to see that moral disjunctive depicted. But, well, as I said before, The War Rises isn't a war film, but a pseudo- biography which doesn't adhere to the facts, but to the dreams; to the ideals of flying and constructing effective aerodynamic systems which get us a little bit close to the birds' casual and instinctive ability. In conclusion, I liked The Wind Rises very much, and even though I wouldn't consider it my favorite Miyazaki's film (that one keeps being Princess Mononoke), it's definitely his most mature and personal work. If this truly ends up being his last movie, it would be an excellent way to close his filmography, and a clear testimony that traditional animation keeps being as vital and expressive as always. But, beyond the technique, Miyazaki reminds us of the importance of aspiring to an ideal; and I think his filmography has been a definite proof of it.
I vaguely remember having heard Louis Zamperini's name regarding his Olympic fame, but I completely ignored his story as an allied bomber during World War II. His devastating experiences in combat and after having been shot down are certainly inspiring, and they undoubtedly deserved a film... but I think that the film Unbroken couldn't make justice to that story, because despite its solid manufacture, it isn't able to evoke an emotional answer on the audience. Besides, allowing myself some cynicism, Unbroken seems to have been designed to win Oscars, and that erodes the honesty of the film, which already feels cold and distant, even more... exactly the opposite of what we would expect in a film about "the triumph of human spirit". On the one hand, the absence of sentimentality and narrative frivolity denotes a considerable respect for the hardships suffered by the characters; but on the other hand, such lack of empathy ends up making the film a historical pamphlet which is informative and well produced... but hollow and forgettable. The performances are also a factor in that sensation of coldness. Jack O'Connell, Domhnall Gleeson and Garrett Hedlund don't feel credible in their roles, and they can never transmit the psychological havoc of their characters' situation, or the internal struggle they had to go through. In conclusion, I appreciated the didactic intention of Unbroken, as well as its polished manufacture. This film didn't bore me, but it feels more like an impersonal History lesson than as an endearing and human tale. I can give a slight recommendation to Unbroken, even though I feel that having spent half an hour in Wikipedia reading about this story would have provoked the same effect on me.
I now know that the book Gulliver's Travels, written by Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) in 1726, is a sharp social and political critic against the contradictory customs from British government, but when I read it as a kid, I simply found it to be an entertaining fantasy story with imaginative situations and interesting adventures. Unfortunately, the recent film version of Gulliver's Travels is very boring, and not even the presence of Jack Black (whose style of comedy I usually enjoy), could save it from its absolute mediocrity.The screenplay from Gulliver's Travels is mainly a collection of unfunny jokes based on the contrast between the main character and his "hosts", not only in regard of his huge size, but also in his condition of "fish outside the water". Oh, and everything gets worse when we lead to the terribly ridiculous ending.On the positive side, I have to mention that I liked the special effects. However, that was not enough to compensate the boredom this generic and insipid movie provoked on me, so in conclusion, I do not feel like I can recommend it.
What the hell happened to Sex and the City? Between 1998 and 2004, this series obtained the recognition of the audience and the critic thanks to its intelligent humor and appropriate observations about modern relationships, urban life and the contrasts of the "feminism".What is more, its success changed the television's face, because it showed that the cable channels were not only useful to watch movies and "softcore", but that they could also compete with the big TV chains, without submitting to the censorship and the advertisers' whims.Because of all that, it was a huge disappointment to watch Sex and the City 2; I did not like the first film either, but at least it had kept the four main characters' geniality; however, this sequel becomes them into repulsive caricatures who completely lack of any charm and humanity.I repeat...what went wrong in here? In Sex and the City 2, the problems from the four main characters are common in the setting of the "chick flicks", but they were not examined with the humor, sobriety and maturity from the series, and as a consequence, it does not show us how every one of them surpasses their difficulties according to their particular personality.I am not asking for something as deep as Hannah and Her Sisters or as funny as Bridget Jones' Diary; I just wanted to see a narrative level which would be more consistent with the TV programme so many people admired.Unfortunately, director and screenwriter Michael Patrick King decided to exclusively focus on the style, the dresses, the decorations, the shoes...nd in my humble opinion, that did not work either.I am not an expert on fashion, but the clothes, jewelry and general design are so excessive that they provoked nausea on me.A theory which is crossing my mind is that King (who also worked for a couple of years as a director of the TV series) intensely hates the four main actresses, and that Sex and the City 2 was his delicious revenge, because as a final result, he could absolutely destroy the characters that Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon developed for a long time.With that exaggeration, I want to express the size of this pathetic failure.In summary, avoid Sex and the City 2 as a plague, because watching this movie for almost 2 and a half hours was an absolute torture for me, not to mention that it also provoked me pain in the eyes.I cannot believe how something as atrocious as this received the "green-light" in Hollywood.
Many people thought it was an impossible dream, but after a very successful campaign in Kickstarter (to which I obviously contributed), the cult series Veronica Mars resurrects in the shape of this homonym film, continuing the adventures of the female detective and of the citizens of Neptune; and of course, we also have Keith Mars, Veronica's stoic and reasonable father, who would prefer to see her working as a lawyer in New York, instead of returning to the sordid scandals of a treacherous town. The best thing about this movie is that it's very similar to the TV series. And the worst thing is that it's very similar to the TV series. Director Rob Thomas preserved the tone, atmosphere and rhythm of the programme, so Veronica Mars truly feels like a natural evolution of the franchise, and even though it had been absent since 2007, it didn't show any difficulty in retaking its style. On the other hand, this movie feels like a long episode, and not like a genuine film adaptation. Besides, that inflexible compromise with the original continuity will avoid this film from being attractive or accessible to new spectators, something which will considerably damage its economic potential. But anyway, I think this movie works pretty well as a re-introduction to this universe, and it sets firm bases for future adventures. If they get made in the shape of more movies (or a new TV series), books (the novel Veronica Mars: The Ten Thousand Dollar Tan Line, co-written by Thomas, will get published on March 25th), or even comics (as it had originally been planned), it's still to be seen... what is important is that Veronica Mars returned, and I'm planning to enjoy it while it lasts. If only Freakylinks could get the same treatment...
The adolescence represents the initiation rite for the adult life, and as a consequence, the characters in that age range have been employed all kind of juvenile films. Something less common are the stories about pre-teens, because that difficult period does not seem appropriate to be commercially exploited with romances or scatological humor. The film Diary of a Wimpy Kid offers a view to that world, and even though I was not very interested in watching it, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, I ended up finding it boring and bland.It is needless to say that I have not read (nor will I) the books on which this movie is inspired, so I cannot judge its fidelity to the original source; and it is also needless to say that I am many decades older than the spectators for which this movie was designed. However, I do not think that is an excuse for such a tedious and unfunny movie. On some way, Diary of a Wimpy Kid reminded me of the old TV series Clarissa Explains It All, which also employed "gimmicks" like drawings, animated graphics and chats to camera in order to illustrate the challenges and advantages of being a pre-teen. 20 years ago, that format seemed fresh and irreverent, but it nowadays feels like one of many tools which are excessively used by the marketers and producers in order to wash the brain form the young consumers and develop their future corporative loyalty. Zachary Gordon and Robert Capron feel too insipid in the leading roles. On the opposite, the supporting cast offers competent performances from Chloe Moretz (unforggetable since her extraordinary performance in Kick-Ass) and Devon Bostick.However, I don't feel like recommending Diary of a Wimpy Kid, mainly because it bored me and it did not make me laugh at all.
It seems difficult to conceive it nowadays, but the train was for many decades the absolute king of the terrestrial transport, and that importance had an echo on the popular culture, where we find all kinds of stories set on board of these vehicles.The cinema has created a sub-genus called "mystery on a train", with classic films like The Lady Vanishes or Murder on the Orient Express.Eventually, the efficiency of the train as a massive transport declined, and similarly, its appearance on cinema became more sporadic.But that did not avoid director Brad Anderson from making a tribute to that semi-extinct sub-genus on the interesting, but not completely satisfactory film, Transsiberian.During his short but interesting filmography, Anderson showed an inclination for stories which present complex and detailed characters with an uncertain morality and nebulous motivation.That quality works to "fill in the holes" of the deceptively simple stories from his movies.For example, in Session 9, an ordinary maintenance work becomes into an examination of madness and obsession with some supernatural touches, while in The Machinist, we observe the havocs of guilt in the sub-conscience of a normal man rounded by extraordinary situations.Now, in Transsiberian, we have a chain of coincidences, crimes and bad decisions which puts two innocent people on a difficult situation where the internal conflicts are as tense and dangerous as the external ones.And even though I have many reservations on the first half from the movie, the second half is pretty good.Oh, but that first half...I think Anderson's excessive zeal became on indiscipline and auto-indulgence.To start with, the establishment of the story is excessively slow, and the mystery is too shallow.Yes, after a while, the film takes an unexpected route, but it takes so long to find its own rhythm that I got a bit bored.Fortunately, as I said, the movie gets much better on the second half, because it gets tense and Anderson finally finds a good rhythm to tell the story.And we also have the excellent performances from Ben Kingsley and Emily Mortimer, who are electric and absolutely credible on every scene they appear.Woody Harrelson also brings a solid performance, but he gets a bit darkened by Kingsley and Mortimer.However, I did not like the performances from Eduardo Noriega and Kate Mara very much, because they lack of intensity and passion on their performances.I think Transsiberian is Anderson's least achieved movie to the moment, but that does not mean it is bad by any means.On the contrary, even though it did not leave me totally satisfied, I think it is a solid thriller, and I recommend it, because it kept me entertained in general.
On many aspects,Deception is like many crappy generic erotic thrillers made for TV.I think that the element which makes Deception marginally better than those rubbish films is the presence of two brilliant actors...who are unfortunately wasted by the boring and painfully predictable screenplay.In other words,Deception is a very bad thriller.I think the worst point from it is the screenplay,which results too basic and predictable.If you do not figure out the twists from this movie,you have never seen a thriller.Plus,this is one of that movies which make the characters to act stupidly for making the story to advance.So,the spectators only have a collection of obvious twists and boring scenes.This film has so many (predictable) twists on its desperate effort of amazing us with its (non-existant) ingenuity.The only saving grace from this movie is the performances from Ewan McGregor and Hugh Jackman,who show enormous charisma on their characters.All the time,I wished to see this two talented actors on a better film than this crappy erotic thriller.The female cast (composed by Michelle Williams,Natasha Henstridge,Maggie Q and Charlotte Rampling) does not have much to do.Lisa Gay Hamilton did not convince me at all on her character.Deception is a very crappy film which commits the fatal mistake of being boring.In summary,this movie is a waste of time and I suggest you to do something more interesting than watching this boring and predictable thriller.
When a movie portrays a very regional culture, it runs the risk of confusing to a percentage from its spectators, because not all of them will recognize the references and atmosphere employed in them (for example, that happened to me with the film A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, which reproduces the life into a specific neighborhood from New York during the '70s). Winter's Bone could have fallen into a similar case, because it is set into the remote regions from the Ozark mountains, in the middle east from the United States, whose inhabitants are famous for their brusque and minimalist social dynamic, their isolation and their insular economy. However, the fascinating story, unique characters and extraordinary performances from Winter's Bone make it to transcend its regionalism in order to become it into an excellent drama.The inhabitants from the Ozark mountains have been employed in some horror films as ruthless and ignorant villains, ready to kill (or even devour) to the "invaders". Winter's Bone is not a horror movie, but an intense family drama, and therefore, its focus is much more realistic and sober. One of its main attributes is not laughing at or underrating the contradictory attitudes which are revealed during the main character's investigation. Speaking of which, Jennifer Lawrence brings a magnificent performance in the leading role, because her very expressive face is able to express a lot of deep emotions without the need of words. The rest of the cast also brings remarkable works, since they all feel absolutely credible in their roles.In conclusion, Winter's Bone deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation because of its performances; Debra Granik's direction, which seems deceptively simple at first sight, but which in fact, shows a very meticulous attention to every detail; and also because the screenplay is very well written. There are a few minor fails in Winter's Bone, but that does not avoid it from being an exceptional movie which is absolutely worthy of the acclamation it received.
The fact that Disney, an eminently kid-friendly company, decided to take to the big screen the adventures of John Carter (created in mid-20th century by author Edgar Rice Burroughs) seemed strange, because those tales were charged of brutal violence, female seduction and racial concepts which could seem politically incorrect, nothing of which is compatible with Disney's traditional values. But anyway...even though Burrough's testosterone prose was quite diluted, the film John Carter made an effort to keep the character's spirit, and it also offers us some magnificent special effects and a solid production design. Unfortunately, the screenplay makes too many turns, and it feels too dispersed in order to be genuinely satisfactory.To be honest, I read Princess of Mars many years ago; and I haven't read the rest of the books, so I'm not sure whether John Carter incorporates elements of the other books, or if it was a free creation from co-screenwriters Andrew Stanton (who was also the director), Michael Chabon and Mark Andrews. But whatever the origin of the screenplay is, it is so saturated of characters, cultural factions, romance and action that it's difficult to keep the interest whenever there isn't time for completely swallowing the confusing mythology of "Barsoom" (the name brought to Mars by the natives), the weak political intrigue (which tries to get complicated with the help of cosmic conspirators) and the romance between Carter and the Princess of Mars (no, she obviously isn't naked the whole time in here, at the difference of the way in which she was described by the dirty old man Burroughs). Everything in this film happens very fast; there isn't any time in order to establish the relationships between the characters nor to contemplate their development. Carter's allies lack of a concrete motivation, and the villains are bad because the screenplay says so. In other words, John Carter includes enough material for two or three movies; but when all that is compressed to 132 minutes, the result is a film which tries to be too many things, without being very satisfactory in any level.However, not everything is negative. As I previously said, John Carter is a visually impressive film, and it successfully solves some impossible concepts which appear on the book (such as the eight-legged "horses"). Maybe Mars could have been more red and not be so similar to the North American desert, but anyway...at least the creatures and vehicles (which have some "steampunk" taste) compensate the frankly terrestrial settings. What doesn't work are the scenes in which Carter makes huge jumps; and I'm not only talking about the atrocious "wire work", but also about the fact that they seem immune to the influence of the mass, gravity and inertia. I'm not saying this because I was looking for scientific realism, but because those scenes feel horribly fake. As for the cast, Taylor Kitsch (who had already left me a bad impression with his atrocious performance in X-Men Origins: Wolverine) lacks of any credibility, charisma or presence in the leading role. The same can be said about Mark Strong, who plays the main villain with such a reluctance that I found his character completely exchangeable with any of his minions. On the other hand, Lynn Collins brings energy and conviction as the Princess. As for the digital characters, we have an adequate voice work from Samantha Morton, Willem Dafoe and Thomas Haden Church.In conclusion, John Carter managed to keep me moderately entertained despite its various fails, and I never found it boring, so I think that that is enough to consider it worthy of a slight recommendation. However, that doesn't avoid it from being a mediocre and not very satisfactory film.
The great screenwriter Charlie Kaufman surprised everyone with the ingenious movies Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (let's forget about Human Nature for a moment).By chance or by destiny, they were made by directors whose unique vision complemented Kaufman's exotic sensibility.What result do we have in Synecdoche, New York, in which Kaufman had absolute control on the material, since he did not only write it but also directed it? The answer: interesting, but pretentious and not completely satisfactory.Synecdoche, New York is definitely not an accessible movie.However, the brilliant performances made me to be interested in the movie, and they made the assimilation of the digressions and changes of perspective from the complex story easier for me.I guess that the actors in Hollywood do not receive roles like the ones from this movie too often, something which might explain the ensemble of excellent actors Kaufman recruited, composed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Tom Noonan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Dianne Wiest, Samantha Morton, Michelle Williams, Hope Davis and Emily Watson.I also liked Kaufman's precise direction.However, his work as a screenwriter was not at the same level.I will explain myself.I do not know whether Synecdoche, New York is one of those pretentious and indulgent movies which analyze the mature age on their dysfunctional characters...or if it is a parody of those pretentious and indulgent whims.The point is that is that I could not realize what Kaufman was trying to say.It may sound weird, but I found Synecdoche, New York to be simultaneously interesting, hollow, deep, pretentious and occasionally boring.I liked the experience in general, but I think that with less pretension and more focus, Kaufman would have gotten a better result with this film.I do not know if I can recommend it to everyone, specially to the casual spectator, because this is not a precisely easy movie.
Director Timur Bekmambetov became famous with the brilliant Russian film Night Watch, which amazed many people (including me) with a high-quality manufacture, interesting characters and a complex mythology which had enough material for various sequels. The first of those ones was Day Watch, which in my humble opinion, was even more superior to the first movie. However, Bekmambetov didn't continue with that saga, because he decided to try luck in Hollywood, where his first movie was the tedious Wanted. And even though Bekmambetov keeps occasionally working in Russia, he returned to Hollywood in order to make Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, which is unfortunately a boring and totally insipid film.The concept from Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is intentionally absurd, and it could have worked well as the basis of an action comedy; unfortunately, this film takes everything so seriously that it constantly stumbles in its effort harmoniously reconcile the historical aspects (the Civil War, the abolition of slavery) with the vampires subject. Even worse, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is developed with quite a laziness, without any energy or any excitement during the action scenes.Another big problem from Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is Benjamin Walker's poor work in the leading role, because he shows a total lack of credibility and charisma in his character. Yes, I admit he has a certain physical resemblance to the authentic Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) when he carries that classic beard and the famous "chimney" hat; but his performance is so weak that I could never swallow his character's wish of revenge, his political fervor nor his sincerity when he's giving a speech. At least, I have to say that the rest of the actors makes a decent work in their roles, highlighting Mary Elizabeth Winstead.In conclusion, I can't recommend Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, mainly because I found it very boring. If you want to watch exciting and entertaining films about a vampire hunter, I recommend you Blade and its first sequel; and if you want to watch a solid re-interpretation of a historical figure, I recommend you Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter.
The Wrestler is an extraordinary film at the same time it marks the transition of director Darren Aronofsky to a different style than the one of his previous movies.The Wrestler is a more accessible film than Aronofsky's previous movies.Pi,Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain were very unusual movies while The Wrestler is more "normal".But this very talented director has made a brilliant work even at a style which is different than the one he is accustomed to.This is a magnificent movie which will stay with the spectator for a long time (well,that's what happened in my case).Basically,The Wrestler repeats the formula from Rocky (or,more precisely,from Rocky Balboa).But putting the main character in the wrestling world makes the story more credible and less archetypal.The down at heel hero who tries to recover his previous glory has been used on many movies; but in The Wrestler,that story feels fresh,unpredictable and absolutely realistic because of some innovative angles the screenplay has.Many people consider The Wrestler as the artistic rebirth of Mickey Rourke,which makes me very happy,although we do not have to underrate his solid works on supporting roles in movies like Domino,Spun and the brilliant Sin City.But the last time we had seen Rourke in a leading role was in 1992,in the movie White Sands.His performance in The Wrestler is monumental and it also helps the fact that Rourke had a period of glory for then living in the shadows for a long time,something which is related to his character.Marisa Tomei also shines on her character because she is completely natural on her role.Evan Rachel Wood also brings an excellent performance because she shows solid range and adequate deepness.Aronofsky's direction is perfect.The style he found to tell the story was completely appropriate,he could obtain magnificent performances from his cast and the scenes of wrestling fights are very well filmed.The screenplay is amazing,not only because it is very well crafted and because it presents a perfect development of the characters,but also because I admired the way in which it shows the wrestling world.For one sight,it accepts the falseness from that sport but for the other sight,it shows the tremendous training the wrestlers have to do,which requires enormous effort.And I also liked the ending very much.I think it should not be taken on a literal way,but as an analogy of the emotional search of the main character.I will not say any more because I would ruin the movie to the reader.The Wrestler is a magnificent and absolutely fascinating movie which shows once more,why Aronofsky is one of the most interesting contemporary directors.This is a great cinematographic experience which deserves all the acclamation it has received.Besides,who cares if Rourke did not win the Oscar ? What it matters is that this excellent actor made an extraordinary work,at the same time he recovered the dignity as an actor many people considered it was lost...and that means much more than a whimsical trophy which has a very doubtful credibility.
I think I had never seen an Indonesian film, and the reason of that might have been because the strict censorship and high taxes over the film industry from that country avoided the development of films suitable for international distribution for years; but fortunately, the laws are changing, and we will now be able to enjoy such entertaining films (I hope so) as The Raid: Redemption, which takes elements from occidental action cinema and brings them a pleasant cultural twist in order to offer us a simple story which is able to transcend due to its ingenious execution, high levels of energy and amazing displays of martial arts.The screenplay from The Raid: Redemption is kinda similar to the one from Die Hard, but director and screenwriter Gareth Evans has mentioned that his main influence was filmmaker John Carpenter, which seems a bit strange at first; however, thinking about it well, The Raid: Redemption has various similarities with Assault on Precint 13 (1976) (not to mention some tributes to Escape from New York), even though the policemen are the ones who invade the criminals' barracks this time. The premise includes a desperate "siege", endless waves of anonymous thugs, and some revelations in order to increase the drama and bring the heroes more motivation. Nevertheless, what mainly distinguishes The Raid: Redemption are the constant fights, incredibly brutal and filmed with a perfect combination of open shots and closed frames on a hand-held camera, and as a consequence, we can appreciate the movement from the athletes and also "feel" the knockings and the intensity of physical contact.As for the actors, they all bring a decent work, as well as good scenic presence, charisma and a lot of physical ability. The ones who most stand out are Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian. Ray Sahetapy brings an adequate performance as the main villain, but the character feels like a simple "mcguffin". Another thing I can say against The Raid: Redemption is that some details from the screenplay could have been better polished.Nevertheless, I enjoyed The Raid: Redemption pretty much, and I can definitely recommend it as a very solid action film. Apparently, the studio Screen Gems has acquired the rights of this movie in order to make a North American remake, which is something I find absurd, because it will surely lose its rustic style, along with the picturesque locations and cultural environment; but well, unfortunately that's the way the creativity works in Hollywood.
Some years ago, directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez made a contest between amateur filmmakers in order to select a trailer which would be included as part of the Grindhouse project. The winning trailer ended up being Hobo with a Shotgun, which was unfortunately only exhibited in the Canadian version of Grindhouse, even though it's obviously available on the Internet in order to delight the fans of exploitation cinema with its ridiculous premise and bloody images. More recently, and following the steps of Machete, a film inspired on that fleeting film joke was made...and I'm glad to say that Hobo with a Shotgun didn't disappoint me at all, because it intelligently expands the story and doesn't spare even a single drop of blood, nor a pinch of morbidity in order to make a tribute to the "grindhouse" cinema. And the best thing of all is that it offers wide doses of black humor without laughing at that kind of cinema, and keeping an absolute respect for its tragic main character.On some way, Hobo with a Shotgun looks like a Troma Films movie from the '80s, because it has an amateur "taste" which looks deceptively real. However, there's professional talent in its saturated cinematography ("Color by Technicolor"), good performances and solid direction, well balanced between dramatic moments and scenes of a grotesque gore which ignore any notion of "good taste" in order to delight itself in such an extreme cruelty that it borders the black humor. In other words, there isn't any "tabu" in Hobo with a Shotgun, at least regarding the violence; but it's so ridiculously over the top that it looks like a insane caricature which is impossible to take it seriously. I'm saying all that as a warning to the spectators who aren't accustomed by the satisfactorily perverse elements of exploitation cinema. After all, that has always been the purpose of this kind of cinema, and I have to appreciate Hobo with a Shotgun for having fulfilled with that.Having said that, it would be unfair to classify Hobo with a Shotgun as another simple "straight to DVD" film which only offers gore (in fact, this film had a limited release in North American and Canadian cinemas, but I won't get into details). Thanks to Rutger Hauer's excellent performance, Hobo with a Shotgun takes a different dimension, more sever and realistic, making us feel the pain and disappointment the main character experiences. On the other side of the coin, I have to mention that Hobo with a Shotgun has a few fails, which come from some clich√©s and forced details from the screenplay.Nevertheless, I liked Hobo with a Shotgun pretty much, and I can definitely recommend it...only to the people who know exactly what they can find in here.
I appreciate the initiative from the film New in Town for trying to add a slight social commentary about the effects the worldwide economical crisis produced on the lives of workers who suffer the close of factories in order to keeping the earnings of huge companies, to a simple romantic formula.But let's not get depressed...after all, Rene√© Zellweger's character falls in love! New in Town is a mediocre movie...it is not very good, but it is not bad and it kept me moderately entertained.Zellweger's performance lacks of any enthusiasm, energy or credibility, but the rest of the actors bring a competent work, from Harry Connick Jr. as her love interest to the brilliant J.K. Simmons as the foreman from a factory, without forgetting Siobhan Fallon on a performance which reminded me a little bit of the one made by Frances McDormand on Fargo.New in Town does not have the subtle sense of humor from that movie, but it explores the characteristic accents from the region, the cold grasslands and the funny hats used because of the intense cold on a more or less sympathetic way.Besides, although this movie has various clich√©s, it also avoids falling on various ones.The main problems from this movie are that the comedy should have been funnier and that the romance is not very credible.I did not like New in Town very much, but I have to recognize that I do not belong to the kind of spectators it was made for.However, I will give it a slight recommendation because despite being mediocre, it kept me moderately entertained.But if you wanna watch an excellent romantic comedy starring Zellweger, I recommend you Bridget Jones' Diary and Down With Love.
I had a bit of distrust when, on the beginning credits of Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium, the words "Walden Media" appeared.This producing company has in its filmography tedious and generic family films like Journey to the Center of the Earth, Hoot, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe or The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising.However, I ended up taking a very nice surprise with Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium, a very entertaining family film with a good rhythm, competent performances and valid life lessons, which are not only valid for children, but also for adults.The fails I found on these movie are some forced elements and a few clich√©s from the screenplay.However, the quick rhythm, interesting characters, the good screenplay and the energetic performances from Dustin Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Jason Bateman offset to some point those fails, making the experience to be pretty entertaining.In summary, Mr. Magorioum's Wonder Emporium may not be a great movie, but it is a very competent experience.I recommend it for the whole family.
I think that Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973) was one of the few movies which would justify a contemporary remake due to the fact that its cheap TV manufacture demerited its ingenious screenplay and somber atmosphere of "suburban Gothic". Now, we finally have the remake of that film, and even though it surpasses the original on various technical elements, it is very far from reaching it on the other aspects, specially the narrative one.The main problem from Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010) is that it reveals its "secret" during the first minutes (even before the credits!). As a consequence, co-screenwriters Matthew Robbins and Guillermo del Toro extinguish any possibility of mystery or suspense about the events developed into the sinister mansion. Besides, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010) is far from reaching the atmosphere and level of tension from the original one, not to mention that it does not generate on us the uncertainty of the reality of the phenomenons, which in the original film could have been simple hallucinations from a woman overwhelmed by the pressures of being a "perfect wife" for her exigent husband.What takes me to the second most important fail from the film...Was it necessary to introduce a girl to reconfigure the story and make it a "dark" fairytale? In my humble opinion, that clich√© cheapens the narrative, because we have already seen it too many times as an easy trick to amplify the (null in this case) emotions from the screenplay. The life from an innocent girl is in danger! Robbins and del Toro surely supposed that the suspense was going to be bigger on that way and that the audience would squeeze their hands so that nothing happens to her. Yawn. And something which does not help at all either is that the child actress Bailee Madison shows a very limited range of expression and not even the minimum level of conviction in her role. I know that not all the young actresses can have the huge talent from Elle Fanning or Chloe Moretz, but I think director Troy Nixey should have made a better effort at selecting the actress.Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes do not show any credibility in their roles either, something which is exacerbated by the fact that their characters are quite superficially written; when the girl explores the disgusting basement, they are both conveniently absent; but at the first sign of "fantastic stories", they immediately call a child psychologist. So, in conclusion, I cannot recommend Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010), because I think it is a tedious remake with many negative elements.
From the first scenes of Pride and Glory we see a lot of tragedy,shouts,rage and violence.But,for a long time,none of those elements could emotionally connect with me.And when the main conflict is finally defined,the movie already got a little bit tiring.Pride and Glory is not a bad movie,but I just found it to be mediocre,and I cannot deny that the excellent performances from Edward Norton,Colin Farrell and Jon Voight make this movie seem to be better than what it really is.The weakest element from this film is that it is full of elements we have already seen on many other cop flicks.Some examples are slow motion funerals,private lives which are ruined by the tension of work and the grey morality some cops have.It may seem as a stupid complain,but I found the constant use of the "F" word as a negative element.That does not offend or scandalize me,but it is used with so much frequency that it finishes distracting us from the story.In other words,there comes a moment in which the use of that word stops being realistic for becoming in the version of "New York reality" from co-screenwriters Joe Carnahan and Gavin O'Connor (who was also the director).Besides,the screenplay makes too many turns for getting to the final point we have guessed much before.Pride and Glory is not a bad movie and I can give a slight recommendation to it,because in general it did not bore me.But the final experience is absolutely forgettable.
Under the supervision of his mentors (Wachowski Bros.), director James McTeigue made an excellent work with the film adaptation of V for Vendetta 5 years ago; and more recently, his film Ninja Assassin makes tribute to another support of "geek" culture: martial arts cinema.The result may not be great, but it is definitely very entertaining thanks to its over-the-top violence and exuberant energy.McTeigue directs Ninja Assassin with a good combination of solemnity and lightness.As a fan of the "gore", I was delighted with the exaggeratedly graphic violence and the frequent rains of blood.Besides, I also liked to see that the screenplay has some subtle touches of humor.The screenplay has some inconsistencies, but McTeigue's direction is so dynamic that that is not very noticeable.Korean super-star Rain makes an adequate work on the leading role, and the choreographers take good advantage from his competent physical development.Besides, I also liked the narrative economy from this film, because it ignores any filling or obstacle on its road to the frenetic action scenes.In summary, Ninja Assassin is a very entertaining experience, and it deserves a recommendation because of that.
I am going to make a prediction: within 2 years, the Blu-Ray of Sanctum 3D will universally be employed in shops and homes in order to display the properties from 3D televisions which will be flooding the market by then (asumming that that technology will prosper like its manufacturers expect). And I do not doubt the fact that Sanctum 3D will sell many televisions, because it offers truly impressive images, which take the maximum advantage of the 3D filming process. Pity that the film has such a bad screenplay...With James Cameron's name in the movie's credits (as an executive producer) and knowing the fact that most of the movie takes place under the water, we can expect in Sanctum 3D the same spirit of exploration and techno-fetishism which guided the documentaries he made about the wonders from the submarine world. For better or for worse, I think that a documentary about the (fictitious) cave Esa'ala (which may be based on the "Cave of Swallows") would have been much more interesting than this tedious and irritating movie, which is full of hateful characters, bad performances and forced conflicts which were designed with the only purpose of exalting the explorers' "extreme" personalities. By the way, the worst performances from this movie are the ones from Rhys Wakefield and Ioan Gruffudd. What is more, the general level of the dialogs and the screenplay borders the atrocious. And something I found strange in Sanctum 3D is that it combines extraordinary special effects with other ones which are so bad that they seem to belong to a TV movie.In conclusion, Sanctum 3D is a bad movie, despite the impressive underground 3D images created by cinematographer Jules O' Laughlin and production designer Nicholas McCallum, who both avoided the experience to fall into abysmal levels. It is a pity that Sanctum 3D could not endorse that technical achievement with a good story, interesting characters and a solid narrative.
It's hard to believe that the feared ouija is a board game produced and distributed by the toy company Hasbro... exactly like the transformers! Leaving that aside, the film Ouija is a tedious horror movie in which I wasted my time and my money. Ouija is full of clich√©s and prefabricated elements we have seen an uncountable number of occasions. Instead of exploring the enigmatic properties of ouija or expanding the mythology of the game, co-screenwriters Stiles White (who was also the director) and Juliet Snowden appeal to the obligatory vindictive ghost, seasoned by the typical appearances, distended faces, researches in a dark attic and the visit to the old woman who knows more than she seems. The twist near the end is laughable, and the road which took us to it is so insipid that it was difficult for me to keep the attention or get worried for the destiny of uninteresting characters. One of the few positive elements in Ouija is Olivia Cooke's competent performance in the leading role; pity that she had to work with such a poor screenplay. In conclusion, Ouija bored me pretty much, and needless to say, I don't recommend it. I just wish that the future will bring us a much better film about the ouija; I think that would be preferable over an adaptation of Scrabble or Battleship. Wait a minute...
Last year, I read an interview to Ralph Sarchie, a retired policeman who co-wrote the book Beware the Night (along with Lisa Collier), about the paranormal occurrences he found during his career in New York. The anecdotes he told in that interview were truly terrifying, and elevated my expectations for the film Deliver Us From Evil, "inspired" on Sarchie's experiences. However, the film took a simpler and safer road, and the result is mediocre, but passable. As an important part from its screenplay, Deliver Us From Evil borrows many concepts and situations from other films, either as a "tribute" or as a tool for establishing the atmosphere and tone from the scenes (some examples: policeman with family difficulties; rebel priest with a tortuous past; a main character who has lost the faith; and a prologue set in the Middle East, in the purest style of The Exorcist). The actors make a competent work, highlighting Eric Bana, Joel McHale and Olivia Munn. However, Deliver Us From Evil isn't very satisfactory as a horror film. Its rhythm is occasionally a bit dull, the screenplay makes too many unnecessary turns, and the demonic possession scenes aren't very frightening. I appreciate the fact that Deliver Us From Evil attempted to modify its particular cinematographic recipe, placing the characters' humanity above cheap scares and stylish tricks (even though it contains various examples of both); but at the same time, I feel that it distanced itself too much from the roots of the horror genre, and tried to compensate it with an abundance of clich√©s which end up diluting its identity. Nevertheless, I can give a slight recommendation to Deliver Us From Evil, mainly because it generally kept me moderately entertained.
I am very happy to see the sudden critical acceptation director Danny Boyle is getting for Slumdog Millionaire,because I have liked his entire filmography (with the exception of The Beach) and I feel that many of his films have been unfairly underrated for not adjusting to the spectators' expectations.Nobody denies the greatness from Trainspotting but his also very interesting films Shallow Grave,A Life Less Ordinary,28 Days Later and Sunshine were underrated from my point of view.Slumdog Millionaire is another very interesting and entertaining film from Boyle which,in spite of not being excellent,it is near from being.During the first half hour from the movie,it disappointed me its repetitive structure and the convenient way of how any question from the programme is magically related to a past event of the main character's life.However,that fail is compensated a little bit because when I started thinking about the movie,I noted that was made with the intention of showing the chaotic life in India,from the childhood from the kids of Mumbai to the impact the occidental culture has had on that country.Another function from those vignettes is showing the relationship between three young people during their unpredictable lives on which their separations are as important as the moments they are together.That is a very good strategy,because it makes the screenplay richer but at the same time,I think that aspect could have been worked a little bit better,because it reminded me to the style shown in the extraordinary movie City of God,which used that strategy a little bit better.However,the charisma from the actors and their honest performances emotionally connect to the spectator,and that made Slumdog Millionaire to provoke an unusual emotional impact on me.Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy used a very ingenious trick : starting the movie with what it seems a posterior event to the TV programme,suggesting the final result and making us believe that he killed us any suspense.However,that was only an intelligent manipulation from Beaufoy because,near the ending,nothing is as it seemed and the film gets incredibly tense until it leads to a very satisfactory conclusion.Boyle's dynamic direction perfectly complements the tone from the movie.It is obvious his intention was not emulating the narrative language from Bollywood (with the exception of the final credits) but incorporating his style to the exotic Indian sensibility,and it is a testimony to his extraordinary talent that so different films like Sunshine (human sci-fi),A Life Less Ordinary (a violent and modern fairytale),28 Days Later (horror for the new millennium) and now Slumdog Millionaire show the exact same vision.Slumdog Millionaire is not Boyle's best film (by my point of view,that one is still Trainspotting) but still,I can recommend this movie with confidence because it kept me very entertained and interested,at the same time it exposed a very good message.Rating:8.5
In 2000, the film Final Destination proposed an innovative premise about the survivors of a catastrophe, and the strange ways they die as a consequence of altering the "plan of the death".I liked that idea very much, but the screenplay had bored me because it was full of gimmicky explanations and ridiculous situations.Three years later, I enjoyed Final Destination 2 a lot, because of the simplification in the structure of the screenplay, the constant tension, the sardonic sense of humor and the sublime combination of practical and digital effects which created some of the most grotesque and grimly amusing deaths I have seen on horror cinema.In 2006, the director of the first film (James Wong) made Final Destination 3 which, although it was inferior to Final Destination 2, was very entertaining.Now, we have a new sequel on this franchise, and I had very high expectations for watching it, because the director of the second film (David R. Ellis) was back and because of the 3-D effect.Unfortunately, the movie represented a huge disappointment, and it is truly horrible.First of all, the screenplay from this film is exactly the same we have seen on the previous movies.The initial tragedy is different, but the story follows the same design, structure and style.However, this movie is much less bloody, shocking and entertaining than parts 2 and 3. In other words, The Final Destination is more of the same, but nowhere near as good as the previous two films.The excessive emphasis this movie puts on digital tricks breaks the excellent balance between modern and traditional methods which were so well employed on parts 2 and 3.But the worst thing of all is that screenwriter Eric Bress looses any opportunity of complicating the hollow screenplay a little bit.For example, nobody questions the origin of the visions the main character has or the reason of their survival; they simply accept that because the screenplay says so.Another example is when one of the characters reveals he WANTS to die and he raises a disjunctive about how that would affect the plans from the death.However, the screenplay does not explore that idea, because it is hurried to show one of the characters dying.All those things reveal that Bress had zero interest or enthusiasm on his screenplay.And I have not even mentioned the awful cast yet.With the exceptions of Mykelti Williamson (who does not have too much to do) and Krista Allen (who has a short appearance), the rest of the actors are SO bad that I wanted their characters to die as soon as possible.Their performances are so bland and passive that there is not even a slight suspense for their destinies.On some way, I understand the reasons of such a poor cast.At being a movie based on special effects, it is easy (and economic) to hire unknown and cheap actors whose only function is bringing the faces to the victims.The actors from the previous two parts may not were brilliant, but they showed enough credibility and enthusiasm for us to care about their characters.I do not recommend by any means this hollow and absolutely tedious sequel.I truly took a big disappointment with it.The title from this film suggests the end of the saga, and if that is true, I honestly do not care, because the very low quality from this movie does not inspire any optimism for future sequels.
I guess that Youth in Revolt can be considered as a juvenile comedy even though that, at the difference of similar movies, its screenplay seems more sophisticated and mature due to the addition of unexpected lessons about ethic and morals which are rarely seen in movies from this genre. But after all, it is another simple story about a young man who tries to fall in love with an unusual girl by using methods which are occasionally moderately funny and occasionally irritating due to their arrogance and stupidity. In summary, I found Youth in Revolt to be a mediocre film barely rescued by its competent performances and likable atmosphere.Youth in Revolt is based on a semi-autobiographical book written by C.D. Payne. For better or for worse, the "semi" means that the story is full of exaggerations whose purpose is to emphasize the humor and the drama; I assume that Payne's experiences were less extreme, and maybe not very interesting, so they required some "embellishment". Unfortunately, his inflated fantasies are not enough to make a good movie, because the narrative thread from Youth in Revolt is full of patches, cracks and tangential digressions which do not lead to anywhere, at the same time that they relegate the story to a secondary level in some occasions. Sure, the best juvenile comedies are basically adolescent fantasies where the emotions are over the top, but I think that it is indispensable to set them into a firm and recognizable context; otherwise, they seem like the scores from a screenwriter who is more interested in satisfying his/her artistic whims than in telling a good story, and I think that is the case with Youth in Revolt. Besides, the film has the frivolous and pretentious style from the modern "indie" cinema, something which occasionally obstructs the slight "reality" from the portrayed situations. In summary, I feel that the screenplay should have been better written.However, I found Youth in Revolt to be moderately entertaining, mainly because of the performances. Michael Cera achieves a good contrast between his shy character and his twisted secret identity. Portia Doubleday is also credible as the main character's love interest. And in supporting roles, we have solid works from the talented character actors Steve Buscemi, Zach Galifianakis, Ray Liotta, Fred Willard and Justin Long.In conclusion, I think Youth in Revolt deserves a slight recommendation, because despite not leaving me very satisfied, I have to admit that it did not bore me.
In early 1998,actress Helen Hunt seemed to be about to become into a big Hollywood star.After having won an Oscar and Golden Globe as Best Actress in a Leading Role for the movie As Good as It Gets,and an Emmy (not to mention having achieved another Golden Globe nomination) for the TV series Mad About You,her rising career was assured.However,after some commercial Hollywood movies (like the conventional drama Pay It Forward and the mediocre romantic comedy What Women Want),her career only limited to a pair of roles on independent movies,where she showed her talent was intact,but that she never became on the Hollywood star she seemed she was going to be.I have a theory to explain that : Hunt was more interested in exploring her talent than in selling herself to the fame many actors ambition to.As a possible proof of that,we have the movie Then She Found Me,which also represents her first work as a director and as a co-screenwriter.This movie resulted to be a humble but entertaining and very interesting melodrama with emotive details,credible characters,a honest romance and solid performances.The synopsis from this movie could suggest this is an "ethnic comedy" like My Big Fat Greek Wedding or Moonstruck.However,the screenplay from this movie is much more subtle and delicate,because besides of avoiding the characters to become into crude racial caricatures,it has the patience to developing them at a calm (but never boring) rhythm,at the same time it avoids the clich√©s from family drama and romantic comedy.The best attribute from this movie is that everything seems natural on it.Hunt brings an excellent performance,and although the rest of the cast is also solid,this movie clearly rests on her shoulders.There are a few fails on this movie.For one sight,some of the dialogs feel a bit forced and,although I appreciated the delicacy from this movie,there were some moments in which that made it seem a little bit bland.When we are in front of the debut of an actor as a director,the result is unpredictable.On some occasions,the result is a pathetic exercise of ego.But,on other occasions,there are actors who show genuine talent as directors because they find a good tone and rhythm for conducing a story and they can extract solid performances from the cast.Fortunately,Then She Found Me belongs to the second style,and I hope to see more movies directed by Hunt,because she shows potential.I can recommend this movie with confidence,because although it is not excellent,it kept me very interested.
Even though I liked the original film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990), I have never been a devotee of the franchise, either on cinema, TV, comics or videogames. That allowed me to watch the film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) without any nostalgic distortion; nevertheless, that didn't avoid me from finding this film boring and uninteresting. The main problem from this movie is that it didn't comprehend the irreverent spirit of the Turtles and didn't elevate the story beyond the clich√©s of a TV caricature. I would have thought that the successful films from Marvel studios would have inspired co- screenwriters Josh Appelbaum, Andr√© Nemec and Evan Daugherty and director Jonathan Liebesman (whose previous filmography ranges from the execrable -Darkness Falls- to the competent -Wrath of the Titans-) to bring the movie a more substantial and mature sensibility, equally capable of satisfying the modern audiences and the fans who grew up with this saga. Even the modest animated film TMNT comprehended that necessity. Unfortunately, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) ended up being an innocuous and tedious film, visually impressive but narratively insipid; they tried to make it "darker", but they ended up betraying the essence of the saga. The basic story is the same: four turtles mutated in the sewers of New York under the care of a philosophical rat called Splinter, who taught them martial arts and trained them to fight against crime in secret, until they are discovered by an audacious reporter. And, of course, we have the obligatory villain with an anti- ecological plan. The problem is that the screenplay doesn't have any deepness, or suspense, or sensation of danger. The scenes occur by obligation instead of logical progression. The occasional instances of drama lack of weight and emotion. And regarding the humor... the least I say, the better. Instead of being funny and incisive, it's deeply irritating, lacking of any ingenuity and full of forced references to Star Wars, Lost, '80s culture and any other thing Appelbaum, Nemec and Daugherty thought it could resonate with modern audiences. On the positive side, we have the amazing special effects from ILM, not only on the shape of the Turtles themselves, but also on settings and sequences which were entirely digital (I found the chase on the snow particularly impressive from the technical point of view... but as a simple action scene, it bored me). However, despite the excellent special effects, I can't recommend Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014), because I found it tedious and insipid.
Knowing that the very active squirrel was the best element from the two previous films,Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs makes its participation bigger,adding a rival and new sets for developing its chase after the lost acorn.However,that strategy fails because of two things.First,that sub-plot is diffuse and repetitive.And second,that does not save this movie from being a tedious and completely unnecessary rip-off without any interest or emotion...but with various new characters which are ready for being made into toys.Ice Age 3 is very boring for many elements,like for example,its tiring chase scenes,tedious danger situations and hollow and stupid humor.I guess this film was only made for very little children,who cannot comprehend the narrative subtleness of excellent animation films like Up or Ratatouille; so I think this movie will bore to the parents pretty much,because they may be expecting something more interesting than the obligatory falls,hits or more strident things which replace to the genuine humor.I honestly do not have much more to say.Ice Age 3 is a bad animation movie because of its poor screenplay,its forced voice performances and,mainly,for being boring.
Like many other aficionados to sci-fi,I consider The Terminator and Terminator 2 to be undeniable classics from the genre.I think I liked the first movie a little bit more because it transpired its humble condition of "B" cinema for becoming on an unexpected worldwide success thanks to the ingenious screenplay and James Cameron's excellent direction.Besides,I think that movie was the one which most advantage took from Arnold Schwarzenegger,a horrible actor who however was perfect as a rigid and expressionless robot.Terminator 2 and Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines made the mistake of requiring him to act,and his inability to do it damaged the quality from those movies a little bit.Terminator Salvation avoids that fail by using three competent actors on the lead roles.This fourth part is the least obtained one from the saga by my point of view,but on its own merit,I found it to be entertaining although not lacking of important fails.Terminator 2 and Terminator 3 had recycled the formula established on the first film : a robot travels to the past in order to kill the future leader of the human resistance.On the contrary,Terminator : Salvation presents a different story setting us on that frightening future at the same time it carefully integrates the information we have received on the previous movies.I really appreciated that,because by doing that,the film keeps the continuity at the same time it distances enough from the previous movies in order to have an own identity (although the phrases "I'll be back" and "Come with me if you want to live" feel a bit out of place).But the screenplay has various negative elements.For every ingenious detail or interesting scene,there is a forced situation or unbelievable coincidence which takes out points to the movie (for example : why do the robots need keyboards and monitors? Why is SkyNet's heart protected by only one android? Did we really need the classic monologue from the villain near the end of the movie?).I had mentioned on the beginning of this commentary that one of the positive elements from this movie is on three members of the cast,but I have some complains about one of them.Christian Bale is an excellent actor but his performance on this movie lacks of dimension : for one side,he shows a credible balance between military discipline and his abundant internal doubts; however,I could not see on him the charisma or presence of a leader who inspires a troop.By my point of view,the best members from the cast are Sam Worthington and Anton Yelchin,who show charisma and enthusiasm on their roles.The special effects from Terminator : Salvation are competent.The robots from Terminator : Salvation are not as spectacular as the ones from Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen,but at the difference of that movie,their battles provoke emotion and suspense...not to mention that they are directed on a clear way.In fact,all the action scenes are well filmed.Terminator : Salvation is not as good as the previous films from the saga,and it is not a highly memorable experience,but I had a good time watching it,and because of that,I think it deserves a recommendation.Although I cannot deny that this film could have been better with some adjusts made to the screenplay.Rating : 7.5
I was very interested in watching Vanishing on 7th Street, because director Brad Anderson's previous filmography includes the excellent films Session 9 and The Machinist, which besides of both being mature and intelligent movies from the fantastic genre, did not necessarily rely on supernatural elements in order to provoke an impact on the spectator. On the opposite, their force resided on the realistic and credible interactions between the characters, on their well defined personalities and on the resulting drama from an unexpected factor (the main character's guilt in The Machinist, and the workers' stress in Session 9). I think Vanishing on 7th Street is Anderson's film with the biggest quantity of elements from the fantastic genre so far, which means that it employs the previously mentioned supernatural elements as an integral part from the screenplay, and not only as a metaphor of the psychological suffering. However, I think that this movie's main fail comes from there...the emphasis on the fantastic aspect leaves aside the human element, which ends up feeling like a nuisance for not being well integrated...something which is exacerbated by the poor performances.The first 20 minutes from Vanishing on 7th Street are pretty good, because they raise the situation with the correct grade of reservation in order to create curiosity in us. But once that the four characters entrench themselves into the restaurant, the film is stuck into a repetitive circle of discussions, personal conflicts and revelations which should supposedly bring shape and depth to the characters, when in fact, the only thing they get is irritating us with their constant fights and whims. And we have like 1 hour of the movie like that...Luke makes various attempts to escape (where?) and tries to convince the other ones that it would be a fatal mistake to stay there once the generator is out. Rosemary unstoppably talks about her missing son. James is confused because he does not know which person to heed. And Paul is practically the whole time lying on a pool table saying incoherences (besides, I could not understand the reason why he is hurt or ill). Oh, and screenwriter Anthony Jaswinski does not loose any chance to remind us that the shadows are moving and are only expecting the opportunity to attack the characters. We already understood that! Really, that was left clear from the beginning! How much time do we have to wait the story to advance? Answer: too much. When the screenplay finally starts moving, the movie is very near to the end, and we only receive an abrupt ending which does not explain too much, even though it might confirm what we were suspecting during the beginning. Or at least, I interpreted it like that. The conclusion is enough ambiguous for every spectator to draw his/her own conclusions according to their own ideology and beliefs. On the one hand, I can consider that like a pro, because I like it when a movie makes the spectator to think; on the other hand, it feels a bit frustrating not to reach to something concrete after having invested so much time in almost useless drama and dialogs. On the positive side, I liked the audio design, Lucas Vidal's music and Anderson's direction style.In conclusion, I think Vanishing on 7th Street deserves a slight recommendation because of its concept, a few good moments of suspense, the atmosphere and the fact that it generally did not bore me. However, the screenplay is so repetitive and the characters so hollow and unwillingly interpreted that the movie did not leave me very satisfied.
Zombieland, director Ruben Fleischer's first film, combined horror and comedy with an entertaining, but not very memorable, result. 30 Minutes or Less, his second film, combines comedy and thriller, but the result is exactly at the same level of the one from Zombieland.30 Minutes or Less counts with a generally well written screenplay, likable characters and dialogs, and solid direction. But on the other hand, I did not find the comic component particularly funny, nor balanced with the dramatic elements in the correct proportions.If the comic elements from 30 Minutes or Less had been deleted, the movie would have been an efficient thriller. However, the comedy changes the identity from the story pretty much, lightening its tone and occasionally sabotaging the tension we should have felt. The general effect is a curious amalgam of action and suspense, spiced with humor elements, which do not work on various moments. Nevertheless, I occasionally smiled during the movie...but not enough moments in order to consider 30 Minutes or Less a solid comedy. Let's say that this film was forced to work inside a genre it was not designed for.Jesse Eisenberg brings a competent performance in 30 Minutes or Less as a normal man who is bound to reaction to the buffoons which surround him. The great Fred Ward is perfect in his role, and it was a pleasure to see him with the same intensity with which he amazed me 27 years ago in the underrated film Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins. As for Dilshad Vadsaria, she is only employed as a pretty face, and her character is not very well written.In conclusion, I think 30 Minutes or Less is an entertaining, but not very memorable, "thrill-omedy", whose main pros are the work from the cast and Fleischer's direction, something which makes it worthy of a moderate recommendation. However, I think the screenplay could have gone further in every single sense.
The Crazies (1973) is one of the least famous movies in director and screenwriter George A. Romero's filmography, but I personally liked it very much, because besides of having excellent moments of tension and violence, it tells a story which is rich on its meaning and very well structured, which does not loose the time in divisions between heroes and villains, but which instead focuses into the realistic examination of a horrible situation which is observed by different points of view. Unfortunately, that reflexive tone is absolutely absent in the recent remake of that film, which ended up being a tedious horror film with absolutely nothing of the narrative deepness from the original film.One of the things I most liked in the original The Crazies is that it divided its narrative between the inhabitants from the contaminated town and the military who were searching for a cure of the illness, or at least trying for it to extend. That division made the spectator to comprehend the difficult ethic decisions both groups had to face. Unfortunately, the remake reduces its focus to a small group of survivors who live the typical tribulations we have seen in practically every single post-apocalyptic film, from the desperate search of transport and refuge to the scenes of personal conflicts and fight for the power.Despite having poor material to work with, I have to admit that the actors from The Crazies (2010) made a good work with their roles: Timothy Olyphant feels credible as a sheriff who will do anything in order to protect his wife; Radha Mitchell brings energy and personality to the most generic character from the movie; Danielle Panabaker is effective as a "scream queen" (a role she had also interpreted in Friday the 13th -2009, another useless remake-); and Joe Anderson brings the best performance from the movie (at least by my point of view) as an unstable policeman. Pity that their competent performances are trapped into such a mediocre and lacking of any deepness movie.So, in conclusion, I found The Crazies (2010) to be a boring remake with a tedious screenplay which is full of logical holes (for example: how did not the sheriff though that the ONLY functioning car in the village would bring suspicions?). Besides, I did not see the point in making this remake when all the elements which made the original film to be unique and fascinating were omitted. And there have been so many movies about epidemics and biological threatens in recent years that The Crazies (2010) feels like more from the same. So, despite the performances, I cannot recommend this weak and unnecessary remake.
Every time I watch a movie about racial oppression (either it is set during the slavery period, or the subsequent segregation, or the current combination of volatile cultures), I cannot avoid some suspicions about the authentic intentions from the screenplay. Due to the fact that the subject is controversial, it can be used as a basis of intelligent and provocative reflections...or it can simply be used as an easy trick to draw attention and provoke emotions on the spectator. Which one of both categories does the film The Help belong to? I honestly cannot assure it, because its tone changes with an alarming frequency, from predictable soap-opera clich√©s to genuinely honest drama with a deep emotional resonance. Nevertheless, I think that the balance of the film definitely falls on the positive side, mainly because of its excellent performances and a precise narrative which never looses the focus on the main message.The screenplay from The Help shows the classic traces of a "compressed" story, in which some important points feel hasty or superficial, while other elements occupy space without substantially contributing to the story. Ie that that is normal in book adaptations, and I am sure that screenwriter Tate Taylor (who was also the director) tried to preserve the best he could from author Kathryn Stockett's book. However, I would have liked to see the time spent on some elements (such as an useless love story) invested on developing better some of the very interesting characters who do not have enough time on scene. Another small folly comes from the funny moments, which occasionally feel excessively forced and predictable.However, that did not avoid me from liking The Help pretty much because of the brilliant performances and the generally well written screenplay. The interaction between the characters Minny and Aibileen is among the best elements from the film, and it does not leave any place for sentimental manipulation, because it did not need from any exaggeration in order to perfectly express the suffering from the characters and the catharsis of simply venting their painful memories and sad experiences. Even though The Help is not based on a true story, it feels like that because of the sincere performances and the realism of the situations depicted, which are unfortunately credible in the historical framework the movie is set.As for the actresses, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer bring extraordinary works which are absolutely worthy of the acclamation they are both receiving. Even though Emma Stone feels a bit darkened by Davis and Spencer, that does not avoid her work from being solid. Oh, and I don't wanna forget Bryce Dallas Howard bringing a perfect performance as a villain simultaneously worthy of hate and sorrow. So, despite some tonal and narrative irregularities, The Help definitely deserves a recommendation as a very interesting experience.
Despite a few scenes which feel too sentimental and idealized, Saving Mr. Banks is an excellent film which works on many levels. The most obvious one is, of course, the clash of wills between P.L. Travers and Walt Disney. She is a punctilious and strict woman forged by a difficult childhood; and he is a tycoon accustomed to get everything he wants. The interaction between Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson is wonderful, because it brings smiles on the audience, but with enough glimpses to their internal emotions in order to create credible and sincere human drama. The film also offers us an eloquent biography of Travers, whose personal tragedies molded her literary work. And finally, during fleeting moments, the film expresses a kind auto-critic of the bland and cloying Disney philosophy. In the supporting cast, we can find perfect performances from Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford and Jason Schwartzman. In conclusion, Saving Mr. Banks is a brilliant film, which brings us an emotive and hugely entertaining experience that illustrates us a little bit about the origin of the classic family film Mary Poppins, and also reminds us of the passion and humanity which once drove the monolith Disney. There might not be too much from it nowadays, but the existence of this film suggests that they haven't forgotten it completely.
I understand the attractive of the romantic films which show two people in love despite their obstacles, such as different social levels, past tragedies or personal insecurities.The problem is that they generally do not interest me because they very rarely feel credible or real.Almost always, they are over the top fantasies of unconditional and immediate love expressed with clich√©s and with two possible solutions: tragedy or eternal happiness.So, I found the romance to be much more tolerable when it is only a supporting element on a movie, and not the absolute axis from the story.Unfortunately, that one is the case from the movie Remember Me, a juvenile romantic drama which strictly follows the description mentioned above.However, the movie has two elements, which can be either positive or negative depending of the spectator: the first one is Robert Pattinson's presence, who is the idol of millions of teenagers thanks to his performance as a vampire in the Twilight saga; and the second one is the ending, which will scandalize some people and inspire other ones.Personally, I found it to be a cheap trick in order to simulate relevance on a film which is no more than another soap-opera with poor logic and forced emotions which did not result either satisfactory or entertaining.I suppose that a big part of the (female) audience who watches Remember Me will be satisfied by Pattinson's mere presence, his tortured eyes and scruffy beard.Perfect.I am glad they enjoy the movie.But those who are expecting to see an original and interesting story will be very disappointed, because this tedious story is painfully similar to so many others melodramas which are only based on the whimsy suffering from the characters...and their equally arbitrary "love".The only variation is the previously mentioned conclusion, and of course I am not going to say what happens, but needless to say that it does not improve the movie, because I found it to be forced and, as I previously mentioned, a cheap trick.The performances may be the only positive elements from this very boring movie.Pattinson brings a competent histrionic development, and I think he has potential beyond of his vampire personification.Pierce Brosnan and Emilie de Ravin also bring solid works.Finally, I found the great Chris Cooper to be pretty wasted on his role.In summary, I did not like Remember Me at all, because I was terribly bored while I was watching it, despite the solid work from the cast.However, I must admit I am not the kind of spectator this movie was made for.In other words, I found it to be horrible, but I understand why some people could like it.
At this time, I should not be surprised to receive the disappointment of seeing directors from the horror genre I admired in previous decades (such as Tobe Hooper, Dario Argento and John Carpenter) making mediocre or horrible films which are very far from reaching their glorious times. On the other hand, it might be unfair to expect greatness in every single thing they do, specially considering the fact they are normal people who might feel a bit tired of an industry which has substantially changed during the last 3 decades. So, trying to be as objective as possible, I started watching The Ward, Carpenter's most recent film.The Ward is a mediocre horror film whose screenplay is developed predictably, distributing the obligatory jump scenes and violent deaths we expect to see in these kind of movies during its running time. However, the emphasis is not on the gore, but on the atmosphere of threaten which floats around the cold corridors from a psychiatric hospital. Nevertheless, the screenplay always keeps itself ambiguous with the supernatural aspect, so we never know if the main character is on the correct track or is only a victim of hallucinations; after all, she is in a psychiatric hospital with good reason. That uncertainty is the main thing which makes The Ward moderately interesting, despite the generic formula employed by the screenplay.As for the performances, I found them forced and excessively over the top. I think Amber Heard is a good actress, who is able to face very different characters with credibility (from the brave and rebel woman in Drive Angry to the "simulated daughter" in The Joneses); however, her screams and over-acted reactions in The Ward feel totally unnatural. And the same applies to Danielle Panabaker, Lyndsy Fonseca, Laura Leigh and Mamie Gummer.In conclusion, I can give a slight recommendation to The Ward, mainly because it kept me moderately entertained, despite its bad performances, problems in the screenplay and its excessive use of ridiculous shocks and loud music to "scare" us.
Although I liked the special effects and the visual style from the first two Underworld films,I found their mythology unnecessarily solemn and complicated,so I did not expect with too much enthusiasm the third part,which is a prequel which shows the origins of the conflict between vampires and werewolves ("lycans" in the mythology of the saga) shown in the previous movies.But Underworld : Rise of the Lycans was a very nice surprise in my case,and I found it much more entertaining and exciting than the previous films.Director Patrick Tatopoulos lacks of the visual dynamism of Len Wiseman (the director of the previous Underworld films),but he could find a better tone for this movie and I think the action scenes are better filmed than in the previous films.Rhona Mitra was a very appropriate replacement of Kate Beckinsale.She shows credibility and enthusiasm on her role.Michael Sheen also brings a good work but I think the member of the cast who mostly stands out is the great Bill Nighy,who takes his character to histrionic extremes.Nighy shows conviction on his dialogs but he also shows a subtle touch of humor which makes his dialogs more entertaining.The special effects are very well done.I think the best element from this movie is that it does not take too seriously to itself,at the difference of the previous movies.I can recommend Underworld : Rise of the Lycans as a very entertaining and exciting movie with competent performances and good action scenes.I took a very nice surprise with this movie.
What to Expect When You're Expecting can be classified in the "self-help books turned into horrible films" category (along with He's Just Not That Into You), but it can also fit into the "multiple Hollywood stars trapped into a horrible film" category (along with New Year's Eve and He's Just Not That Into You). Nevertheless, the niche isn't very important, because the result is the same: a pathetic movie with many famous actors but a deplorable screenplay. So, this tedious adaptation fails on every single level: as a comedy, it's completely unfunny; and it doesn't respect the spirit of the book on which it was based, because it doesn't offer any advice or inspiration to the future mothers (with one exception: "pretty people also suffer").In previous occasions, when Hollywood took books to the big screen, they were novels, comics or biographies...something with a story, characters, chronological flow, or similar elements of narrative art. However, "money calls money", so any successful book is currently susceptible to be adapted into a movie. The book What to Expect When You're Expecting has sold millions of copies, and it's been very useful for many families to face the difficulties of pregnancy (at least that's what I have been told). On the other hand, the film What to Expect When You're Expecting is a rehash of melodramatic clich√©s and romantic comedy formulas structured in a series of situation with a bad shape and null rhythm. The result is a film full of insipid dialogues and synthetic sentimentality which only provokes yawns.I honestly can't find any positive element in What to Expect When You're Expecting, but at the same time, I admit the fact that I have a biological disadvantage and I can't evaluate the film from the point of view of someone who has lived (or is living) pregnancy. Who knows? The screenplay I found intolerable might hide valuable observations and amusing references to moms and future moms who might feel themselves identified with the characters of this film (after all, Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Lopez and Brooklyn Decker are faithful reflections of the average woman, right?). But from my personal experience, I can't recommend by any means this execrable piece of junk. And the worst thing of all is that What to Expect When You're Expecting establishes an unfortunate precedent to the adaptations of more books lacking of story. I can already imagine some Hollywood screenwriter trying to write "Handbook of iPhone: The Movie"...Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher are two linguistic geniuses who meet each other playing Words with Friends; they hate each other on the beginning, but their rivalry becomes into a romance; Julia Roberts and Bradley Cooper accidentally exchange telephones at a caf√©, and they attempt to meet each other following the dates of their respective calendars; when they finally meet, they feel they know each other so well that they decide to get married; Patrick Dempsey is a lawyer who sends an innocent text message to the judge Halle Berry, but the "auto correct" acts up and makes it a sexually suggestive message; the judge makes him arrest, and the lawyer must defend his innocence at court...even though that will mean revealing his love for Berry; and finally, Robin Williams starts a trial for the State to recognize his marriage to Zooey Deschanel. The problem? Williams ends up falling in love with his lawyer Jennifer Garner, and Deschanel becomes so jealous that she will make Garner's life impossible.
I took a very nice surprise with this short film called A Fitting Tribute.For one sight,the story is excellent and very well written.It is concise and entertaining at the same time.Director Daniel Cormack made a great work and he appears as a very promising talent.A Fitting Tribute has excellent performances from the small cast.The actors completely become on their roles and they never seem to be acting.The only fail I found on this movie was that there was an element near the ending which did not flow completely naturally.In spite of that,A Fitting Tribute is a great short film with excellent performances and a brilliant screenplay.I totally recommend it.
I like the work of Akiva Schaffer, Jorma Taccone and Andy Samberg in the "troupe" The Lonely Island; however, the experience has shown over and over again that they have less luck when they work individually than as a trio; in other words, the combination of talents is more than the sum of its parts. I mention this because the film The Watch, directed by Schaffer and with cameos from Taccone and Samberg, is very far from reaching the humor, irreverence and energy we habitually find in their collective work, and is a horrible "comedy" with a pathetic screenplay.The combination of contradictory genres can bring good results, but in the sad case of The Watch, the mixture of comedy, sci-fi and thriller feels absolutely forced and like an arbitrary collection of incongruent scenes which don't contribute to the narrative, but which only exist as mini-sketches of a bad quality. On the comedy level, The Watch is too predictable, with the expected scatological jokes and vulgarity which don't even work (the five-minute scene about urinating into a jar reveals a lot about the auto-indulgence from co-screenwriters Jared Stern, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg...and their probable level of intoxication while writing the screenplay). As a thriller, The Watch also fails because it never creates suspense in order for us to get worried about the characters. And the least I say about the sci-fi aspect of The Watch, the better.The alliance of Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade sounds good on paper, but unfortunately, they are totally wasted in The Watch. I know that the economical failure of a film rarely indicates its real quality, but I think that the fact that The Watch flopped is widely justified, because it's an execrable and irritating waste of time. Needless to say that I recommend you to avoid this piece of trash like the plague.
I have generally enjoyed the "chick flicks" Nancy Meyers has written, produced or directed.Sure, she has had some false moves on her wide filmography, but in my humble opinion, she has generally maintained a good standard of quality.It's Complicated, her most recent film, has some good elements and it has perfect performances from the main cast; however, I felt this time that the idealized situations from the screenplay and the affected humor feel a bit irritating, so the overall experience did not leave me very satisfied.I do not know if that happened because of a sudden increase of my bitterness, or because Meyers is starting to fall into an auto-parody of her previous work.To start with, I found it difficult for me to feel pity for "mature" characters with a perfect skin, impeccable costumes and refined suburban lives where the biggest problem is having "only" two ovens in their huge kitchen.But well...I understand that this film represents a feminist fantasy (I do not wanna sound sexist, but let's accept the reality), so I can more or less excuse the "Hollywood treatment" from this movie.However, what I cannot excuse is the artificiality from the screenplay and the predictable humor, which, to start with, is not particularly ingenious.Nevertheless, the main cast from this movie is what rescues it and helps to make it moderately entertaining.Meryl Streep generates automatic credibility with her character; exactly the same can be said about Alec Baldwin; and Steve Martin (who I consider to be a genius of the comedy -read the book Pure Drivel if you do not believe me-) has to contrast to the loquacious Baldwin, and he achieves it to the perfection with an appropriately subtle and controlled development.I also appreciated to see that It's Complicated avoids some clich√©s from romantic comedies, so we do not have to stand another forced love outbreak in an airport, or witness public humiliations of someone who wants to prove his/her repentance, or other clich√©s on that line.So, in summary, It's Complicated is a mediocre movie, but the cast and a few elements from the screenplay make it moderately entertaining.So, I think that it deserves a slight recommendation because of that.
My first encounter with Jonah Hex came in the precise moment when I started to find out that the comics could go much further than the typical superheroes which had initially captured my interest in that art.And even though I have never been an obsessive fan of that character, I enjoyed the black humor and bizarre tone from the mini-series Two-Gun Mojo and Riders of the Worm and Such.Because of that, I had the hope that the very negative reviews received by the film Jonah Hex were due to the fact that the people had misunderstood the character, because he had never been really a hero, but a parody of the anti-heroes who are famous in the classic westerns.Needless to say I was wrong...Jonah Hex ended up being an atrocious experience which did not work as an action movie, as a comic adaptation nor as a western.The only thing I did not hate in Jonah Hex is Josh Brolin's solid performance in the leading role; pity that he is caught in such a bad movie.The rest of the actors do whatever they can with their poorly written characters; someone who is authentically wasted is John Malkovich as the boring and lacking of any personality villain.The screenplay from Jonah Hex is nothing more than an incongruent mess of confusing situations, badly written characters and the most rancid clich√©s from the western genre.Ugh...and did I mention the music from Marco Beltrami and the group Mastodon? That would have been an interesting combination in any other case, but I found it to be absolutely inappropriate to accompany a tedious story about cowboys, American pseudo-History and witchcraft.With the exception of Brolin's performance, I do not find anything positive to say about this movie.Besides of all the previously mentioned defects, the action scenes are very badly filmed and edited, something which is exacerbated by the irregular cinematography.In summary, Jonah Hex is a deplorable and vomiting film which, in my humble opinion, is among the worst films I have seen in 2010.
In Homefront, Jason Statham reveals a new facet of his talent: long hair. What will this mean for his career? No, one moment... false alarm. After the first 10 minutes, Statham goes back to his traditional shaved head. And at the same time, this movie returns to the same formula from almost all the films from this actor's filmography. However, I found Homefront entertaining despite not being very original or highly memorable. To start with, the characters are interesting because of a wide range of morality which doesn't guarantee a precise division between "good ones" and "evil ones". Director Gary Fleder finds beauty in the sinister marshes, without losing the dirty rural atmosphere which is appropriate for the fermentation of deep grudges. His handling of the action scenes is also appropriate, keeping the fights clear and dynamic without obfuscating us with excessive edition or camera movement. And, finally, the whole cast brings solid performances, from Statham, James Franco and Winona Ryder to Kate Bosworth, Clancy Brown and Rachelle Lefevre. In conclusion, Homefront is far from being an excellent movie, and it's not a very memorable experience, but I can give a moderate recommendation to it because it managed to keep me entertained.
I have been a fan of videogames for almost 30 years, and I think that during all that time, I never wished that the monsters, vehicles or characters from them were real.In fact, the main attraction from the videogames (at least in my case) is on the fantasy of puzzles, dangers and violence which are inoffensive and inconsequential, but which at the same time present challenges which are sufficiently realistic to stimulate the brain in the precise measure to keep us entertained.Because of that, I had some difficulties at swallowing the premise from the movie Gamer, whose story rounds on a futuristic game called "Slayers" in which the players remotely control real people on settings of frantic combat, with authentic blood and death to the losers...or at least, to the human "avatars" who danger their lives.In other words, it is like playing Call of Duty sitting comfortably in our homes, but with real people shooting to each other and trying to survive in the ultra-violent "multiplayer" encounters.The idea has some ingenuity, but its execution during the movie reveals various inconsistencies.I liked Crank and Crank: High Voltage, the other two films co-written and co-directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, pretty much, mainly because their ridiculous unreality was very well balanced by dynamic rhythms and interesting stories.Gamer is set on a similarly chaotic and over-the-top universe, but the problem is that it excessively complicates the screenplay.Nevertheless, the energetic direction from Neveldine and Taylor kept me moderately entertained during this movie.Besides, Gamer makes some narrative improvement during the last half hour, because the introduction of some characters changes the tone from the story a little bit, and it adds an interesting sci-fi angle.However, when we get closer to the ending, the movie goes back to use some typical clich√©s from action cinema, including the absurd and laughable participation from the chatterbox villain, who pretends to solve his problems by revealing the details of his strategy while he fights against the hero.Yeah, sure...that is what every criminal genius would make.So, in conclusion, the whole experience from Gamer did not leave me very satisfied, but I think I can give a slight recommendation to it because, as I previously mentioned, it kept me moderately entertained.
I liked them both, but I have honestly never been a big fan of Conan the Barbarian (1982) and its sequel, Conan the Destroyer; however, when I was a teenager, I read some of the original stories written by Robert E. Howard (1906-1936), and I liked its shameless abuse of sex, violence and absurd manifestations of macho heroism very much, which I now interpret as a possible parody of a genre which is famous because of its stylish excesses and repetitive formulas (even though there is quite a big debate on that subject). Anyway, I think that the film Conan the Barbarian (2011) took the right decision at ignoring the first film, and not trying to be a remake, but a new adaptation of the "pulp" novels which made the character famous in early 20th century. However, in spite of that good decision, the film is not very satisfactory...even though it kept me moderately entertained.The first 20 minutes from Conan the Barbarian (2011) were unexpectedly good, thanks to the dynamism from its narrative and the presence from Ron Perlman, who interprets his character with such an enthusiasm and dramatic conviction that he steals the whole movie. Unfortunately, his appearance is short, and after that 20 minutes, the movie gets mediocre, mainly because its "drama" is composed by heroic clich√©s, operetta dialogs and constant violence to make us believe the story is genuinely advancing. However, the level of blood is adequate, and the action scenes are moderately well filmed, with the exception of the final battle, which possesses the classical confusion and visual chaos from the modern action cinema.As for the main actor, Jason Momoa has a good physical shape for the character; however, his histrionic work feels weak, because I could never feel the wish of revenge his character has nor his internal conflict. Rose McGowan brings a good amount of energy and credibility to her role. And Rachel Nichols is also efficient in her role.In conclusion, Conan the Barbarian (2011) is a mediocre adaptation of an iconic literary figure, but it did not bore me, and I consider it worthy of a slight recommendation, with the warning that, unfortunately, the movie puts more emphasis on the action and the production design than in the narrative integrity, the force of the characters and the emotional realism.
To my knowledge, Mutant Chronicles was the first movie to be released in Blu-Ray, before being edited to the DVD.I guess that results appropriate, in sight of the process which was used during the production, which employed the well known green screen in order to later add epic digital scenarios.On the one hand, I like to see that that technique permits the elaboration of very ambitious movies which would have otherwise been unaffordable; but on the other hand, it is becoming into a dangerous trap with the potential of attracting directors who are very interested in the technology, but not much so in the quality from the screenplay.Robert Rodriguez fell on that trap with the horrible The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl, but he learnt enough to redeem himself with the excellent Sin City.What kind of movie does director Simon Hunter offer us in Mutant Chronicles, his digital debut? The answer is: entertaining, but not highly memorable.In order to enjoy Mutant Chronicles, the spectator has to accept from the beginning that the purpose from the movie is not replicating the reality, but creating an imaginative world of over the top emotions, desaturated colors and frenetic violence.We have to see Mutant Chronicles with the eyes of an artificial appearance, assimilating the rules it establishes and expecting the movie to follow them even though they do not always seem logical.The numerous samples of "steam-punk" technology are garish, and they go from everyday mechanisms to interplanetary spaceships.In summary, the production design represents one of the best elements from the movie.The screenplay is not as lucky, but it is well structured after all.The formula of "soldiers on a suicide mission" is not very innovative, and the characters are clich√©s, from the stoic anti-hero who is tortured by his past to the woman who fights for her sons and in order to redeem her violent past.However, the cast makes a good work with those clich√©s, and the actors who most stand out are Thomas Jane and Anna Walton.I would have liked to see in Mutant Chronicles some touches of humor, because it feels excessively serious on some moments.Nevertheless, I had a good time watching Mutant Chronicles, and I recommend it with the warning that the experience is not very memorable.
Even though the Paranormal Activity franchise has reached the point of saturation, I can't blame the studio Paramount Pictures for taking advantage of a successful formula, annually producing these movies on such a low cost that they would pay off even without being huge box office successes (I suppose they learned the lesson from Lionsgate and their failed sequel of The Blair Witch Project). Anyway, the point is that Paranormal Activity 4 is a very boring horror film which obviously represents a desperate strategy to extend the production of golden eggs without killing the hen.In Paranormal Activity 4, screenwriter Christopher Landon took the decision not to explain too much and leave the audience to complete the story in their minds. However, that feels like a laziness from Landon in order to replace narrative development for paranormal events which don't lead anywhere...and which aren't scary at all. In other words, the sudden movement of a chair isn't enough for justifying long moments in which we see the same static shots, or in which we have to see through every pixel in search of movement or paranormal manifestations. By this moment, we have already seen all the tricks offered by this formula, and the truth is that not enough things happen in order to satisfactorily fill in the short (which however feels long) running time of the film.On the positive side from Paranormal Activity 4, the actors feel quite natural in their roles, highlighting Kathryn Newton. Nevertheless, this is a tedious film which made me feel like wasting my time and my money, so I can't recommend it, specially when there are some excellent horror films (such as Absentia and Wake Wood) which are much worthier of our attention.
Despite all the acclamation poured into The Hurt Locker, I started watching it with pretty much skepticism, because I think the Irak war has already been examined in cinema from all the possible angles, not to mention that the protests against it feel increasingly tiring and irrelevant (even though they are right).However, The Hurt Locker ended up being a fascinating experience because of its innovative subject, lack of dull ideology, excellent performances and specially, because of Kathryn Bigelow's intense direction.One of the things I most liked in The Hurt Locker is that it does not pretend to instruct us about the failed reasons of the incursion in Irak, or repeating oil conspiracies or complaining about the lies about the weapons of mass destruction.It is simply focused on the experience from three soldiers specialized in disabling bombs, and it leaves us to interpret the situations from our points of view.And it also shows us brilliant scenes of action and war suspense.During the first seconds of The Hurt Locker, screenwriter Mark Boal establishes the message from the film: "War is a drug".And during the rest of the film, he shows us the effects of that addiction, making a realistic portrait of the dehumanization provoked by the uncertainty of combat, the impersonal management of the soldiers in the army and the psychological afflictions provoked by the horrible life conditions during war.But all those messages are set in the background from the movie, assimilating themselves to the spectator's point of view.On that way, the main attractions are the incredibly tense missions from the soldiers and the brilliant performances from the cast who interprets them.Jeremy Renner brings a very detailed development, which lets us see his character as a likable and competent man, but who is truly devastated in his soul.Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are also excellent, since they completely become on their characters.By the way, the marketing from The Hurt Locker emphasizes the presence in the cast from Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce and Evangeline Lilly, but their roles are so short that they could be considered as cameos.I understand that strategy, because the main actors from this film are relatively unknown, and in order to raise the profile from this movie, they hired famous names; however that could disappoint the spectators who expect to see Fiennes or Pearce as the centre of attention, when reality is very different.But really...the performances from Renner, Mackie and Geraghty are so powerful that I barely noticed the stars on their fleeting appearances.What takes me to the real star from this film: Bigelow.The filmography from this director includes some of my favourite movies (Near Dark, Strange Days and Point Break).However, in early 2000s, her career declined with two mediocre movies: The Weight of Water and K-19: The Widowmaker.However, after that low period in her career, Bigelow makes her return to glory with The Hurt Locker, at the same time she created precise, energetic and very exciting action scenes in this movie.However, I have to make clear that the action of The Hurt Locker is not based on massive battles, confusing shootouts or heroic displays of machismo.Compared with the excesses from directors like Michael Bay or Stephen Sommers, Bigelow's action seems slow and methodic...but it is infinitely more striking because of the emotional weight from this film.Besides, Bigelow creates an appropriate sensation of anguish on the action scenes, which perfectly shows the nightmare of being at war.The only complain I have against this film is that it has a few irrelevant moments.But that does not avoid me from giving a very enthusiastic recommendation to this excellent movie, which is absolutely worthy of the acclamation it is receiving.
I am definitely a fan of the exploitation cinema which prospered during the second half of 20th century, and because of that, I have contradictory opinions about the modern rebirth from that kind of cinema. On the one hand, I like to see those modest movies full of violence, sex and melodrama finally validated as legitimate entertainment; but on the other hand, some of these modern movies tend to only imitate the shape, and not the background which defined that legendary cinema. And besides, the exploitation phenomenon and its distinctive personality are intimately bound to the time in which it was most popular. Going straight to the point, thanks to the enthusiasm from filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth and Robert Rodriguez (among many others), we have recently seen various movies which emulate the subjects and aesthetic from the exploitation cinema, but without reaching the same amazement reaction and pervasive delight which originally distinguished it. Drive Angry 3D belongs to that category, and even though I appreciate the intention it had of entertaining us at any cost, it feels shy in many occasions, when it should have been much more audacious and aggressive. Despite that, I had a good time while I was watching it, and I think it deserves a moderate recommendation for those spectators who do not expect to find an epic action film, but a slice of nostalgic automotive violence and exaggerated melodrama, but not lacking of a sense of humor and irony.This is obviously not a film to take very seriously, but it fulfills with its purpose of creating various action scenes, naughty humor and even a little bit of emotive drama. And something which helped to that are the solid performances from a cast who perfectly comprehended the tone required by the film. To start with, Nicolas Cage is perfect in the leading role, because he is enough tough to loom credible during the action scenes, but with emotional deepness in his face in order to credibly express the tortured past and inexistent future from his character.I also liked Amber Heard's performance. I had found her works in films like Zombieland and All the Boys Love Mandy Lane to be adequate, but she reveals more histrionic potential in Drive Angry 3D. But William Fichtner steals the show as "The Accountant"...he takes an absolute possession of his character, and his performance is so good that I would even like to see a movie with his character in the leading role.Unfortunately, the direction is not as good as the performances. Patrick Lussier has improved very much as a director from his work in pieces of crap like The Prophecy 3: The Ascent, Dracula II: Ascencion and White Noise: The Light, and he undoubtedly acquired experience in the B-cinema with the very entertaining remake of My Bloody Valentine. However, his direction in Drive Angry 3D feels impersonal and lacking of the vigor required by the exploitation cinema. The 3D in Drive Angry is well employed, but the car accidents and chases occasionally loose the scale and impact with the extra ornament of 3D cinematography. As for the gore, I think this film falls short in various occasions, like if it is scared of showing too much blood or excessively brutal violence. However, I liked Drive Angry 3D, mainly because I had an entertaining time while I was watching it.
Curious...two films in a same year which make a tribute to the origins of cinema. I liked Hugo pretty much, but I think The Artist is a highly superior movie, because its overflowing charm fascinated me from the very beginning and provoked a constant smile on me, until leading to a magnificent ending.The first thing which draws the attention in The Artist is the fact that it was filmed like if it was really done in the late 20s or early 30s, in black and white, without sound and with a musical accompaniment in order to accentuate the emotions from the scenes (oh, and I also have to mention the interstitial banners with selected dialogs from the characters). So, The Artist could be grouped into the modern tendency of "retro" cinema; however, the truth is that the anachronistic style of The Artist is not a gimmick (like it has been in many movies), but an essential part of the narrative, so as a consequence, the shape enriches the substance, and vice-versa, telling the story with a big ingenuity and an obvious love for that incipient period of cinema, when the formulas we can find nowadays were forged.Director and screenwriter Michel Hazanavicius made a brilliant work at capturing the atmosphere, rhythm and texture of mute cinema. I would also like to mention the special effects, which are deceptively invisible but indispensable in order to bring the Hollywood from that period to life. As for performances, Jean Dujardin and B√©r√©nice Bejo bring wonderful works, reaching that exact point of theatrical exaggeration and intimate detail the best actors from that period possessed. We tend to watch old films almost like involuntary comedies, full of apparatus expressions and excessive melodrama, but the actors were testing the limits of the new medium, and their best exponents (such as Buster Keaton, Lillian Gish and Lon Chaney) discovered the balance which was perfectly captured by Dujardin and Bejo.The screenplay from The Artist is perfectly written, and it even includes some ingenious implementations of clich√©s which end up taking an unexpected twist. In conclusion, The Artist is absolutely worthy of applause and a very enthusiastic recommendation, because to the aficionados of classic cinema, it will be a great nostalgic experience, and to the modern generations, it will be an extraordinary and hugely entertaining History lesson, which is much funnier and more emotive than any book about the cinema of the period portrayed in here.
Sometimes, it's difficult to evaluate the technical and narrative attributes of a film which exposes socially relevant or culturally significant subjects... something which, thinking about it well, is appropriate in the big context of cinema as an artistic discipline. In other words, when the message is very important, it doesn't seem prudent to focus on dramatic arches, structure or even less "entertainment" too much (specially when the historical fidelity takes precedence over the Hollywood formulas). I said all that to express the fact that I found the film Selma a bit irregular, but nevertheless, recommended and very interesting due to its emotive and inflexible depiction of transcendent events in modern History. That's the main strength of Selma, but not its only attribute. The whole cast makes an excellent work in their roles, starting by David Oyelowo, who brings an extraordinary performance in the leading role. The rest of the cast is equally worthy of applause, highlighting Tom Wilkinson, Andr√© Holland and Wendell Pierce. I also liked the cinematography, which is slightly desaturated in order to bring the film a retro air which increments the gravity of the scenes, as well as the perfect soundtrack. On the negative side, I have to go back to the previously mentioned irregularity. I appreciate the effort made by screenwriter Paul Webb to cover all the possible aspects of the story, but that ambition ends up bringing us some unnecessary and kinda forced scenes which distract the attention from the main matter. And I also noticed a tendency to the monologues which explain things which are more or less obvious, because they summarize thing we have already seen on the screen. However, Selma is a solid and satisfactory film which I can recommend with confidence, despite a few brush-strokes which are a bit out of place.
I generally like the filmography from director and screenwriter Pedro Almod√≥var very much, and I think that his best film so far is Los Abrazos Rotos, which I found absolutely fascinating and hugely satisfactory. That made me have very big expectations before watching La Piel que Habito, his most recent film.Unfortunately, La Piel que Habito ended up disappointing me pretty much, and I think that (with the exception of La Mala Educaci√≥n) it is Almod√≥var's least achieved film so far, because it is so committed to surprising us with its ingenuity that it sabotages a moderately interesting story with an excessive number of characters, hollow grotesqueness and unnecessary turns in order to lead to a too simple message.Many people have mentioned the fact that La Piel que Habito is a horror film, or at least, an interpretation of the horror genre filtered through Almod√≥var's sensibility; however, I consider it a melodrama where there is not any real suspense or fear, but a group of turbid characters tortured by the obsession, by tragic family secrets, and the internal and external fight of their sexual identity. The problem is that I never found the "dramatic unifying" to bring meaning or validity to those concepts. Besides, the elements of "clinical horror" Almod√≥var incorporated into the melodrama look like tributes (or "loans") to films which were genuinely interested in examining the relationship between body and mind, such as Dans Ma Peau, Les Yeux Sans Visage and the classic work from director David Cronenberg. Needless to say I found them much more interesting alternatives than the sterile La Piel que Habito.Nevertheless, I think I can give La Piel que Habito a slight recommendation, because of its solid technical aspects and the fact that the screenplay kept me moderately interested (despite its various fails -besides of the previously mentioned ones, the big twist is too predictable, something which considerably decreases its impact-). As for the performances, Antonio Banderas and Elena Anaya feel excessively cold and distant in their roles, even in the most intense moments, while Marisa Paredes, Jan Cornet and Blanca Su√°rez bring solid performances. In conclusion, La Piel que Habito is not bad, but it disappointed me pretty much, because I expect much more from a great filmmaker like Almod√≥var.
In 2003, the film Wrong Turn took the formula from The Hills Have Eyes (1977), and it showed it with enough style and energy to make it very entertaining; 4 years later, the sequel, Wrong Turn 2: Dead End, came out, and it ended up being a very nice surprise, because it was pretty entertaining and violent.Of course that, after those two very competent horror films, my expectations for Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead were high...unfortunately, I ended up very disappointed with it.I liked the idea of facing the villain with equally dangerous and aggressive enemies, but screenwriter Connor James Delaney excessively entangled the story, dividing it on various slopes which do not conjugate with each other to provoke suspense or horror.The villain Three Toes is left on the background for a long time, something which makes us to get very bored with the tedious discussions between prisoners and policemen.After a while, I started to laugh when someone said "I am gonna kill you!", because they never fulfilled with their threats, even when it would have been logical or even convenient for them to do it.And I have not even mentioned the sub-plot of the money lost in the woods, which gives place for more tedious discussions and death threats.The main problem is that Delaney lost the control from the story.Besides, the deficient special effects provoke more laughs than horror and I found the conversion of Three Toes on a species of mutant Rambo absolutely ridiculous.What is more, every single character is absolutely generic.So, in summary, Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead is a boring and very disappointing horror film, and which is very far away from reaching the level from the first two films.I do not recommend it.
It is easy to prejudge Observe and Report, because the plot summary from this movie seems to indicate that it will explore the same territory as the atrocious Paul Blart: Mall Cop, because we also have a security guard from a shopping whose detective fantasies and delusions of greatness contrast with his ineptitude and zero authority.So, I started watching Observe and Report expecting a horrible movie, but I ended up taking a very nice surprise with it, because this comedy shows unexpected audacity and a twisted sense of humor which is much more dark and subversive than many comedies which imitate director Judd Apatow's style (like Semi-Pro or Forgetting Sarah Marshall).The result was a simultaneously funny, dramatic...and also disturbing experience.Although it is structured as a comedy (and it really has various hilarious moments), I think it would be more precise to describe Observe and Report as a perverse parody which uses the bipolar disorder as a replacement of the generic stupidity which usually motivates the immature characters from the new North American comedy.By adding a medical condition as an excuse of the inappropriate and scandalous behaviours from the main character, the movie achieves to set itself on a different level, where the jokes keep being funny but they leave a bad taste which stays with the spectator for a long time.To explain this more clearly, I will compare two similar scenes on their shape, but deeply different on their effect: on the film Role Models, Paul Rudd's character insults a kid with enthusiasm, and that made me laugh because it shows the immature adult catching up to the level of his child rival; on Observe and Report, Seth Rogen's character makes the same, but his face expresses genuine aggression which borders on the abuse, and although that scene made me laugh, it is accompanied by a sensation of pity on the character.The best element is that things like that feel very natural in this movie.The fails I found on it are some forced moments and other ones which feel a bit unnecessary.However, I liked Observe and Report pretty much because of its audacious intention, grotesque humor and solid performances.Rogen shows a lot of conviction on his character; Ray Liotta perfectly transmits intensity on his role; Anna Faris is very funny (as always); Michael Pe√±a is brilliant as a Mexican security guard; and Patton Oswalt has a short but funny appearance.It may not be a great film, but I found Observe and Report to be a very competent comedy, and I recommend it with confidence.
I usually pay a lot of attention to the consistency and credibility (note that I did not say "realism") of the movies I watch, and I frequently end up hating those ones which ignore every common sense, without even trying to seem plausible.But once in a while, I come across with a movie like Law Abiding Citizen, which transcends its absolute senseless in order to entertain us with an interesting premise and a provocative message which in a big degree compensates its logical holes.In other words: I cannot believe I had such a good time watching an intentionally ridiculous movie.The chain of events from Law Abdiding Citizen is progressively more absurd and unbelievable.However, the dynamic direction, the competent performances and the interesting story made me to "plunge" myself into the movie, and they made me to feel very curious on how the ending was going to be.In summary, in spite of its fails, I had a very entertaining time watching this movie.Besides, independently from its logic or coherence, the movie rounds on a fascinating moral disjunctive, represented by the opposites (but at the same time compatibles) points of view from the main characters.On the one hand, we have a man looking for revenge, and who feels disappointed because of the subjective nature from the judicial system; and on the other hand, we have a prosecutor who has the best intentions of punishing the guilty ones, but who feels himself engaged to follow the laws which guarantee protection and civil rights even to the worst criminals.Under that impossible dilemma, it is difficult to determine who is the hero and who is the villain in this movie, and I guess that the answer will be different to every spectator, according to his/her philosophy or personal experience.But the simple fact that an apparently hollow action film offers those interesting levels is enough reason to recommend Law Abiding Citizen.Director F. Gary Gray drives the movie at a very good rhythm, at the same time he could extract solid performances from Gerard Butler, Jamie Foxx, Bruce McGill, Colm Meaney and the brilliant Viola Davis.Law Abiding Citizen undoubtedly has some forced coincidences and inconsistencies in its screenplay.However, I enjoyed it pretty much, because of its ambition of doing something different in the sub-genus "vigilante looking for revenge".I recommend this film with confidence.
Following the example of Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Red Riding Hood (2011), the film Mirror Mirror takes the most basic concepts of a famous fairy tale as a starting point, and it disfigures it until leading to an unrecognizable modern and revisionist version whose purpose, moral or function I don't reach to comprehend. Nevertheless, I'm not against the procedure...after all, this fairy tales have been suffering uncountable variations since its beginnings in the European folklore, and it isn't wrong to impulse its evolution for the consumption of modern sensibilities. The problem comes when the effort invested on the re-imagination isn't enough for making an entertaining movie, and that's a clear example of what happened to Mirror Mirror.The changes made by Mirror Mirror are the following: the conflict between Snow White and her step-mom isn't because of beauty, but because of political ideology; the "dwarves" aren't miners, but highwaymen; the Prince is profiling from the beginning as a reluctant fianc√© of the Queen; and the mirror isn't a mirror, but some kind of portal to a parallel world (I suppose so?) in which the Queen saves her conscience (or something like that?). In fact, the story is so different that I expected a pitched battle in the ending, like it had happened in Alice in Wonderland (2010). However, instead of that, there's a fight against a monster (?). Well, to be exact, there's another ending, which I won't describe, but I will say that it's so bad that I wanted to take my eyes off while I was watching it.The production design from Mirror Mirror is extremely opulent and elaborate, and it can be noticed a fetish for the golden colors, the over-designed dresses and such extreme disguises which would be even rejected by singer Bj√∂rk. Anyway, the point is that there are some attractive images in Mirror Mirror, but that isn't enough to rescue the movie from being tedious. Julia Roberts brings an extremely forced performance as the Queen, while Lily Collins feels insipid as Snow White. Armie Hammer brings some enthusiasm to his role, but his character is so poorly written that he's not given too much to do.In conclusion, Mirror Mirror is a boring film with a badly raised and executed idea. As a consequence, I can't recommend it. I just hope that the film Snow White and the Huntsman, another re-invention of the same fairytale we will see in a few months, will be better than this one.
I generally like the minimalistic movies with one location and few actors (or even only one), because they present intriguing challenges for the filmmakers who decide to approach them. To start with, it's indispensable to work with an interesting story, with twists and ingredients which keep the audience's attention. Besides, in many cases, they have to dispense with those dramatic tools which are incompatible with this style, such as exposition, sub-plots and occasionally even dialogs, something which severely limits the possibility of "explaining" the spectators what is going on. And it is also important to find actors with a strong scenic presence and enough talent in order to instantly incorporate us into that world. I'm glad to say that the film All is Lost could overcome those challenges, because I found it a brilliant movie with a strong emotional content and an excellent performance from an authentic Hollywood legend. It's obvious that Robert Redford keeps having the "star quality" which made him famous various decades ago. The narrative from All is Lost is methodic and paused, refraining from creating big moments of action or dramatic fuss, something which was a very appropriate decision. The strategy of "simmering" the story allows a gradual increment of the suspense which makes the main character's fleeting triumphs and frequent disappointments more intense and real... and confirms us that the most important tools for his survival won't be his knife, his compass or his water supply, but an unwavering will and the persistent hope of being rescued. The only thing I can say against All is Lost is that, during a brief moment, the rhythm seems to go down a little bit. Nevertheless, All is Lost is a fascinating experience, and I recommend it with enthusiasm.
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 is a horrible film, and the worst one from the saga so far. To start with, this first episode of the fourth part introduces new elements only to leave them aside and waste their potential, and the story feels terribly boring.The supposed romance which should sustain this film feels absolutely bland and uninteresting. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson bring atrocious performances as the leading couple, while the rest of the cast seems to be there only in order to charge a paycheck.The previous filmography from director Bill Condon includes two excellent films (Gods and Monsters and Kinsey), but it is obvious that he made The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 as a mercenary, because his work feels absolutely listless and lacking of any vision.I have to mention that The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 offers some moments of involuntary humor. From the pathetic performances brought by Stewart and Pattinson to the weak special effects, there are some opportunities to laugh at the technical, histrionic and narrative blunders from this film. And since I just mentioned the special effects, the werewolves look totally fake, and they appear in one of the worst scenes I have seen in a long time...one of those which provoke an absolute embarrassment combined with the incredulity of knowing that someone considered that a good idea.In conclusion, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 is an unbearable film, which made me snooze very frequently and made me feel like wasting my time. I know that this film is having many female fans...I respect them, but I honestly do not understand them.
I wasn't interested in watching Safe House, because I'm already tired of those generic thrillers which try to create emotion and suspense by recycling concepts we have already seen too many times (and sometimes better executed) in recent films. To my surprise, Safe House ended up leaving me pretty satisfied, because its screenplay contains new-flanged elements which generate interest and captured my attention until leading to a solid ending.I generally like the "alliance of enemies against a same threat" formula, because it brings a moral conflict which clouds the "good ones vs. bad ones" transparency. And sure, when the CIA comes into the scene, we know that it won't be easy to determine who the authentic bad ones are. So, even though the screenplay from Safe House includes some conventional elements, it also includes new-flanged ones, at the same time that it fulfills with its function of creating enough shootouts, chases and fights in order to keep us excited, while we also have some unexpected turns which create uncertainty about the main characters' authentic motivation. As for the action sequences, they are very well choreographed, and with the exact balance of extravagance and realism, stretching our credibility, but without crossing to ridiculous fields.And then, we also have the competent performances from the whole cast. Ryan Reynolds is intense and credible in his role, while Denzel Washington displays aplomb and spontaneity as the villain. As for the supporting cast, we can find solid performances from the excellent actors Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga and Robert Patrick. So, Safe House isn't a great movie, but it kept me very entertained while I was watching it, and I think that that makes it worthy of a recommendation. Director Daniel Espinosa showed a good hand for the action scenes, and an interesting style during the whole movie, so it will be interesting to see his future projects.
The Five-Year Engagement is a romantic comedy which had the good intentions of not meekly following the clich√©s of the genre, and of basing its humor on the interaction and nature of the characters, instead of searching for trite slapstick or scatological jokes. This film aspired to a realistic and sincere tone in order to examine some real couple problems...however, its main problems are that it's longer than it should, and that it should have provoked more laughs in order to satisfy as a comedy. Nevertheless, I have to admit that it kept me moderately interested because of the solid performances and some valid reflections about contemporary relationships.The main pro of The Five-Year Engagement is the cast, which makes the TWO HOURS the movie takes in order to tell a story which frequently tends to wander on tiring and not very interesting sub-plots more bearable. During those digressions, Mindy Kaling, Brian Posehn, Chris Pratt and Chris Parnell come and go without too much purpose, but they take the maximum advantage of their dialogues and superficial characters. In the leading roles, Jason Segel and Emily Blunt are credible and have a good chemistry with each other.What works the least in The Five-Year Engagement are the psychological analogies which arise as a consequence of Blunt's character's job. The "social experiments" she makes at college have obvious parallels to her romantic engagement and the long wait of her wedding, and I suppose they help in order to reinforce the film's message...but, let's accept it, the message isn't exactly deep, so I don't think that so many turns were necessary in order to express it. Instead of that, I would have preferred a more concise and disciplined screenplay, with less distractions and tangents, even if that would have sacrificed a percentage of the humor, because the diffuse narrative focus is kinda frustrating, and demerits the pros from this film. Nevertheless, I think I can give The Five-Year Engagement a slight recommendation because of the good performances and some interesting aspects from the screenplay.
Director Chan-wook Park became famous all over the world with his "vengeance trilogy". And even though I liked those three films (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Oldboy and Lady Vengeance) very much, it was also pleasant to see Park exploring different horizons with the untraditional romantic comedy I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK, and more recently, with the film Thirst, which represents an unusual and very interesting vampire film, where the bloody scenes provoke the same level of impact as the evolution of the two main characters and the twisted way their relationship follows. However, Thirst is not a perfect film: there are some unnecessary elements in the screenplay, and some changes of tone feel a bit forced. Nevertheless, that is offset to some point by the interesting story, the perfect control Park has over his actors and the visual style with which he creates attractive images and moments of an intense emotional strength. In this last aspect, and I will say this with the fear of falling into the hyperbole, Park's direction remembered me to some point to filmmaker Orson Welles (1915-1985)' work, due to the care he brings to every frame and to every camera movement.Besides, Thirst is faithful to the vampire subject, because it respects the "biological" precepts from the myth, wisely avoiding its most theatrical and bland characteristics...something which is an indirect way to say that there is an abundant level of blood and violence in this movie. And, in the Oldboy tradition, the violence is very graphic and direct. The vampires from Thirst are not the sophisticated ones from the books written by Anne Rice, nor the stylish monsters from Underworld or Blade. The characters from Thirst are realistic and imperfect persons with a strange illness which tests their conscience, as well as their capacity to survive one more day at the expense of losing their humanity.So, despite not being an excellent film, I liked Thirst pretty much, and I think it deserves a safe recommendation as a very interesting experience which I would not classify as a "horror film", but as an intense passional drama with supernatural subjects which work as analogies of the reasoning and the spirituality when they are cloudy by the passion.
As an aficionado to the literature about conspiracies, "hidden knowledge" and more historical curiosities of a doubtful veracity, I have read a little bit about the theories which propose the falsehood of William Shakespeare (1564-1616) as an author of the plays, poems and sonnets which made him such famous...and I honestly don't find them very convincing theories. Even without being a historian, and without being able to confirm the contradictions about dates and places, it's clear to me that the focal point of these "conspiracies" is simply claiming that Shakespeare couldn't have written the most acclaimed English literature for not having the necessary social connections, education and culture in order to achieve that. In other words, those investigators suggest the fact that the greatness from a person is determined by his/her money or social position, and that it's impossible for any "commoner" to possess the necessary talent in order to stand out in his/her occupation. Under that logic, every millionaire person should be an artistic and scientific genius.The film Anonymous tried to examine that hypothesis about Shakespere, and even though I liked it, I think its screenplay should have been better polished, because its frequent chronological jumps, court intrigues and numerous characters make it occasionally a bit confusing and tiring. Nevertheless, I have to admit that Anonymous generally kept me interested.Anonymous recreates London in 16th century with an absolute realism and attention to every detail; from the mud on the floor to the extraordinary replica of the Globe theatre, all the visual elements are brilliant, even though they occasionally draw more attention than the necessary. The narrative aspect also suffers from some excesses, and I think that the film could have been a bit shorter by deleting some of the most tangled plans from the villains (or even from the heroes).The whole cast from Anonymous brings solid performances, highlighting Rhys Ifans, Vanessa Redgrave and Rafe Spall. So, in conclusion, I think Anonymous deserves a moderate recommendation despite some tiring moments, because it generally kept me interested.
In 1996, the film Twister employed a hollow screenplay as an excuse to display the then impressive special effects from Industrial Light and Magic. And now, 18 years later, Into the Storm repeats the formula with bad performances, excessively bland direction and a weak screenplay. However, I have to admit that the movie offers brilliant special effects, which made me feel sorry for the fact that they weren't part of a better film. In other words, the moments which Into the Storm dedicates to its characters are increasingly irritating and boring. But when we listen to the sound of the wind and the roar of the tornadoes, we can appreciate the digital magic, which is an end by itself in here. As for the characters, they represent the range of stereotypes we have seen in many disaster movies: the brave scientists with all the answers (even though nobody listens to them); the youngsters in love in danger of getting separated; the stoic hero with family problems; the ignorant louts who don't take the risk seriously until it's too late; and the villain who puts his interests above other people's lives (even though he eventually has the opportunity to redeem himself). In conclusion, I can't recommend Into the Storm, because even though the special effects are excellent, it fails in its screenplay, direction and performances.
Prediction: the "flares" (optical flashes) will be to this decade what the blue mist was to the '80s. They seem cool in their time, but they will quickly age and will be seen as ridiculous once the trend is over. That's the only thing I was left with the film Total Recall (2012), another unnecessary remake which is so premature that it was impossible for me not to watch it making constant comparisons with the hugely superior original version, which was directed by the great Paul Verhoeven. But anyway, director Len Wiseman had commented that his remake follows the original story written by Philip K. Dick (1928-1982) with more fidelity, so there should be place for both versions, right?To start with, the fact that Total Recall (2012) is more faithful to Dick's short story is a fallacy. Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback's screenplay omitted any reference to Mars, to the extraterrestrial invasion, and specially, it ignores the cunning sense of humor which distinguished Dick, and which Total Recall (1990) had adapted so well. At the same time, I found details from an uncertain precedence confusing, such as "Quaid"'s name. The main character from the short story is called Quail, but he became Quaid when Arnold Schwarzenegger played it 22 years ago; so...Which version did Total Recall (2012) exactly adapt? And I could also point out the incongruous presence of the famous prostitute with three breasts, who doesn't make too much sense because there aren't "mutants" this time. Sure, they are tiny details which don't affect the global narrative (it already has various problems by itself), but they illustrate the condescension from Total Recall (2012), and its lack of vision in order to offer us a new interpretation of the story, instead of limiting itself to duplicate scenes, but with better special effects.And that's how we lead to the main pro from Total Recall (2012): the special effects. Legacy Effects, MPC and half a dozen of additional studios contributed to create a brilliant futuristic world which borrows elements from Blade Runner, Minority Report and I, Robot, but with a level of detail and realism which has rarely been seen in fantastic cinema. And I also have to say that the action scenes are decently filmed. Kate Beckinsale brings conviction to her character; and besides, she looks very good when she threateningly walks between killer robots (I'm sorry...personal fetish). On the opposite, Jessica Biel lacks of credibility and personality in her role. And finally, Colin Farrell makes an adequate work as the hero. However, this film didn't leave me very satisfied mainly because of the screenplay's various weaknesses, since it doesn't only copy too many scenes from the original film, but there's also little excitement in the story, and a low level of suspense and interest in the main character's adventures. Once more, we have the classic modular structure of exchangeable scenes which don't form a coherent story, but simply present a parade of stunts and special effects which are well done even though they are irrelevant after all. I guess that the addition of a weak political subtext pretended to bring substance to the screenplay; however, the "class struggle" has become the fashionable clich√© (like the terrorism was some years ago), so I can't take it seriously as science fiction with a social conscience, but just as a trick to bring moral reason to the explosions and destruction.Nevertheless, I think I can give Total Recall (2012) a slight recommendation, because it managed to keep me moderately entertained despite its various fails. However, it kinda left me with a bitter taste, because once this film ended, I started to speculate of the potential its story would have had if the film had shown more faith in the ideas than in the special effects.
For various years, we have been watching several films which use the terrorist attack which happened on September 11th, 2001 as a dramatic element; sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. But one way or another, I find it an easy trick in order to obtain an automatic emotional response, which doesn't require too much preparation nor development in order to make an impact on the spectator. That's the sensation I had after watching Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, a film with a good premise irregularly developed, and which is excessively forced on its attempt to make us cry at any cost.I found the concept of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close moderately interesting, because the investigation of a mystery which links a kid to his father evokes some intense family feelings. However, screenwriter Eric Roth (who adapted a book written by Jonathan Safran Foer) drives the story on an excessively forced way, making us swallow improbable situations and submitting us to a diffuse narrative structure, which is not afraid of violating its own logic whenever it has the chance of showing another cloying scene, or a new conflict which complicates the things. But what I least liked about Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is the fact that it deposits the story on a kinda antipathetic character.Don't misunderstand me...I think Thomas Horn brings a good performance in that role. The problem is that his character is written as a very intelligent boy, but who is so capricious and arrogant that I ended up finding him frequently irritating. As for the supporting actors, they weren't given too much material to work with. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock don't interpret very substantial characters, and even though Max von Sydow makes an adequate work in his role, I found his character a bit irrelevant. The same can be said about Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright: they make a decent work in their roles, but their characters feel kinda unnecessary.In conclusion, I think Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close deserves a slight recommendation because it kept me moderately entertained while I was watching it. However, the film didn't leave me very satisfied. Or maybe it was my habitual cynicism what avoided me to "plunge" myself into a story told from the point of view of a kid.
I have already complained in other occasions about the various bad horror films which are exhibited in cinemas, while many very good or excellent films of the genre languish in the darkness of the straight-to-DVD market, due to a poor distribution system which is incapable of recognizing genuine quality when it is in front of it. Unfortunately, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is another recent victim of that phenomenon...shelved for a long time and without a defined distribution contract, but with a big number of followers thanks to its presence in multiple film festivals. Anyway...I am not going to spend more time explaining that sad situation. I will better focus on the movie itself, which despite not being something great by my point of view, is a very satisfactory and entertaining horror comedy.To start with, the screenplay from Tucker and Dale vs. Evil includes very interesting twists, as well as ingenious changes of points of view employed by co-screenwriters Eli Craig (who was also the director) and Morgan Jurgenson in order to create two parallel and to some point contradictory stories, but which also both feel consistent and complementary. So, I have to say I found the screenplay simultaneously hilarious, interesting and emotive, specially when it plays with our perception of the "rural horror" in order to explore new narrative possibilities which are not common to find in a horror comedy.Another important pro from Tucker and Dale vs. Evil comes from its two main actors. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk make a perfect couple as Tucker and Dale, and their performances are so good that the friendship between their characters feels absolutely honest from the beginning to the end. Besides, the spontaneous attitude they both bring to their works makes their characters to feel human, even when their actions border on the caricature. Katrina Bowden is a genuine revelation in this movie. Having seen her for various years as the vacuous and naive Cerie in 30 Rock, I expected her performance in Tucker and Dale vs. Evil to be the one of a typical "final girl" with a pretty face but few histrionic talent; however, she ended up destroying that expectation with an absolutely credible and likable performance in here.The complains I have against Tucker and Dale vs. Evil are that the romantic component feels occasionally a bit weakly written, and that a few scenes break the flow from the film (such as the one of an improvised session of group therapy). For the rest, I enjoyed Tucker and Dale vs. Evil pretty much, and I consider it worthy of a safe recommendation. Pity that this film was condemned to the darkness by the distributors, because it really does not deserve it.
One of my favorite comedies is Adventures in Babysitting, in which a responsible teenager from the suburbs of Chicago has to get into the dangerous city with the kids she's looking after, in order to help her best friend; and it's needless to say that the babysitter and the three kids have many "PG-13" adventures before going back to their respective homes. The result was a wonderful experience which keeps being enjoyed regardless of how many times it has been watched, and of how many years have gone by since it was made. So, it was unavoidable the fact that some executive from Hollywood was going to copy the formula, changing it enough in order not to pay for the rights and not to call it a remake. The result is The Sitter, a mediocre comedy, which despite having similarities in the plot with Adventures in Babysitting, employs a much coarser sense of humor.The ones who don't appreciate Jonah Hill's comic style will surely hate this film, because we see him making his routine of a vulgar, even though without any malice and with a big heart, nerd during the whole movie. Personally, I have always found this actor likable, and that's the main reason why The Sitter kept me moderately entertained. The kids Landry Bender, Max Records and Kevin Hern√°ndez have a good chemistry with Hill, and they show naturalness in their performances. On the side of the villains, we have Sam Rockwell as a sensitive and extremely fickle drug dealer, who can go from the tears to the violence in a matter of seconds. Rockwell is an extraordinary actor, but in this film, he took his character to the extreme of the caricature, with which he eliminated the few realism this movie could have had, and extinguishes the air of threaten his character should inspire to the sitter and the three boys. As for Ari Graynor, she makes a very good work in her role; pity that her appearance is very short.Despite having some positive elements, The Sitter didn't leave me very satisfied, mainly because I found it bland and lacking of energy. It seems that co-screenwriters Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka auto-censored themselves, and they didn't dare to take the film to subversive levels which would have made it more entertaining. Nevertheless, I think I can give The Sitter a slight recommendation, even though it definitely didn't live up to the potential of being an adult version of Adventures in Babysitting.
The original Fright Night is one of my favorite movies from the 80's, because of its excellent balance of comedy and genuine horror, remarkable special effects and an ingenious screenplay which distinguished it from the slasher cinema which was in vogue in that time. A few years ago, I decided to watch it again, and I discovered that it aged pretty well, because the story keeps working perfectly well and the visual style does not feel very archaic. Now, the remake of that film is mediocre, but moderately entertaining.Marti Nixon's screenplay from Fright Night (2011) presents an adequate definition of the characters, something which is endorsed by the solid performances from Anton Yelchin, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Toni Collette. However, I think that the screenplay totally failed with the character Peter Vincent, mainly because his presence feels excessively forced and illogical; honestly, who would ask for advice to a Criss Angel wannabe to exterminate a vampire? That does not make too much sense. And, to worse the situation, David Tennant (an actor I admire because of his extraordinary work in the TV series Doctor Who) brings an irritating and too over the top performance in that character. Another important fail from the movie is that, when we are near the ending, the screenplay offers ridiculous coincidences and stupid "surprises".As for the villain, Colin Farrell is a bit insipid in his role, something which is exacerbated by the fact that his character is a bit superficially written. As for the special effects, we have digital tricks made with a variable expertise, because while we have some good samples of synthetic gore, there are complex action sequences (like the one which is developed on board of a car) which feel so obviously filmed in "green screen" that they loose some impact. In spite of that, I appreciate the fact that they never draw too much attention nor obstruct the narrative...at least until the ending.In conclusion, Fright Night (2011) kept me moderately entertained despite its various fails, and I think that that makes it worthy of a slight recommendation. However, my absolute suggestion would be for you to watch the original film if you have not done it yet.
School of Rock is a brilliant comedy, not only because of its excellent screenplay, but also because of Richard Linklater's perfect direction and the conviction and energy brought by Jack Black in the leading role. That's why I was filled with enthusiasm when I found out the fact that Black and Linklater were going to collaborate together again in a film called Bernie, based on a strange crime committed in a small town from Texas in the '90s. The final result is an excellent movie with a screenplay which is difficult to classify but easy to enjoy.If Bernie wasn't based on a true story (which reinforces the old "reality is stranger than fiction" adagio), it would be difficult to accept the main character's bizarre behavior, as well as the unusual reaction from the inhabitants of the town when they found out the secret from its most admired citizen. Black brings a very good performance in the leading role, and his character can be interpreted under our particular perception. Linklater stresses that ambiguity with a tragicomic atmosphere which clouds its genuine intention...Is it a black comedy made in the Coen Brothers style? Or a cynical rural drama such as In Cold Blood? Nevertheless, the answer isn't very important, because some of the main reasons this is such an interesting movie are its ethical dilemmas and the contradictory opinions of the inhabitants from the town in which this film is set.In fact, I have the theory that co-screenwriters Linklater and Skip Hollandsworth employed the singular story just as a disguise of the authentic purpose from Bernie: a simultaneously critical and affectionate examination of the social dynamics from small towns, in which everyone knows (or believes to know) the lives of others, and where public opinion is more important that the objective truth (in case such thing exists). Matthew McConaughey brings a perfect performance as the arrogant attorney who has finally found an enough juicy case in order to apply his sharp investigative instincts (at least in his own opinion); and Shirley MacLaine is brilliant in her role, being simultaneously able to bring a dominant and vulnerable personality to her character.In my humble opinion, the best thing about Bernie is its lack of answers. The screenplay might girded to true events, but behind those facts, there's a universe of possible interpretations whose definition is up to us. The only thing I can say against Bernie is that a few details from the screenplay could have been a bit more explored. However, I enthusiastically recommend it as a fascinating and very entertaining experience.
The Giver is another futuristic film based on a juvenile novel about a young man who ends up being "the chosen one". But, well, to be fair, The Giver is based on a book which was published 21 years ago (even before the first Harry Potter novel), something which brings it an advantage over the avalanche of imitators. Unfortunately, this chronological "advantage" doesn't make it a good film; on the opposite, I found The Giver the worst adaptation of a juvenile novel so far, because of its improbable premise, forced narrative, and specially, the unbearable boredom it generates. As for the cast, Jeff Bridges is the only member who shows credibility (despite how poorly written his character is); the rest of the actors feels absolutely insipid and listless. So, the novel The Giver was ahead of the other ones which would later adopt its formula, but the film The Giver came too late to the party, and nothing of what it offers wakes any interest or excitement. As always, I have to point out the fact that this review exclusively refers to the movie, which should be able to hold itself on its own merits, without requiring us to read the novel in order for us to "understand" the emotions it had to transmit. However, I found this film an absolute disaster, and I regret having wasted my time and my money on it.
The acclaimed film American Beauty opened many doors to director Sam Mendes, but it could also be argued that it created unreal expectations to many people about his future work.And even though his following films were well received, none of them ended up being as memorable as American Beauty.Away We Go, his most recent film, is not the exception; however, I liked it very much, and I think it deserved much more recognition than it got because of its intelligent screenplay, excellent performances and valid message.In summary, I had a fascinating time of laughs and reflection about the subjects of family dysfunction which obviously interest to Mendes (besides of American Beauty, his film Revolutionary Road also rounded on those subjects) with Away We Go.Away We Go has that distinct "taste" of independent cinema, with sensible characters facing eccentric characters who represent different aspects of society with humor and ingenuity.And the best thing of all is that, at the difference of other similar films, all that elements feel very naturally integrated to the screenplay in here.What is more, we have Mendes' solid direction and the perfect performances from the two main actors, who bring a lot of honesty and realism to their characters.John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph are more famous for their work on TV, but their developments in Away We Go are so good that they feel as veterans from the big screen.I truly hope that, in sight of their work in this movie, they get more offers from casting directors in Hollywood.In supporting roles, we have also great performances from Allison Janney, Catherine O'Hara, Jeff Daniels and specially Melanie Lynskey in a brief and almost mute interpretation which evokes a deep level of emotion and intensity.I wish she had more screen-time, but her work and the one from the rest of the supporting actors are reduced to brief cameos in which different social contemporary clich√©s are very well parodied.The only members of the cast who did not convince me were Maggie Gyllenhaal and Josh Hamilton, because they feel too forced on their roles.But, in spite of that, Away We Go is an excellent film which brings a very interesting satire which perfectly endorses the central message: the rules and expectations from the society do not necessarily drive to happiness; the compatibility between the people and their tolerance to the eccentricities from their peers are more important, at the same time they make their relationships richer and they teach to appreciate the person from him/herself, and not for his/her function on the world.In summary, that is another fascinating level to this brilliant film, which I enthusiastically recommend if you wanna watch a high quality film.
I think romantic comedies do not promote the idea of marriage or family life.What they sell is simply the idea of romance, concluded by a great wedding or declaration of eternal love, with which they tacitly admit that it is better to end the story when the main characters are still happy, before they land in the cruel realities of the married life.On the same way, the movies focused on pregnancy do not promote the breeding of a child, but the idealized tenderness a baby represents.The Back-up Plan is an irritating and absolutely atrocious hybrid of those styles.One of the biggest problems from The Back-up Plan is its offensive simplification of the subjects about the romance, babies and marriage, which leads to levels of absolute stupidity.Needless to say that that clearly reflects the opinion big Hollywood studios have on the spectators, and they suppose it will not care if they insult our intelligence, as long as they put some sticky song, a few "slapstick" scenes and an attractive main couple that personifies the particular romantic fantasies from many people.Big mistake.I do not expect every movie about babies to be academic studies on the evolution of maternal roles in 21st century; but as the Baby Boom and She's Having a Baby show, it is perfectly possible to make a funny and very entertaining comedy about the subject, which does not sacrifice its intelligence or is afraid of talking to the audience with a bit more of sophistication.Another big problem from The Back-up Plan are that it is terribly unfunny and the screenplay is truly deplorable.Jennifer Lopez and Alex O'Loughlin lack of any chemistry; O'Loughlin is one more in the list of generic and uncharismatic gallants, and I would not be surprised if this "actor"'s previous work is as a male model in romantic questionnaires from the Cosmopolitan magazine.My recommendation is for you to avoid this execrable movie as a plague.I have definitely abandoned any hope for Lopez to recover the credibility as an actress she acquired in the 90's with Out of Sight, U-Turn and Blood and Wine.My good will definitely expired (specially with The Back-up Plan).
I hated Final Destination, but I enjoyed Final Destination 2 and Final Destination 3 pretty much, mainly because of the ingenious "deaths" with which The Death (yes, with capital letters) kills the characters, which was enough for creating very entertaining experiences. However, I found The Final Destination (the fourth movie from the saga) atrocious, and even though Final Destination 5 is much better, it did not leave me very satisfied.I found the first 10 minutes from Final Destination 5 almost intolerable, because of the bad performances, the clumsy "exposure" dialogs which weakly establish the situation and the lack of even the minimum character development. But I think that the main guilties of all are the actors, because the performances are genuinely horrible, and as a consequence, the actors cannot involve us into their sub-plots. Fortunately, the scene of the bridge catastrophe comes after that, which is very well filmed, and the movie improves from there. However, the movie keeps showing various fails after the bridge scene.As for the death scenes, some of them are too simple and abrupt, and exacerbating that, they do not produce too much "shock value"; other ones abuse from the 3D effect too much; but there are other ones which generate a good measure of tension.I appreciated the introduction of new rules to the mythology of the saga in this movie. Pity that that is a bit ruined by the total lack of interest in the characters. I also appreciated the decision from screenwriter Eric Heisserer of bringing back the character interpreted by Tony Todd, who along with David Koechner as a "comic relief" and Courtney B. Vance as a detective, are the only actors who bring conviction to their characters.In conclusion, Final Destination 5 is a film with ridiculous dialogs, non-existent drama and (with the previously mentioned exceptions) bad performances. However, I have to admit it generally kept me moderately entertained, which makes it worthy of a slight recommendation.
By my point of view,Funny Games (1997) is a very interesting experiment.In spite of being a bit forced and pretentious in some occasions,I admired the intention of the film,its message and its audacity.Now,we have the remake of that film which is not bad but,for the ones who saw the original,it is the exact same film,so it does not offer anything new.I did not understand the purpose of this remake : what is the grace of practically watching the same movie again? Still,this remake is far inferior than the original film.One of the best elements from Funny Games (1997) was its realism and the unknown actors helped to increase that realism.Although Naomi Watts and Tim Roth are excellent actors,it's impossible not to recognize them as two Hollywood stars,so the realism is much lower than in the original film.Two elements which had also worked in the original film were its social commentary and the complicity with the spectator.They were used on a natural way.In this remake,they are used on an artificial way.I think the people who did not see the original movie will enjoy this movie much more than me.After all,in spite of all my complaints,Funny Games U.S. did not bore me.I had liked the original film pretty much,so it was impossible for me not to make comparisons.In spite of not being boring,this remake does not offer anything new if you have already seen the original film.
Director and screenwriter Kevin Smith made films which prove the value of independent cinema and its narrative virtues, which were more than enough to compensate the reduced resources with which they had been made. Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back were refreshing discoveries whose "vocie" defied the Hollywood conventions. However, when Smith's indie fame impulsed him to the mainstream, he made the atrocious films Jersey Girl and Cop Out (even though on the other hand, he also made the very entertaining films Clerks II and Zack and Miri Make a Porno). Maybe, feeling disappointed with those experiences, Smith decided to go back to his independent roots, but not with a comedy about the New Jersey "slackers", but with a fierce satire of the religious extremism which is unfortunately not very distant from the reality. The film is Red State, and even though I would not consider it among his best movies, it was a definitely very interesting experience which displays a darker and more reflexive side from Smith.In some websites, Red State is classified as a horror film, but I do not think that is an appropriate label. It certainly includes suspense and gore, but its tone is rather dramatic when it shows us the consequences of the crash between inflexible attitudes about sex, politics and religion. However, Smith does not pretend to bring us an elementary moral lesson, with "bad ones" and "good ones" as imaginary extremes of a same discussion. On the opposite, it can be noticed that his genuine intention was showing the points of view from the characters on a balanced way, as extreme and absurd they might seem to us. I am not saying that Smith is completely impartial; there certainly is a socio-political message in the movie...but he does not try to induce us to his point of view either; he simply presents factions convinced of their own reason, and he leaves us the homework of deciding who we will affiliate ourselves with: Do we agree with the religious extremists disposed to kill in order to fulfill with the dictates of the Bible? Or do we accept those violent manifestations as one more face of the "terrorism" the government must eliminate? Or do we maybe trust in the tolerance as a magical tool to make the coexistence between opposed and incompatible ideologies possible? Needless to say that not all of those postures end up as "winners" in the film, but they are present in order for us to identify ourselves with the one which suits with us the best. And that position will define whether Red State is a satire, a protest or a tragedy to us.As for the production values, Smith has considerably evolved from the poor cinematography and static shots of his first films. It is obvious that Red State was filmed with a low budget, but thanks to cinematographer David Klein and Smith's dynamic direction, the visual professionalism from the film exceeds its limited resources. Combining creative camera sites, subtle movements and even dynamic hand-held sequences, Red State ended up being one of Smith's most polished movies. Besides, the whole cast brings excellent performances, highlighting Michael Parks, John Goodman and Kerry Bish√©.The complaints I have against this movie is that the screenplay includes some forced details which feel out of place, and that a few elements should have been better polished. However, I liked Red State pretty much, and I can recommend it as an audacious and very interesting movie with a strong social message.
I have never been a fan of the TV series The A-Team because I found it to be excessively absurd...even inside the parameters of the 80's television.However, I had some optimism before watching the film The A-Team thanks to the presence from director Joe Carnahan, whose previous movies were the excellent Narc and the entertaining Smokin' Aces.And even though it did not result to be a highly memorable movie, I cannot deny it kept me entertained because of Carnahan's dynamic direction, the competent performances and the action sequences.The A-Team (of course that the film) decided to follow the doctrine from films like Charlie's Angels, xXx and The Transporter, because it discards the realism in order to show absolutely over the top action sequences which require the defiance of every law from the Physic and of every limit from the human resistance.But the truth is that they all work well in the context from the movie.As for the characters, I honestly did not care too much about them, because due to the fact they are apparently immortal, I could never feel the sensation that something bad was going to happen to them.In other words, they did not emotionally connect with me.However, something which lessens to some degree that important fail are the performances from Liam Neeson, Bradley Cooper, Sharlto Copley and Quinton Jackson, who bring a good amount of enthusiasm and energy to their characters, at the same time they never loose the credibility.So, The A-Team is not a brilliant movie, and it does not result to be a very memorable experience.However, I had a good time while I was watching it, specially during the ridiculous action scenes.And in conclusion, I think it deserves a recommendation because of that.
I generally HATE the modern TV programmes dedicated to the "study" of ghosts and paranormal phenomenons, not only because of my skepticism to those subjects, but also because they never lead to something concrete or narratively interesting.Because of that, I had a bit of distrust before watching the acclaimed film Paranormal Activity, because I was afraid of finding something similar to the techniques and false atmospheres from programmes like Ghost Hunters, Paranormal State and Celebrity Ghost Stories.To my surprise, Paranormal Activity ended up being an excellent horror film with competent performances and perfect direction, among many other positive elements.The format of home video has been employed on some good movies (like Cloverfield or REC), but in spite of that, it is on a decay due to many years of saturation in the independent cinema (on unbearable crap like, for example, Amateur Porn Star Killer).Fortunately, Paranormal Activity belongs to the group of the good movies, not to mention that it takes perfect advantage from that format, because it helps for creating tension and atmosphere.As The Blair Witch Project did 10 years ago, Paranormal Activity arrives preceded of considerable "buzz" on the Internet, where it received many positive reviews and announcements of its big economical success.And I think this movie is absolutely worthy of such a promotion.This film is a perfect reminder that, many times, "less is more", because the mere suggestion of the unknown is much more effective for producing sensations on the spectator than a dozen of masked killers or millions and millions of dollars invested on generic special effects.The characters from this film are interesting and credible, and director and screenwriter Oren Peli takes his time for developing them.Thanks to that, the paranormal phenomenons they experiment become more tense.The only thing I can say against this movie is that a few details from the screenplay could have been better polished.However, in spite of that, Paranormal Activity deserves an enthusiastic recommendation as a fascinating and very entertaining horror film.I truly enjoyed this film very much.
I am already tired of movies with normal teenagers who result to be "special", or the chosen ones to save a magic kingdom, or heirs of superhuman powers, or similar rehashes of zero intelligence which only try to infiltrate to the lucrative market inspired by Harry Potter.So, my first intention was avoiding Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief; however, I decided to watch it because I had some free time...and because it was directed by Chris Columbus.Of course I could not resist the irony of watching an imitation made by the filmmaker who started the film Harry Potter franchise; and besides, the cast included some good actors in supporting roles, who could may rescue what seemed a tiring story of hollow heroism and puerile fantasy.Unofortunately, I was wrong, and Percy Jackson & the Olympians ended up being a truly horrible film.This film is inspired by a book collection written by Rick Riordan, and even though I have not read any of them, I dare to say that the author used the Greek mythology as a basis of his work for two reasons: 1) he has "brand recognition" included; and 2) it avoids him the nuisance of inventing creative names for his heroes and villains (Percy...Perseus...that is so obvious).In Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, the juxtaposition of modern and old elements creates wide opportunities of humor and "culture crash", which totally fit with the bland and harmless style we have seen in similar movies, such as The Spiderwick Chronicles or The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising.Another resemblance this film has with those ones is the abundance of ostentatious special effects, which are technically well made but they lack of passion, since they are only there to distract the attention from the boring human characters, their hollow personalities and the insulting simplicity from the screenplay, which is limited to join scenes we already know by heart: "Nobody understands me!", "It is time for you to know the truth", "You are the only hope!", etc.You know what I am talking about.I had previously mentioned the presence of good actors in supporting roles in this movie, but unfortunately, Sean Bean, Catherine Keener, Joe Pantoliano, Uma Thurman, Pierce Brosnan, Rosario Dawson and Steve Coogan are absolutely wasted on their roles.In the leading roles, we have a trio of young actors who do not have too much charisma or talent...I truly hope that the rumors of Logan Lerman being the next Spider Man are false.What this kind of movies do not seem to understand is that the magical context, or the heroic trio, or the warm mentors or the adventures full of exotic creatures are not important...what is really important is for the spectator to feel a connection with the characters and to share their emotions.Needless to say that Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief does not get that at all, so the final result is a very boring experience, which made me to look at my clock very frequently.So, my suggestion is for you to avoid this crappy movie at all cost.
I was quite interested in watching Labor Day, because director Jason Reitman's previous filmography includes the films Thank You for Smoking, Juno and Up in the Air, which I liked very much not only because of their warm and precise style, but also because they told original and hard-to-classify stories which were very entertaining and accessible because of the humanity from the characters and the vehemence from their emotions. And besides, I appreciate the passion shown by Reitman for making personal projects which don't necessarily seek economic success or fulfilling with the arbitrary marketing guidelines from Hollywood. That long list of attributes also describes Labor Day, an excellent film with perfect performances and a subtle suspense which is gradually increased until reaching a satisfactory conclusion. Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet are absolutely credible in their roles, and I would like to mention the young Gattlin Griffith, who also makes a very solid work in his role. And a sincere applause to the casting department for having found Tom Lipinksi, who plays the younger version of Brolin's character; his resemblance is truly amazing, and the film is truly benefited from that. The only thing I can say against Labor Day is that a few details from the screenplay could have been better polished; nevertheless, I liked this film very much, and I consider it worthy of an enthusiastic recommendation.
I liked Iron Man because of the solid performances and the good decision to base the movie on Tony Stark's personality, his interaction with Pepper Potts and the origins of the superhero.Howover, by my humble point of view, the supporting story was generic, the villain lacked of a defined motivation, and the battles did not provoke too much suspense or emotion on me.Those elements made me not to be completely satisfied with the movie, but I cannot deny it entertained me, specially due to Robert Downey Jr.'s brilliant work on the leading role.Now, with Iron Man 2, screenwriter Justin Theroux tries to keep the formula untouchable, but he adds so many supplementary elements to the narrative that the film feels badly focused and a bit tiring on a few occasions.However, I think it is a competent sequel which has the same balance of virtues and defects of the first film.Iron Man 2 has enough dramatic points in its screenplay in order to fill two entire movies, so all the dramatic threads do not enjoy of the same attention, and as a consequence, some of them feel too light and hasty.That is a typical mistake of a comic-book adaptation; we saw it in Spider-Man 3, in The Dark Knight and we now see it on Iron Man 2.However, we fortunately back to have Downey Jr. on the leading role, and he rescues many scenes with his sparkling performance.What least worked for me in this movie were the scenes with Nick Fury and his S.H.I.E.L.D. "entourage", something which was a bit frustrating, because I have always liked that character and what it represents in the Marvel Comics universe, not to mention the character was given a limited screen time.Another one of the characters which suffered because of lack of time was Natalia Rushman, which disappointed me for the same reason as Fury.After many years of reading her fascinating adventures on the comics, and knowing her remarkable evolution, I was disappointed to simply see her as a secretary with a mysterious past.Sure, she participates on a good action scene, but that only stressed the fact that the character's potential was not appropriately exploited.However, I have to clear that my complains about the characters of Fury and Rushman do not extend to the actors.On the contrary, Scarlett Johansson feels credible as Rushman, and Samuel L. Jackson brings a perfect balance of gravity, threaten and humor to Fury.Gwyneth Paltrow also brings a competent performance as Stark's romantic interest/confident/helper.Don Cheadle is solid as "Rhodey", but I think I liked Terrence Howard's performance on the previous movie on the same role a bit more.Sam Rockwell is appropriately hateful as Stark's competitor.And finally, the great Mickey Rourke brings a decent development as the mysterious Vanko; however, I think his character is superficially written, with few attention to the details of his personality.In summary, I would put Iron Man 2 on the exact same level of the first film: entertaining but not highly memorable.I can recommend it mainly because the action scenes are well filmed (director Jon Favreau improved on that field in comparison with the first movie), the performances are competent and the film is never boring.
Final Destination 2 was an excellent horror film, whose combination of suspense, gore and narrative ingenuity made it hugely entertaining. Besides, the movie established director David R. Ellis as a filmmaker with big potential of standing out into the genre...same potential he later betrayed with the mediocre Snakes on a Plane and the horrible The Final Destination. Now, I think that Ellis' career has reached the bottom with Shark Night 3D, a genuinely pathetic "horror" film.To start with, the lack of gore is one of the main reasons which make Shark Night 3D totally insipid. Unfortunately, the movie stays on the PG-13 field from the beginning to the end, with the shark attacks represented by agitated water and a little bit of red paint.I do not think the special effects can become a bad movie into a good one, but they can at least make an experience a bit more tolerable to those of us who use to watch these kind of movies. And I would even excuse the lack of gore if Ellis' direction had generated enough suspense, or if we had really had interest in the characters' survival. But Shark Night 3D could not even achieve that. The deaths lack of any emotional impact, there is not any surprise in the attacks and the "creative" explanation of the lake sharks is so absurd that it works as an example of what NOT to do in a film about "man vs. nature".It is honestly very difficult for me to find positive elements in this film. Submarine cinematography? Almost the whole movie is developed at night, so we barely see the sharks as silhouettes and threatening shadows. Humor? Totally unfunny. Performances? Don't make me laugh.In conclusion, Shark Night 3D is a tedious, predictable and atrocious "horror" film in which I unfortunately wasted my time and my money. As for Ellis, I have officially lost any interest in his filmography, and I would not be surprised if we later see him directing cheap horror films for the straight-to-DVD market.
I liked the film Lost in Translation very much, but I understand why its slow rhythm and minimalist story were disliked by many people who may were looking for a more traditional comedy or romance. Director and screenwriter Sofia Coppola returns to the same field of parsimony and narrative ambiguity with her most recent film Somewhere, which is starred by two less famous actors, has locations which are less picturesque and possesses an even more languid and minimalist style. I know it is definitely not for every taste, but I liked Somewhere very much, mainly because I rarely find a movie which says so much with so little.Even if Coppola had not directed the previously mentioned Lost in Translation, I would still say that Somewhere has many things in common with that movie, not only because it also examines the "dark side" of fame with the character of a famous actor, but also because the redeemer agent in both ones is a woman who helps the main character to rediscover his own humanity and critically analyze the fallacy of a life wasted in the artificial world of any celebrity. The main character from Somewhere has it all, but he cannot appreciate the value of anything, including his own existence, something which is extraordinarily captured by Coppola during the first minutes of the movie. What takes me to one of the best attributes from Somewhere: I felt it real, something which immediately plunged me into its atmosphere of apathy and disenchantment.Somewhere focuses its attention into imperceptible changes of humor and uncertain emotions, and as a consequence, there is not too much place for telling a conventional story. In other words, nothing really happens during this movie, and I understand why some people would get bored with long scenes which reiterate the same point: the main character floating into a swimming pool; driving a Ferrari; or falling asleep during a show made by two exotic dancers. And even though some people might interpret that as a pseudo-artistic indulgence from Coppola, or as another variation of the old "the rich and famous also suffer" formula, I see all that as a clear demonstration that Coppola has a genuine vision and a skilled hand to get into the main character's mind with minimum effort but honest results.And I also admired the performances from Stephen Dorff, who brings a very natural and detailed work, and from Elle Fanning, who feels credible and spontaneous in her role. I also liked the brief appearances from Ellie Kemper as a smiling publicist; Angela Lindvall as a mysterious woman who drives a white Mercedes Benz; Benicio del Toro as a strange man; Michelle Monaghan as an antipathetic actress; and from Chris Pontius, who surprised me with a honest performance in here, something I would have never expected from him after seeing the crazy stuff he makes as a member of the Jackass group.So, in conclusion, it is needless to say that Somewhere is not for every taste, and I will not deny that there are a few moments which feel a bit pretentious. But those who can "connect" to the main character (like me) will have a fascinating experience with this movie, which has much more deepness and emotional weight than what it may seem at first sight.
Almost 10 years ago, I saw the film The Yards, co-written and directed by James Gray, and I found it to be a very solid combination of family drama and thriller which avoided the easy clich√©s from both genres to produce something different, unpredictable and very interesting, although it was so soberly made that some people found it to be slow and boring.On his following film, We Own the Night, Gray tried to do something similar, but he added elements of the action cinema which broke the balance, and made the experience to be not very satisfactory.Now, with Two Lovers, Gray simplifies his formula focusing on the romantic drama, and the result is a very interesting film.The story from this film is deceptively simple, but in fact, it hides a lot of meaning and deepness behind its structure.Besides, the characters feel real, and on that element, the excellent performances from the cast help.Joaquin Phoenix is simply perfect on his role.Gwyneth Paltrow and Vinessa Shaw also bring brilliant performances, which are simultaneously subtle and credible.And finally, I also liked the performances from Isabella Rossellini and Moni Moshonov very much.I also liked Gray's direction, because he lets the story to flow on a natural and paused (but never boring) way, which lets us to know the characters in detail.The only fails I found on this movie are the appearance of some clich√©s and a few scenes which do not add to the story too much.However, in spite of that, I liked Two Lovers pretty much and I recommend it with confidence.
I am not a big fan of the Harry Potter books, but I did not hate them either.I appreciate their vivid main characters and the fluid "voice" from author J.K. Rowling, but I think that the saga suffered from a severe case of "giantism", unnecessarily extending itself with "surprising" revelations of a doubtful importance; carloads of new characters who are either simple fillers or convenient victims of inept villains; and an out of control "ret-con" to justify the twisted narrative roads which lead to nowhere.I honestly think that the story about the young magician could have been told in only three books, but I think that it was Rowling's creative (or economic) ambition what unnecessarily inflated the series.As for the film adaptations of the books, I did not like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; I found Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to be mediocre; and I liked Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, because they condensed the bloated books into competent screenplays, by extirpating the "straw" and concentrating on the narrative knot.Unfortunately, that did not happen with the film adaptation of the last book, which was divided in two films as a desperate financial maneuver to extend one of the most successful franchises in film History a little bit more.And having seen the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, I felt it exactly like that: a marketing trick, and not as a genuine culmination of the saga.When Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 1 ended, I asked to myself: Two and a half hours for this? I think that the important elements from this film could have easily occupied the first half hour from the following film without losing the spirit from the book or the growth from the main characters.Big part of this film is a boring "road movie" in which the three main characters run through woods, grassland and mountains...with which purpose? Was that really their plan to destruct Voldemort? For being such a redundant and unnecessary movie, they could have invested some minutes in "Previously on Harry Potter", or something like that, in order to have a clearer perspective of the situation and the past events.Of course that that will be unnecessary for the "hardcore" fans who know the seven books by heart and spend hours discussing about the sexual tension between Ron Weasley and Bellatrix Lestrange (or similar subjects).And I am sure that those fans will find Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 1 much more satisfactory than me.But as a casual spectator, I found it to be extremely tedious and repetitive.Besides, the melodrama in this movie feels artificial, while the "comic relief" is not funny at all and the action sequences lack of any emotion or suspense (even though the special effects are very well done).And the least I say about the central mystery between the "horcruxes" and the relics, the better...it does not make too much sense and it sins from the typical "deus-ex-machina" from Rowling.On the positive side, I have to mention that Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint bring solid performances.I think that the biggest problem from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 1 is that I could never feel a real narrative impulse, or the organic development from a story; I simply found a list of situations and places the film has to visit, but without a genuine cohesion between them.So, in conclusion, I personally found this film to be very boring and unsatisfactory...and if that were not enough, I was left with the impression that this film is nothing more than a financial trick from the executives from Warner Bros. to squeeze more money from the fans of Harry Potter who have been faithful to the saga for almost 10 years.
After making three mediocre movies (The Peacemaker, Deep Impact and Pay It Forward), director Mimi Leder went to work in television, directing during a decade episodes from TV series such as ER, The West Wing and John Doe.Thick as Thieves, her return to the cinema, is a pathetic thriller with a trite, badly written and weakly implemented story.The only thing which could have rescued it is its high profile cast, if it had offered good performances.But the film also fails on that.Well, I may exaggerated by saying Thick as Thieves has bad performances.I usually do not like the work of Antonio Banderas very much, but Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors, and Radha Mitchell, Robert Forster and Rade Serbedzija are also solid interpreters.However, there is not any energy or enthusiasm on their performances; they all show an absolute apathy for their characters.And besides of that, the screenplay consists of a horrible collection of clich√©s, like for example, the forced romance which arises between two people after 5 minutes of having met; the tedious explanation of the security system the thieves have to violate; the supposedly tense sequence of the robbery, full of incongruent technology and ridiculous logic; the artificial flukes which save dangerous situations at the last moment; the confrontations between thief and cop as rivals who respect their mutual honor and talent...Shall I go on? Thick as Thieves is a boring and lazy pastiche of archaic ideas and concepts.In summary, Thick as Thieves is a horrible and tedious thriller which is full of clich√©s.This is the kind of film in which I really feel I wasted my time, so do not make the same mistake I did, and avoid Thick as Thieves by all means.
Even though I am not a big fan of musical movies, some ones I liked very much are "opera rock", such as Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita, Tommy and Pink Floyd: The Wall.So, my expectations for Repo! The Genetic Opera were pretty high; it did not only use heavy rock to tell the story, but it also offered blood and violence.The final result was disappointing, because even though I found this film to be moderately entertaining, it did not leave me very satisfied.The story from this movie evokes the dramas from the traditional opera, with forbidden romances, dangerous secrets and cataclysmic family revelations.The problem is that (as it happened on other musical films) the story sacrifices flow and coherency in order to insert the songs, and the story ends up suffering smooth and interruptions which make it occasionally incoherent.Besides, we have the problem that not all the songs work well (on the narrative aspect as well as on the musical one).As for the cast, let's see the positive side first.Paul Sorvino shows a potent voice and he brings a precise performance.The same can be said about Anthony Head.And the revelation from this movie is undoubtedly Alexa Vega, who we knew in the trilogy of Spy Kids; but now that she surpassed her adolescence, she shows a very good presence, excellent voice and an absolute conviction in her character.On the negative side from the cast, we have Bill Moseley, Nivek Ogre and Paris Hilton, who are excessively over the top on their characters, and I think they did not find the balance between fuss and performance, at the difference of Sorvino, Head and Vega.But that is not all...I think the characters from Moseley, Ogre and Hilton were unnecessary in the movie, and they are truly antipathetic.Another element which should have been deleted from the movie is the sub-plot about the succession of GeneCo.Repo! The Genetic Opera has the obvious purpose of becoming into a cult film, and because of that, it feels forced and a bit pedantic, instead of spontaneous and vivacious.Nevertheles, I think this film deserves a slight recommendation, because even though it is mediocre, I cannot deny it kept me moderately entertained the whole time.
Director Joe Carnahan is specialized in making highly stylized films, with an overflowing attitude and a masculine sensibility which can go from the over the top (Smokin' Aces, The A-Team) to the sober (Narc). The Grey, his most recent film, belongs to the second group, and even though it was difficult for me to completely swallow the most improbable aspects from its screenplay, Carnahan's ability for creating suspense and orchestrating action scenes makes it an entertaining experience.The screenplay from The Grey is based on a short story written by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, but I felt it like an action film written by Jack London (1876-1916), that North American author popular in early-20th century who spent many years at "the Yukon", and who accustomed to use the icy landscapes and cruel weather from Alaska/Canada as metaphors of the internal fights every individual has to overcome in order to meet his/herself, or as an indispensable initiation rite for the man in search of the potential. And sure, his most famous books have sled dogs as main characters, so it's not difficult to imagine The Grey as the film equivalent to those novels, which maybe romanticized the danger, but didn't elude the consequences of facing it. In other words, this is a film not only about physical survival, but also spiritual, with dangers which threaten our life and our humanity.The Grey is also an action/thriller film about wolves...and in that aspect, I didn't find it completely satisfactory. Besides of the fact that I don't like to see animals suffering (not even when they are animatronic creations made by the great Greg Nicotero), the wolves from The Grey don't behave as authentic wild animals, but as monsters which seem taken from a horror film, something which ends up decreasing the credibility from the dramatic aspects of the screenplay, and lessens the strength from the philosophical elements. And what is more, Liam Neeson's performance in the leading role feels a bit forced.However, I liked The Grey, mainly because of Carnahan's ability to handle the action scenes, the moments of suspense and the contemplative breaths in which the characters reflect about their mortality and everything they left behind. And despite not being great, I think that that is enough to make The Grey worthy of a moderate recommendation.
Although it has been acclaimed all over the world with various awards and nominations (including the one to the Oscar as Best Picture),I went to see Frost/Nixon with some doubt about its social or political relevance.After all,Richard Nixon died fifteen years ago and his life as well as the Watergate scandal have been examined on movies (from the biographical drama Nixon to the comedy Dick,without forgetting the most famous one,All the President's Men),books and television and it seems there is not too much fresh material which does not limit to recycle what we already know.But,after watching this movie,I just forgot about all the prejudices I had before watching it because Frost/Nixon is an extraordinary movie whose main point is not examining the multiple mistakes Nixon has committed,but to examine the man behind the scandal and at the same time,offering a fascinating behind-the-scenes look to the interview that,for many people,represented the judgment Nixon has never had.Frost/Nixon is based on a play written by Peter Morgan,and the author himself made an excellent adaption.Morgan did not intend to take a play to the cinema but to transform the play into a movie.In other words,Frost/Nixon never feels as a filmed play,but as a movie.Frank Langella made a magnificent work as Nixon and he completely deserves all the acclamation he has received.Michael Sheen,Oliver Platt,Sam Rockwell,Matthew Macfayden,Kevin Bacon and Toby Jones also bring excellent works because they completely become on their roles,so they never seem to be acting.Ron Howard made an extraordinary work as a director.He has an irregular career and although he is a talented director,he has shown a doubtful criterion for choosing some projects (like,for example,The Da Vinci Code and The Dissapearences).But in Frost/Nixon,Howard proves all the talent he has when he works with good material.Although the story of the film is a little bit static,Howard found the way to make it enormously entertaining,interesting and not boring at all.I honestly think Frost/Nixon is the best movie of his career.By my point of view,this is the best film from 2008 (from what I have seen).Frost/Nixon is a fascinating and magnificent movie thanks to its interesting story,brilliant performances and excellent direction.I completely recommend this movie because this is certainly cinema of the best quality.
The excellent film Match Point provoked a rebirth on director and screenwriter Woody Allen's career,which a few years before that movie was agonizing (specially,with the pathetic Anything Else).After Match Point,Allen made the entertaining but forgettable comedy Scoop,which made me loose a little bit of the enthusiasm I had won with Match Point.After Scoop,Allen made the very interesting movie Cassandra's Dream and,now,we have his most recent film,Vicky Cristina Barcelona,which also results to be an interesting movie.The best element from Vicky Cristina Barcelona is that it has very well constructed characters under interesting circumstances,while they examine human relationships.Some people prefer Allen when he made naughty comedies with eccentric characters and which evoked the style and rhythm from the comedies of the 30's and 40's (like Bullets Over Broadway); other people prefer him when he made serious dramas where the human relationships were examined by intelligent characters (like Husbands and Wives).In Vicky Cristina Barcelona,Allen combined both styles with a pretty good result.This movie has very funny moments but,at the same time,it makes a honest analysis about romantic relationships.Many movies examine the romantic relationships but they stay in the simple "war of both sex".In this movie,Allen added more levels to that analysis and they feel honest and realistic.Besides of all that very good elements,Vicky Cristina Barcelona is also a well structured and very entertaining movie,which has a brilliant cast who brings credible and honest performances.The fails I found on this movie are two.On the one hand,there are moments in which the use of the narrator feels artificial and unnecessary.There are moments in which the presence of the narrator is important but,on other moments,it was not necessary.And,on the other hand,some elements from the screenplay do not flow naturally.In spite of that fails,I liked this movie pretty much.Vicky Cristina Barcelona was a very interesting and entertaining experience in my case and I recommend it with confidence in spite of the fails I mentioned.
Without too much fanfare nor publicity, Cristopher Smith has become into one of the most interesting contemporary directors. His first film was Creep, a very entertaining "subway horror" film with a good atmosphere and solid moments of suspense. Then, he made the extraordinary Severance, which simultaneously was a parody of the rural slashers (like Wrong Turn or both versions of The Hills Have Eyes) and an incisive comedy about the modern labor tendencies (yes, a definitely strange combination, but I can assure you that it works wonderfully). After Severance, he made the excellent Triangle, whose nightmarish atmosphere and ingenious screenplay made it one of the best movies I saw last year. Now, his most recent film Black Death also shows high narrative ambitions, because it hides deep ideas and ideological questions behind its deceptively simple story about medieval knights. And the result is a fascinating experience which satisfies on the visceral level (due to the gore it pours during its violent fights) as well as on the cerebral one, due to the provocative ideas it explores and for denying itself to bring an easy and soothing conclusion.The screenplay from Black Death uses its picturesque characters to explore different levels of religious conviction, from the authentic devotees with a sincere altruism, to the fans who take refuge in the dogma in order to commit atrocities by way of personal revenge; without forgetting to the victims who suffer arbitrary punishments because of harboring different beliefs to the other people. However, it is difficult to determine who the heroes are and who the villains are, because in this movie, nobody is exempt of intolerance and prejudices against different opinions. That moral ambiguity makes Black Death to be an excellent drama whose hint of supernatural elements does not want to scare us, but to emphasize the dangers of the fanaticism, whatever the religion practiced by the extremists is. In other words, Black Death is not an anti-religion fable, but a denounce against the habitual obstinacy which made the humanity to commit crimes against itself over and over again.I also liked to see that the actors from Black Death genuinely transport us to the medieval time, not only for their appearance in here, but also because of the credibility they show in their roles. Sean Bean brings a good work as a man who is pure of heart but also willing to use excessive mission in order to protect his mission or his faith. Eddie Redmayne makes the evolution of his character totally credible. And I also liked the work from Carice Van Houten.The only thing I can say against Black Death is that a few details from the screenplay do not feel very polished. In spite of that, I liked this film very much, and I can definitely recommend it because of its brilliant screenplay, solid performances and excellent direction.
Sabotage is like an over the top parody of the '80s action cinema, except that director David Ayer (whose previous film was the excellent End of Watch) and the cast take it very seriously; and I don't know whether that makes it more entertaining or more ridiculous. The characters are so tough that they reach caricature levels... literally. Their laughable attitudes and extortionate dialogs seem taken from animated satires such as Archer and Venture Bros. None of them has deepness or identity beyond their physical appearance: the bearded one, the butch woman, the "corncrows", etc. The violence is brutal and gratuitous, rejoicing in multiple shootouts, bloody fights and juicy headshots. And, needless to say, all the agents are rebels who work under their own rules. Despite everything, I have to respect the inflexible seriousness and conviction from Sabotage, even when it provokes involuntary laughs (something which is frequent). And I also have to say I found its screenplay interesting and well structured (even though it's full of holes), with moderately unexpected twists and agile dynamics which allow us to see glimpses of the characters' twisted psychology. Arnold Schwarzenegger makes his usual stuff in the leading role of Sabotage, even though he's looking quite old nowadays (he should ask for some advice to Sylvester Stallone or Tom Cruise). Sam Worthington plays a supporting and passive (at least inside this film's standards) role; it seems that he won't end up being the Hollywood star he seemed he was going to be some years ago. Harold Perrineau brings a decent performance as the only remotely normal human being from the film, even though he doesn't share any scenes with Josh Holloway, so the mini-reunion of Lost I was expecting didn't happen. But my favorite performance from Sabotage was Olivia Williams' as the tough (of course) agent Brentwood. The attitude and intensity she brings to that role are perfect. In conclusion, Sabotage isn't a very original or memorable film, but I found it a competent action film whose disproportionate violence and cartoonish tone make it an entertaining experience, despite the excesses and inconsistencies which plague the screenplay.
In the '80s, I read a book written by Stephen Hawking (despite not having understood a word of it), but what made me appreciate him more as a person was his cameo in Star Trek: The Next Generation (in the episode "Descent, Part 1"), revealing the humor and simplicity from that enigmatic genius. The film The Theory of Everything completes that mission with a look into Hawking's domestic life, as well as his marriage to Jane Wilde and the (physical as well as emotional) difficulties both faced with the scientist's devastating illness, which has fortunately never affected his brilliant mind and inquisitive spirit. The movies depicts that well... but I would have personally liked to see the same attention over his academic trajectory, his theoretical innovations and maybe even an analysis of his deductive process or sources of inspiration; unfortunately, it wasn't like that, and the absence of those elements end up making the film feel incomplete and superficial. Having said that, the intimate focus of The Theory of Everything helps us comprehend the man behind the legend better, and brings us a new perspective of the huge difficulties faced by Hawking in his search of the big mysteries of the universe. The problem is that said "mysteries" are expressed in the shape of disposable conversations which are too trivial to transmit their scope and potential. If The Theory of Everyhing had integrated both perspectives (personal and professional) better, it would have been more interesting, equally valuable because of its dramatic virtues and its effort of scientific diffusion. After all, this isn't a biography about an artist or a politician, but about one of the most influential theoretical physicists in History. Anyway, I appreciated The Theory of Everything despite that imbalance, mainly because of the extraordinary performances from Eddie Redmayne, Felicity Jones and David Thewlis. Director James Marsh presents the story with fluency and clarity, and with a colorful and elegant visual style. In conclusion, I think I would have preferred to see a good documentary about Hawking, focused on facts and theories, and without so many cloying romantic flourish. On the other hand, I liked its direction, its sincere purpose to humanize the scientist and the previously mentioned performances, highlighting Redmayne's, which could transmit Hawking's physical limitations without any affectations or offensive exaggerations. I think those attributes are enough to make it worthy of a moderate recommendation.
I enjoyed pretty much Will Ferrell's style of comedy when he was in Saturday Night Live.But,now,I have seen his style of humor so many times that I'm tired of it and I do not like it anymore.Well,that's what happened to me with Semi-Pro.This comedy really irritated me and,with one or two exceptions,it did not make me laugh at all.There is a serious problem when a comedy does not make me laugh.I think the gags fail because we have already seen them too many times,on the TV or in movies.The gags are completely unoriginal and they did not have even a pinch of intelligence.Ferrell makes the same character as always : a man with more enthusiasm than common sense and without any shame.I think he has talent so he should do something different.Woody Harrelson and Jackie Earle Haley are brilliant actors but they do not have much to do,so they are completely wasted in here.The worst fail from this movie is that it bored me pretty much and I wanted it to end.That's the worst thing a movie can provoke.Semi-Pro is a mediocre,irritating and boring comedy which wastes talented people.I do not recommend it.
Hollywood may be comprehending that the movies with political and war subjects saturated the taste and they left the unhappiness from North American people satisfied.The ones who are already convinced do not need any more; and the ones which match with the aggressive foreign policy from the United States will not stop supporting the "pro-America" practices.However, that has not stopped many filmmakers from looking for new material; in other words, they are more interested to focus on the peripheral aspects of war, instead than focusing on the war itself.So, we have seen movies like In the Valley of Elah and Stop Loss, which offer discouraging visions of the soldiers who came back from war; movies like Lions for Lambs, Rendition and Syriana, which examine the ideology behind the conflicts; and finally, movies which could belong to the action genre if it was not because of their political message, like The Kingdom and Body of Lies.But we had never seen the conflict from the enemy's point of view, and because of that, Traitor is a refreshing and fascinating portrait of the causes which motivate the rebellion and disgust against the North American expansion.The screenplay from this movie has unsuspected levels of intellectual and emotional provocation.Screenwriter Jeffrey Nachmanoff (who is also the director from this movie) refuses to bring us easy answers about the ideological conflicts, and he portrays a discouraging vision of international politics, where concepts like "loyalty" and "treason" are neither good or bad, but only useful tools for manipulating opinions, public perception or legislation.Traitor is a truly audacious movie which goes more far away from the easy complaints of patriotism and human rights which other movies make, showing us that in fact, the world works on a grey scale, and not on the simplistic "black and white" the politicians want to make us believe.But, besides of all the ideological background from this film, Traitor work perfectly as an ambiguous and incredibly tense thriller, which has perfectly developed characters who occupy their ambiguous positions without revealing their clear porpoises, provoking a delicious suspense on the spectator, at the same time it is difficult to know where the story will take us.Nachmanoff's direction is sober, something which works very well on the context from this movie.The performances are excellent, not only the one from the great Don Cheadle, but also the ones from the supporting cast, where the members who mostly stand out are Sa√Ød Taghmaoui as a terrorist and Jeff Daniels as a security contractor, which is a role where this underrated actor shows his wide range, which goes more far away than the family films where we usually see him.The only fail I found on this movie is that the ending could have been a little more polished.But, in spite of that, I recommend Traitor with a lot of enthusiasm, because it is an excellent movie which does not only entertain very much, but which also leaves the spectator thinking.
Of all the Birtish writers who laid the foundation of modern fantastic literature, I think Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) is the one who has best resisted over time.I do not want to underrate the work of Bram Stoker (1847-1912), H.G. Wells (1866-1946) or Lewis Carroll (1832-1898), but I either cannot deny that their archaic styles and motley prose are difficult to assimilate by the new generations.On the contrary, Doyle's strong expression keeps their writings in force until our days, and even though I prefer his science fiction stories, I also like Sherlock Homes' ingenious stories very much, who may be the most famous fictitious character around the world.However, I am not a "purist" who reveres Doyle's work as holy writing, so maybe because of that, I have enjoyed some film re-interpretations of Holmes very much, from They Might Be Giants to Murder By Decree.Now, screenwriters Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg and the irregular director Guy Ritchie bring us their "alternative" vision of Holmes, and the result is very entertaining.The publicity of Sherlock Holmes clearly established that this film does not pretend to be a faithful adaptation of Doyle's work, but a modern interpretation full of action.However, what mostly surprised me from this film is that it respects big part of the original mythology, not only on the Victorian setting and the analytic methods which made Holmes famous...but also on the deployment of his talents as a boxer and martial arts practitioner.Sure, those abilities are not explicitly described on Doyle's work, but there are some references to Homes' encounters with amateur box and his knowledge of "baritsu", an exotic Japanese discipline of self-defense.In summary, this movie puts the same emphasis on the main character's physical development as well as on his intellectual one...and I am glad to say that the combination works pretty well.Then, we have the excellent performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, whose perfect chemistry and nice interaction provoke the best moments of the film.The action scenes are very well filmed, but the moments I mostly remember from the film are the subtle dramatic moments, which work perfectly thanks to the great work from Downey Jr. and Law.Rachel McAdams is adequate on her role, but she is a bit darkened by the two main actors.The only member of the cast who did not convince me was Mark Strong, because he feels forced on his villain role, and that exacerbates the fact that his character is a bit superficially written.In spite of that fails, Sherlock Holmes is a very entertaining experience with a good balance of humor, suspense and ingenuity, at the same time it counts with remarkable special effects which recreate 19th century London.So, because of all that, I recommend Sherlock Holmes with confidence.
When the company Hasbro decided to take their famous toy lines Transformers and G.I. Joe to the big screen, they at least counted with the narrative bases established in the popular caricatures from the '80s (let's ignore for a moment the fact that that did little). However, for the film adaptation of the board game Battleship, co-screenwriters Erich and Jon Hoeber didn't count with a defined narrative framework, so they simply decided to copy the story and structure of Independence Day, changing some details and weakly incorporating the mechanics from the previously mentioned game, and as a result, Battleship is a deeply boring and absurd film.The quantity of elements Battleship stole from Independence Day is excessive. However, that's not the main problem; the main one is that the Hoeber bros. didn't make any effort at building credible characters, and they preferred to employ "attitude" instead of human features or authentic personality. In other words, there's nothing in the screenplay to evoke human and realistic characters; they are just puppets from the screenplay and pre-fabricated stereotypes in order to satisfy the commercial needs from the film. And that's exacerbated by the poor performances from the whole cast.The action scenes lack of any suspense or excitement, even though the special effects are extraordinary because of their realism and complexity. Going back to the negative elements, the incorporation of classic elements of the board game feels horribly forced (for example, I can mention the long sequence in which the heroes are literally playing Battleship on a digital dashboard, with a grid where they have to guess the enemy ships' position). In summary, there was obviously not enough creativity nor ingenuity to make a film based on such a simple thing, and the result is a tedious, repetitive and full of clich√©s experience.And finally...since when has it been obligatory to introduce a "personal" factor as a motivation for the heroes? Isn't it enough with saving the world for the benefit of its inhabitants? Is it that the altruism as en end in itself has become a "losers"' thing? According to Battleship and other movies, the things only deserve to be done if they solve some problem from the main character, or help him to overcome some insecurity. I know that the screenwriters employ this formula in order to bring "deepness" to the narrative, but they make the mistake of considering it a magical solution which will work by itself in order to bring substance to an empty screenplay. Unfortunately, it isn't like that; that's one of many elements which should be conjugated in order to create a solid and consistent story. End of the diatribe. In conclusion, Battleship is a film with a bad screenplay, weak performances, and inexistent suspense and emotion, and I can't recommend it, despite the brilliant special effects.
After having read about the "men in black" for many years in paranormal literature, I was a bit disappointed when the film Men in Black decided to take the subject as a joke, and make an agile but hollow sci-fi comedy out of it. Nevertheless, I found it entertaining, mainly because of the then innovative special effects and the good interaction between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. The second part, Men in Black II, was a tedious recycling which was made with a clearly mercantile intention. And now, I went to see Men in Black III with low expectations, but it fortunately ended up being much better than I expected, because it made me have a very good time.The main pro from Men in Black III is using the relationship between the agents K and J as the absolute axis of the narrative. At the difference of many others Hollywood blockbusters which use the characters as filler between special effects sequences, Men in Black III genuinely cares about developing the characters, and examining the dynamic they share with each other. Before watching Men in Black III, I was a bit afraid by the fact that Jones was going to be absent for a big part of the film; fortunately, Josh Brolin ended up being a perfect "replacement". His work as the young K is very solid and funny, and his chemistry with Smith is excellent. As for Smith's individual work, he brings sincerity to his character in every scene, while Bill Hader makes an hilarious work as Andy Warhol (1928-1987).On the negative side, some moments from the story are developed on an excessively fast way, and a few details about the time travel feel a bit forced. Nevertheless, I have to admit that screenwriter Etan Cohen made a generally solid work, specially near the ending, when he employs a twist which generates an unexpected emotive impact and efficiently ties all the loose ends.As I said on the first paragraph, I went to see Men in Black III with low expectations, but I ended up taking quite a pleasant surprise with it. I can recommend it because of the competent performances, the impressive special effects, the good screenplay and Barry Sonnenfeld's direction, which is more disciplined than what he accustoms to. Men in Black III managed to keep me very entertained from the beginning to the end, while I appreciate the fact it put more emphasis on the screenplay than on the visual spectacle. Unfortunately, I suspect I won't be able to say the same about other Hollywood blockbusters from this season.
I am accustomed to watch "science fiction" movies to discover they are really adventure stories set on a futuristic, extraterrestrial or high-tech context.The emphasis is always on the explosions and special effects, ignoring the authentic basis from the genre: provocative ideas, reflections on human condition and speculation about the future of the human beings.So, genuine Science Fiction (yes, with capital letters) movies (like the extraordinary Gattaca and Children of Men) do not appear very frequently.I am happy to say District 9 is one of those fascinating movies, and it offers a high level of satisfaction for two facets of spectators: the ones who look for action and special effects and the ones who want something more thought-provoking and which feeds the brain.The main character from this movie is brilliant because he shows a very interesting ambiguous morality and an amazing emotional evolution during the movie.The story is also excellent for many elements.On the one hand, it shows us that the "villians" are not only those who have hate on their hearts and weapons on their hands, but also those who rationalize their behaviour in order to disguise (at least on their minds) even the worst elements from human condition.Another very interesting aspect from the screenplay is the culture crash it shows, because it points out the human prejudice against anything which is not traditional.All those allegories would have become dull if they were not endorsed by a simultaneously subtle and brilliant satire which makes us occasionally smile, and which proves director and screenwriter Neill Blomkamp takes his movie seriously, but not enough to deny the intrinsic humor from some scenes.In summary, a great combination of ideas, drama, humor and suspense.But District 9 is not only political judgement and abstract concepts.The deep narrative is accompanied by extraordinary special effects and a perfect direction.The action sequences are brilliant, not only because of their manufacture, but also because they endorse the screenplay and they obey to the narrative flow from it.But let's go back to the special effects.The studio Weta deserves all kind of recognition for their monumental work, not only because of the extraterrestrial elements, but also because of the creation of authentic performances in the aliens.The only fail I found on this movie is that a few elements from the screenplay feel a bit forced.But that is a minor fail, and it did not avoid me from liking this movie very much.District 9 is a fascinating movie, which does not only analyze about potent and controversial subjects, but which also made me have an exciting, full of suspense and hugely entertaining time.Pity this excellent movie went completely unnoticed in the North American box office, while the tedious Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will end up as the most economically successful film from 2009.I recommend District 9 with a lot of enthusiasm.
Bond movies had been disappointing me for decades,when they started to lose any contact with the serious spy cinema for becoming on cold action comedies where the plot was an excuse for showing Bond making impossible things on the action scenes and seducing exotic women.But,everything changed with the brilliant Casino Royale,which made a complete re-interpretation of Bond,putting the main character on a more realistic and modern context and where the action scenes were not funny and exaggerated,but realistic and violent and where the ridiculous villains had been replaced by a more credible one.Now,Quantum of Solace disappointed me pretty much,specially after the excellence shown on Casino Royale.The biggest problem of this movie is that it is,on many aspects,a copy of the Bourne franchise which,in 2002,started to comprehend the constant mistakes of the Bond franchise and it solved them make a more dynamic and modern version and where the villains were simpler but more credible.Quantum of Solace specially copies it on style and rhythm but any of the films of the Bourne franchise are very superior to this movie.By my point of view,Quantum of Solace is a parade of frenetic action scenes,well done but completely irrelevant,and with a hollow story.It seems that the porpoise of the movie was using the plot as an excuse for showing action scenes.Having said all that,I have to admit that the beginning of the film is promising.But,after that,it starts to fall.It seems incredible,but the moments I mostly enjoyed from Quantum of Solace were the ones in which Judi Dench appeared.Dench brings an excellent performance which,by my point of view,makes the movie better than what it really is.And when the commentaries of a mature woman are the best moments of a movie full of explosions,fights and chases,there is something wrong with the screenplay.But,that should not surprise me too much,because director Marc Forster previously made movies in which the emphasis is on the human drama.The extraordinary movies Monster's Ball,Finding Neverland and The Kite Runner show that Forster has enormous talent for bringing humanity to a film.I hope he recovers from the moderate misstep he had with Quantum of Solace in his next movie.One of the biggest purposes of Quantum of Solace is making Bond more modern and realistic.The problem is that the main fail of the Bond films pre-Casino Royale was not the lack of realism but the weakness of the screenplays.And Quantum of Solace does not solve that problem and it shows a lot of action scenes for making us ignore the incoherent plot.This commentary may sound too negative,but I have to admit Quantum of Solace did not bore me and it is superior to the Bond films with Pierce Bronsnan.But,it's a generic action film and it is very far away from Casino Royale.
Out of the first four films from the Resident Evil saga, the only one I liked was the third one, Resident Evil: Extinction. It was the only one with a rational and interesting narrative, along with adequately defined characters who more or less emulated the behaviour of humans facing big danger, instead of being rigid video-game "NPCs" only motivated by their function as victims or "mcguffins" from a pre-fabricated story. However, the fourth film, Resident Evil: Afterlife, went back to the disposable characters and video-game structure from the first two films of the saga. Now, the fifth movie, Resident Evil: Retribution, continues the anti-narrative crusade...even though I have to say that the film works well once we abandon the hope of finding a logical or original screenplay. The result is an entertaining movie which doesn't have scenes, but levels, such as the video-game which inspired it.Resident Evil: Retribution has few story, but at least, the main character has a defined purpose: moving from point A to point B and surviving despite all the technological and organic risks lurking in the wide section of the subway complex. Once we accept that premise, we can appreciate a parade of well filmed action scenes. Besides, by incorporating many characters we already knew, screenwriter Paul W.S. Anderson (who was also the director) avoided the task of defining their personalities, and he could even achieve some brief (very, very brief) moments of emotional subtext which make us lament the deaths of the characters and celebrate their triumphs. Besides, Milla Jovovich brings conviction and enthusiasm to the leading role.Despite having a "moderate" budget (65 millions of dollars, according to Box Office Mojo), the cost from Resident Evil: Retribution looks like the double, because it counts with excellent settings and extraordinary special effects which perfectly combine the practical make-up with digital tricks in order to bring the various creatures which threaten the heroes to life. The wire work occasionally stumbles a little bit, but that's a minor detail which doesn't darken the amazing work from studios specialized in all kinds of effects (minatures, make-up, 3D, etc.).On the other side of the coin, we have the atrocious performances from Sienna Guillory, Li Bingbing and Johann Urb as Jill Valentine, Ada Wong and Leon S. Kennedy, respectively. Their performances are so wooden that they provoked involuntary laughs on me. However, I have to admit that the three of them look physically identical to their video-game counterparts. Nevertheless, I can give a moderate recommendation to Resident Evil: Retribution; it's not something great or highly memorable, but it managed to keep me entertained.
I like the Captain America character very much whenever he is presented in the comics as a strategic and spiritual leader of the Avengers team, but I honestly never enjoyed his original adventures, which were written during the '40s as simple political propaganda during the World War II, more than 20 years before than when Marvel Comics adopted him as a fundamental part of its emergent superheroes universe. That's why I tried to keep realistic expectations before watching Captain America: The First Avenger. As an "origin story", the screenplay would be a recount of his beginnings as a patriotic symbol, fighting against Nazis and enemies of the North American democracy...which has a very different meaning now than the one it had during the '40s. Back in that while, the threaten from Nazis and communists was palpable and concrete, and it justified fast and offensive actions. On the opposite, we now have ambiguous "wars" against the drugs, the terrorism and similar ghosts which look like excuses to spend money, usurp governments and manipulate international relationships. How does the Captain America fit into this reality without looking like a parody created by a political cartoonist? Fortunately, co-screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely took the good decision of evading that question, and they instead preferred to use the patriotic angle as a secondary humorous detail, leaving the field free to explore the "retro" atmosphere from World War II and creating a narrative which simultaneously feels old and modern. The consequence is that we have a solid and dynamic screenplay which captures the military heroism from the war films starring John Wayne (1907-1979), while Joe Johnston's competent direction employs all kinds of modern techniques in order to bring the colorful villains and exaggerated adventures to life. In summary: a very entertaining action and adventure film, which is free of any ideological contaminants and stylish excesses.Captain America: The First Avenger faced the task of simultaneously being an exciting introduction of a superhero, and an adequate prequel of the future film The Avengers (by the way, don't forget to stay until the end of the credits). I think that the movie works very well on both aspects, even though it makes the first thing better than the second one. The transformation from the weakling Steve Rogers into Captain America touches the necessary base from the superhero manual (tough mentor: present!; romantic interest: present!; brave "sidekick": present!), without neglecting the emotional development from the character and his well balanced relationships. In the fantastic field, we have fun "pseudo-science" which adequately evokes that idealized futuristic aura which impulsed the best adventures from the "pulp" literature. And the "black and white" of heroes against villains dissipates any moral ambiguity during the battles which represent the crash between the good and the evil. And it fulfills with its function as a prequel well, even though I found the plan of the villain to be a bit generic and unimaginative. The mentions of Odin and the enigmatic "tesseract" feel like obligatory elements to preserve what was established in the film Thor, and leave everything ready for The Avengers. Nevertheless, that does not avoid Captain America: The First Avenger from being a very satisfactory experience, simultaneously different to Thor and Iron Man, and credible as a part of the same motley universe.As for the cast, I will start mentioning the supporting one. The great Tommy Lee Jones is perfect as the Col. Chester Phillips, because of the credibility and attitude he brings to that character. Hayley Atwell is the romantic interest, something which is well handled by the screenplay and her good work as an actress. Sebastian Stan is efficient as "Bucky" Barnes, who is a good collaborator and faithful friend of Rogers/Captain America. He might not have the same age as his counterpart in the comic, but I prefer it this way; I honestly do not think it would have been very credible to see a teenager fighting in World War II. And finally, Hugo Weaving brings a credible level of threaten to his villain character.As for Chris Evans in the leading role, I have opposed opinions. I consider him a good actor but, in this movie, I found him to be more credible as Rogers than as Captain America. I don't think he shows enough gravity and dramatic weight as Captain America. On the other hand, his work is good in the introduction of his new identity, when Rogers is barely assimilating the physical changes he experimented, and which may not still be registered in his subconscious. In other words, I liked Evans' performance as an unsafe young man who suddenly receives huge power without losing his nobility nor common sense...but I did not find him totally credible as Captain America. I hope he corrects that weakness in The Avengers.It seems unbelievable...three Marvel Comics films in a same year. And something which seems even more unbelievable is that none of them were a fiasco, like it had happened in previous years with films which were made without the collaboration from Marvel (I know we all want to forget them, but I have to mention the atrocious The Punisher -2004- and the laughable Ghost Rider). Putting Captain America: The First Avenger in that context, I will say that I liked it a bit more than Thor, but less than X-Men: First Class. However, on its own merits, Captain America: The First Avenger deserves a recommendation as a very competent action and adventure film with a solid screenplay and firmly directed by Johnston, whose sensibility for the "pulp" style (which had previously been displayed in the brilliant The Rocketeer) worked very appropriately in here.
Even though I'm not a fan of the romantic comedy genre, I tend to find the films from that style more tolerable when they come from independent cinema, because they usually possess an unusual artistic varnish which suggests deeper subjects. Besides, these films usually include more solid actors than the Hollywood stars whose routines we know by heart. Ruby Sparks belongs to that type of "indie" romantic cinema with a message, employing the clich√©s of the genre in order to tell an apparently fantastic story, but with a solid core of reality and valuable life lessons.The use of "magic" in a romantic comedy is usually an excuse to solve situations in the most convenient way, without having to think too much. Nevertheless, in Ruby Sparks, screenwriter Zoe Kazan employs the fantastic elements as in indispensable basis of the premise. The main characters has some "literary groupies" who try to seduce him because of his fame; however, he's looking for someone to love him for himself...and when he finally finds Ruby, it seems that his wish was accomplished. But ironically, the main character can't accept her like she is and he proceeds to "improve" her, which provokes chaos in the relationship, and in his small universe of friends and family. In other words, finding (or "creating") the perfect woman doesn't necessarily lead to the perfect relationship. And from then on, anyone can draw his/her conclusions about this film, which ended up being much deeper and more ingenious than I expected.Having said that, Ruby Sparks occasionally falls into the typical vices of independent cinema. The screenplay has some forced elements and occasionally can't avoid a pretentious air which is characteristic of the "Sundance syndrome". Going back to the pros, most of the cast brings competent performances, highlighting Kazan. I think the only weak spot is Antonio Banderas, who feels kinda forced in his character.In summary, I enjoyed Ruby Sparks pretty much and I recommend it to the fans of the romantic comedy as well as to its haters, because it proves that the genre can produce interesting and amusing stuff when it's in the hands of filmmakers with talent.
Widely acclaimed as one of the best films of 2011, A Separation was released in my country with quite a delay, but I could finally confirm the virtues from this Iranian movie, whose deceptively simple screenplay hides devastating reflections about the human nature, not to mention a very interesting look to the "normal" life in Iran, a country which might be misunderstood by the inhabitants of the Western world. Having said that, I liked this film more because of its cultural content than because of its screenplay, and I think it was a bit overrated.As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, one of the main reasons why I liked A Separation pretty much is because it introduced me to the daily life of Iranian people, who are much more "Westernalized" than I imagined, but still subject to the omnipresent influence of religion in every aspect of their existence. Independently from the family drama which impulses the film, I think that the most important function from A Separation is as a "demystification" of the Islamic culture which, thanks to the cinema and TV, has surely taken much more exotic and sinister dimensions in the minds from the rest of the world (specially to those of us who consume abundant quantities of North American popular entertainment). Needless to say that that doesn't only reflect the natural environment from A Separation, but also its solid screenplay, which simultaneously finds the differences which separate us from the characters, and the similarities which connect us to them, regardless of the part of the world we are in.As for the formal story of A Separation, I really appreciated the fact that it ignored the schemes from commercial cinema in order to employ an organic and realistic development of events and decisions which mold the characters' destiny. In that aspect, A Separation isn't like other family dramas...and however, it covers the same narrative field without using dramatic clich√©s to make us feel the emotions and conflicts from the characters. The performances are perfect, and one of the main reasons why this movie works is because we perceive the characters as real people from the first scene. Meanwhile, director Asghar Farhadi shows an excellent handling of cameras, locations and scene choreographs, but without unnecessary outshine; I would almost say that A Separation looks like a documentary, but I don't want to give the impression that it belongs to the "simulated documentary" niche, because it's not like that...the sensation of realism and immediate presence is precisely due to the fact that the camera doesn't hinder nor is noticed. We are in the same places the characters are, and that can occasionally feel uncomfortable...Nevertheless, I have to say that I couldn't understand some details from the story completely well because of my ignorance of some aspects from the Iranian society (for example, I never understood whether the "lenders" have an official influence in judicial processes, or if that's just an instance of governmental corruption). Besides of those "cultural holes" (which are naturally my fault), I found some moments repetitive, which I think could have been deleted without making the film loose the impact, at the same time that would have made the movie a bit more agile. However, A Separation definitely deserves a recommendation, and even though I enjoyed the cultural experience more, I can't deny that the film is very good regarding screenplay, performances and direction.
The publicity from The American suggests it is an action and adventure film, when it is in fact a melancholic and deep drama.I liked The American very much, but I perfectly understand why its slow rhythm and calm narrative would make it inaccessible to those people who expect to see shootouts and explosions.And that is not a problem from the film or from the people, but from the distributors, who did not know how to sell this movie.The American is developed parsimoniously, dividing its time in the methodic way in which the main character constructs a rifle; the flourishing romance among two people who are hungry of affection; and the occasional moments of suspense.Oh, and we also have conversations between the main character and a priest, which contribute to reveal the psychology from the first one mentioned.And all that is framed by the perfect Italian locations, which are full of atmosphere and detail, but without becoming into the idealized brochures from advertising agencies we have seen in movies which were also set in that country (such as Letters to Juliet and Under the Tuscan Sun).I would have said that is an unusual style for director Anton Corbjin, who made many video-clips of Metallica, U2 and Depeche Mode...if he had not already shown his firm hand and measured vision in the excellent film Control.In order to make a relaxed narrative like the one from The American to work, we need a good actor in the leading role, so that we can perceive the thoughts from the main character in an almost intuitive way.Fortunately, George Clooney is one of those actors, and his brilliant performance in The American is one of the best attributes from this movie.The rest of the cast also made a good work, highlighting Violante Placido, Johan Leysen and Thekla Reuten.The brief sequences from The American which could be considered as "action" look almost anti-climatic...like an interruption in the paused routine from the main character.And this is one of the few movies in which the romance is not used as a forced ornament, but as an integral part from the screenplay.The only negative element from The American is that there are a few scenes which feel out of context.However, that minor fail did not avoid me from having a fascinating time with The American, which I very enthusiastically recommend with the warning that you do not have to expect shootouts and explosions.
The movies about disasters have been a constant in the cinema from its beginnings,and they generally follow a established formula : a catastrophe threatens the world,a country or a city,and a group of audacious human beings fight against it making a big personal sacrifice.That genre is still active,and it is more easy to make movies like that now because the digital effects make it relatively easy and cheap to create images producer Irwin Allen did not even imagine during the 70's.A little bit more than 10 years ago,we could see movies like Independence Day,Deep Impact and Armageddon,in which a group of soldiers and scientists formed a group in order to rescue the planet.The message was clear : the world (or,more precisely,the United States) is ready to face every contingency from the destiny,and they could trust that every global danger was going to be saved by Bruce Willis or Ben Affleck.However,during the last 5 years,we have seen a new kind of film catastrophe on movies like The Day After Tomorrow,I Am Legend,The Happening,War of the Worlds or Cloverfield : the disaster is unavoidable,it does not have a simple solution and the characters only try to escape alive.This tendency does not require heroic (North American) redeemers who are equipped with a high level of technology,irreverent attitude and a woman of science at their sight; now,the characters need enough ingenuity (or luck) to survive the tragedy.Even if the humanity (or country,or city) survives,the reason is random or by an external factor which appears at the last moment.Knowing is the most recent film with that characteristics and,although it is not a bad film,I found it mediocre.The first 90 minutes from this movie are moderately entertaining.Nicolas Cage brings a competent performance and the investigation his character does is reasonably interesting,although the excessive quantity of coincidences does not feel credible at all.It seems the screenplay did not completely know how to take advantage of its original premise,so because of that,we have various holes and easy coincidences.The last half an hour from Knowing is extremely absurd,and at the ending,we have a completely ridiculous "deus-ex-machina".This movie was not what I expected from director Alex Proyas.I liked his semi-independent movies very much,but his work as a mercenary director for big Hollywood studios seems to have extinguished the visionary talent behind The Crow,Dark City and Garage Days.I,Robot was a moderately entertaining but insipid and mediocre movie and Knowing falls on the same.So,in sight of his excellent previous work,I have felt disappointed with his two most recent movies.I cannot deny this movie has some interesting ideas,but they are not completely well developed by the screenplay.Knowing is not a bad movie and I have to say it kept me moderately entertained.But I cannot excuse the ridiculous ending and the various fails from this movie,not to mention that it disappointed me to back to see Proyas making a movie which wastes his big talent.Still,I can give a slight recommendation to this movie,mainly,for not being boring.
The trailer of The Roommate makes the film look like an extra-official remake of Single White Female, that famous film belonging to the "psychotic woman" sub-genus, which was quite popular during the '80s and '90s. And the truth is that I did not find that a bad idea. A juvenile version of Single White Female could have worked well in the hands of filmmakers with the necessary talent in order to transcend the trite premise and take it to the melodramatic extremes which had made that film popular. However, the story from The Roommate ended up being quite different to the one from Single White Female, and the result is a tedious and absolutely bland film with a horrible screenplay and, with one exception, bad performances.In fact, I should not be surprised by how bad The Roommate is. With a cast almost exclusively integrated by attractive actors of TV series (Leighton Meester from Gossip Girl; Minka Kelly from Friday Night Lights; Aly Michalka from Hellcats; Nina Dobrev from The Vampire Diaries; Matt Lanter from 90210; etc.), it should have been natural for me to expect one of those insipid "PG-13" movies which dilute the suspense to inoffensive levels, but keeping themselves enough "dark" in order to provoke some shocks to the pre-adolescent spectators.As for the performances, Meester is the only person from the cast who shows some energy and conviction. The rest of the actors brings genuinely pathetic performances, specially Kelly, Michalka and Cam Gigandet. In conclusion, I recommend you not to waste your time and your money in this piece of junk.
Enemy is a polished Canadian-Spanish co-production, and I don't know if it was because of the Toronto locations, or its cold and clinical narrative tone, but it reminded me of director David Cronenberg's first films, something I definitely say as a compliment. Jake Gyllenhaal brings a brilliant performance in the two roles he plays, defining each character with the necessary precision in order to distinguish them with each other, but leaving a hint of ambiguity in order to play with our expectation and accentuate the mystery of both characters with similarities and differences which go beyond their physical appearance. On the negative side from Enemy, the enigmatic premise ends up getting reduced to a psycho-sexual melodrama which on some way betrays the potential of the story. The reaction of the characters occasionally feel out of proportion with the situation; and the drama feels a bit over the top and artificial on some occasions. On the positive side, I appreciate the fact that the film took a fantasy concept and distilled it to the most basic human level, taking us to the inside of the characters in order for us to explore their complex emotions, instead of seeking external answers in the shape of predictable paradigms of horror or science fiction. Having said that, the unexpected final scene fundamentally alters our perception of the story, and opens even more alternatives of interpretation which I prefer to leave in the hands of every spectator (I have some theories, but they are probably incorrect, so I will take my habitual attitude of not trying to "understand" the movie, but simply enjoying its general effect and contemplating the possibilities, without engaging myself with any of them). In summary, Enemy is a satisfactory and very interesting film, and I can recommend it, specially to those who like "weird" movies which don't give explanations, but propose a provocative intellectual challenge.
I generally like watching films which offer a different perspective of the genres which are monopolized by North American cinema; for example, there is a particular taste which makes Asian horror films (like The Eye or Ju-On), French action cinema (like Nid de Guepes or L'empire des Loups) or British romantic comedies (like Love Actually or Bridget Jones' Diary) attractive to me.However, it is not very common to see historical epics, since their high cost makes them unprofitable to international cinematographic industries, which are not very accustomed to the extravagance of resources from North American cinema.That is why I liked to see Mongol, a very entertaining epic which is superior to various North American films from the same genre.This co-production between Kazakhstan, Russia, Mongolia and Germany is not lacking of a glamorous varnish which makes the emotions more intense and the action more dynamic; however, there are enough ethnic overtones and cultural deepness not to discard it as a simple copy of Alexander or King Arthur.Mongol uses the conventions from epic cinema in order to help us to assimilate the interesting story it tells.And even though many people have spoken against its historical imprecision, I think it is excusable the creative license which clouds the facts in favor of the melodrama, because co-screenwriters Arif Aliyev and Sergei Bodrov properly decided to put the entertainment over the academic precision.I do not have any problem with that focus, because I do not watch a movie to learn History, but to have an entertaining time, and I think Mongol succeeded in that.The battle scenes are brutal and bloody, something which increases the realism, even though this movie is not lacking of stylish ornaments and cinematography which make those scenes to look "cool".It may not be a great movie, but Mongol is a very entertaining experience which finds a good balance between political drama and commercial attraction.I recommend this movie with confidence.
Saw was an excellent film with solid suspense, adequate atmosphere and an emotional background which is not very frequent to find in the horror genre.Saw 2 was entertaining, but not highly memorable.Saw 3 was boring and unsatisfactory.Saw IV was at more or less the same level of the second film from the saga.Saw V did not know how to continue with the franchise and it entangled the story to the point of the incoherence.After that, we had Saw VI, which had the good idea of restoring the basic premise from the saga, minimizing the confusing "ret-con" from the previous movie and preparing a good road for future sequels...what now takes us to Saw 3D, which despite being moderately entertaining, is mediocre.To start with something positive, I will mention that the screenplay from Saw 3D is quite accessible, and it is not necessary to remember every detail from the previous movies to understand the moral and dramatic ups and downs from this new movie.On the negative side, I did not find the characters to be very interesting, and something which influences on that is that the performances are not very convincing.The old acquaintances from the franchise Costas Mandylor and Betsy Rusell feel apathetic and listless on their roles, while the new members Sean Patrick Flanery, Gina Holden and Chad Donella feel bland and feigned.As for the screenplay, its simplification of the sub-plots and its aleatory victims occasionally blur the flow from the story, so the final revelation I was expecting to link the divergent elements from the story never came.However, I have to admit that the gore effects from Saw 3D are pretty good.Before watching the film, I was fearing to find a saturation of bad special effects and ridiculous scenes designed the emphasize the 3D technique with which the film was made (as it had happened in the deplorable The Final Destination), but fortunately, director Kevin Greutert did not abuse of that "gimmick" and he respects the balance of practical and digital effects.Nevertheless, the "game" prepared by the villain does not provoke too much anguish or tension.The first film from this saga comparatively had few blood, but a much bigger emotional impact.In other words, an example that less is more.In conclusion, I think Saw 3D deserves a slight recommendation because I have to admit that, despite my complaints, it never bored me.Nevertheless, it did not leave me very satisfied, mainly because I expected more from the conclusion of this saga.
There are events on the human History which are so tragic, monumental or significant, that any movie based on them seems to be automatically immune to any criticism, because those who risk themselves to talk against them seem to be disrespecting the victims or heroes those movies portrait.The Jewish Holacaust is one of those events; the same applies to any genocide, even more if it is recent; and other example is the apartheid, which existed in South Africa for many years.I mention all that because, even though I found Invictus to be an interesting film, it did not leave me completely satisfied and I found important fails on it, although I do not deny the validity of its message, or the importance of the events it portrays.I simply do not completely agree with the way they are exposed.During the first half of Invictus, we follow the character of Nelson Mandela on the following days to his election as a President; however, on the second half, the screenplay changes its focus and it becomes into a sport movie, dedicating most of the time to a very important rugby match.That change of perspective irritated me, because beyond the fact that I do not have any interest in rugby and I do not know the rules of the game, I think that was a weak analogy of the huge challenges Mandela faced as a President of South Africa and of his important successes.In other words, there is absolutely fascinating material on Mandela's life, and I do not think that a simple rugby match was the best way to examine it.Besides, I feel that, with the rugby match, the film looses its narrative axis.On the positive side, Morgan Freeman brings one of the best performances from his entire career (something which means a lot) as Mandela.I do not wanna exaggerate, but Freeman was truly born for this character.Matt Damon also brings a solid performance, at the same time he shows a good dominion of South African accent; but he is a bit darkened by Freeman's extraordinary development.Invictus is an interesting movie, but its problem is that this story offered almost unlimited narrative potential, and the movie decided to focus on its most simple aspects.In summary, Invictus is an interesting movie when it could have been fascinating.However, I think it deserves a recommendation, because it is entertaining, it is well directed...and mainly because of Freeman.
The film Conviction is based on an astonishing and certainly inspiring true story. So, I expected Hollywood to become it into a cloying melodrama with many tears and few narrative integrity. To my surprise, screenwriter Pamela Gray and director Tony Goldwyn took the opposite road, focusing on the facts and carefully controlling the emotions from the film not to suffocate the story, bringing as a final result, a concise, frugal and very interesting film which does not spare emotive force.The title of the film (Conviction) works on two levels: on its simplest way, it speaks about the conviction of an accused man which is more based on his personality and reputation than in the investigation of facts and examination of evidence. And on a deeper way, it describes the strong conviction which impulsed his sister for years in order to prove his innocence. The axis of the film is obviously the crusade of the woman for justice; but what I find most interesting about the film is her personal evolution, starting as an insecure girl from the town and ending as a strong woman who believes in herself and is consent of all the things she sacrificed in order to fulfill the moral debt she feels with her brother.And the credit of that mainly belongs to Hilary Swank, who brings an excellent performance in that role. Swank took an absolute possession of her character and she "dissapears" into it without falling into the exaggerations and histrionic juggling the Oscars like so much. The rest of the cast also makes a solid work, from the great Sam Rockwell to Minnie Driver, without forgetting Melissa Leo and Juliette Lewis. But the movie belongs to Swank, and her hypnotic presence is definitely one of the best attributes from Conviction.I also liked the sober emotional balance from the screenplay, along with its discipline of sticking to the facts without using unnecessary drama. The complains I have against this movie is that a few parts feel kinda dull, and that the ending looses some force. However, that does not avoid me from recommending Conviction as a very solid film with many positive elements.
After two horrible movies, the Resident Evil saga redeemed itself (at least in my humble opinion) with the third part, subtitled Extinction, because even though it was not a great or highly memorable movie, it was entertaining and with a consistent and well structured screenplay which left the disjointed and modular narrative from the first two films behind.Unfortunately, Resident Evil 4: Afterlife goes back to the arbitrary twists and forced logic from the first two films (although on a lesser degree), at the same time it bored me and it left me dissatisfied.To start with, the screenplay from Resident Evil: Resurrection is absolutely hollow, and the worst thing of all is that it seems that screenwriter Paul W.S. Anderson (who was also the director) did not even care to construct a coherent story, because he thought that the abundance of "cool" action scenes, with slow-motion action, explosions and stunts would be enough for the audience to ignore the fact that the film lacks of a solid story.Big mistake from his part.And Anderson also failed on his work as a director in here, because he is absolutely unable to create atmosphere, or emotions to endorse the action we see on scene.In other words, there was not even one single second in Resident Evil: Afterlife in which I felt even the slightest amazement, anguish or suspense.And that lack of an emotional support is the main thing which sinks √ßthis movie.So, in conclusion, I cannot recommend Resident Evil: Afterlife, because I found it to be unsatisfactory and boring.By the way, after watching this film, I remembered the time in which it was assumed that the great George A. Romero was going to direct the original Resident Evil.Unfortunately, that did not happen, but in case a fifth movie from this saga gets made, I hope the works of directing and writing the screenplay are given to him, because what it would need are not more fights filmed on "bullet time", but more atmosphere and narrative deepness.
While I was watching A Prophet, I could not avoid the comparisons to the also recently released straight-to-DVD in my country film Cell 211, since both take place in a prison.However, it is very clear that they are two very different films, because even though both denounce the corruption, internal management and injustices from the nightmarish setting, A Prophet is an undoubtedly much more mature film, because its ambitions go beyond the suspense seasoned with social commentary from Cell 211.The external drama from the main character of A Prophet could have been the subject of a more traditional story, but co-screenwriters Jacques Audiard (who was also the director) and Thomas Bidegain preferred to focus into the internal evolution, something which makes the story to be more intimate and satisfactory.The point from A Prophet is not to make us ingratiate with the main character, but to show us his methodic development, which in many aspects seems to celebrate the ascent of a young man, who discovers his potential behind a lacking of any opportunities life; but on the other hand, it is a sordid visit to the reality of a penitentiary, where the concept of "rehabilitation" is completely ignored in favor of the training of new criminals in a vicious circle of ambition and survival.That ambivalence of tone is the main element which makes this film to be deep, disturbing and absolutely fascinating, because its realism is not based on the typical devices from the "prison cinema", but on a sober and natural style which does not make any traps to express its message, or is worried by commercial requirements.The same criterion is extended to Tahar Rahim's performance as the main character.In the past, I have mentioned that I like the actors who are able to express a lot saying little; however, Rahim is the opposite, since his impassive face makes the thoughts and feelings his character experiments to be indecipherable.Far away from damaging the movie, that curious acting decision makes the film to be even more intense, by forging a character of unpredictable reactions who surprises us with every revelation from his character, even if it is emotional or rational.And that performance, plus the brilliant screenplay and the perfect direction, make A Prophet to be an extraordinary film, which brought me an unforgettable experience.In summary, this movie absolutely deserves all the acclamation it won around the world, and also a very enthusiastic recommendation from my part, because this film is an authentic gem.
I had good expectations before watching What Just Happened because Robert De Niro had previously worked with director Barry Levinson in Wag the Dog, one of my favorite political comedies, and I was enthusiastic to see them working together again in a satire of the film industry. Unfortunately, What Just Happened is too bland and artificial to consider it as a genuine denounce against Hollywood, and I think that it is nothing more than an insipid comedy whose good intentions are not enough for justifying its lack of energy or its boring screenplay.It is easy to laugh at Hollywood, because from the outside, it seems like an absurd industry which punishes the originality at the same time it promotes the mediocrity and the conformism. However, I would have thought that screenwriter Art Linson (who also wrote the book this movie is based on) would have had more things to say about Hollywood, since he has been working for various decades as a powerful producer with various mainstream films (such as, for example, Fight Club, Heat and The Untouchables) in his filmography. And I think that is the main problem from What Just Happened: it does not even remotely go as far as it should, and it simply recycles the same jokes and situations we have seen in much better satires of the film industry, from the movie The Player to TV series like Entourage and Extras.Among the few positive things I can say about this movie, I have to mention the solid performances, from Stanley Tucci as a capricious screenwriter to Michael Wincott as a director/artist obsessed with his vision, without forgetting about Catherine Keener as an inflexible director from a studio and John Turturro as a traitor agent who is only worried in charging his next commission. But the best performance of What Just Happened comes from De Niro, who can credibly express the tumult of emotions his character must keep under control in order not to ruin his career or his personal life. However, despite the competent performances, I do not feel that What Just Happened deserves even a slight recommendation, because I found it to be a boring and unfunny satire which lacks of ambition.
I would like to see director David Cronenberg still working in the horror genre which made him famous during the '70s and the '80s, but the truth is that his transition to the dramatic cinema has been brining very good results from the artistic point of view, even though not from the economical one. His film A Dangerous Method is a clear example...the subject is abstract and cerebral, the rhythm from the story is too slow in order to satisfy the requirements from commercial cinema, and even though this film could have been an intense romantic drama, Cronenberg decided to bring the film his habitual clinical coldness. The result is a film I liked very much, even though I perfectly understand the complaints some people had against it.Independently of the credit brought by the spectator to the technique of the psychoanalysis, or to the respective theories from Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) and Carl Jung (1875-1961), A Dangerous Method is a fascinating study of their points of view, perfectly expressed by two actors who take an absolute possession of their characters. Sure, I couldn't have expected less from Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender, who both bring adequately sober and modulated works. Keira Knightley is totally expressive and passionate in her role; I was particularly left astonished by the extraordinary scene shared by Knightley's character and Jung's wife (brilliantly interpreted by Sarah Gadon), which is full of subtext we have to cypher through both actresses' faces. The conversations between Jung and Freud are also among the best elements from the film, even though many idea exchanges were made by mail; as a consequence, Cronenberg and his cast faced the difficult homework of loading all the dramatic weight on static images of Jung and Freud reading letters...scenes which are technically easy, but narratively complicated. And the amazing thing is that they work wonderfully well.I understand why some people found A Dangerous Method to be a superficial film, since Cronenberg's coldness stifles the vehemence from the story, and might avoid some people to getting "plunged" into it, as it could be expected in a more conventional "romantic triangle" (or it might be better to say "academic triangle"). However, I think my personal sensibility is more similar to Cronenberg's, and that's the reason why I prefer to watch a cold and intelligent biographical movie such as A Dangerous Method, instead of an artificial and manipulative one (such as A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man). I also liked the screenplay from A Dangerous Method, because it's very well structured, and it's full of brilliant conversations which educate us without proposing that to themselves, and which are more captivating due to their precision than due to their eloquence. In conclusion, A Dangerous Method is an excellent film, and I enthusiastically recommend it because it's entertaining and it left me thinking for a long while after it ended.
It would be stupid to go the the cinema to watch romantic movies again and again when I know I am going to hate them, as well as I hated most of all the ones I have seen in my life.Oh, but there is the detail..."most of the all the ones".It is that optimistic hope to find a gem of the genre (such as Love Actually or Kissing Jessica Stein) what invites me to risk myself again and again because, after all, I do not hate the romance.I simply hate the stories which use the romance clich√©s as a substitute of the genuine emotions they cannot evoke (I can mention the films Dear John and Remember Me as recent examples).Unfortunately, that also applies to Letters to Juliet, the most recent romantic film I hated.The only thing I liked in Letters to Juliet is the excellent performance from the great Vanessa Redgrave, who gives a lesson of subtleness and emotion to many modern actresses who are more worried about the bright in her lips than about their performances.On the other hand, I felt Amanda Seyfried to be wasted in her role.That is a shame, because I have considered Seyfried as a brilliant actress since I saw her as the reckless Karen in the film Mean Girls; I only hope Seyfried is not starting to waste her talent in horrible romantic films such as this one, where she sacrifices artistic credibility in favor of fleeting popularity.As for the rest of the cast, Christopher Egan is insipid on his role, while Gael Garc√≠a Bernal feels apathetic and irritating.So, in summary, it is needless to say I do not recommend Letters to Juliet.Unfortunately, I have failed once again in my search of a good romantic movie.
Like many films about time travel, X-Men: Days of Future Past occasionally stumbles over its own rules. Besides, there are some inconsistencies in the continuity of the saga, not to mention that the screenplay has few things in common with the comic Days of Future Past. All those factors make the narrative to feel a bit disperse, because there are so many characters and events that the scenes don't always flow naturally, and it can be noticed that screenwriter Simon Kinberg had to give them some push. But fortunately, X-Men: Days of Future Past has much more pros than cons. The characters continue with their evolution and learning, invariably considering their nature over their mutant powers, and as consequence, the film isn't only enjoyed because of the epic battles between human and mutants, but also because of the emotional conflicts from the characters. In other words, X-Men: Days of Future Past doesn't only care for the special effects, but also for the dialogues and the human conflicts. However, that doesn't mean that the battles and the special effects are bad; on the opposite, there are some excellent displays of mutant power (Quicksilver's appearance and Mystique in Paris come to mind). As for the actors, they all made a perfect work, highlighting James McAvoy, Hugh Jackman and the great Peter Dinklage. In conclusion, I would consider X-Men: Days of Future Past inferior to X-Men, X2 and X-Men: First Class, but superior to X-Men: The Last Stand, X-Men Origins: Wolverine and The Wolverine. But whatever the way it is, I found it very entertaining, and I consider it worthy of a recommendation.
I think that the comic media possesses some magic property which facilitates the assimilation of fantasy combined with some degrees of "reality".The secret may be in the way in which the brain processes the draws, or it may lies on the intermediate space between panels, where our mind adds the necessary information in order to complement the narrative and bring it fluidity and coherence.Because of that it is such a difficult work to adapt a superheroes story to the big screen...what wonderfully works in the pages of a comic can feel absurd and out of place when it becomes into real people fighting in real locations.Some movies (for example, Batman Begins or Spider Man 1 and 2) preserved the alchemical combination, while other ones fatally fail because of the incompatibility between concept and execution (for example, Catwoman or The Punisher).So, what can we expect of a movie based on a "realistic" comic which examines the existence of heroes in contemporary society? Co-screenwriters Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman (Vaughn was also the director) made their best effort to find that precarious balance in Kick-Ass, and even though they did not always achieve it, the ingenious story and the interesting characters help to endure the least unfortunate moments from the movie.I think that I went to see Kick Ass with excessively high expectations.I liked it, but at the same time, I felt the narrative to be a bit weak.Despite the dynamism Vaughn brought to the intense action sequences, the film has a low level of energy, something which is translated on a reduced emotional impact despite the good moments of suspense, twists, revelation, triumph and failure the movie has.I honestly do not know how to exactly describe my reaction; I simply feel that the film should have gone further on every sense.If it had engaged with a more concrete style (like the expressionist dystopia from Batman Returns or the melodramatic rawness from Watchmen), Kick-Ass would have generated a defined identity instead of rambling between genres and repeatedly encountering with the diffuse line between reality and fantasy.But, despite all that, I enjoyed the movie, mainly because of the performances.Aaron Johnson makes a good work in the leading role, despite his character being superficially written.As the ambiguous Red Mist, Christopher Mintz-Plasse exercises another facet of his talent by bringing a darker "taste" to the kind of acting he made in Superbad and Role Models.Mark Strong is perfect as the villain, because he is always very credible and he avoids his character to become into a caricature.However, it is impossible to deny that Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz steal the show.The young Moretz is definitely a revelation, and her performance in Kick Ass incremented my curiosity for the remake of the excellent Let the Right One In.As for Cage, his character could have degenerated into a bunch of exaggeration, but he modulated it to the perfection.And finally, I also liked the performances from Clark Duke, Evan Peters and Lyndsy Fonseca; their characters may seem as "fillers", but they habit them with credibility and enthusiasm.The screenplay from Kick-Ass moves a bit away from the original comic, something which usually would not bother me very much; but in this case, I felt that the introduction of caricature elements (specially near the ending) betrays the ideals from creators Mark Millar and John Romita Jr.In other words, I would have preferred the movie to respect the brutal contrasts from the graphic novel a bit more (yes, despite the bloody violence, I felt the movie flinched on various scenes).However, all my complaints do not avoid me from recommending Kick-Ass as an entertaining re-interpretation of the modern superhero, which will not change the face of the genre, but which made me have a good time.
I have to say I did not like director Isabel Coixet's previous work.My Life Without Me and the intolerable The Secret Life of Words had bored me pretty much,they were pretentious and they did not have too much to say.However,I think Coixet made her best movie so far with Elegy,her most recent film.This movie is far from being great,but it avoids many problems from her previous movies,at the same time it was an interesting experience to me,something completely different to My Life Without Me and The Secret Life of Words.I usually do not praise the title of a movie but,in this case,I have to do it.An elegy is a poetic lament which announces the lost of something...or somebody.And I think that word perfectly summarizes the message and content from this movie.If you see this film,you will understand what I am talking about.The main character from Elegy uses a dug intellectualism to seduce Consuela (the other main character),and on some way,I think the movie uses the same trick with the spectator.Elegy has many solemn dialogs and reflexive ideas but,beyond their surface,I found them as a methodical trick the movie uses to make the spectator feel impressed with its apparent intelligence.In other words,I think this movie thinks it is more intelligent than what it really is,and I think that's the worst fail from it.Another negative element is that some moments felt a little bit boring.The character of Professor Kepesh is very interesting because of his emotional complexity.I think that character was perfectly developed by the screenplay,although I must add that it also helps it was performed by Ben Kingsley,who brings a phenomenal performance.He is so involved with his character that he never seems to be acting at all.An extraordinary achievement from Kingsley which was unfortunately ignored.Pen√©lope Cruz is an excellent actress but,for some reason,she did not convince me too much with her performance on this movie.I think she could not completely become into her character.Patricia Clarkson is brilliant as always and,although her appearance is not too long,she shows credibility and conviction.And I also appreciated the performance from the great Dennis Hopper,which is serious and honest,although it has a touch of irreverent humor.Coixet's sparing direction works well because it lets the story to be developed with sobriety and elegance,but without loosing the emotional impact from certain scenes.Elegy is far from being a great movie but I had an interesting experience watching it.I think that a little bit less of pretentiousness on the screenplay would have worked better but this movie deserves a recommendation in spite of its fails.Rating:7.5
Almost a decade ago, the film Shrek left many people amazed (including me) with its extraordinary animation and a hilarious parody of some famous fairy-tales (specially the Disney interpretations of them), without neglecting the creation of memorable characters and honest emotions.Shrek 2 was also excellent, but it was a bit below the level from the first film.Then, in 2007, Shrek the Third was a desperate attempt to have the magic from the first two films; the result was mediocre, and a big declination from the first two films.Now, we have Shrek Forever After, and even though it is far from reaching the level from Shrek 1 and 2, it kept me entertained, and I think it represents an improvement on the third film.What I mostly liked from Shrek Forever After is that screenwriters Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke followed the evolution from Shrek in a natural way.In the first film, we saw the change in Shrek's life when he first fell in love; in the second one, he had to face the responsibilities from adult life; in the third one, he faced the insecurities of the paternity; and now, the ogre feels overwhelmed by the family routine and he misses the liberty from his youth, which is a subject that is a bit more mature to what we are accustomed to see on an animated film.However, I found various fails in Shrek Forever After, specially in the fact that the screenplay is not very ingenious.Its handling of the humor keeps being based on songs, characters and events from popular culture, but that does not feel as fresh and irreverent as it had felt on the first Shrek; in fact it feels a bit tiring now, because of the large number of animated films which have used that strategy.However, there are good moments of humor in the interaction between the characters; I particularly liked the character of Puss in Boots; most of the laughs I had while watching this movie came from that character.Good work, Antonio Banderas.Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about Eddie Murphy, one of my favorite comedians, whose contribution to the other movies had been among the best elements from them.However, I felt his voice acting in Shrek Forever After to be forced and listless.The rest of the cast made a decent work, but nobody particularly stood out.But the whole experience from Shrek Forever After is not highly memorable, and one of the best things I can say about it is that it avoided to fall into some irritating mistakes from the third film (even though that does not exempt it to have its own fails).However, I think I can recommend Shrek Forever After because it kept me entertained...however, it is very far away from reaching the magic from the first two films.
10 years ago,in the TV programme Saturday Night Live,comedian Will Ferrell made popular the character of an adult guy who behaves as an idiot.On that moment,that was innovative.But now,that has became into a clich√© and,after seeing it on an enormous quantity of films (two examples : Dodgeball and Blades of Glory),I am getting a little bit tired of it.That's one of the main reasons which made Forgetting Sarah Marshall not too good for me.This is not a bad comedy but it has various negative points.Besides using a tiring formula,the screenplay is mediocre.Various gags from it fail while a lot of things feel forced.Jason Segel shows zero grace and charisma in the leading role and he becomes irritating.In spite of all that negative elements,I cannot say this is a bad movie.After all,it did not bore me and I laughed on some occasions.So,I think I can give Forgetting Sarah Marshall a slight recommendation if you just wanna have a light time and nothing else.In summary,this movie is not bad but it is not too good either.
I do not know whether it was good or bad that director Danny Boyle won so many awards and recognitions with Slumdog Millionaire. On the one hand, I am glad to see that his visual and narrative talent (which was underrated for a long time) was finally recognized; on the other hand, it seems that his future work will automatically be categorized as an "Oscar competitor" (at least for a while), something which could make him to create unreal expectations about his movies, and as a consequence, alter the perception from the spectators, who are always ready to overthrow their "idols". What brings me to 127 Hours, a very good drama based on a true event which comes to life under Boyle's solid direction, bringing us an interesting film experience...even though I would not consider it to be as exceptional as many people consider it to be.Before watching 127 Hours, I thought that it was going to take a similar road to the one taken by the thriller Buried, by spreading to the spectator with the claustrophobia of a character trapped into a reduced space. And Boyle achieved the atmosphere very well, because even with only an actor confined into a hole with a rock over one of his arms, the camera is always fluid and unpredictable, capturing every scene from the angle or emplacement which transmits us the biggest emotional impact (and I am not only talking about the video camera with which the main character captures his most fatalistic thoughts). In other words, 127 Hours feels as dynamic as any action film thanks to Boyle's excellent direction, which is so energetic that left me breathless during some scenes, and so precise that it does not loose even one detail from James Franco's performance, something which equally contributed to keep me interested.By the way, Franco brings a very solid performance which is worthy of the acclamation he is receiving. As for the supporting cast, I can barely mention it, because the whole movie belongs to Franco. Nevertheless, I think that Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara made an efficient work with their brief roles.However...even though I liked 127 Hours pretty much, I did not find it to be something exceptional. Its dominion of the suspense, the anguish and the emotional collapse from the main character worked for me while I was watching the movie; I also liked Boyle's direction, whose visual tricks have an emotional and narrative justification. However, I cannot deny that when the film ended, I felt the experience to have been a bit hollow and insubstantial. Nevertheless, I think that 127 Hours definitely deserves a recommendation because of its direction, performances and because it tells a very interesting story.
Something the films directed by the great Darren Aronofsky have in common is the obsession. Independently from what the plot is about, we can be sure that the axis of the story will be the obsession which is devouring a person's life, either if it is in the shape of an impossible mathematical formula (Pi); the addiction (Requiem for a Dream); the eternal love (The Fountain); or recovering past glories (The Wrestler). Now, his most recent film Black Swan follows that thematic tendency, at the same time it brought me a unique and fascinating experience.I think that Black Swan is a movie which will provoke divisions between the spectators, because while some ones will acclaim it as an excellent film full of deepness, symbolism and emotion, other ones might consider it as an absurd melodrama due to the visual tricks Aronofsky uses in order to portray the unstable mind from the main character. Personally, I belong to the first group, because even though there were a few occasions in which I found the visual tricks to be a bit excessive, I was "hooked" on the film from the very beginning until the end. And something which helped me to that is the extraordinary performance from Natalie Portman. To put it simply, she brings one of the best performances I have ever seen (I am not exaggerating). From the first seconds of the movie, Portman establishes the attitude and personality from her character with an incredible clarity and precision, and as a consequence, we do not need too much dialog or "exposition" in order to understand the hard way she took in order to lead to the New York Ballet, the difficult situation she lives at her house, and the damage the suppression of emotions and natural instincts in her search of perfection provoked on her. Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder, Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey also bring solid performances; however, they get a bit darkened by Portman's monumental work.The only time I have seen ballet live precisely was a staging of Swan Lake, and I was left impressed by the elaborated scenic effects the show was adorned with (I particularly remember a lightning which announced the entrance of an evil sorcerer). Black Swan also employs many special effects, but most of them are subtle and almost invisible, something which makes them to be more disturbing because we are never really sure if we really saw what we think we had seen. That is the general atmosphere from this movie...an ambiguous balance between fantasy and reality, not as opposite extremes, but as fusion of experiences which have to be interpreted by every spectator in order to draw conclusions. That nightmarish tone might be the reason why some people consider Black Swan to be a horror movie; but I think that it would be a mistake to typecast it into a specific niche, because its ambition is superior to belonging into any formula or genre.And I think that it is not convenient neither to "understand" Black Swan, or to separate the real scenes from the ones which (maybe) take place into the main character's mind, because I feel that the purpose of the movie is for us to feel the confusion, anguish and terror the main character experiences under the intense pressure the different aspects of her life provoke on her, from the horribly competitive world of professional ballet, to the anxiety she feels at her house due to her own insecurities and the influence from her suffocating mother. Aronofsky and Portman can make us "live" that situation with excellent results, and I enthusiastically recommend this movie, because despite not being perfect, it definitely is a great movie.
Many people is comparing the film Real Steel with the classic toy "Rock'em Sock'em Robots", but the truth is that the popular culture has a long history of robot fights, from the entertaining films Robot Jox and Crash and Burn, to the memorable episode from The Twilight Zone titled Steel (mmh...curious), without forgetting the chapters of Futurama which rounded on Bender and its incursions on wrestling. Real Steel surpasses all its predecessors regarding the quality of the special effects...but for the rest, it has such a simple, pre-fabricated and corny screenplay that it was impossible for me to get interested in it.The conflict between father and son looks like director Shawn Levy's favorite formula, because it had already been employed in the tedious Night at the Museum and its atrocious sequel. In that aspect, Real Steel does not offer anything new; the dialogs are painfully weak ("You have been working with robots for such a long time that you ended up becoming into one of them"), the emotions from the human characters are more artificial than the ones from the mechanical boxers, and the moments of the biggest melodrama produce unintentional laughs instead of a lump in the throat. Besides, it was impossible for me to swallow the premise that in 20 or 30 years from now, the robotic technology will advance enough in order to create the fighting machines portrayed in the movie. That looks like a concept taken from the '50s, which ignores the contemporary technology in order to jump to an "alternative" future, more consistent with the TV series The Jetsons than with the digital environment we are living in now. Besides, I never understood whether the robots had a conscience or if they were mere puppets from their "trainers". I guess that screenwriter John Gatins wanted to create a similar friendship between a boy and a robot to the one portrayed in The Iron Giant, but unfortunately without getting himself into science fiction subjects, like the definition of the conscience and the rights of the robots.Hugh Jackman showed talent for bringing realism to characters in a fantastic environment in the films The Fountain, The Prestige, the X-Men trilogy and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. However, his character in Real Steel is so poorly written that he cannot do too much with it. Evangeline Lilly is only used for being a pretty face, and the kid Dakota Gayo brings an adequate performance. However, the main stars of the film are the robots, which were well created by the studio Digital Domain. They might not reach the level of detail portrayed in Transformers, but that does not avoid them from being solid special effects on their own merit.However, the good special effects did not avoid me to find Real Steel pretty boring, mainly because of its weak screenplay and the fact that I did not find the action scenes exciting at all. In conclusion, I do not recommend it.
An underrated character has overcoming dreams, but he only receives mockery from the people around him.However, thanks to his dedication, he wins trust on himself and he triumphs over the adversity...and over his own insecurities.Does that sound familiar? That phrase could describe a big number of animation films, from the good ones (like A Bug's Life or Finding Nemo) to the horrible ones (like Bee Movie or Doogal).Unfortunately, Igor is a new addition to the second group, and it punishes us with 90 minutes of forced humor, far-fetched design and generic action sequences.Igor tried to make likable references to the horror cinema, but it could not achieve that because of its lack of ingenuity and grace.We are in presence of another pathetic animation film with a bland and insipid screenplay.The only thing I liked on this film was the character Scamper, thanks to Steve Buscemi's solid voice work.Pity that character has a very limited appearance on this movie.I am not among them, but I know many people excuse even the weakest screenplays when the animation is good.Well, Igor will also disappoint them, since the animation is absolutely generic and insipid.Igor may be better than the previously mentioned Bee Movie and Doogal...but that is the same as saying that drinking poison with lemon flavor is better than drinking poison with buttermilk flavour.In fact, saying "less bad" is more proper in this case than saying "better".In summary, Igor is a horrible animation film and an authentic waste of time.
Those of us who like the horror genre are accustomed to see the villain resurrecting during the final minutes from the film in order to bring us an additional scare before the credits. In My Soul to Take, that happens during the beginning, and so many times that it ended up making me laugh, something which was not a good augury for the rest of the movie. Needless to say that My Soul to Take ended up being atrocious, and particularly disappointing for those of us who expected the triumphal comeback from legendary director Wes Craven to the horror genre.The screenplay from this film is very badly written, mainly because I found its pseudo-juvenile drama so boring that I was glad when the killer started to finish the antipathetic characters. By the way, where do these horrible actors come from? I understand that this film's low budget did not allow the presence of Hollywood stars (however, I do not think the film would have been much better on that way), but I am sure that the casting sessions include an acting test, and not only competitions on who has the "coolest" hairstyle or the most rebellious attitude. And the violence is shown on an excessively brief and insipid way...like if Craven had aimed for a PG-13 instead of an R but without too much conviction, maybe in order to reassure to his investors.I made my best effort in order to find even the slightest trace of the greatness that Craven brought to films such as (just to mention two examples) A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and The Serpent and the Rainbow, but the truth is that My Soul to Take bored me to tears, something which made me to truly hate it. In summary, do not waste your time and your money in this piece of junk.
For long, it has been rumored in Hollywood the existence of a super-computer programmed to write the most predictable, irritating and repulsive movies the big studios make.Automating the process apparently became necessary in early 90's, when the screenplay of Weekend at Bernie's II caused severe damages to the screenwriters who wrote it.So, in order to avoid future legal problems, the presidents from the main studios commissioned the construction of that mythical computer, in whose memory every clich√© and every formula are stored, so that its algorithms can select them and combine them in a horrible way.So, from its secret base under the mountains from Bronson Canyon, the computer diligently works to bring us execrable movies such as, for example, Glitter, Battlefield Earth and now, the most recent one: Did You Hear About the Morgans? I honestly do not have too much to say about this "movie".Needless to say that it is so bad that it is insulting to the spectator, at the same time it shows all the things that are wrong in Hollywood.Let's say there are not any redeemable elements in this movie, and Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker are absolutely wasted on their roles.In summary, stay very far away from this piece of junk, and avoid it like a plague.I would not recommend this unbearable and vomiting movie even to my worst enemy.
The main problem from Divergent is that its premise is too far-fetched, improbable and illogical. If the story had been ingenious enough to justify so many conditions and unearthly circumstances, there wouldn't have been any problem. But no... this is simply another juvenile tale about the typical main character who must overcome her insecurity when she finds out she's "special", and her actions escalate until she practically saves the world... without forgetting, of course, the "unexpected" romance in the road to her destiny. Well, I'm speculating about saving the world. Divergent is based on a series of "young adult" novels I haven't read (and I will never do so), and the producers obviously expect to shoot sequels, so this first film establishes the (absurd) post-apocalyptic world, the bland characters and the obligatory conspiracy in which NOTHING IS LIKE IT SEEMS (translation: everything is exactly like it seems, from the predictable villain to the gallant who starts being a hateful lout, until he softens himself and shows his romantic side). In other words, a simpleton and innocuous teenage fantasy made for female spectators; and another attempt to create the saga which will inherit the crown from The Hunger Games... something which isn't precisely bad. Divergent was made for a very specific audience, and I sincerely hope that the female fans of the novels are left satisfied by this film. For the rest, the production values are pretty high, the special effects are competent and the cast is composed in a big part by attractive multi-cultural young people who seem taken from a catalogue of Urban Outfitters (what a luck for the post- apocalyptic world). I don't know how the casual spectators can take Divergent; in my personal experience, it bored me very much (specially during the "exciting" conclusion full of action), but I'm very far from belonging to this film's objective audience. Each one will know his/her posture and tolerance to this kind of film; I personally regret having wasted my time and my money on it.
It's not an excessively popular subject, but we occasionally see films about the "prodigal son (or daughter)" who lives in the big city and returns to his/her town, where he/she faces a clash of ideologies while learning something about the values and traditions those conservative communities still have. That formula is sometimes presented as a comedy, sometimes as a drama, sometimes as a romance, and sometimes all together, like in the film The Judge, whose well built screenplay offers some laughs, a bit of romance and, specially, the family drama between a son and a father who never understood each other, until the tragedy forces them to cooperate... and maybe discover virtues they weren't willing to recognize. And an actor who can definitely keep that delicate balance drama and comedy is definitely Robert Downey Jr., who is able to express deep emotions with a pleasant lightness which doesn't contradict the sincerity of his character's feelings. His excellent performance in The Judge is enough reason to see this movie... but there's much more. In the complicated role of the father, we have Robert Duvall, who expertly handles his scenes without any effort, while perfectly complementing Downey Jr.'s performance. And in the supporting cast, we also have solid performances from Vera Farmiga, Leighton Meester, Vincent D'Onofrio, Billy Bob Thornton, Jeremy Strong and Dax Shepard. The Judge is a film in which everything fits into its place, without aspiring to go beyond the minimum narrative requirement. The screenplay touches the obligatory bases from family dramas and legal thrillers; the actors make a perfect work in their roles; and director David Dobkin (whose previous filmography is mediocre at best -The Change-Up- and atrocious at worst -Fred Claus-) drives the film with an austere measure, without wasting his time into excessive style or visual flourish. In other words, there isn't too much ambition or novelty in The Judge, but there's no need to have them when the pieces work in a good harmony, conjugating with each other in order to create an entertaining, satisfactory and emotive experience (even though it's occasionally manipulative and a bit longer than it should). The legal aspect brings suspense and structure, but the most important elements of the film are the family conflict and the interaction between the actors. So, I wouldn't consider The Judge an excellent film, but I recommend it as a solid combination of family drama and legal thriller which inspires a bit, entertains pretty much and offers brilliant performances from the whole cast.
In less than a decade,director Stephen Daldry has built a career composed by movies which have been highly acclaimed.Billy Elliot,The Hours and now The Reader,combine good manufacture with mature stories.I have to say I did not like Billy Elliot and The Hours very much because,although I appreciated those two elements I mentioned,I had found them too forced on their attempt at being commercial,not to mention I had also found them to be a little bit boring.I think that with The Reader,Daldry has made his best movie so far.At the difference of his previous films,The Reader never feels forced and I had a fascinating experience while watching it.Let's see why.The "forbidden romance",which pushes the conflict of this movie,is interesting but not particularly meaningful.The ideological background from the story is much more provocative,because it shows the causes and consequences of bad decisions which seemed appropriate on a moment.Many people have criticized The Reader because of its apparent apology of Nazi war criminals but I think they took the wrong focus.The Reader is not interested in analyzing their objective innocence or guilt,but on showing how a normal and reasonable person could commit atrocities during wartime,without being the amoral monster which immediately comes to our minds.That ideological and emotional audacity is the best element from this movie,because it results absolutely fascinating.Besides,the excellent performances from Kate Winslet and David Kross help to this movie.They are 100% natural on every scene they appear.Ralph Fiennes brings a competent performance,but this movie clearly rests on Winslet's and Kross' shoulders,whose extraordinary works are completely deserving of applause.Some people may complain about the slow tone from this movie,but I do not,because the parsimonious development is essential for showing the characters' evolution and for completely involving us into the movie.The only thing I can say against this brilliant movie is that the ending feels a little bit convenient and manipulative.But,in sight of all the positive elements this movie brings,I can excuse that fail.The Reader is an excellent film which deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation.I always admire when a movie wants to leave us thinking,and that's the main reason why I liked The Reader so much.
During the 90's,the career of the brilliant comedian Jim Carrey was at the top thanks to films like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,The Mask,Dumb and Dumber and Liar,Liar.I personally found that films very funny and entertaining and Carrey could make his talent to explode at the maximum level.But,on this decade,his career went pretty unnoticed because Carrey decided to leave aside his frenetic (but excellent) performances on the comedies I mentioned,for making more serious stuff.Although I liked his performances on movies like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Majestic very much,very few people remember him on that movies.Also,his comedies Bruce Almighty and Fun With Dick and Jane,showed him more serious and controlled than in his movies from the 90's.The fact is that,as well as his performances on dramas,very few people remember him on that movies.Maybe,noticing that,Carrey decided to come back to his kind of frenetic roles from the 90's,to come back to the top.The result is Yes Man.Although this movie kept me moderately entertained,it is very far away from the comedies Carrey participated on the 90's.But,on its own merit,this movie results to be a mediocre comedy.Although I laughed on some occasions,there are various jokes which fail,because they result pretty obvious and basic.Plus,the screenplay has a lot of forced elements which do not result credible at all.And,as I mentioned,this movie is generic and mediocre.But,there are some positive elements which make Yes Man worthy of a slight recommendation.Although he has much more talent than the one he shows in this movie,Carrey brings a competent performance,and his character empathizes with the spectator.Zooey Deschannel brings a correct performance,although she does not have too much to do.And,in spite of all the fails,this movie kept me moderately entertained.That and Carrey's and Deschannel's development make me recommend softly Yes Man.Although I did not dislike it,the experience was forgettable and mediocre in my case.I think this phrase summarizes the experience I had with this movie : I do not regret watching it,but it would have not bothered me to skip it.
REC is the best horror movie I have seen in 2008 (although its release date in Spain was in 2007).Many movies have used the trick of using an improvised and very realistic cinematography (like Diary of the Dead,directed by George A. Romero),but very few movies have used that trick on an intense and credible way.And,besides of that,REC had had natural performances and creepy situations.The final result was an excellent horror film with a lot of suspense,blood and tension.That great achievement was noticed by Hollywood and following their tradition,they decided to remake REC.I had very little expectations for this movie but it was much better than I expected and it is clearly beyond the average of Hollywood remakes.In other words : Quarantine is obviously very far away from the original film but,on its own merit,it is a competent movie.First,I'll mention the negative elements from this movie.There are various forced things on the screenplay and some scenes do not result as tense as they should be.Another disadvantage are the performances.I usually like the work of Jennifer Carpenter very much (specially,on the brilliant TV series Dexter) but she is too over the top on this movie and she was not natural at all.She felt like an actress trying to seem scared.Manuela Velasco,in the original film,had been completely natural and credible.The same that happens with Carpenter happens with the rest of the cast.And,although I liked this movie,it feels unnecessary...why fixing something which is not broken?.But this movie has many positive elements.As I said,Quarantine is a good movie on its own merit.Plus,very few people saw REC,so,for them,it will be an original experience.The story from this movie is well written (with the exception of some forced things) and the frenetic tone makes of it an entertaining movie.And the last take,although it was better done on the original film,results very tense and truly creepy.Quarantine is one of the best remakes from Hollywood of horror films,but that is not saying too much,because these remakes are usually crappy.REC is a much better film than Quarantine but I still can recommend it because,on its own merit,it kept me entertained and tense.
I had interest in watching Lars and the Real Girl after all the excellent commentaries it had received.And,although I did not find the film to be great,I think this is a very good movie.The screenplay is very well written.It makes a very precise and detailed characterisation of characters and everything flows pretty well.Director Craig Gillespie (who gets totally redeemed for making the crap Mr Woodcock) made a good work as a director because he could find the correct style and tone for this movie.The actors make an impressing work.Ryan Gosling made a brilliant performance,proving once more,he is one of the best young actors of our days.Emily Mortimer,Paul Schneider and Kelli Garner also bring excellent performances because they totally become on their characters.The negative elements I found on this movie are two.The movie got a little bit slow on a moment and I would have preferred some more dynamism in there.Also,although the screenplay is very good,it has some things which do not totally fit on the story.But,in spite of that,I recommend Lars and the Real Girl because it is very good movie with many positive elements.
I was not very interested in watching Youth Without Youth, despite being director Francis Ford Coppola's first film in 10 years (if we do not consider his anonymous "contribution" to the atrocious Supernova).I liked various movies from this legendary filmmaker very much...not the ones he made as a mercenary director (like Jack or Peggy Sue Got Married), but the most personal ones (like Rumble Fish or Tucker: The Man and His Dream), where he was obviously interested in the material.But the negative commentaries Youth Without Youth received made me not to be very interested in watching it, because I did not want to find another great director reduced to a mere shadow of his previous energy (like it happened to me with Oliver Stone and Alexander, Steven Spielberg and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, John Carpenter and Ghosts of Mars, and a very long etcetera).However, Youth Without Youth was released in my country, and since I had some free time and due to a schedule coincidence, I decided to watch it.Unfortunately, all the negative commentaries were right: Youth Without Youth is a confusing, hollow and terribly boring mess, and I think this is the lowest point in Coppola's career so far.The story of this movie is complicated, but not on the interesting way which challenges us to unravel the mysteries of the narrative (like it would may happen on a film directed by Jim Jarmusch), or complicated in the sense of director David Lynch's delicious style, which invites us to draw conclusions and enjoy a dream-like experience.Youth Without Youth is complicated on a horribly tedious way.Besides, this film is full of forced and arbitrary philosophical, linguistic and literary discussions.In summary, Youth Without Youth is an unbearable experience, and my recommendation is for you to stay away from it.I still cannot believe Coppola was the responsible of this mess.
Some months ago, I read the graphic novel Cowboys & Aliens...and it honestly bored me to tears. Leaving the innovative concept described on the title aside, the story only offers hollow characters, sci-fi clich√©s badly combined with western clich√©s, and an excessively light tone which does not make any justice to the potential from that combination of genres. Paradoxically, that disappointment improved my expectations for the film Cowboys & Aliens. After all, Hollywood tends to change the novels it adapts pretty much, and I thought that some "expert" screenwriters would fix the many fails from the story. And even though Cowboys & Aliens improved a few elements from the book, it also preserved the characters without any substance, the arbitrary narrative and the inconsistent behavior from the aliens.The idea of brave cowboys facing an alien invasion is interesting, but I think it works better as a concept than as an execution. The crash between advanced extraterrestrial technology and primitive weapons from 19th century would lead to an unilateral massacre which would make the film to conclude in its first 10 minutes; so, it is necessary to find the way to give the advantage to the cowboys so that the battle is more credible and there is suspense about who the winner will be. Unfortunately, co-screenwriters Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby did not find a logical way to solve the problem, and as a consequence, they employ many traps, excessive inconsistencies and absolutely ridiculous notions in order to give the cowboys the opportunity to defend themselves from the invaders. Without deepening too much in order not to get into the spoilers field, I will mention that, despite their technology and destructive potential, the favorite method of combat from the aliens is...body-to-body fights. And besides, their vulnerability changes according to the screenplay's convenience; when the presence of suspense is necessary, the aliens are practically indestructible; but whenever the movie decides to introduce a "cool" scene, it is easy to kill them with just one shot, an Indian spear, or a small knife.And because of that, the movie constantly "pulled me out" with its coincidences and forced narrative short-cuts. On the positive side, the special effects created by Industrial Light & Magic are competent. As for the human element, Harrison Ford brings an adequate performance, while on the other side of the coin, Daniel Craig feels bland and antipathetic as the anti-hero. By the way, I am going to propose an hypothesis; Sam Rockwell and Clancy Brown interpret two supporting roles in this film, but they are too short and inconsequential; however, I think Cowboys & Aliens would have been a better movie with that duet in the leading roles; Rockwell is one of the best contemporary actors, and he has more cowboy "looks" than Craig; besides, his less athletic physique would make the challenges the character faces more interesting. As for Brown, he would have been absolutely perfect as the cacique from the village. Sure, none of them would have attracted as much spectators as Craig and Ford, but anyway...I am sure this movie would have been better if that fantasy was true.In conclusion, I cannot recommend Cowboys & Aliens, because I found it insipid, irritating, and the worst thing of all, boring. Instead of wasting your time with this film, I recommend you three very entertaining "western/fantasy" hybrids: The Burrowers (cowboys against subway humanoids -which also includes Brown in the cast!-), Dead Birds (cowboys against ghosts) and Tremors (modern cowboys against crawling "graboids"). Cowboys & Aliens might surpass them in budget, but it is not even remotely to their levels of ingenuity and amusement.
For better or for worse, Transcendence ended up being exactly like I expected: a simplified and improbable approach to the ideas proposed by futurists such as Raymond Kurzweil and Vernon Vinge since the '70s. The ideas are good, but as it always does, Hollywood determines the fact that the most important event in the history of humanity must be subject to a generic romance in order to bring it emotional validity. Otherwise, the audience wouldn't be interested. Nix! While I was watching Transcendence, it made me angry because of all the things it copies, and on top of that, it copies them badly. But on the other hand, I found Transcendence a moderately entertaining technological fable with an important warning against out-of- control science, even though at the same time, it lacks of enough ingenuity in order to classify it as "serious" science fiction. On the positive side, the actors make a good work in their characters, which were created following Hollywood's mold: they are all good-looking. I think that the day someone reaches the "singularity" in the real world, those people are going to look more similar to the cast of the TV series Silicon Valley: "weirdos" and misfits. But instead of that, we have Johnny Depp as the archetypal rebel scientist with glasses (to reflect intelligence) and with the hair expertly disheveled (to indicate his casual greatness). Morgan Freeman plays the clich√©d mentor with abundant sensibility and wisdom; and Rebecca Hall is the selfless wife who maintains endless conversations with "green-screen" settings, while she applies her considerable talent to express the surprise and the fear the screenplay isn't able to generate. Director Wally Pfister made a decent work, avoiding the film to derail under the weight from its own grandiloquence, and preserving the gravity of the situation despite the simplistic twists from the screenplay (if this movie had been made in the 20th century, everything would have been solved with an atomic bomb; but since we are in the 21st century, the only solution can be a digital virus). The concepts of artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and "technological singularity" have been handled with genuine intelligence in various novels (such as The Diamond Age, Blood Magic and William Gibson's "Bridge Trilogy"), and they were even brilliantly satirized in Futurama (in the episodes Benderama and Overclockwise). They are undoubtedly fascinating topics, and I think they will become more relevant as our unavoidable technological dependence advances. That's why I was left disappointed by the clich√©s and lazy narrative from Transcendence, even though I can give a slight recommendation to it, because as I previously said, it managed to keep me moderately entertained.
Before watching Warrior, I expected it to be a poor imitation of Rocky, but set in the more violent world of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). However, the reality ended up being very different, because Warrior is an excellent film which is more similar to The Fighter, in which we had also seen the rivalry between two brothers dedicated to the same brutal sport, balancing the action with a deep family drama in which the repair of grudges ends up being as important as the fight on the ring (or octagon, or whatever it is).It's not very common to find a martial arts movie such well written, directed and acted as Warrior is. For better or for worse, this kind of stories is usually relegated to "B" cinema, in which the action takes precedence over elements such as performances and narrative. On the opposite, Warrior counts with a very well written screenplay, perfect direction and wonderful performances from Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy, who both work perfectly as brothers/rivals with turbulent emotions under their laconic surface.The only complaint I have against Warrior is that its screenplay includes a few clich√©s. Nevertheless, I unexpectedly enjoyed this movie very much, and I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm. In summary, a very pleasant surprise.
Co-directors and co-screenwriters Peter and Michael Spierig have truly impressed me this time. Their first film was Undead, an entertaining, but not highly memorable, zombie movie. In their second film, Daybreakers, they ventured into vampire cinema with a mediocre result. But with Predestination, the Spierig brothers reveal a maturity and vision which are very superior to what I expected from them, perfectly translating a complicated science fiction story with twists and surprises which are brilliantly planned and executed. It's not convenient to reveal too much about Predestination, because the least the spectator knows about it, the easier it will be for him/her to appreciate the labyrinth of causes, relationships and consequences handled by the fascinating screenplay, based on the short story All You Zombies (which I read many years ago, and don't remember practically anything about). Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook bring excellent performances, perfectly navigating the intricate dramatic arches of their characters, and the technical aspects display a considerable level of quality, such as Ben Nott's attractive cinematography, the settings and the brilliant production design which combines the real aesthetic of the historical period when the story is set with interesting "retro-futuristic" details. Predestination might make us to occasionally take a leap of faith, but everything is so well done that I don't consider that as a fail. If the Spierig brothers keep this level of quality and talent, they will become important names in fantastic cinema, and I will definitely be looking forward to their next film. For the moment, I postulate them to adapt the work of authors Philip K. Dick and H.P. Lovecraft, both of them experts in reflexive and intelligent stories which challenge our imagination and perceptions. There aren't many filmmakers who would be up to that level, but after the extraordinary Predestination, I think the Spierig brothers definitely are.
I remember that between the late 90's and early 2000's,the juvenile comedies experimented a boom (independently of the quality of the films) and there were a lot of films with teenagers facing the normal problems of their age,from the eternal search of a romantic friendship to the juxtaposition of the Shakespearian comedy in the high school (well,the conflicts may not were too normal).After the horror and science fiction,the juvenile comedy is my favourite genre,although I'm the first one to admit that it deserves many times the harsh reviews it receives.But,because of the appreciation I have for that genre,I use to ignore the clich√©s and absurd stories when the films result funny or if they have ingenious elements which give new life to the genre.Nowadays,it seems the juvenile comedies can only be found on the straight-to-DVD market,with the atrocious sequels of American Pie and intolerable crap like Foreign Exchange or Cougar Club.On the commercial cinema,there are not too many juvenile comedies but,last year,the excellent film Superbad fit on the style established by gems like Can't Hardly Wait,Bring it On,Clueless and the films written and directed by the great John Hughes.Last year,co-screenwriters Piers Ashworth and Nick Moorcroft decided to resurrect a series of British juvenile comedies which had started in 1954 with The Belles of St. Trinian's and had ended in 1980 with The Wildcats of St. Trinian's,which had been repudiated because of their lack of humor and excessive lust.But now,in the new century,that kind of juvenile comedies resurrect with the brilliant film St. Trinian's,which is a return to the subversive and extremely acid tone of its previous films,brutally laughing of the British conventions.This movie tells an excellent story and all the details it has take it to a high level of greatness.This film could have easily been offensive,but it is not like that because the naughty tone of the film kills any possibility of offense,so its most extreme characters become on funny exaggerations which should not be taken seriously...they are just a humorous subversion taken to a sublimate level which we could NEVER see on a North American film.St. Trinian's is a brilliant juvenile comedy and one of the most funny and subversive films I have seen on recent years.This is one of that occult joys in the world of cinema and it is good to know that movies like this one exist.So,this movie deserves a recommendation,not only to aficionados of juvenile comedies,but also to aficionados of the good cinema.
In the '80s, the name "culture jamming" was given to an artistic movement created in the '50s, which consisted of using the media as a "canvas" to create artistic expressions which satirized the media itself as well as the society which blindly believed in them. Nowadays, the "culture jamming" is part of the popular entertainment thanks to the Internet and the cable TV, which are both always hungry of new and provocative material in order to attract an increasingly segmented audience. And something which can't be denied is that the most successful exponent from this discipline is comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who made the media (voluntary or not) accomplice of his social satire, first in the TV series Da Ali G Show and later in the films Borat and Br√ºno. For better or for worse, the most recent film in which he has been involved, The Dictator, adopts a more conventional narrative shape in which his accustomed observations about North American culture are combined with the clich√©s from many contemporary comedies. The result isn't completely satisfactory, but it offers enough laughs and good satirical comments in order to make it worthy of a moderate recommendation.First, the screenplay from The Dictator is focused on the issue about the main character's double. Then, the focus changes when the main character gets lost in New York, when the movie becomes a modern (and more vulgar) version of Coming to America. At the same time, the screenplay looses impulse and degenerates into a parade of vignettes which fully exploit the "fish outside the water" clich√©, in which we see the dictator using his habitual insensibility and arrogance while he tries to look for a job and find someone who believes his crazy story. Some of those vignettes work quite well, both in the humorous and the satirical level, pointing out some ridiculous aspects of North American culture and laughing at the extremes reached by the "political correction". But other vignettes feel antipathetic and too repetitive.As for the performances, I liked the work from Baron Cohen, Ben Kingsley, Jason Mantzoukas and Anna Faris. So, in conclusion, I can give a moderate recommendation to The Dictator as I previously said, because it made me laugh enough times, and also because of its social satire, despite not being as solid as the one from Borat.
North American cinema is already quite saturated of films about the vicissitudes from "pretty people", but in spite of that, I was interested in watching Friends with Kids because its cast included various solid actors, and because it was Jennifer Westfeldt's debut as a director. One of her previous works as a screenwriter was for the film Kissing Jessica Stein (one of my favorite romantic comedies), which had a sarcastic/indie/emotive voice which distinguished it from the competence, and that's exactly what I expected from Friends with Kids; however, I wasn't left very satisfied by this film, because even though it's a bit distant from being the typical romantic comedy, it sacrifices acid humor for the sake of commercialism, and it ends up being as predictable as most of the films from the same genre.Friends with Kids offers some moderately interesting comments about the setbacks from marriage and the erosion of romance in front of the relentless onslaught of domestic co-existence. However, the screenplay quickly degenerates into clich√©s, and it employs forced conflicts and artificial drama in search of the drama, which isn't very credible nor satisfactory. What is more, there's a point in which the film is near from falling into the soap-opera field. Nevertheless, Westfeldt, Adam Scott, Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm (Westfeldt's romantic partner in real life) bring sincere performances, and they are the main reason why this film is worthy of a slight recommendation.Friends with Kids spills in every frame the pretension from New Yorker "yuppie" cinema, with characters too plunged into their own melodrama in order to realize that many of their problems are absurd, and could have an easy solution if they were less selfish and more mature. Anyway, as I previously said, I can slightly recommend Friends with Kids mainly because of the competent performances.
The film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas employed an exuberant style and surrealistic images in order to capture the prose from novelist and reporter Hunter S. Thompson (1937-2005), interpreted by Johnny Depp with a febrile energy. The result was one of the most hypnotic film experiences I have ever had. That's why my expectations before watching The Rum Diary were excessively high, and in retrospective, it was a mistake to expect "Fear and Loathing 2: Puerto Rico". Instead of that, The Rum Diary is some kind of tedious prequel in which we meet Thompson (or at least his alter-ego "Paul Kemp") during his first days as a reporter on a strange land, immersing into his vices and trying to use his literary voice with a humanitarian objective...if the drunkenness and the girls leave him enough time.I haven't read the homonym novel on which The Rum Diary is based, but I have read enough material from Thompson in order to know that, in effect, what he writes tends to be diffuse and entangled. In that aspect, the same thing is reflected on The Rum Diary, because the screenplay drifts for long whiles, dividing its attention between unconnected scenes and unnecessary sub-plots. However, Thompson's prose was enough colorful in order to invite us to keep reading; but that aspect is lost in this film, so The Rum Diary immediately degenerates into a boring parade of scenes lacking of any interest or energy. Depp brings a solid performance in this film, but that's not enough to rescue it from the tedium.So, I can't recommend The Rum Diary. As a comedy, it isn't funny; as a romance, it lacks of any credibility; and as a "tropical thriller" (to call it on some way), it lacks of any suspense, coherence or a structure to exploit the struggle made by the rebel reporter against the corrupt businessman. And as a biopic, I didn't find enough introspection into Thompson's (I'm sorry, "Kemp"'s) personality in order to leave the cinema with a better understanding about this controversial writer.
I tend to watch the films about sports with some reluctance, because that is not a subject I am interested in, and as a consequence, I do not know many things about it. So, if a film deepens too much into the rules or History of some sport, it is more difficult for me to "plunge" myself into its narrative. And that is exactly what I was afraid of before watching Moneyball, not only because it deals with baseball (a sport I do not know practically anything about), but also because it is focused on its coldest and most inaccessible part: the statistics, the negotiations and the insides of the management of a professional team. To my surprise, the film ended up being very entertaining, perfectly accessible and even emotive.The subject Moneyball deals with might sound dry, but co-screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian expertly combined the intellectual aspect from the story with the emotions of the classic sport story, in which a "loser" is ready to face unimaginable obstacles in order to reach the triumph...or at least trying it. The fact that the story is developed in meeting rooms, locker rooms and offices does not make it less interesting, even though director Bennett Miller certainly knew how to offer us some tense moments during decisive baseball matches.However, there are a few moments in Moneyball which feel a bit longer than they should during the very beginning. Nevertheless, the movie improves when Jonah Hill comes into scene, and his excellent chemistry with Brad Pitt takes the control of the narrative. Pitt himself brings a sincere and detailed performance, avoiding unnecessary sentimentality, but credibly expressing emotion whenever it is necessary. Philip Seymour Hoffman is perfect as the pragmatic trainer Art Howe, while Kerris Dorsey brings an adequate performance as the main character's daughter and Chris Pratt is quite funny in his role.In conclusion, I do not think Moneyball is a great movie, but I surprisingly liked it pretty much. My favorite film about baseball keeps being A League of Their Own, but that does not avoid me from recommending Moneyball as a very competent sports drama, which is well written, solidly acted and presents the adequate balance of suspense, emotion and drama in order to leave us satisfied.
I am not completely sure whether Precious is a brutal complaint on the failed North American social system or a reminder of the human baseness which is hidden behind the tricky face of the "civilization".It may be a combination of those things.But, more concretely, Precious is a devastating film experience which is not easy to put into a niche, but it is definitely difficult to forget.Till where I know, Precious is not based on a true story, but it feels much more authentic and credible than most of the Hollywood dramas, and part of that merit is on the extraordinary performances from Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique, who are both able to transmit emotions which even the the smallest gestures.Paula Patton and Mariah Carey also bring excellent performances, because they show a lot of precision and conviction on their roles.I also liked the discipline from the screenplay very much, because it never allows the characters to take easy way of the pity, or degrades them for the spectators' compassion.Of course it was devastating to see the sufferings from the main character, and even the twisted mentality from her mother, but screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher never shows the characters as passive martyrs worthy of pity, but as strong people who do not have the opportunity to escape from their unfortunate situation.The social and cultural commentaries this movie makes are are as important as the story, and even though I found them to be very appropriate, some people interpreted them as racist or degrading to black people.However, by my humble point of view, those opinions are wrong, because the problems the main character suffers are not determined by her race, but because by the prevailing condition on the most oppressed sectors from any country and any city, where the protection and the good intentions from politicians and educators do not save them from the cruelty and family vices which are difficult to extirpate.It is true the fact that Precious shows us the problems without creating any solutions; however that restriction could be due to the fact that Fletcher tried to avoid political tendencies which could play against the story.The only thing I could say against this movie is that there are a few elements of manipulation on the screenplay.However, that is not a very important fail, because that is compensated by many positive elements.Precious is a movie which is difficult to describe, because nothing compares to the experience of watching it.It is definitely a strong film, so I do not know if some people could stomach it; however, I enthusiastically recommend it to those who want to see an important film, which offers a level of substance which is not common to see in contemporary cinema.
It has been pretty much commented that Super 8 is a tribute to the classic films directed or produced by Steven Spielberg, in which the ordinary life in the suburbs was contrasted with an extraordinary phenomenon which had to be usually faced by the kids or teenagers, while the adults ignored the situations until it was too late. In that aspect, director and screenwriter J.J. Abrams achieved exactly what he proposed to himself, even though he had to sacrifice any trace of originality or surprise in the film. However, Super 8 kept me very entertained because of its solid direction, excellent performances and well written screenplay. In summary, this film is an exciting juvenile adventure seasoned with wide doses of "Spielbergian" nostalgia.If we analyze Super 8 scene by scene, we can find an alarming number of parallels to films like The Goonies, Poltergeist, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and specially, E.T. The subject from Super 8 is superficially different, but the characters, atmosphere and tone perfectly emulate the "Spielberg style" from the '70s and the '80s, when his films (either as a director or producer) literally changed the face of popular cinema. Even the young actors from Super 8 possess that chemistry with each other which makes us to accept their long friendship and related personalities...even though that, as in any group of friends, they occasionally have juvenile disputes with each other.And besides of the perfect chemistry they have with each other, the young actors also make a brilliant individual work, highlighting Joel Courtney, Ryan Lee and specially Elle Fanning. After the works she brought in Somewhere and Super 8, Fanning reveals herself as a great actress who is even superior to her famous sister Dakota. The moment in which her performance in Super 8 most impressed me was during a scene of "performance into performance" which is so good that it equals the one interpreted by Naomi Watts in Mulholland Dr. (I am not exaggerating). As for the adult cast, the only one who stands out is Kyle Chandler, who makes a solid work as a simultaneously benevolent and strict father.On the negative side, the screenplay from Super 8 falters a little bit in some important points. Abrams dominates the drama and the growing suspense very well, but he occasionally violates the internal logic from the story or forces too convenient situations. Nevertheless, Super 8 is a very good film which definitely deserves a recommendation because of the genuine talent it has in front of and behind the camera.
I don't know whether anyone took Joaquin Phoenix seriously some years ago, when he announced his retirement from acting in order to become a rap (or hip hop, or whatever) singer. Independently from his null musical talent, the simple fact that he was simultaneously making a documentary about his transition manifested a transparent desire to create controversy, and maybe satirize the "celebrity culture", made popular many years ago by Abbie Hoffman (1936-1989), Andy Kaufman (1949-1984) and other "culture jammers". However, in that pre-Internet era, it was easier to cheat the media with irreverent "performances" which denounced the superficiality from culture and the dominion of the marketing over the consumers' mind...but in this time of Twitter, "blogosphere" and continuous informatics immersion, it's more difficult to keep the illusion of seriousness, specially considering that Phoenix's "metamorphosis" was so extreme and unexpected. That's why I wasn't interested in watching the mentioned "documentary", titled I'm Still Here, but anyway...I found it on a TV channel and I had some free time, so I decided to leave my prejudices aside and watch it. Unfortunately, the experience ended up being intolerable.The worst thing of all is that Phoenix and director Casey Affleck probably had the intention of making an intelligent satire about the cult to the celebrity, the actors who pretend to become singers overnight, the celebrities who psychologically crumble in front of the paparazzi cameras, and the people who delight themselves watching their idols falling. Unfortunately, I'm Still Here lacks of a comprehensible structure, or a specific focus. This film is basically composed by the home videos of an idiot with a lot of money, a lot of fame, and many "yes men" (and "yes women") who accept his stupid whims simply because he's famous. This is exactly the reason why I don't watch any reality shows, and I think the formula doesn't improve at all simply because the protagonist is an acclaimed actor. And well, let's not even talk about the quality of the making; I'm Still Here couldn't have looked cheaper and more improvised.And the least I say about Phoenix's songs, the better; they are genuinely horrible. So, in conclusion, I'm Still Here is an atrocious film, and instead of watching this piece of junk, I recommend you any of the excellent films in which Phoenix has been involved, such as Signs, Gladiator or U-Turn.
I don't know how many films I have seen with this same plot: a group of young people decides to spend some days in a remote cabin in the woods, and the only thing they find is their violent deaths in hands of some unknown threat (it can be mundane or supernatural). It's one of the most employed formulas in horror cinema, and even though we have occasionally seen interesting variations of the same story (such as Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil), I had rarely found such an ingenious, amusing and ambitious one as The Cabin in the Woods. In fact, the word "ambitious" doesn't adequately describe the scope of the screenplay, nor the way in which it has changed my perception of that particular formula.Let's see...How am I going to talk about The Cabin in the Woods without revealing the delicious surprises its screenplay includes? Well, there definitely are surprises, but the central premise is predictable, specially because co-screenwriters Drew Goddard (who was also the director) and Joss Whedon offer us various clues from the beginning. So, we might not find unexpected twists which defy our perception, but a gradual evolution in the subjects dealt by the film, and a methodic re-accommodation of the apparently incongruent elements of the story. But the best thing of all is the deep affection shown by Goddard and Whedon to this particular genre, honoring (and also satirizing with a piercing precision) many popular clich√©s of horror cinema which take a new life and meaning under their imagination. Having said that, the last third of the movie takes some questionable creative licenses, stretching our credulity to the maximum in order to satisfy the screenplay's huge ambition. I won't say any more, except that I found the "red button" issue excessively convenient and improbable. On the other hand, I can't deny the fact that that I agree with the ideology of the few survivors who accompany us to the nihilistic ending.Goddard's direction is incredibly precise and disciplined, employing an agile and modern style which drives the narrative at a perfect rhythm, slowing it a bit down during the beginning in order to create suspense and later loosening the reins until leading to an exuberant and ironic ending, bathed in blood but at the same time based on universal ideas. The whole cast makes a good work in their roles, highlighting Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, whose perfect chemistry makes the long labor relationship between their characters completely credible.So, in conclusion, I enthusiastically recommend The Cabin in the Woods, whether you are a fan of the horror genre or a hater, because this film works as a denounce against the creative stagnation of the genre...but instead of simply criticizing it, it found a very ingenious way in order to exploit it on its favor, and also offering us a unique experience of fantastic cinema. There are movies I like very much, but don't inspire me to watch them again; The Cabin in the Woods is the opposite because, besides of its narrative values, it includes such a quantity of details which will make various additional visits necessary in order to appreciate all the tributes, satires and references.
Strictly speaking, Priest is based on a Korean manga (manhwa?) I have never read. But that does not matter, because this film recycles many elements we have already seen in fantastic cinema. To start with, we have Paul Bettany as a religious warrior which is very similar to the one he interpreted in Legion (which was from the same director!). The setting is the totalitarian and technologically advanced world from Babylon A.D.; the villains are vampires with physical variations which depend from their genetic variation, like in Daybreakers. The creatures stalking the heroes are digital creatures which are similar to the ones from I Am Legend. And the battles have the same "cool" style we saw in Underworld, with martial arts in slow motion, exotic weapons and inhuman stunts which should supposedly leave us amazed. In other words, there is not even a pinch of originality in Priest, and besides of that, I found it to be tedious.The characters and the screenplay from Priest are excessively simple, and they did not provoke any emotion in me, so we only have a bunch of narratively hollow sequences and pre-fabricated action scenes which do not provoke any suspense, nor interest in the characters' destiny. Among the few things I liked in this film, I can mention the dynamic and credible performances from Bettany, Karl Urban and Maggie Q.Director Scott Charles Stewart took advantage of his experience as a special effects supervisor in order to balance digital tricks with practical creations, avoiding the CGI saturation which ruined other movies with an excessive artificiality. On the other hand, what he could not avoid was a bad 3D conversion which only darkens some scenes which were badly illuminated by themselves, and damages the action sequences, which are not very well filmed by themselves. So, I think Priest is an insipid, boring and very unoriginal film that I cannot recommend.
I was a big admirer of the TV programme Family Guy during its initial seasons (pre-cancellation/resurrection); however, I later started to loose the taste in it due to the repetitive style from its creator, Seth MacFarlane, full of incongruent flashbacks and bizarre references which sometimes sacrifice the integrity of the characters or the stability of the story. Now, in his debut as a film director and co-screenwriter, MacFarlane found a good balance between both extremes of the humor, complementing the comic "asides" with interesting characters and a screenplay which is kinda predictable, but well handled in its structure and feelings. Sure, there are pretty much opportunities of displaying the characteristic vulgar and politically incorrect humor from Family Guy, but Ted ended up being a pleasant surprise because of its narrative care and emotional warmth.Big part of the humor from Ted consists of the contrast of seeing a teddy bear (a traditionally childish and innocent figure) enjoying his numerous vices and behaving as a vulgar and irresponsible lout. The joke functions on the beginning (look at the bear smoking weed...look at the bear hiring hookers...look at the bear seducing the dumb blonde) but it quickly wears. Fortunately, this film isn't only based on that, and it offers us much more things to make us laugh and keep our interest in the two main characters' adventures; to start with, Mark Wahlberg and the bear (brilliantly brought to life by MacFarlane's voice) have a perfect chemistry with each other, and their conversations are full of funny details, not always because of what they say, but because of how they say it. The "bromance" between man and bear feels sincere, and even though the existence of a harmful co-dependence is obvious, the genuine affection they have with each other is undeniable, as well as the support they bring to each other when they need it the most. Besides, we have the previously mentioned humorous flashbacks and unexpected references which go from the obvious ("He's still a better singer than Katy Perry") to the complex (such as the satire inside a satire which combines Airplane! with Saturday Night Fever), without forgetting the obligatory winks to Star Wars, and the unexpected devotion to a certain sci-fi film from the '80s I really enjoyed seeing honored.Mila Kunis' character is written more as a mesh of the narrative than as a real person, but her natural charm rescues the character, and she brings a totally honest work during some touching dramatic moments. The special effects are perfectly made, not only bringing the teddy bear to life, but also making his interaction with the real world completely credible (the scene in which we see him fighting is very funny, but what drew my attention the most was the perfect integration between 3D, practical effects and filmed footage). A truly excellent work from the Tippet Studio in order to "sell" us a digital character we never see as a mere "special effect". On the negative side from Ted, I can mention the unnecessary final action sequence. I understand the necessity of introducing a danger element and an emotional catharsis to impulse the characters and take them to a satisfactory (not necessarily happy) conclusion, but it feels a bit forced, specially because the arbitrary antagonist was obvious from almost the beginning of the film. Nevertheless, I recommend Ted as a very entertaining adult comedy which balances vulgar humor with interesting characters and credible situations (yes, despite including a magical teddy bear). MacFarlane's style is present from the beginning to the end, and I liked to see that his talent goes beyond than laughing at director George Lucas or obsessively satirizing '80s icons. I will expect his following films with interest, and I think I will even give another chance to Family Guy, in order to see how many other elements from modern culture have fallen under his sharp satirical scalpel.
It seems that the few beneficiaries of the recession from the year 2008 are the multiple experts and analysts who have been illustrating us by press, radio, television and YouTube about the causes, consequences and future perspectives from the economical crisis, which might be the strongest one in the History of humanity so far. Even like that, there may be people who want a deeper and more detailed examination of that financial catastrophe, and they will be the ones who will most enjoy the documentary Inside Job, whose investigative zeal and anecdotal density make it the definite document about "the Great Recession". In fact, it is so "definite" that it might tire the casual spectator a bit due to the overwhelming quantity of figures, names and eternal parades of "talking heads" who explain the fails from the financial system or justify its existence.In Inside Job, director Charles Ferguson interviewed bankers, professors and politicians who offer their very diverse (and occasionally contradictory) opinions about the crisis, its origin and the identity from the guilty ones. And when it is the turn of the guilty ones to appear, they explain us why they did not do anything wrong. This film's first half is focused on the Wall Street scene, but it eventually follows "the road of destruction" until leading to the common citizens who suffered the worst consequences from the crisis, while the genuine offenders of the collapse were quietly retiring with compensations of hundreds of millions of dollars...which were many times funded by the huge packages of "economical rescue" the government of the United States awarded using the money from its contributors. Yes, the same ones who lost their homes, savings and jobs.But what takes Inside Job to horror levels is that in the end, it shows us how the situation has not changed, and how it is even getting worse with financial companies merging themselves into increasingly big organizations, with a bigger influence on the international politics, and in a constant fight against the regularization from markets which already proved their ineptitude to control the finances from the whole world. So, even though I found Inside Job to be a cold, repetitive and a bit tiring documentary (despite Matt Damon's pleasant and modulated voice), I also think that it is a valuable and interesting History and economy lesson which leaves us with a clearer idea about the precarious situation from modern civilization.
The term "psychopath" is frequently used to describe murderers and other dangerous criminals, but in fact, it denotes an emotional disorder which limits or deletes the feelings to other people. Despite the stigmata entailed by the word, there are millions of perfectly functional psychopaths having normal lives, because their lack of compassion, remorse or affection doesn't automatically make them murderers. In fact, many businessmen and politicians are probably psychopaths whose rise is due to the fact that they never stopped to think in other people. The main character from Nightcrawler is one of those psychopaths. The screenplay and direction from this film are brilliant, and they would be enough reasons to make it worthy of an enthusiastic recommendation, but the main pro from Nightcrawler is Jake Gyllenhaal's monumental performance, which perfectly allows us to see an intelligent and organized psychopath quickly advancing in an unethical but legal (most of the time) business which is designed for people with null empathy for other human beings. Gyllenhaal's performance is truly magnificent, and he deserves all kinds of acclamation for it. Besides of that, Nightcrawler offers us a fascinating look into real "nightcrawling", and reveals the factors which promote it, starting by the fierce competition between TV channels and the obsession for the "ratings". But screenwriter Dan Gilroy (who was also the director) doesn't limit himself to seek corporative villains, but he also humanizes the struggle to have an audience in the shape of the character Nina, brilliantly played by Rene Russo. In conclusion, Nightcrawler is an extraordinary thriller with an excellent screenplay, perfect direction and great performances (besides of Gyllenhaal and Russo, I would also like to mention the perfect works from Riz Ahmed and the great Bill Paxton). I hope Nightcrawler doesn't end up being a "hidden gem", because it truly deserves to be appreciated and enjoyed... even though it leaves us uncomfortable and paranoid once we leave the cinema.
Oh...nice people's problems.They are soooo interesting.Much more than ugly people's,like me.He's Just Not That Into You shows the problems some cute women have when they do not find men who accept their neurosis and marry with them and when they do not find the perfect man.And,what about the men in this movie? They are also cute,they have athletic bodies,they have a lot of free time and they have to avoid the good looking women who chase them with the porpoise of having sex and living an eternal love.This movie is VERY far away from my personal experience,so in this commentary,I will have to take the role of a dog writing about the most recent book from Salman Rushdie...I understand its physical presence in the world,but the content surpasses not only my interests,but also my comprehension.I just want to say that,independently from my personal experiences,I found He's Just Not That Into You as a very crappy movie which kept me tremendously bored.I think that since the atrocious movie Town & Country,I had not seen a solid cast so brutally wasted as in He's Just Not That Into You.Really,how did they make to put Jennifer Aniston,Jennifer Connelly,Scarlett Johansson,Drew Barrymore,Justin Long,Kris Kristofferson and Ginnifer Goodwin together in a movie,and make it so hateful and completely lacking of any humor?.I think this disaster of a movie was principally caused by the horrible idea of taking a book which is full of romantic advices (or only one of them which is re-worked on hundreds of pages) and trying to become it into a conventional narrative.Having said all that,I have to admit it was a good idea to show various interconnected relationships,showing at the same time different romantic stories.But screenwriters Abby Kohn and Mark Silverstein were so untalented that they decided to extent the confusing network of relationships,romances and disappointments beyond of what a 2-hours movie must contain without loosing coherency.Seriously,while I was praying for this movie to be over as soon as possible,I started thinking that Kohn and Silverstein wasted the opportunity of becoming the book into a franchise of romantic comedies,in which the problems of one or two couples would have been examined at the same time we would have felt identified with the characters (obviously,if they were written by talented screenwriters-Richard Curtis would have been an ideal election-.).But this tremendously crappy movie has so many ingredients that it looses taste at the same time it falls indigestible.Before you think I'm a chauvinistic pig who does not understand the women's problems,I clear that I am only criticizing the movie,and the poor way in which it examines the couples' problems as if it was the story from a sitcom,which is easily solved and without any lasting effects.In other words,I'm NOT laughing of the real problems,but of the ineptitude in which Kohn and Silverstein tried to incorporate them to a sterile,hollow and tedious screenplay.And besides of that,we have the waste of a good cast,a pathetic direction,predictable solutions and completely disgusting characters.Once more,Hollywood simplifies what is complex and it complicates what is simple for provoking a product which,at least in my case,bored me very much at the same time it totally lacks of any interesting elements.He's Just Not That Into You is an intolerable movie.It was a torture for me to sit through watching this film.Do not make the same mistake as me,and use your time and your money for something more useful than watching this pathetic movie.
A part of the movie X-Men Origins : Wolverine is based on the mediocre mini-series Origin,which unnecessarily reveals Logan (alias Wolverine)'s hidden origin,when he is trying to find a balance between his beast ferocity and his human sensibility.Fortunately,that part of the movie concludes when the initial credits,composed by a good assembly of periods and places,begin.But,as a final result,we have a moderately entertaining but mediocre movie which is not only very inferior to the other X-Men films,but it could have also been better.Although his previous work is competent (Tsotsi,specially),I do not think director Gavin Hood was a good election for making this movie.It's obvious he is not too interested in comics,because the style he uses to telling the story feels very cold.In summary,Hood's direction lacks of passion and energy because he is simply not completely interested in the original material.The apparatus sequences of special effects seem to be more interested in being cool than in being naturally linked to the story.The most clear example from this is the exaggerated final battle,which is visually creative but narratively inert.Besides,the work of "green screen" on that scene is not good at all.Now,let's see the positive elements from this film.Hugh Jackman brings a very competent performance and I admired the engagement he shows with his character on every scene he appears.Although Liev Schreiber was not a good decision on the physical aspect to incarnate Sabretooth,he brings a solid histrionic work.Danny Huston and Ryan Reynolds also deserve to be mentioned,because they show credibility and conviction on their characters.The only performance I did not like was Taylor Kitsch's,because he does not show any charisma or conviction as Gambit.In spite of all my complains,I cannot deny this film kept me moderately entertained.However,X-Men Origins : Wolverine is so worried on telling the origins of the main character that its screenplay forgets to justify the motivations from the rest of the characters and the causes of their alliances and rivalries (for example : why did exactly Victor and Logan become enemies ? Why does Stryker kill some mutants and he only captures other ones?).I can give a slight recommendation to this movie as what it is : generic and moderate entertainment.X-Men Origins is not a bad film,but it could have gone more far away,and I personally found it mediocre.
I have liked the comics from an early age, but it wasn't until I was 10 or 11 years old when I started to systematically collect them, following specific titles and "plunging" myself into the respective mythologies from Marvel and DC (I have never been never been an "exclusive" fan of some publisher). One of the first comics I took seriously was The Avengers, because Stan Lee already knew that the secret to capture the readers wasn't on the cosmic battles and colorful disguises, but on the examination of the vulnerable and human side of the characters. The Avengers was the perfect medium for that, because it put together a group of superheroes with very different ideologies and personalities, so that their mere interaction was as entertaining as their fights against villains and other threatens. Fortunately, director and screenwriter Joss Whedon comprehended that fact, and as a result, the film The Avengers is very entertaining.In The Avengers, Whedon wrote a generally well balanced screenplay in which he re-introduced the characters, justified their alliance and put them to fight as a team in one of those cosmic threatens suffered by New York with such a frequency. I said "generally well balanced" because the screenplay makes some stumbles and has a few weakly developed characters. To start with, Loki feels like a bland villain; his methods and his motivation aren't consistent to what we had seen in the comics, in which he was a formidable and malicious manipulator (after all, he's the archetypal "trickster"). I also found the "Heli-carrier" sequence, in which Iron Man and Captain America try to repair an engine during 15 minutes, a bit weak...it feels like a poor excuse to insert an apparatus action sequence. And the other problem from the screenplay is that we don't know practically anything about the character Clint Barton. Fortunately, it was interpreted by Jeremy Renner, who is such a good actor that he can display his character's nature and his relationship with the other members of the team with just one expression; but even like that, I would have preferred the sacrifice of some gratuitous action scene in order to bring that character more dimension.Those fails are mainly noticed during the first half of The Avengers, in which the pieces of the story are being accommodated. For the rest, this is a very satisfactory and entertaining (and unexpectedly quite funny) culmination of the "cinematic universe" Marvel had been building since the film Iron Man in 2008, and it was very pleasant to finally see the seeds which had been planted in that film harvested. As for the actors, I don't have any complaints. When I wrote the review of Captain America: The First Avenger, I complained about the fact that Chris Evans hadn't been able to evoke the gravity of Captain America, but fortunately, he corrected that weakness in The Avengers. Chris Hemsworth also brings a perfect work as Thor. Robert Downey Jr. shows a lot of enthusiasm and conviction as Tony Stark/Iron Man, while Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk also bring solid performances.In my opinion, the best moments from The Avengers were the dramatic ones, as well as the interaction between the superheroes. However, that doesn't avoid the action scenes from being exciting. Their best attribute is that they are always perfectly clear. In conclusion, even though I wouldn't consider it an excellent film, I had a very good time while watching The Avengers, and that is already more than enough to make it worthy of a recommendation.
Two competent performances from Robert De Niro (in Machete and in Stone) in the same year? Is he really trying to redeem his long mediocre phase? If it is like that, it is time for his fans and ex-fans to rejoice. Sure, it will be necessary to fake amnesia regarding Little Fockers, but well...two out of three is not bad. Anyway, I like to see this legendary actor searching for more interesting characters to work with, and even though Stone is not a very satisfactory film, he brings a solid performance in here, and he is well complemented by the work from Edward Norton, Milla Jovovich and Frances Conroy. Unfortunately, the movie itself is not very good.Stone starts with an interesting premise, but it eventually changes the direction and it becomes into a slow psychological drama which examines the spirituality from the characters and the events which forged their personalities. And I think that that decision has both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, the emphasis on the internal conflicts, feelings of guilt and existential frustration leads to some good scenes, in which the actors fully display their talent by expressing their characters' deepest emotions without the need of words. But on the other hand, 105 minutes of depression and tremulous conversations make the movie to feel a bit tiring and occasionally boring.In conclusion, I can give Stone a slight recommendation mainly because of the performances. De Niro and Norton have a good interaction with each other, at the same time that they credibly express the emotional evolution from their characters. Jovovich and Conroy also bring honest performances. However, I cannot deny that I found Stone to be pretentious, not very satisfactory and occasionally boring. In summary, I did not like this movie very much, but I cannot say I disliked it either.
I think the "slasher" cinema has two variations from the formula, which are very similar but they have an essential difference; in movies like Friday the 13th, Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street, the murderer is the star, and his victims are simple sacrifices on the road to the final confrontation between survivor (who is usually a woman) and villain, which offers a few times a slight psychological or emotional ingredient.The second variation keeps in secret the identity from the murderer, so we do not only see how he kills his/her victims, but we also look for clues to reveal the villain and his motives for the killings.Sorority Row belongs to the second group, but it did not leave me satisfied, because it was too boring for me to care who the killer was.Sorority Row is a remake of The House on Sorority Row, a film I have not seen, so I will not be able to make any comparisons.However, it will be unavoidable for me to compare it with other films from the same genre, specially on its fails.The story from this film is kinda similar to I Know What You Did Last Summer (anyway, neither this was nor The House on Sorority Row were the first ones in using their premise), but set on the vacuous and irritating university context, something which reminded me to the atrocious remake of Black Christmas.And as well as on that film, Sorority Row shows us young actresses trying to create drama and emotion with their stupid internal conflicts and insipid discussions.The result is something like a bad episode of Gossip Girl or 90210, but with more blood and less obsession for fashionable clothes.The characters are extremely antipathetic, and the actors (Rumer Willis specially) do not seem very interested in them, so I did not care too much if they died or not.Besides, Stewart Hendler (who had left me a pretty good impression with his previous -and first- movie Whisper)'s direction helps to sabotage the narrative with excessive close-ups and poor edition, which make what happens on various scenes difficult to understand.In summary, I cannot recommend Sorority Row, because it is boring and pretty mediocre.
The Immigrant tells us a devastating story, which simultaneously denounces the fallacy of "American dream" and confirms the indomitable spirit of the immigrants who forged the cultural and economical basis of that country. The performances are excellent, the characters are complex, and the cinematography captures the reality of the historical period with a raw beauty. However, I didn't like this film very much, mainly because it didn't make me feel anything, despite all the drama and personal tragedy it displays. The unfortunate experiences the main character lives are mortifying, and unfortunately, they might have been very common in the time in which this movie is set (also nowadays, thinking it well); but for some reason, The Immigrant isn't made with enough passion for us to plunge into the main character's experiences, and it doesn't have a concrete point besides of being a sample book of human suffering which should have been touching, but it isn't. Having said that, I think my opinion about The Immigrant is in the minority, considering all the acclamation this film has received around the world. However, this doesn't mean I couldn't find positive elements in this film, such as the brilliant performances. Marion Cotillard perfectly transmits vulnerability and resistance at the same time. The great Joaquin Phoenix brings a predictably amazing work as the opportunist Bruno, and Jeremy Renner brings a warm and sensitive attitude which totally adjusts to his character. I think that those three performances are enough reason to make The Immigrant worthy of a slight recommendation, with the hope that other spectators will appreciate the emotions and narrative honesty I wasn't able to find.
When I was kid, the animated version Disney made of Alice in Wonderland left me perplexed.When I was a teenager, I read the novel which inspired the film, and I comprehended that that movie was a faithful (but diluted) representation of the concepts and ideas from author Lewis Carroll as metaphors of the maturity process which experiments a girl in the traditionalistic England from the Victorian period.And even though that through the years we have seen other adaptations of the book, they did not count with the creativity or resources to make justice to Alice's strange world.Now, director Tim Burton made his version of Alice in Wonderland, and the result is moderately entertaining, but not very satisfactory.Alice in Wonderland (2010) is basically a "reboot" of the story, because it employs Carroll's books as a starting point and inspiration of its exotic production design, at the same time it ignores the delicate watermarks from the narrative, reducing it to a generic epic fantasy.I do not deny the visual creativity from Burton, but I am honestly tired of his far-fetched style, because in his most recent works, it became as an end for itself, instead of the perfect ornament to stories with genuine narrative magic (such as, for example, Beetlejuice and Pee Wee's Big Adventure), which also counted with bizarre but interesting characters.In my humble opinion, his last great film was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and after that one, he made the excessively cold films Corpse Bride and Sweeney Todd.Alice in Wonderland fits with the description from those two films, but I would consider it inferior to them, because I think that, with the exception of the remake of Planet of the Apes, this is his least achieved movie, mainly because it feels heartless.I liked the first 10 minutes from this film very much, but when the special effects appear, Alice's development is interrupted, because since from then, she limits to react to the extravagant characters and situations from the "underworld".Talking about extravagant characters, I have to mention Johnny Depp.Or better said, Mad Hatter.What was an incidental (and belatedly added to the original book) character becomes into the co-star from the film, undoubtedly because of the attraction Depp has on the box-office.And, sure, on his seventh collaboration with Burton, it was obligatory the presence of an eccentric and colorful character in order to exploit his talent.However, I could never swallow the "madness" and eccentricity from the character, and Depp does not seem to be very interested in it.Worse yet, his extended appearance rattles the gears from the story in order to justify his presence in too many scenes which, after all, do not win too much with his presence. The same could be said about the other celebrities who bring their faces or their voice to the rest of the characters, with the exceptions of Stephen Fry and Helena Bonham Carter, since Anne Hathaway and Crispin Glover feel bland on their characters; and Christopher Lee, Imelda Staunton, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall could have easily been replaced by generic announcers from the BBC without changing the movie at all.With so many complains, you may think I hated this movie, but the truth is not like that.In fact, Alice in Wonderland (2010) kept me moderately entertained the whole time, and I think it deserves a slight recommendation because of that.However, in my case, it was not a very satisfactory experience, mainly because of its lack of depth and substance.
After many years of women relegated to the characters of victims or sexual objects in the fantastic cinema, a feminist side appeared on the horror genre.I think this evolution started with the character Ripley from Alien, who was not a generic male character interpreted by an actress, but a realistic transposition of roles respecting the essence from the female sex.On this decade, we had films like Ginger Snaps, Teeth and The Descent, whose bloody stories hid valid reflections about some aspects of the female existence.Jennifer's Body pretends to be an addition to that small but distinguished niche, and although it covers similar subjects to that movies, I think it is far away from reaching their narrative quality and visceral impact.Although the presence of Megan Fox as the main actress will be the main attraction for many people to see this movie, my main interest in watching this movie laid on another woman...screenwriter Diablo Cody, who won an Academy Award for Juno.That film has many haters who did not accept its eccentric characters and its universe of impenetrable juvenile jargon, dark pop references and ambiguous messages about the teenage pregnancy.However, I liked it very much, mainly because of its stylized vision, which perfectly combined honest feelings with cynical observations and an intelligent sense of humor which was expressed on ingenious dialogs.I also like Cody's screenplays for the TV series United States of Tara pretty much, and because of all that, I expected Jennifer's Body with big expectations, since I was very interested in watching Cody's version of a horror film.The final result was a moderately entertaining but mediocre film which disappointed me pretty much, since I expected a lot more.On the one hand, let's see the positive elements from this film.If we leave the horror aspect from this film aside, we can notice that the main narrative flow from this movie is pushed by something which feels real: an addictive and co-dependent relationship between two young women.Like she did on Mamma Mia!, Amanda Seyfried steals Jennifer's Body with her perfect performance, and I think she truly elevated the quality from it.But, now, I have to mention the negative elements which make of Jennifer's Body a mediocre and forgettable experience.There are various moments of blood and violence on this movie, but they did not produce too much impact on me, because the screenplay does not endorse them with an emotional background.The ending is not deep or justified, so it does not result very satisfactory.Besides, Karyn Kusama's direction feels weak.Scene by scene, she did not make a bad work, but I could not feel a cohesion between them...they feel alien from each other.In other words, there is not a vision which unites the experience and drives us through the story with enthusiasm.What is more, although the screenplay has some positive elements, it has various logical fails, predictable things and clich√©s like idiot adults on supporting characters.And finally, with the exception of Seyfried, the performances are rather anonymous.If I did not have such big expectations, I would have may liked Jennifer's Body more.But, whatever the way it is, I found it to be mediocre but worthy of a slight recommendation because I cannot deny that, in spite of its fails, it did not bore me.
The Signal starts like some bad horror films do: a maniac is torturing two young women.But...wait a minute!...It is a trick! The maniac belongs to a movie the authentic characters from The Signal are watching, until the transmission is cut.That is the beginning of this excellent film.One of the most interesting things I found in The Signal is that what could have been a simple post-apocalyptic tale has a vein of intense romance and honest emotions which makes the movie more engaging.This film tells three different stories, and each one of them was made by a different director.That was a simultaneously original and risky idea, because dividing the narrative in chapters could have taken cohesion or integrity out to the global story.However, the stories are very interesting, and the sensibility and vision from every filmmaker are perfectly well complemented, bringing as a result a fascinating and highly recommendable film with unusual deepness, ingenuity and dramatic consistency.It is a pity that The Signal went so unnoticed.It has been available in DVD for three years, but even then it had a time of being "in the shelves" (as a proof of that I can mention the CDs reproducer one of the main characters constantly uses...how long has it been that that technology was replaced by the iPod and similar devices?).But its anachronism does not decrease the value of the interesting story, solid performances and even the black humor from the intermediate segment, which brings a very grateful respite after the intensity from the first segment, and which prepares us for the anguish from the conclusion.There are some moments of brutal violence in this movie for the fans of gore, but one of the best things from this movie is not what it shows, but what it omits.That automatically makes us participants of the fear and uncertainty the characters experiment, and we share their mystery about the phenomenon which is happening to their city.The only thing I would criticize about this film is that the final segment is a bit longer than it should have.However, that does not avoid me from giving an enthusiastic recommendation to this hidden gem from horror cinema.
I always find director Steven Soderbergh's experiments interesting because they challenge the spectator and they go beyond the common.The Argentine also falls on that category.This a fascinating movie and it clearly is one of the best I have seen this year.Soderbergh made a wonderful work as a director because of the excellent performances he got from the cast and for his extreme attention to the details.Benicio del Toro brings a monumental performance as Che Guevara.He completely becomes on him and he never seems to be acting.Demi√°n Bichir also brings a magnificent performance as Fidel Castro.This movie kept me very entertained and it brings a very valid and important message.The only fail I found on this movie was that it was a little bit long on a specific moment.But that's a minor fail.The Argentine is a fascinating experiment I liked very much.This is one of that movies which challenge the spectator and have something to say and I really admire that.I totally recommend this film.
Back in early-80s, when I found out the fact that the comics could be something more than the repetitive adventures of masked superheroes, I tried to extend my "literary horizons" with the work of famous European creators, such as Moebius (and his Airtight Garage), Carlos Ezquerra (Judge Dredd), and Herg√© (1907-1983), the author of the popular Tintin books...which I immediately abandoned, because they had an excessively simple narrative, which obviously aimed to childish readers who did not require narrative complexity or dramatic deepness (I do not mean that as an insult). That's the reason why I was not interested in watching The Adventures of Tintin...until I found out the impressive talent behind its making. A film directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by Peter Jackson and co-written by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish? And with voice acting by Andy Serkis, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost? Sure! Where do I buy my ticket? Unfortunately, the film ended up being a bland childish adventure lacking of emotion and suspense, even though I cannot deny the fact that it is technologically impressive and visually spectacular.The Adventures of Tintin combines elements from three different books, so I cannot blame Moffat, Wright and Cornish for the simplistic story or the transparency of a "mystery" which does not provoke any suspense, at the same time it is not really mysterious either. For when the third or fourth flashback with pirates came, I had already lost my interest in the story, which is so elementary that it does not stimulate the imagination nor wakes any emotion or empathy in the spectator. However, not everything is bad in The Adventures of Tintin; on the positive side, I appreciated the visual creativity which is present in every frame of the film, from the humor details which lurk on the periphery of the scenes, to the technical virtuosity from the animation and the render, which is realistic but without losing the caricature aesthetic from the books. I think that that fusion of styles was the right decision, because it avoids (to some point) the dead and inexpressive faces from other photo-realistic animation films, such as The Polar Express and Beowulf. The voice acting is also competent; Jamie Bell makes a solid work in the leading role, but the other actors stand out more, not necessarily because they are more talented, but because their characters have more development than Tintin, who is an enigma during the whole film. For some reason, I think Tintin is an excessively passive hero, whose repeated escapes from dangerous situations and his victories over the enemies seem more because of chance than because of his talent or special abilities (if he has any of them). In other words, the main character is not interesting enough, and he simple feels like a puppet at the mercy of the action.What takes me to the comparisons many people are making between The Adventures of Tintin and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Really? Besides of the similar historical period in which both movies are developed, I do not find too many similarities. Indiana Jones was a dynamic hero, with a lot of personality and owner of an ingenuity which made us believe in the ridiculous solutions with which he faced improbable situations (for example, lashing to a submarine with a whip). On the other hand, Tintin (at least the way in which he is presented in the movie) is barely the sketch of a character, with as many deepness as the paper sheets in which Herg√© drew him. It is a bad signal when a dog has more charisma than a film's hero. As for the action, it is true that both films display scenes with an elaborated choreography, but at least in my case, it was very different to see Harrison Ford fighting against Nazis on board of a rickety truck, than seeing an artificial Tintin in a synthetic chase which lasts various minutes on board of a simulated motorbike. The sequence is well made, but there is not a single trace of danger or tension in it. Instead of plunging me into the narrative, the only thing I thought was "what a nightmare it must have been to make the scene's storyboard".In conclusion, I can slightly recommend The Adventures of Tintin because of its technical aspects and the fact it never bored me. However, it did not leave me very satisfied, and I think it is an insipid adventure film.
Despite having read very enthusiastic reviews about Fish Tank, I honestly was not very interested in watching it. Another British drama about the nihilistic and ignorant youth in the pathetic suburbs from London (or any other famous British city)? Thanks, but I have already seen so many movies with that subject that I am a bit tired of it. However, and despite not being completely satisfactory, Fish Tank ended up being better than I expected because of the performances and the style from director Andrea Arnold, whose objective coldness does not avoid us from empathizing with the somber characters.For better or for worse, Fish Tank is one of those movies whose screenplay is almost accidentally drawn in the periphery of scenes focused on the problems, disappointments and fleeting joys the main character finds day after day. On some way, I like the technique, because besides of feeling honest and natural, it also sets the narrative free from the formulas and clich√©s we are accustomed to find in contemporary cinema. But on the other hand, that style can also be associated with pretentious whims from directors who are so focused in "the art" (you know: long shots with hand-held camera; natural lightning; etc.) that they loose the narrative flow which should be the basis from the movie of their sight. And Arnold occasionally falls into that vices, something which explains the excessive 2 hours she takes to tell a relatively simple story. Nevertheless, the excellent performances helped me to overcome some boring parts from Fish Tank, and I think that they truly elevate the quality from this movie.In conclusion, I think Fish Tank deserves a moderate recommendation, because I generally found it to be interesting and also because of the performances. I think Fish Tank can provoke a divisive effect on the audience: some ones will take it as an interesting alternative to Hollywood cinema, while other ones will take it as a pseudo-artistic pretentious movie which takes two hours to itself to point out what is obvious. Personally, I incline to the former, but I cannot deny that the film also has a little bit from the latter.
It might be due to a lack of "experience" that I generally don't find the "stoner" humor (the humor oriented to the drug consumers, particularly the ones who smoke marijuana) very satisfactory. I didn't dislike films such as Pineapple Express and Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, but I felt the fact that I was losing an essential part of the comedy while I was watching them...or the problem might be the fact that they were designed to be watched on an altered state of conscience, and that's the only way in which one can feel totally satisfied with them. Anyway, the point is that I wasn't very interested in watching Your Highness, even though I had some curiosity because I had heard that it combined humor and heroic fantasy. Would it be a spiritual successor of Monty Python and the Holy Grail? Or would it be a light version of The Lord of the Rings filtered through a thick cloud of "ganja"? It's easy to note the effort made by co-screenwriters Danny McBride and Ben Best in Your Highness in order to combine such different genres with each other; however, I could constantly feel the touch of incompatible elements which "took me out" of the narrative due to their inescapable incongruence. So, when we start to get moderately interested in the heroic fantasy...it's suddenly interrupted by some anachronistic line of dialog which destroys the illusion and stops the flow of the narrative. In other occasions, I was occasionally laughing moderately with the "stoner" aspect and the contemporary jokes...until we suddenly go back to the heroic fantasy, derailing the humor and forcedly making us go back to the pseudo-medieval "reality" of the film. I suppose that some people might consider that contrast between styles part of the comedy, and they might find them funny. But it honestly didn't work very well to me, and I would have preferred something more exaggerated in both extremes, instead of this unstable combination of ingredients which shouldn't have been combined with each other.Nevertheless, I can't deny that Your Highness occasionally made me laugh moderately, and that I liked the occasional satire to the clich√©s of heroic fantasy. And then, we also have the competent performances from McBride and James Franco in the leading roles, who both make the love/hate balance between their characters totally credible. The rest of the characters are quite uni-dimensional; for example, the villain never looks genuinely threatening, but just a minor obstacle destined to the failure. On the feminine side, Zooey Deschanel doesn't have too much to do, because she interprets the generic damsel in danger. And then we have the great Natalie Portman, who brings a predictably solid performance in her role, despite her character not being very well written.So, Your Highness isn't an extra-official sequel of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, nor a psychedelic version of The Lord of the Rings, but a mediocre hybrid of two styles which shouldn't have been combined with each other. Nevertheless, Your Highness didn't bore me, and I had a moderately good time while I was watching it, so I can slightly recommend it despite not being a very good film.
I think the animated series Astro Boy is more reminded because of ts cultural meaning than for its intrinsic attributes, because it was the first "anime" which found popularity outside of its natal Japan.Personally, I have never seen that series, so I went with zero expectations to see its film adaptation.However, the movie ended up being a boring, bland and cloying clothing which combines elements from A.I., Wall-E and Peter Pan.This film has a lot of clich√©s and pre-fabricated characters.Besides, there are too many irrelevant sub-plots which distract the attention from the story.The only positive point I found in here is that the voice cast (composed by Freddie Highmore, Nicolas Cage, Samuel L. Jackson, Charlize Theron, Kristen Bell, Donald Sutherland, Bill Nighy and Eugene Levy) makes a functional work.Astro Boy is another horrible animation film from Hollywood, which is truly boring and irritating, at the same time it lacks of any creativity.I suggest you to avoid it.
Why the hell did I go to see Annie? The answer is: Will Gluck. This director/producer/screenwriter has been involved in various projects I liked, both in cinema (Fired Up!, Easy A) and TV (The Loop, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Grosse Pointe). On the other hand, he also made the tedious romantic comedy Friends with Benefits. And it's true that Annie received very negative reviews, but I had curiosity in watching it, because Gluck's style doesn't always "connect" with the audience and the critics. After having watched Annie, I have to say I didn't find it as bad as many people did... but I definitely didn't find it good either. I was moderately enjoying the first half hour of Annie, because that's where Gluck's style is mostly noticed; but after that, the film gets increasingly boring and irritating. A divisive factor for many spectators will surely be the "ethnic readjustment" of the characters. The purists of Broadway, the 1982 film and Harold Gray's cartoon (yes, strictly speaking, Annie is an adaptation of a 1924 comic) might be against that, but in my personal case, that was indifferent to me. Quvenzhan√© Wallis and Jamie Foxx made their best effort in their characters, but they are frequently betrayed by the cloying routines of the screenplay. In conclusion, I found Annie (2014) a waste of time, and I can't recommend it, not even to the fans of Rose Byrne's (like me; she's definitely one of the most adorable actresses nowadays).
We have to recognize that not all films that are considered as classics or as "cult cinema" survive the test of time.Some of them are really good and I do not deny it (for example,the excellent The Wicker Man-1973-) but other ones only work as historical relics which represent the idiosyncrasy of a time (like The Apple or Forbidden Zone).The film Death Race 2000,from 1975,belongs to both categories because,besides being very entertaining and exciting,it represents social aspects which evoke our days.So,a remake of that brilliant movie,should take the ideas of that film to our future,to speculate about the development of the human society on the following decades.That should be done by an audacious and visionary filmmaker which entertains us at the same time it makes us think.Or,that homework,could be given to Paul W.S. Anderson.I do not belong to the group of haters of that director.Alhough he has wasted unique opportunities (Alien Vs. Predator and Resident Evil) because he could not recognize the potential of that projects,he has also made interesting and entertaining movies (Event Horizon and Mortal Kombat).This remake,Death Race,belongs to the second group.This movie is hollow entertainment which has some good ideas which are not completely well exploited.I had a good time watching this movie,although it is completely forgettable.The actors were perfectly chosen for their roles and Anderson made a dynamic work in this movie,something which is appropriate because that complements its tone.I think in the only point Anderson's direction failed was in the action scenes.They are entertaining but Anderson exaggerated a little bit with the edition tricks on there so it was a bit difficult to notice,on some occasions,what was happening.I think the main fail of this movie is that it completely lacks of the social commentary which was in the original film so,as a final result,Death Race is a hollow movie.In spite of that,I can recommend this remake because I had a good time watching it,although this experience is not memorable at all.
One of the most rancid cinematographic formulas is that one in which an unusual teacher achieves raising the conscience from his/her apathetic students, inspiring them to overcome themselves and fight against any external or internal obstacle which interposes on their road to education. The truth is that that subject feels a bit spent, specially when it lacks of conviction and is only employed as a forced ingredient to produce emotion and tears. Before watching Detachment, I thought it was going to be one of those films; fortunately, the reality ended up being very different, because even though I didn't find it always sincere, it undoubtedly represents an audacious and innovative interpretation of the "miraculous teacher" subject which deserves to be seen not only because of its valid message, but also because of its excellent performances and solid direction. We needed something like this after the atrocious Bad Teacher...In other circumstances, I would be frustrated by a movie with such many characters, such many sub-plots and such little time to fully develop them as Detachment. However, screenwriter Carl Lund handled the story with pretty much eloquence, painting the events and relationships with broad strokes, in order to later fill in the holes with economic but potent details of a big emotional force. As a consequence, when we reach the ending, the story feels simultaneously satisfactory, logical and inspiring, without submitting itself to the classic "happy ending" from Hollywood. The actors make a perfect work, starting by Adrien Brody, who transmits the melancholy which has eroded his character's soul through the years without the need of words. The supporting cast is also worthy of applause, highlighting James Caan, Lucy Liu and Marcia Gay Harden.I would also like to mention the excellent score from the Newton Brothers and Barry Alexander Brown's precise edition, which complement the directing style from Tony Kaye (who had left me amazed in the late-90s with the extraordinary American History X), which is simultaneously simple and meticulous. On the negative side from Detachment, a few scenes and situations feel excessively convenient and simplified; particularly, there's near the ending a tragedy I found totally gratuitous, predictable and unnecessary. I also found some monologues a bit pretentious and forced. Nevertheless, I liked Detachment pretty much, and I definitely consider it worthy of a recommendation.
I felt the almost complete absence of juvenile comedies on commercial cinema on recent years weird,but compensating that,we have the excellent movie Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist which,under Peter Sollet's precise direction,combines intelligent and funny humor with honest and realistic romance.This movie is based on a book,and that can partially explain why it has perfectly constructed characters,who empathize with the spectator.Besides,I admired how the screenplay avoids every single clich√© from juvenile comedies...in other words,we will not find athletic villains,idiot adults or love declarations on an airport,sport event or at the graduation party.Nick and Norah... perfectly captures the emotion and confusion a lot of teenagers experiment.I think this movie is a combination between After Hours and Before Sunset,but on a juvenile way.On the one hand,it portraits a never-ending night in which the relationship between two young people is developed.And,on the other hand,Nick and Norah... shows the bizarre night adventures in New York a group of eccentric characters live,at the same time their trip is more important than the final destination.The best element from this movie are the characters and the way in which they interact,which is not why the screenplay says so,but because the illusion of reality is perfect and they simple interact as normal young people.The soundtrack is also excellent,because every song accompanies the tone of the scenes,so their presence is not arbitrary.The only fail I found on this movie is that a few dialogues felt a little bit forced.But,in spite of that minimum fail,I liked this movie very much.Nick and Norah... is a brilliant juvenile comedy with an excellent screenplay,solid performances and a competent direction,and those attributes are not usually found on the sub-genus "juvenile comedies".
Year One is the most recent film from the very irregular director Harold Ramis...and with the word "irregular", I am not talking about his bowel movements.Or maybe I am, because I do not find any other description for pieces of crap like Analyze That or Club Paradise.But on the other hand, Ramis has also directed some excellent comedies, like Groundhog Day or National Lampoon's Vacation.Which one of those two extremes does Year One belong to? The answer: neither of them; it is on an intermediate point of his career.Year One is a very strange combination of sophisticated post-modern humor, theological reflexions and jokes about urine, flatulence and excrement.For every funny observation made by Michael Cera's character, we have a coarse scene of irritating cleanings which do not tear a single smile; and for every humorous rudeness made by Jack Black's character, we have the appearance of a famous comedian on an unnecessary and forced cameo.In summary, the screenplay has good and bad elements on the same degree, and its inconsistency and mercurial tone damages the film.I am a fan of Cera's and Black's, but I have some doubts about their real talent.In other words, I do not consider them to be good actors, but I think they do perfectly the few things they know how to do.And I also know they have many haters who are already bored of their routines.So, big part of the entertainment the spectators will be able to extract from this movie will be based on their tolerance to Cera and Black.I think the comedy is the most subjective genre, and the main reason Year One kept me moderately entertained is because of those two actors.However, if the main actors had been Adam Sandler and Martin Lawrence, I would have found the film tedious.Ramis' direction is routine and impersonal.And besides, I think the screenplay should have been more subversive.But maybe, the fear to the boycott or the violent reactions from the biggest Catholic fans made co-screenwriters Ramis, Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg to dilute the controversy from the screenplay a little bit.I understand that, but I still think the film could have been a bit more acid.However, in spite of all its fails, I think Year One deserves a slight recommendation, but with the previously made warning about the personal taste.Personally, I found Year One to be moderately entertaining and with funny moments, but I found the whole experience to be mediocre and easily forgettable.
On the beginning of I Love You Phillip Morris, we are assured that it is based on true events.And it is true; a quick visit to Wikipedia revealed that even the most unlikely events really happened.That would have made a fascinating movie out of I Love You Phillip Morris, but it unfortunately was not like that, because co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who were also the co-screenwriters) did not find the appropriate tone to tell the story.The screenplay from I Love You Phillip Morris is well written, but the problem comes from the direction, because Ficarra and Requa do not know whether they want to make us laugh, cry or simply share our incredulity to the situations portrayed in here.While I was watching it, I was reminded of Catch Me If You Can, another film which was based on a con-man's impossible situations.But that film had a more simple and natural style which made the humor to organically flow from the characters and the situations, at the difference of I Love You Phillip Morris, where we find a "funny" atmosphere which feels forced and difficult to classify.Maybe, Ficarra and Requa thought that the general spectators were not going to be ready to accept an homosexual thriller starred by two Hollywood stars, and they decided to protect themselves by adding a badly planned comedy varnish which ended up becoming into the movie's biggest fail.On the other side of the coin, we have the film's best attribute, which is the excellent performance from Jim Carrey, who instinctively adapts himself to the strange requirements from the movie in order to rescue his character's humanity, making us believe his sincere feelings and good intentions despite his unpredictable behaviour.Unfortunately, Ewan McGregor does not bring a very good performance as the other main character; I was left with the impression that this talented actor studied the body language and attitudes from some homosexual people, and the result is that his character feels like an imitation of a gay person instead of a real human being.In other words, as much as McGregor softens his look and voice, I never felt him credible on his role.In summary, I Love You Phillip Morris is a mediocre movie when it could have been brilliant.However, I cannot deny it kept me moderately entertained because of the adequate screenplay and Carrey's performance, so I think it deserves a slight recommendation despite its various fails.
I went to see Appaloosa thinking it would be a remake of the film The Appaloosa,which the only thing I remember about it is that Marlon Brando(1924-2004)'s character wanted to get his horse back.But Appaloosa did not result a remake,but an adaptation from a book which was published in this decade,and although it makes a tribute to the characteristics of western,it does not add too much to the genre.But,in spite of that,it results a good movie.Although I am not a big fan of "old westerns",I have liked some of them pretty much and I recognize that Appaloosa follows the theme,rhythm and structure the genre has had from its beginnings : simple moral fables set on the North American old west with characters who reflect the nostalgia for an existence more simple but more complicated,marking the transition from the barbarism of the "wild one" and the rising social culture,which requires less honor and less ingenuity and more subterfuge,hypocrisy and paranoia for surviving on a completely different level.I understand the interest behind that.But,after seeing so many similar stories during a long time,I need a story which gives new life to that.Unfortunately,Appaloosa does not aspire to so much,so it is a rehash of the well-known clich√©s : the fair and honourable heroes; the greedy and cruel villain who does not respect the law; the flirt widow who falls in love with the two heroes; and,of course,the shootouts in rural landscapes of meadows and mountains.The modern westerns I liked very much had an innovative element which gave new life to the genre : the philosophy of Unforgiven; the visual surrealism of The Quick and The Dead; the humor of Silverado; and the deep emotions of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.Although Appaloosa is a good movie,there is not nothing innovative to make it memorable.Fortunately,it has various positive elements.The screenplay is well written and the beginning and ending are very good (the middle part is also solid,but there are some boring and redundant scenes on it).Ed Harris made a good work on his second experience as a director (the first one was the competent Pollock),although his weak point is on the visual aspect,which does not result too special.But,I think his best work is in the direction of actors.Viggo Mortensen and him bring perfect performances and they can bring life to their characters.The member of the cast who mostly stands out is the great Jeremy Irons,who backs to prove his enormous talent,because he is completely natural and credible on his role on this movie.Ren√©e Zellweger brings a correct performance,although she does not have much to do.Appaloosa is a solid movie,I do not deny it.But its lack of originality and not having innovative elements on the screenplay,make of it a good but forgettable experience.
I am a big fan of director Quentin Tarantino's work, but I took a huge disappointment with Death Proof, at the same time it made me see that Tarantino was not infallible as I thought he was before watching that film.Death Proof had been full of loooooong and horribly tedious sequences which had insipid dialogs and which did not lead anywhere.I found Tarantino's indulgence on that film to be unforgiven, because his obsession for making a tribute to the 70's cinema took preponderance over the narrative and his usually clear vision.So, because of that, I had a bit of distrust before watching Inglourious Basterds, another tribute to a genre ("Nazi exploitation") which was popular on previous decades but which was extinguished over the time for finally becoming into a historical curiosity, and whose films are more interesting for their anachronism than for their intrinsic quality.And although I enjoyed many "Nazi exploitation" films, I did not think they are worthy of a rebirth.At least that was my perception before watching the film.After having seen it, I noticed that Tarantino's intention was showing two facets which coexist on the same movie; on the one hand, he wanted to make a cathartic film with plentiful violence and action; and on the other hand, he wanted to make a sober drama about the ideological conflict behind World War II.I think those two facets are not very well balanced, but they help to each other for finally creating an interesting and entertaining experience, but which is not very memorable after all.I will start with the complains I have with this movie.First of all, I think Tarantino urgently needs an editor or producer who can instill some narrative discipline on him.Tarantino has always been interested in creating juicy conversations, but he exceeded a little bit on that in Inglorious Basterds (although not as much as in Death Proof), at the same time that makes him loose the narrative focus on a few occasions.That was definitely an obstacle I had to completely plunge myself on an interesting story.Besides, I do not think the story was completely well planned; I think that the elements of action and violence were the least lucky from the movie, and that includes the "basterds" from the title.And finally, I did not find Brad Pitt to be completely credible on his role.I consider him to be a great actor, but he honestly irritated me a little bit in here.Fortunately, Inglourious Basterds has various positive elements, so I finished liking it after all.The best element from this movie is the aspect of the espionage and conspiracy from the Resistance, thanks to Tarantino's solid direction and the excellent performances from a group of European actors, where the members who mostly stand out are M√©lanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz.So, in spite of its various fails, I liked Inglourious Basterds and I can recommend it as an interesting movie.It is definitely an enormous step forward of Death Proof, but it is very far from reaching the heights of Tarantino's best movies (Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, by my humble point of view).Clearly, Inglorious Basterds is one of his least achieved movies, but it entertained me anyway.
On this decade,we have mostly seen legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro on mediocre or bad movies,where they are just worried on winning some more money.Righteous Kill is another movie in which these two actors are wasted.This is a very bad thriller which commits the fatal sin of being boring.It seems that director Jon Avnet and screenwriter Russell Gewirtz said : "We have De Niro and Pacino.We do not need a good story".That was wrong.The story from this movie is completely hollow and full of plot holes,not to mention it is painfully predictable.Come on,I predicted that ending like 30 minutes after the movie had started.Plus,this is a kind of story which has been seen too many times.On the supporting cast,there are good actors who are wasted (John Leguizamo,Donnie Wahlberg,the great Brian Dennehy and the underrated Carla Gugino).This movie was completely boring because it lacked of dynamism.In other words,everything felt pretty static.Righteous Kill is a very crappy cop flick which tells a story which does not produce any interest and is totally predictable.It is obvious that Pacino and De Niro have lost the interest in their careers.
I don't know what is worse: the romantic comedies which limit themselves to recycle the same exhausted routine; or the ones which try to adorn the formula with some "creative" premise which feels horribly forced. Sure, at least they try to do something different, but the result tends to be counterproductive (let's remember films such as The Accidental Husband and Letters to Juliet). Unfortunately, this is also the case from the film What's Your Number?, a romantic comedy based on an absurd and arbitrary idea, which is the main reason why I found it tedious.You know what? I'm not going to repeat the same complaints I expressed with an uncountable number of romantic comedies (you know...the comedy isn't funny, the romance isn't romantic, the main actors lack of chemistry with each other, etc.). I think it will be more interesting to tell the story of author Karyn Bosnak, on whose novel this film is based. 20 Times a Lady is her second book; the first one was called Save Karyn, in which Bosnak explains the experience she had in early 21st century, when her addiction to the designer clothes elevated her credit debt to more than 20,000 dollars, something which was not a problem when she had a comfortable work as a TV producer...but when she lost her job, it was impossible to pay for her credit card. So, she created a website called savekaryn.com, in which she requested donations of one or two dollars in order to pay off her debt. And what started as a modest announcement in craigslist.com ended up winning impulse until reports about her were made in CNN, and she ended up with a contract to write a book about her "financial adventure". And more recently, her second book was adapted by Hollywood to the big screen.I'm sorry. I think that that is not such an interesting story as I had initially thought. In conclusion, What's Your Number? is a tedious romantic comedy in which I regret having wasted my time.
I like the novels and short stories from author Philip K. Dick (1928-1982), but my expectations before watching the movies based on his work are always low, because even though I liked some of them very much (Blade Runner, A Scanner Darkly and Total Recall), I found other ones to be atrocious pieces of crap (Impostor and Paycheck). I think that the difficulty for adapting his work to the big screen does not only lie on his febrile vision and extravagant ideas, but also on the use of narrative structures which challenge the unavoidable formulas from the cinematographic screenplay. So, even though his books and short stories might seem like a good starting point for a film, they sometimes loose the "magic", because they are forced to fit into the rigid Hollywood parameters. So, I was not surprised to find that the film The Adjustment Bureau has very few in common with the short story Adjustment Team, on which it was supposedly based; on the other hand, what did surprise me was to find a brilliant movie on its own merit, whose combination of science fiction and romance feels perfectly integrated and intelligently written.It is convenient not to reveal too much about the screenplay from The Adjustment Bureau, because I liked discovering the clues and revelations about the "agents" at the same time of the main characters very much. I also liked the way in which the movie denies itself to bring a definite answer about the "agents", preferring to designate divergent routes in order to let the spectators to draw conclusions according to their own ideology. That same balance between the evident and the implicit extends to the other elements from the screenplay, so The Adjustment Bureau can leave equally satisfied to those who are only searching to spend a time of adventure, romance and suspense; and to those ones who want to analyze the concepts from the story deeply, speculating about all those things which are suggested, but not explained.As I mentioned in many occasions, I am not a big fan of romantic cinema, and I think that that is because I rarely feel it real and sincere. There are many movies which limit themselves to present us an attractive couple and expect us to accept their relationship without questioning their reasons and credibility. On the opposite, The Adjustment Bureau rounds on an intense and credible romance between the characters interpreted by Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, who both have a perfect chemistry with each other, and also make a great work at bringing a genuine life to their characters' feelings. I will not deny the fact that the story occasionally makes us to take a leap of faith, but I did not have any problem in accepting the mutual chemistry between the main characters. In fact, it was indispensable for it to be so, because the romance is not an ornament of the screenplay, but its absolute axis, and if it had not worked, the rest of the movie would have collapsed due to a lack of cohesion. Besides, I found the metaphysical aspect from The Adjustment Bureau to be very interesting.The only complaint I have against The Adjustment Bureau is that the ending is a bit convenient. In spite of that, I liked this film very much, and I was not bothered at all by the lack of the bizarre elements from the short story in order for it to forge its own style and create a fascinating world inhabited by solid and interesting characters. Besides of the performances from Damon and Blunt, I also liked the work from John Slattery, Anthony Mackie and the great Terence Stamp. Director George Nolfi had an excellent debut with The Adjustment Bureau, and I will definitely look forward to his next projects.
At the ending of Rachel Getting Married there is an acknowledgement to director Robert Altman (1925-2006), something which is very appropriate because director Jonathan Demme used on this film a semi-improvised style which is very similar to the one Altman used on films like Gosford Park, The Company and A Prairie Home Companion.I think that it would have also been appropriate to see a mention of director Lars von Trier, because the simplicity and realism from Rachel Getting Married reminded me of the precepts from the (extinct?) doctrine Dogme 95, whose followers despised the artifice of cinematographic filming, so they only wanted "real" elements on their movies: nothing of artificial lightning or music or excessive post-production.I am not saying Rachel Getting Married is a Dogme 95 film...but it definitely honors its theoretical principles (although not all the practical ones) by focusing the full attention on the story and the characters.I think it is highly probable that Demme's experimental facet inspired him to direct this fascinating movie, which is full of deepness, meaning and emotion.It seemed ironic to me to think that the previous film I had seen with Anne Hathaway was the pathetic comedy Bride Wars, which showed the obsession some women have in order to enjoy a perfect wedding.Fortunately, Rachel Getting Married has nothing to do with that piece of crap, with the exception of the bridal subject and the presence of its competent main actress.In less than a decade, Hathaway built a solid career which started with Disney comedies and has evolved to her current maturity.Her performance in Rachel Getting Married is truly brilliant, and not only on the emotional scenes, but also when she expresses a lot without saying anything.Rosemarie DeWitt (whose work on the series United States of Tara is, by my point of view, highly superior to the one from the main actress, Toni Collette) also brings an excellent performance as Hathaway's character's sister.And we also have an amazing performance from Debra Winger.Although her appearance is relatively short, she brings an absolutely hypnotic and credible performance.Rachel Getting Married is an excellent movie which tells a fascinating story with a lot of layers and is rich in details which require an effort from the spectator in noticing them.I like to see that 35 years later of his humble beginnings under the great Roger Corman's ward (with the very entertaining film Caged Heat), Demme has not lost the enthusiasm of exploring cinematographic art and proving new things with excellent results, as we can see on The Agronomist and Rachel Getting Married.
I was interested in watching Fair Game because it examines the same political scandal portrayed in the excellent film Nothing But the Truth, but from a different perspective. Well, to be fair, Nothing But the Truth ensures the fact that it is a work of fiction, but it is obvious that it was inspired by the "Plame case" (also known as "Plamegate"), which shook the corridors of power in Washington D.C. almost 10 years ago. Meanwhile, Fair Game pretends to be a rigorous dramatization of the events (at least inside the Hollywood's parameters), by using the real names and expanding the scope from the story in order to exactly show why that scandal had so much importance. And even though it makes an adequate work at explaining the complicated chain of causes and consequences, it is after all another tiring denounce against the dishonesty from North American government, and therefore, against George W. Bush and his minions. However, the movie kept me moderately interested in spite of that.When I first read about the "Plamegate" scandal years ago, I could not understand it completely well; however, co-screenwriters Jez and John Butterworth (who based their work on the books The Politics of Truth and Fair Game) created a clear narrative flow which correctly explains the importance from that events, and why this scandal was another stain in the face from a government which is already pretty dirty by itself. Naomi Watts brings an excellent performance in the leading role, because she very credibly shows the contradictory facets from her character, as an affectionate housewife; and as a cold and manipulative spy. Sean Penn is a bit over the top in his role, and when his character takes the control of the movie, what was a sober tale of spies, bureaucracy and public perception becomes into a strident political diatribe.Do not misunderstand me; I personally agree with the ideology expressed by Fair Game; however, such a radical change of tone felt very forced, and I do not think that was a good way to efficiently transmit its message. And the worst thing of all is that the agitated speeches about national security, weapons of mass destruction and military intelligence slow down the rhythm from the film and make it occasionally boring.So, in conclusion, I liked some elements from Fair Game, and I found it moderately interesting in general. However, it did not leave me very satisfied, mainly because it is basically ANOTHER denounce against Bush, and because of its evident partisanship and demagogy. Nevertheless, I think I can give it a slight recommendation, but if you wanna see a brilliant film which portrays the espionage on a subtle way, I recommend you The Tailor of Panama, The Quiet American or Spartan.
The films belonging to The Fast and the Furious saga have been increasing the ambition of the stunts and action scenes with every new sequel, while the screenplays have been getting more tangled and apparatus in order to guarantee the numerous cast to have enough moments of individual showcasing. Furious 7 isn't the exception, and I found it very entertaining, while it elevated the level of drama and motoring stunts beyond any reason or logic... which is exactly what we expect in a film from this franchise. Besides, the sad death of actor Paul Walker's brings a gravity to the story which the screenplay could have never generated by itself. I think that, until now, I could found the validity in the wordiness about "family", which has been repeated many times by Vin Diesel in the films of this saga (I counted at least four instances in Furious 7). I wish that this new emotional weight hadn't been due to such tragic reasons, but it undoubtedly influenced my perception of the film. Anyway... what people want to see are the action scenes, and Furious 7 completely fulfills the expectations in that regard, with a series of outlandish stunts which are totally improbable but very entertaining. Screenwriter Chris Morgan found an appropriate balance between action and story, and director James Wan made a fluid and dynamic work. Editorial comment: the quantity and complexity of the stunts displayed in Furious 7 are making some people talk about the possibility of introducing a special category for stunt doubles at the Oscars; and I think that's an excellent idea. There's undoubtedly digital manipulation in those scenes (erasing of cables, face replacement, general retouch), but there's still an extraordinary mechanic talent, pyrotechnic and logistical talent involved in the shooting of those scenes, something which would deserve a formal recognition by the Oscars. There are currently two categories dedicated to the technicians who mix the audio of car crashes... and none to the drivers who risked their lives? Ridiculous. End of the editorial comment. The veteran actors of the saga do their usual stuff in Furious 7, as it can be supposed. As for the additions of the cast, Jason Statham makes a perfect work as one of the villains, but the great Djimon Hounsou is completely wasted as the terrorist who wants to steal a magic application of digital espionage. Kurt Russell brings an appropriate style and personality to his character. And the female fight scene between Michelle Rodriguez and Ronda Rousey is inferior to the similar ones in which Gina Carano was involved in the previous film. I don't know whether this saga is going to continue without Walker; it probably will, considering the huge quantities of money these films generate. My favorite movie from this franchise keeps being the fifth one (Fast Five), but I can recommend Furious 7 as a very competent action film, and as a solid tribute/final chapter in case they decide to stop here.
Director Jim Sheridan is not very prolific, but when he works, he makes films of an unusual dramatic intensity (with the exception of Get Rich or Die Trying).Even though I curiously found his most acclaimed films (My Left Foot and In the Name of the Father) not to be completely satisfactory, I cannot deny the honesty from all his films (again, with the exception of Get Rich or Die Trying), whose modest intimacy hides a big thematic ambition and extensive repercussions (by the way, I think his best movie so far is In America).That also applies to his most recent film Brothers, where the tribulations from a family evoke wider and more resonant questions.The result is a fascinating and deep drama.Brothers is the remake of a Danish film called Br√∏dre, which I have not seen, and maybe because of that it reminded me of the extraordinary The Deer Hunter, because it shows us similar contrasts between the horrors of a war and the intern conflict from a group of people.Brothers is not at the same level of that classic film, but it is very well written, since the characters are very interesting and the story is told on an engaging way.And something which definitely helps is the excellent performances from Natalie Portman, Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal, who absolutely plunge themselves into their characters, and they are capable of expressing the most complex emotions in the most subtle way.As for the supporting cast, Sam Shepard, Mare Winningham, Jenny Wade and Carey Mulligan also bring very solid performances.And if we combine all that with Sheridan's methodic direction and his good eye for creating moments of honest and spontaneous emotion, the final result is a memorable movie.The only fail I found in Brothers is that the ending feels a bit abrupt and convenient.However, that is not a very important fail, and I can easily excuse it in sight of all the positive elements this film has.Brothers deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating screenplay, solid direction and definitely its performances.
The presence of Jason Bateman in the leading role makes the comparison obvious, but not less true: This Is Where I Leave You looks like a tedious episode of Arrested Development. Or maybe three or four episodes together. This Is Where I Leave You is based on a homonym novel written by Jonathan Tropper (who also adapted the screenplay), and it probably worked better as a book, where there is a wide opportunity to explore the emotions and motivation of the characters. Unfortunately, the transition to cinema sacrificed those hypothetical attributes (I haven't read the novel and I'm not interested in doing so), and the result is a parade of boring conversations, bad jokes and artificial drama which can't be taken seriously due to the frivolity of the characters. The cast of This Is Where I Leave You includes three actors I admire, even though they are a bit wasted here: Tina Fey, for whom I will have an eternal devotion due to 30 Rock; Rose Byrne, who I find charming; and Bateman, who resurrected his career with the previously mentioned TV series Arrested Development (it seems there will be a second season on Netflix!). This is Where I Leave You obviously attempted to be a modern version of The Big Chill, but unfortunately, it failed. The humor isn't funny, the observations about relationships and human nature aren't very incisive, and the characters are caricatures. In conclusion, I can't recommend this film, even though some people might "connect" better with spectators who see their lives reflected in the film (even though they are undoubtedly exaggerated reflections). As an only son and old bachelor, I didn't find any material for me to feel identified with this parade of unhappy marriages and fraternal rivalries.
At the beginning of (500) Days of Summer, we are warned that we are not going to see a love story...however, the film has many clich√©s from romantic comedies.I do not say that as a negative element, because I think the best thing about this excellent film is that the clich√©s are very well administrated and they never feel forced, since they are used as tools for telling the story, so the final result is a honest and realistic romantic comedy, something which is not very usual to see.Besides, the concept of the movie and its development have originality.The main actors are perfect on their roles, because they show a natural charisma which makes us to empathize with their characters.I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of the best actors of his generation, and not only because of his big talent, but also because of his audacious selection of projects (like Brick or The Lookout).In (500) Days of Summer, he brings another one of his detailed performances, which are deep and absolutely natural.Zooey Deschanel is undoubtedly charming, but the truth is she had never left me very impressed with any of her performances.However, her role in (500) Days of Summer perfectly adapts to her range, and she is really excellent on it.I also liked the tone director Marc Webb brought to the movie very much.And I also appreciated that, at the difference of so many romantic comedies, everything that happens obeys to the narrative flow of the movie.In other words, there is nothing that happens because the screenplay says so.Besides, (500) Days of Summer challenges our expectations and the conventions of the genre.(500) Days of Summer is an excellent film, and one of the best ones I have seen in 2009.This movie deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation, because it is not common to see a romantic comedy with such an ingenuity and intelligence.
The Bounty Hunter is one of those pieces of crap which were made with the only purpose of showing two popular and attractive actors, and without even the minimum effort in the screenplay and the direction.However, it would be simpler to describe this movie as what it is NOT: it is not funny, it is not exciting, it is not entertaining.In summary: it is absolutely nothing.It is simply 110 minutes of Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston discussing without any passion and running without a purpose.So, it should not surprise us that there is not any ingenuity on the screenplay or credibility in the performances.However, I do not think they could be considered as "performances".This is not the first time Aniston tries to buoy a bad movie with the bright of her "star" (Along Came Polly and Rumor Has It are two examples which come to my mind in this moment).However, I think this is the first time she brings us such a horrible performance with the mere hook of her charisma and physical attractive.As for Butler, the least I say, the better.His dramatic development is generally competent (like, for example, in 300 and Law Abiding Citizen); however, it is obvious he lacks of talent for the comedy because, as he made in The Ugly Truth, he exaggerates his dialogs and attitudes too much.And if we combine those two pathetic performances with the inexistent substance from the characters and story, we have as a final result a disaster which first of all, provokes embarrassment, and then irritation for having invested time and money on this piece of junk.The screenplay is even worse than the performances: an absolutely flat screenplay, without any energy or the most elementary narrative push to make the spectator to get interested in the story.Finally, I have to mention the soundtrack, which puts effort in convincing us we are having fun; needless to say that the only thing the use of songs gets is making the torture worse, because even though the songs are not inherently bad, they feel as weak distractions which are incompatible with the dull tone from the movie, so they end up stressing its antipathy on their intention of disguising it.I recommend you to stay very far away from this movie.It is obvious this movie was made with reluctance, so it is natural that my answer was exactly the same.In summary, The Bounty Hunter is an execrable movie which truly damages the cinema.
I wanted to read the book The Hunger Games before watching the movie, but I couldn't do it because of a lack of time...and now, I'm glad that it was like that, because if the film The Hunger Games is a faithful reflection of its forced narrative and deficient structure, I wouldn't have liked to waste many days on an equally frustrating book. In other words, instead of days, watching this film made me waste only 142 minutes. Having said that, I estimate that this movie was designed to the fans of the book, so please take this review as the reaction from an embittered old man who is ignorant of everything related to the mythology created by author Suzanne Collins.Before watching The Hunger Games, I expected to find something like a light version of Battle Royale, and it ended up being like that to some point...there isn't too much violence, the social commentary is minimum, and there isn't too much interest in the characters' destiny. Even the great actress Jennifer Lawrence shows difficulties in bringing emotions to her poorly written character. The screenplay from The Hunger Games is arid and inconsistent, repeating over and over what is obvious, while ignoring everything it should have explained better. As for the character Peeta, his relationship with the main one evolutes on an abrupt and not very credible way, while there doesn't seem to be any genuine affection between them (Or was that an intentional decision in order to leave the existence of a romantic triangle ambiguous? I don't know! The book might explain that better; the problem is that I'm watching a movie, not reading a book). As a consequence, Josh Hutcherson is a victim of the same thing which happened to Lawrence: he doesn't have too much to do due to the fact that his character isn't well written. As for the supporting cast, nobody shows too much interest in their roles, with the exceptions of Woody Harrelson, who brings some life to his character, and Donald Sutherland, bringing energy and conviction as one of the villains.I had a lot of problems in accepting the exotic futuristic world in which The Hunger Games is developed. I didn't find it credible nor coherent, something which is worsened by the mottled production design which looks like an over-developed combination of an '80s video-clip and Jean Paul Gaultier's febrile fantasies. Oh, and I also have to say that I think director Gary Ross was a horrible decision to take this story to the big screen. He couldn't evoke the atmosphere of misery and desperation in the scenes of District 12, and what is more, his tendency to shoot scenes with closed takes and hand-held camera makes the narrative confusing, the style monotonous and doesn't provoke any suspense during the scenes of the "Games" (the last 30 minutes should have been tense and exciting, and they ended up being the most boring part in the whole film).However, I think that the main problem from The Hunger Games resides on the bases of the story. A death combat between children and teenagers required a lot of ingenuity, something which wasn't employed in the screenplay, as well as levels of violence, subversion and intensity which aren't compatible with juvenile cinema. As a consequence, The Hunger Games constantly sacrificed the realism and the logic in order not to move out from that film niche, and in order to get the censor's approval. The main idea behind this film has potential (something which was proved by Battle Royale and its sequel)...but when it's planted on an infertile land, like in here, the harvest is insipid and diluted. In conclusion, The Hunger Games is a tedious movie in which I wasted my time and my money.
Among the books I obsessively read during my childhood, I can mention Robin Hood, Tom Sawyer, Journey to the Center of the Earth and The Three Musketeers. Of them, I think the last one is the one which most luck has had in its film adaptations, from the pure acrobatic pleasure of Gene Kelly (1912-1996) as D'Artagnan in 1948, to the entertaining version made by Disney in 1993. However, the recent film The Three Musketeers (2011) tried to add something totally new to the recipe, because it re-interprets the venerable novel as a "steampunk" adventure full of retro technology, martial arts and stunts in slow-motion. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it could have produced a good result...if the film had told an interesting story as an endorsement of its over-designed visual style.This revisionist interpretation of The Three Musketeers probably cost more than all the previous movies together, and it is easy to note the big effort from the designers, builders and special effects technicians to reach an opulent visual style. Unfortunately, all that effort was wasted in a movie with a tedious and incredibly lazy screenplay, horrible dialogs and bad direction. The Three Musketeers does not work even as an "involuntary comedy", because the screenplay bores due to the maddening slowness from its repetitive scenes, many of them built with recycled pieces we have seen in better movies.My general description of The Three Musketeers (2011) would be the following: a tedious film with insipid drama occasionally interrupted by badly filmed action scenes. And what is more, Matthew Macfayden, Ray Stevenson and Luke Evans bring listless performances as the musketeers, and they do not have any chemistry with each other, so as a consequence, it was impossible for me to find the intense friendship between their characters credible. In conclusion, this film is a fiasco, so do not waste your time nor your money with it.
The Transporter and Transporter 2 had had frivolous action endorsed by a solid main actor and a subtle sense of humor which invited us not to take them so seriously.In summary,they were not memorable films at all,but at least,they brought me a time of hollow entertainment.Director Louis Letterier was unable to work on the third part (because he was directing The Incredible Hulk) and producer Luc Besson decided to hire another one of his disciples to direct it...unfortunately,that disciple is clearly one of his worst students.I do not know if Transporter 3 failed so much because of the lack of talent from director Olivier Megaton (whose previous movie,La Sirene Rouge,had also been very bad) or the lack of a bigger budget,but Transporter 3 feels very poor and generic; besides,it tries to be more realistic than the previous movies,something which is not precisely bad...the problem is that all the energy and dynamism from the previous parts are missing.Transporter 3 looks like many crappy straight-to-DVD sequels,in which the original main actor was replaced by some down-at-heel actor or some rising wrestler.In other words,although Transporter 3 was released in cinemas and with Jason Statham again on the leading role,it is not difficult to imagine it as a cheap straight-to-DVD movie starred by Casper Van Dien or John Cena.As it is custom in this saga,Transporter 3 starts with a car chase,although it is so short and so poorly filmed that it gives us an anticipation of the very big level of mediocrity from this film.The screenplay is incredibly sterile because it adds nothing new to this saga; the only thing it does is repeating the same from the previous movies,but done with much less energy,ingenuity and vision.The fight scenes completely lack of any impact because of the excessive edition and Megaton's very poor direction.This movie does not offer any interest.The only thing that makes this movie marginally better than what it really is,is Statham's natural charisma.Transporter 3 is a so irritatingly mediocre movie that it finishes being very bad.Skip this movie.
I found The Amazing Spider-Man entertaining, but very inferior to the first two films of the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi; and now, the sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, is more or less at the same level, with interesting characters and a competent dramatic development, but with a screenplay saturated with elements which are not always compatible with each other. Co-screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci introduced enough characters, conspiracies and mysteries to fill in three movies, something which considerably clouds the narrative focus and dilutes the impact of the main characters. I found the introduction of Electro very weak; I don't know whether Kurtzman and Orci attempted to create a tragic villain, or a strange evolution from comic relief to a mortal enemy; anyway, I think they took an unfortunate creative decision which is exacerbated by Jamie Foxx's poor performance in that role. The second villain of the story, Green Goblin, comes out of nowhere and is developed with too much quickness in order to be credible; but at least, Dane DeHaan brings a very good performance in that role. Another positive element from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the relationship between the characters Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone keep having a perfect chemistry with each other, and even though the screenplay occasionally gives them improbable situations, their credible performances and warm interaction always restore their reality. As for director Marc Webb, he keeps showing more preference for the personal drama than for Spider-Man's epic mythology; that's why the narrative occasionally falters and the pieces of the puzzle don't always fit like they should. Nevertheless, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 kept me entertained, and I consider it worthy of a moderate recommendation. However, I hope that some day, the rights of Spider-Man revert to Marvel Studios (they currently belong to Columbia Pictures, something which avoids the cooperation between both franchises), because I think that, even though The Amazing Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 are competent films, they couldn't capture the essence of the character as part of a rich and varied universe.
My expectations before watching Unstoppable were low, because I thought it was going to be another bad "style over substance" film directed by Tony Scott (such as Domino, Man on Fire and the remake of The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3), in which his irritating visual tricks try to disguise a tedious screenplay, when the only thing they in fact do is exacerbating it. Fortunately, I have to say that I was very wrong about Unstoppable, because I had a very entertaining experience while I was watching it, at the same time that Scott's direction in here is much more disciplined than in the previously mentioned films.To start with, the main cast from Unstoppable made a competent work with their roles: Denzel Washington, Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson show a high level of enthusiasm, at the same time that they feel credible in their characters.Scott's dynamic direction creates solid moments of tension, and it also shows a very good hand for creating exciting action sequences. Besides, Scott adds some new visual tricks in Unstoppable; however, at the difference of other movies directed by him, they are used with discipline, and they are helpful to the style required by the narrative.In conclusion, I think I can recommend Unstoppable with confidence, because despite not being a great movie and having some trite elements in the screenplay, I cannot deny that it kept me excited and very entertained the whole time. By my humble point of view, Scott could capture the precise balance between extravagance, energy and spectacle in Unstoppable. In summary, a compact and good-quality entertainment.
I guess that many people will feel confused or disappointed after watching Everything Must Go, because the mere presence of Will Ferrell in the leading role suggests the fact that the film is a comedy. That is incorrect. In fact, Everything Must Go is a serious drama, and those who can put up with that, will find a precisely written and very interesting film.The tone from Everything Must Go is increasingly somber as the film goes by, so I wasn't sure during the second half if the film was going to compensate us with a happy ending. But anyway...the ending is not very important in these independent dramas, but the texture of the narrative, the performances and the realism of the emotions. And I think that the film succeeds in those three elements. The complaints I have against Everything Must Go is that some details feel forced, while a few moments feel a bit dull.And, what about Ferrell? Was his incursion into a dramatic material good? It can be said that he had already gotten close to this territory in the films Melinda and Melinda and Stranger Than Fiction, but Everything Must Go represents his first leading serious role, and I think he did a pretty good job. Besides, he is well endorsed by the solid performances from Rebecca Hall, Laura Dern, Christopher Jordan Wallace and the great Michael Pe√±a. So, in conclusion, I liked Everything Must Go pretty much despite not being an excellent film, and I think I can recommend it because of that.
The film Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle deservedly became a cult classic in 2003, because besides its references to the "stoner" culture and the irreverent humor, there was a solid basis of sincere friendship which humanized the main characters, and avoided them to become simple caricatures making stupidities under the influence of marijuana (among other drugs). And on top of that, the chemistry between actors Kal Penn and John Cho was absolutely perfect. The sequel Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay was moderately entertaining but mediocre, because its disproportionate and surrealistic humor ended up sacrificing the dynamic between the main characters. So, I had low expectations before watching A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas, because its trailers suggested a repetition of the febrile and unbridled style of the second film, instead of the "character comedy" from the first one. Fortunately, that expectation ended up being only partially true, so I ended up enjoying this third movie more than Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, but less than Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle.The screenplay of A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas attempts to gradually increment the level of the main characters' adventures in order to bring some rhythm to the narrative, but when we lead to the cameo of Jesus Christ and Santa Claus' surgery, it's already too late to ask for any coherence or realism. However, co-screenwriters Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Scholssberg made the good decision of basing all those ridiculous things on the existing relationship between Harold and Kumar, something which brings a human touch to their vulgar adventures. Leaving the most absurd moments aside, A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas rounds on the re-discovery of an abandoned friendship, and in that aspect, Cho and Penn took their performances seriously. In other words, what I liked the most in this movie was the honest expression of loyalty and friendship between the main characters.The irreverent and politically incorrect humor is exactly what we can expect in a Harold and Kumar movie, so in order not to ruin the best moments of A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas, I will mention that I approximately laughed 20% of the times, I smiled a 50%, and the remaining 30% produced a slight irritation on me. Something which starts well but ends up tiring a little bit is the satire of the 3D format...even though some of those jokes would have worked better watching it in the cinema. Anyway, I can give a moderate recommendation to A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas because it managed to keep me entertained, even though I would have preferred less surrealism, less exaggeration and more humor based on the interaction between the main characters.
The only thing which stood out for me in the mediocre film Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (2009) was seeing the logo of the company RKO during the opening credits.Sure, it is a modernized digital version (I wish they had kept the "retro" look), but it was still nice to see that that legendary studio keeps being active (or maybe, a nostalgic investor simply bought the rights...I do not know).Unfortunately, that trivial detail was one of the best elements from this movie, because despite the main idea being slightly ingenious, the screenplay develops it on a boring and uninteresting way, at the same time the movie also has bad performances and bland direction from the mercenary Peter Hyams.The screenplay from Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (2009) discards any consistency, and it makes the characters to commit stupid mistakes which go against their character and the most basic common sense.We also feel the squeaks in the narrative gears when the screenplay tries to justify action scenes or moments of suspense in order to bring some life to the inert drama and also distract us from the multiple holes from the story.This film is the remake of a film which was directed in 1956 by the great Fritz Lang (1890-1976), and I suppose that many elements from the original film would feel anachronistic on a contemporary version, so Hyams (on his work as a screenwriter) faced the ungrateful homework of conciliating old concepts with modern technology.As a consequence, we have an erratic logic where the advanced digital analysis of a photograph is possible, but at the same time, the facility of duplicating the digital content of a DVD is ignored.So, the abundance of inconsistencies such as that one, hollow characters and hasty deductions are the main elements which make Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (2009) to be mediocre, boring and disposable.So, in conclusion I cannot recommend this movie.It may not be bad, but it is so mediocre and insipid that I feel I could have used the time I invested in watching it doing something more interesting.
I think that the most important thing in a movie is the screenplay, but even if it is not very good, that does not avoid me from appreciating other elements. In the case of Solitary Man, what I could appreciate were the performances, specially Michael Douglas'...and I do not even know if I am referring to his performance or to his mere presence. I do not think there is too much difference between both things in this point of his career. Sure, he is still able to bring life and realism to the characters he interprets (Gordon Gekko in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is a recent example), but even in bad movies in which he interprets trite characters (like Ghosts of Girlfriends Past), his mere presence is enough to bring charisma and energy to his role. And I think that that is the authentic trademark from a film star, which allows him to transcend the economic success or the ephemeral popularity. In other words, I did not like Solitary Man, and as a consequence, I do not consider it to be worthy of a recommendation; however, Douglas' charismatic work makes it to look better than what it really is.Solitary Man is basically one of those character studies which Hollywood screenwriters like so much. The story is practically inexistent, something which leaves us with a long chain of dramatic scenes, "deep" dialogs and family conflicts, which are all anchored by a main character who is full of fails and problems and who, despite everything, tries to redeem himself. As I previously mentioned, the actors bring good performances, but they could not save this movie from being pretty boring. And I think that that is mainly a consequence from a monotonous and lacking of direction screenplay. Or, better said, "lacking of movement", because there is not a narrative momentum to an either logic or satisfactory conclusion. What we only have are multiple instances from the main character acting like an insensible lout, and facing the consequences from his actions. Is there any important message in there? Don't act like an insensible lout? Unfortunately, I think that, by my point of view, that is all this movie says.Besides of Douglas' performance, I also liked the works from Jenna Fischer in a surprisingly dramatic role; from the great Mary-Louise Parker, who makes practically a cameo as the main character's new "love"; from Imogen Potts as a cynical and intelligent student; from Jesse Eisenberg as a shy young man; from Susan Sarandon as the main character's ex-wife; and specially from Danny DeVito as a main character's friend. However, as I previously mentioned, they could not save Solitary Man from being a tedious movie which made me feel like wasting my time. Nevertheless, I like to see Douglas facing his mature age with dignity.
I had interest in watching Joshua,because I had read a lot of excellent commentaries about it.I had finally the opportunity to watch it and,although I liked it,I have to say it disappointed me a little bit.This is a solid movie but for some reason,I did not find it memorable.First,let's see the positive elements from this movie.Sam Rockwell and Vera Farmiga bring brilliant performances,which are full of details and which are absolutely natural and credible.I would have liked to see these two actors getting recognition for their excellent works.I also appreciated the ambiguity from this movie.I like to see a movie which trusts the spectator will be enough intelligent for taking out conclusions.Now,I have to mention the negative elements from this movie.I did not like Jakob Kogan's performance too much.I do not think it's bad but I think he should have been a little bit more credible and natural on his role of an evil kid.Plus,there are a few irrelevant scenes.I liked Joshua,mainly for the fact that it kept me entertained.But,with the exception of Rockwell's and Farmiga's performances,I do not find something special on it.In summary,a solid film,but not too memorable.Rating : 7.5
Odd Thomas belongs to the modern avalanche of films based on juvenile novels (in this case, a series of books written by the cult author Dean R. Koontz), and maybe because of that, it exhibits the typical dramatic lightness and narrative frivolity from similar films; the things happen with an excessive quickness, the answers come too easily, and even though the central mystery threatens the death of hundreds of innocents, the gravity of the situation is never properly transmitted. However, Odd Thomas has enough positive elements in order to make it worthy of a moderate recommendation. To start with, the performances are pretty good, and the screenplay contains some ingenious details which enrich the universe of the film, extending it and suggesting some interesting possibilities for the future... even though I don't think any sequels will be made considering this film's economic failure. Finally, the main character is likable and interesting. At the difference of other passive main characters who limit themselves to react to the external situations, Thomas is dynamic and proactive, because he complements his paranormal powers with a sharp deductive mind, and with enough physical training in order to defend himself from the bizarre and dangerous situations in which he's generally involved. So, I don't consider it a brilliant or highly memorable film, but I found Odd Thomas an entertaining film with good performances, interesting characters and a relentless rhythm which doesn't leave any place for boredom. The special effects aren't always as realistic as I would have liked, but they fulfill with their function of bringing the monsters and ghosts to life. To conclude, I will say that I hope Odd Thomas will stimulate future cinematographic adaptations of Koontz's novels. I don't know why Hollywood hasn't exploited this underrated author's fertile imagination more. To start with, I suggest an adaptation of Strangers, one of the most tense and enigmatic novels I have ever read.
Edge of Darkness is the most recent case of badly done marketing.The trailers try to sell it as a revenge movie (such as, for example, Death Sentence or Death Wish), something which is tricky to the people, because the authentic story from the movie is hidden, since it is not the one of "vigilante looking for revenge" (well, there is some of that in the story, but it is not the main point from it).This confirms something I have always said: the trailers are dishonest by nature, due to the fact that their function is attracting spectators by any means, something which does not only involve lying to the people, but also occasionally damaging the experience of the film to them.In fact, Edge of Darkness is more of a conspiracy film, which is mediocre, but at the same time moderately entertaining.The conspiracy sub-genre seemed more interesting in the past century; but after so many movies about the treacherous powers which control the world, Edge of Darkness feels rancid and a bit predictable.The premise of its conspiracy is slightly original, but not enough to make it something special.As I said on the first paragraph, Edge of Darkness is not precisely an action film; the main point from the story is on the methodic investigation the main character makes, which is more supported on secrets and revelations than on shootouts and chases.Well, there are a few shootouts and chases; however they look like distractions for avoiding us to get bored with the repetitive interrogations ("If I tell you more, I am a dead man!") and conversations between enigmatic men on board of expensive cars ("I am a Senator from the United States!").Besides, I do not know whether Edge of Darkness should have been longer (in order to make the story deeper) or shorter (in order not to extend the conclusion, which is pretty easy to guess).Something which helps to Edge of Darkness is Mel Gibson's performance, where he shows his habitual intensity and realism.His character in this movie fits on his classic repertoire, because it simply combines the tormented father from Ransom with the unstoppable avenger from Payback, but without any touches of humor.I guess this is a good moment to talk about Gibson's "controversy".His public defaces and artistic eccentricities made him to fall from the high spheres from Hollywood to the low downtowns of tabloid newspapers and blogs specialized on celebrities' scandals.I understand why that makes it hard for many people to take him seriously as an actor and filmmaker; however, I prefer to focus on his filmography instead of his personal life.After all, how many vices and transgressions may be on the past from Hollywood stars who currently show a "clean" image? I personally think that Hollywood (as well as the politics) does not necessarily promote the rise of decent and honest people, but of those who count with the support of the best publicists and public relations agents to keep their secrets in secret.If "the perception is the reality" in our humble daily life, how will it be between the "glitterati" which is constantly scrutinized by the public eye? In other words, the quality of a movie is more important for me than the religion, vices or opinions from the actors, producers and directors; so, I think it is more important to put more attention on their careers, than on their personal lives.End of the editorial comment.I found Edge of Darkness to be a mediocre and kinda predictable thriller, but its moderate entertainment and Gibson's performance make it worthy of a slight recommendation.However, I think there are very superior recent thrillers, such as The International (which had more relevant villains), Duplicity (which was more original and had good touches of subtle humor) or Traitor (which offered a provocative moral disjunctive).
I have read comics since I am a child,but I may have stopped reading them if it was not for the work of Frank Miller.His famous period working on Daredevil,followed by his double triumph in resurrecting Batman (with The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Year One) came in the precise moment to show the narrative and visual heights a comic could go to when they risked to do something more than the entertaining but empty super-heroes and child humor (although artists like Grant Morrison,Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman also showed me that).And although Miller's following career never equaled that masterpieces of the comic genre,his work kept being excellent.For all that,I was enormously filled with enthusiasm with the notice that,after the commercial and artistic success of the excellent film Sin City (which was inspired on a work of his),Miller himself would write and direct the movie adaptation of the comic The Spirit,created by the brilliant Will Eisner,who during the 40's and 50's revolutionized the recently born art of comic and he resulted to be as important in this discipline as Miller.The good news kept coming with the list of female stars who were added to the cast and,although the main character was going to be interpreted by an almost unknown actor (Gabriel Macht),I trusted that Miller knew what he was doing and that he would not betray the work of Eisner,his idol,friend and mentor.But,I took an enormous disappointment with this movie because it resulted to be a big piece of crap which,in my case,was an unbearable experience.I cannot believe how Miller disappointed me so much.This film has a pathetic and completely incoherent screenplay,which is full of tedious monologues and a lot of scenes which do not have a point at all,not to mention they stay more of the time they need...or deserve.I can say the editor of this movie was the guilty of that,but this movie also has bad performances (specially Macht's one) and the movie completely lacks of an emotional level.Plus,this movie frustrates the spectator with the constant changes of tone and its pretentious attitude.It's obvious that Miller was fascinated with the work director Robert Rodriguez made in Sin City and he decided to copy his visual style and using real characters on digital backgrounds.Unfortunately,he did not copy the main work of a director : guiding the actors,giving an emotional context to the movie and bringing rhythm and meaning to the scenes.The result is that this movie is tremendously tedious and boring.The Spirit is one of that movies in which I really feel I lost my time,so I do not recommend it by any means.In summary,a tedious movie which tells a pathetic story and which is all style but nothing of substance.
Without investigating too much, I'm going to propose a hypothesis in order to explain the release on cinemas of the film House at the End of the Street: it was shot in 2010, but it was shelved for a while because, probably, nobody had any interest in distributing it; however, when actress Jennifer Lawrence became a Hollywood star thanks to the success of The Hunger Games, the producers decided to risk themselves in order to invest on releasing it on cinemas, with the hope that the fans of The Hunger Games would fill the theaters. However, I have to say that House at the End of the Street isn't a bad film; I found it a mediocre, but moderately entertaining psychological thriller which, under normal circumstances, would have been found on the TV (in channels such as Hallmark or Lifetime).The screenplay from House at the End of the Street is kinda trite and predictable. Nevertheless, despite the bland material, director Mark Tonderai could achieve a few good moments of suspense, even though he occasionally gives up and employs the typical cheap scares in order to convince us that we are thrilled (needless to say he couldn't achieve it). Lawrence brings a credible performance in the leading role, and she also displays charisma and scenic presence. She's the main reason why this film didn't bore me. Elisabeth Shue shows a good dominion of an inconsistent and excessively fickle character (first comprehensive, then intolerant, depending on what the screenplay requires). And Max Thieriot is adequate as the gallant who wakes the protective instincts on the main character. There are more characters in the film, but none of them are more than gears of the screenplay (for example, the obligatory school bullies, the main character's anonymous best friend, and the classic policeman who doesn't wait for reinforcements in order to investigate the abandoned basement).I went to see House at the End of the Street with low expectations, and I won't say the film surpassed them, but at least, it could keep me moderately entertained while I was watching it. I think I can give it a slight recommendation because of that, and also because it avoided the worst symptoms of the "Teen Wolf syndrome" (mediocre movies resurrected by the later fame of their leading actors).
Despite having the looks of a "movie star", nobody could accuse actor Aaron Eckhart of only accepting easy and safe characters.Sure, his filmography includes the obligatory romantic comedies (No Reservations) and action films (The Dark Knight), but it also includes irreverent and unconventional films like Nurse Betty, Thank You for Smoking and Towelhead.However, Eckhart is not the leading actor in the last mentioned movie; that corresponds to Summer Bishil, who brings a brilliant performance in this excellent film.Towelhead is an audacious and incisive film experience, which makes fascinating commentaries about the grey nature of the segregation and intolerance between races, sexes and ages.Every character represents different aspects from real society, and their consistent conflicts (on the small scale from their community) evoke similar situations on a bigger scale...the scale which provokes wars, ethnic persecutions and genocide.It is ironical to think that a movie whose purpose is speaking against the hypocrisy from all kind of societies and individuals had to change its original title Towelhead (racist epithet applicable to people from the Middle East) for the more bland and innocuous Nothing is Private in order to be exhibited on some territories and festivals.I think we can also consider that fact as one more of the lessons which brings this strong but honest movie, which refuses to assign any guilt or pointing out villains in its fascinating view to contemporary world.The only complaint I have against this film is that I feel the ending should have been a bit more polished.But that is not a very important fail, and it does not avoid me from giving an enthusiastic recommendation to this brave and brilliant movie.However, that recommendation must be accompanied by a very serious warning, because Towelhead includes not necessarily graphic, but tremendously disturbing scenes, both for their intrinsic content as well as for the apparent "normality" which covers those inappropriate behaviours.
Framestore,the European studio of animation and special effects which has created spectacular images for all kind of projects (from the movie The Golden Compass to its more modest but equally impressing work on the TV series Primeval),finally decided to use its resources for an animated film.The result is The Tale of Desperaux.Although the film is visually spectacular,it is boring and completely uninteresting on the story.The Tale of Desperaux is based on a book written by Kate DiCamillo,and I feel that the screenwriters decided to keep so many elements from the book as they could.The problem of that is that the story from this movie never flows naturally.Also,the screenplay is completely incoherent.As a final result of all that,when the movie was near its ending,I had completely lost interest on the story and I was only admiring the visual aspect from this movie.Although I did not like this film,I cannot deny the animation is amazing and it is much more impressing than the animation on films like Open Season or Madagascar.But,in spite of the animation,I cannot recommend this movie.The story is very poorly structured and the film bored me pretty much during all its running time.And that's the worst sin any movie can commit.I hope Framestore will use its amazing animation on better movies than this one.
I generally dislike the "psychodramas" (or whatever you want to call them) in which the wild sexuality is the only thing which motivates or identifies the characters. In other words, I found films such as Eyes Wide Shut, Exotica or The Unbearable Lightness of Being boring because I think they excessively simplified the complexity of human interaction. For better or for worse, that was my expectation before watching Shame; however, this film ended up being more similar to Leaving Las Vegas or Requiem for a Dream, because the main character's sexuality isn't presented as an excuse to create romantic drama, but as an addiction which controls his life, and doesn't give him as much pleasure as we might think.Michael Fassbender brings a brilliant performance in Shame, because he can perfectly express the desperation his character has of not being able to control his sexual addiction without the need of words. The main character isn't a classic perverted guy who revels in sexual fetishes; on the opposite, like it happens with every addiction, the satisfaction of his impulses doesn't provoke pleasure anymore, but it simply extends the vicious circle of his obsession. Besides, while some people may see the main character as a tragic figure who needs help, other ones will see him as a human monster who inspires disgust, and other ones will perceive him (Why not?) as a sexual winner. Unfortunately, that moderately interesting impartiality disappears as the film goes by.What takes me to my main complaint against Shame: I found it a bit tiring and excessively monotonous. Fassbender is such a good actor that he can perfectly establish his character's nature, the suffering the addiction provokes on him, and the difficulties he faces conciliating his vice with his professional life during the first 15 minutes. From there on, the only thing Shame does is repeating the premise, over and over again, without proposing something different. In other words, this film advances at a snail's pace until leading to the multiple endings which look like last-minute efforts in order to tie loose ends. And the worst thing of all is that co-screenwriters Steve McQueen (who was also the director) and Abi Morgan couldn't make their mind about the type of ending they wanted...What would it be better: a tragic ending, an ironical one, or an optimistic one? The problem is that they decided to implement the three of them at once.Anyway, I can give a slight recommendation to Shame despite not having left me very satisfied, because of Fassbender's performance and the fact that the screenplay includes some moderately interesting elements. As for the controversy the sex scenes from this film provoked, I don't think they warranted such a scandal; it's obvious that that was simply employed as a marketing "hook".
When the remake of The Women (1939) was announced,I decided to see the original film when,as a coincidence,it was transmitted on TV.I liked it pretty much,not only for its story and performances,but also for the contrast of the sexual politics of that moment and now.The remake resulted to be pretty mediocre and a wasted opportunity.One of the few elements I liked on this weak remake was the cast.Meg Ryan,Annette Bening,Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett-Smith fit on their roles very well.But my favorite performances are the ones from Candice Bergen,Carrie Fisher and the brilliant Cloris Leachman.But,in spite of the good cast,I did not like this movie because of its various negative points.For one sight,the screenplay is not decided between making a copy of the original film or laughing at it.Screenwriter Diane English (who also makes her first work as a director) is famous for having created the TV series Murphy Brown and My Sister Sam,which are intelligent portraits of women facing the modern world,without obsessing about the "male control",but without ignoring the sad realities from that situation.However,the women from this film define their lives because of the men and they are free on many aspects but they feel slaves of the men.I am obviously saying this from a male perspective,so a woman may lead to another conclusion that mine.What I wanna say with my conclusion,is that the film wasted the opportunity of bringing a honest and realistic message.Besides,the film bored me pretty much and the ending is tremendously ridiculous.The element which most bothered me from this movie is its lack of ambition : instead of making an update of the story and the message from the original movie,it only made an update of the clothes and cars.Although the cast from this movie is good,I cannot give this film a recommendation because it bored me pretty much and it represents wasted potential.Try to see the original film,which is much more interesting and entertaining than this weak remake.
The plot summary from The Resident did not sound very interesting to me, but my suspicions of mediocrity were not enough to dissuade me from watching it, because the presence in the cast from the good actors Hilary Swank, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Christopher Lee suggested enough talent in order to compensate the potential fails from the story; besides, the fact that it was produced by Hammer Films touched a nostalgia factor to me. Unfortunately, The Resident ended up being a boring thriller.The first half hour from The Resident looks like many romantic melodramas in which a divorced woman finds a new love which resurrects her interest in life. But after that, the film takes the thriller route. Unfortunately, the screenplay wastes any chance of making something original or unexpected, preferring a predictable ride through the clich√©s from this kind of movies: romantic moments illuminated by candles; fleeting glimpses to the villain's psychosis (moments which reach the involuntary humor); disgusting invasions to the privacy when the villain spies the main character naked in the bathroom, or kisses her furtively while she sleeps...and, sure, the unavoidable acts of violence when the intruder feels that his "real love" is not answering as he wants to. Among the few elements from The Resident, I can mention Morgan's intensity, the aura of threaten conjured by Lee, and the combination of force and vulnerability expressed by Swank. Pity that they were involved in such a badly written movie.Despite the performances, I cannot recommend The Resident, because it is boring and it does not generate any suspense.
I really appreciated the intention co-screenwriters Miles Chapman and Jason Keller and director Mikael H√•fstr√∂m had of making Escape Plan a film with an unmistakable '80s taste, where its main actors feel comfortable repeating their classic characters of tough guys with a golden heart. Sure, that was back in the '80s, and that might be the reason why Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger feel more passive and measured in Escape Plan, but their challenging attitudes keep being untouchable, as well as the cunning sense of humor with which they say their lines. Unfortunately, the screenplay from Escape Plan has the same fails as the ones from those '80s movies. I'm not saying that action films nowadays are particularly intelligent, but they generally have acquired a sophistication Escape Plan rejoices in rejecting. Examples: the ridiculously refined villain played by Jim Caviezel, the arbitrary changes of attitude in the characters when the screenplay requires so, and the hilarious shootout in which hundreds of bullets are shot and none of them hits on the hero. In spite of that, I found Escape Plan entertaining because of its agile rhythm, imaginative production design and the perfect interaction between Stallone and Schwarzenegger. So, Escape Plan could have been more ingenious, and it might not totally fulfill with the expectations we had of an epic collaboration between two icons of the action cinema... but it works properly as a competent B-movie, and I think that makes it worthy of a moderate recommendation.
I hated Jenny Slate when she incorporated herself to the cast of Saturday Night Live in 2009. I deeply disliked her style and attitude, and I didn't even notice when she left the programme one year later (it is said that producer Lorne Michaels never forgave her for saying the "F" word during her first sketch). However, during the following years, my opinion about this comedienne changed very much, because I saw her flourish in supporting roles or as a guest actress in TV series such as Married and Parks and Recreation, in which she stole her scenes and left me wishing to see her starring in some project which would take advantage of her talent. And well, that project has finally come in the shape of the film Obvious Child, quite an interesting romantic comedy/drama about the abortion. It would seem difficult and even tasteless to find humor in that subject, but the screenplay takes the premise seriously and doesn't trivialize it for the sake of humor; on the opposite, the comedy naturally flows through the contradictory emotions generated by the main character's situation. Slate brings a brilliant performance in the leading role, and the rest of the cast also makes a solid work, highlighting Gaby Hoffman and David Cross. In conclusion, I can recommend Obvious Child as an incisive film, which, despite not being something brilliant, entertains and offers sincere emotions.
I liked the first three films from director Vincenzo Natali (Cube, Cypher and Nothing) because they show a big narrative ambition and a genuine comprehension of the fantastic cinema as a tool to examine the human condition from innovative points of view. His most recent film Splice had the intention of achieving something similar, even though it eventually collapses due to the instability from its structure, half "creature feature" full of clich√©s, and half science fiction of an ambitious intellectual intention. In other words, a malformed mutation...something which does not make it completely lacking of interest.The subjects Splice deals with seem more appropriate for a film directed by David Cronenberg (at least the "classic" Cronenberg, before he abandoned the fantastic cinema), because it keeps the same tone of fascination/repulsion for the "flesh" and its (preferently artificial) mutations. On the other hand, the predictable screenplay from Splice limits itself to recycle the old formula from Frankenstein (with the obvious reference of "Elsa" and "Clive") and its classic moral about the risks and violent consequences of "playing to be God". Worse yet, the "brilliant" main characters occasionally reduce their intellect to themselves in order to make amazingly stupid mistakes, and making things which are so distant from the common sense that they provoke more laughs than horror. I know that this film's point was to denounce the scientific arrogance, and the fallacy that "everything is under control" but Splice takes that to levels which destroy its already questionable credibility.And I think that that problem comes from the fact that co-screenwriters Natali, Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor could not achieve an appropriate balance between the philosophical subjects and the horror format. Besides, the "science" on which the screenplay is based is evidently improbable and superficial; I did not ask for a genetics class, but I would have appreciated something more plausible, not exactly real, but "realistic". Anyway, I appreciated the good intentions behind this movie and I enjoyed some moments of "medical horror", as well as the basic concept, the cinematography and the work from the studies KNB and C.O.R.E., which faced the difficult work of digitally deforming actress Delphine Chan√©ac in order to bring her an exotic beauty of a disturbing inhumanity. And I would also like to mention the competent performances from Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley, who both show an emotional honesty in their characters despite the various moments in which the screenplay makes their characters to make forced things.In conclusion, Splice deserves a slight recommendation, because despite being mediocre, it kept me moderately entertained. Pity that the screenplay was not more polished, because I think that it could have gone further.
There are many movies which proudly pronounce the magic of rock 'n roll, but let's accept it, not all of them are good movies in the traditional sense.Although I liked the music, attitude and message from films like Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, Detroit Rock City or Rock and Roll High School, I cannot defend them as authentic good cinema.Fortunately, we also have gems like Almost Famous, 24 Hour Party People or A Hard Day's Night, which are brilliant cinematographic works which proudly take the flag of rock and wave it with a lot of enthusiasm and conviction.Even though I would consider The Boat That Rocked inferior to the films mentioned in the second group, I liked its energy, cast and enthusiasm very much.What makes this film not to be great are two elements: the narrative feels a bit diffuse on some moments and I think some moments are a bit forced.However, that did not avoid me to enjoy this film pretty much.The Boat That Rocked portrays an important moment in the 60's, when many bands and artists appeared in the UK as an answer to the North American rock 'n roll movement; all that originated the "English invasion", one of the most important movements of popular music during the 20th century.However, in 1966, while the popularity of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, Cream and other groups was spreading across the world, they were practically censored in the UK, because commercial radio stations practically ignored their existence.It was then when many intrepid businessmen decided to satisfy the music demand by the only possible way: pirate radio stations (which did not have an official permission) which transmitted all kind of rock from boats which were anchor in the international waters from the North Sea.That did not please to the British governors very much, but the listeners received the transmissions with enthusiasm.I think The Boat That Rocked portrays that period in History very well.Director and screenwriter Richard Curtis used in here a similar technique to the one he used on his great movie Love Actually: instead of telling a unified and cohesive story, he decided to show us a series of bullets with subjects in common, showing us many characters as the protagonists of brief stories which do not say very much individually, but which on the whole, they integrate a rich and very interesting tapestry of emotions, events and situations.Besides, the actors show enormous enthusiasm, energy and conviction on their characters.It would be impractical to mention every one of them, but I will mention that everyone are simply perfect on their roles.As I said on the first paragraph, I liked this movie pretty much, and I recommend it with confidence, but with the warning that it should not be expected a rigid and generic succession of events, but a collection of anecdotes whose function is not repeating "the truth", but evoking the feelings, values and energy of a time.
Whenever an actor plays a character of the opposite sex is generally inside the context of a comedy, where there's no need for the illusion to be perfect; in fact, the result will be funnier if it isn't. However, when the same thing happens in a drama, it's more difficult to convince the spectator of that sham, and that can ruin the film. Before watching Albert Nobbs, I had the awe that that was going to happen; however, Glenn Close's performance is so good that I didn't have any problem with credibility, and that's the one of the main reasons why I liked this film pretty much.On the beginning of Albert Nobbs, I thought it would be similar to the brilliant TV series Downton Abbey, in which the drama of the characters is combined with the sharp politics and protocols between the diverse social strata living in a same property; the nobles trying to keep an appearance of straightness, and the servants who know the truth about the intimate lives from their patrons. And on some way, Albert Nobbs examines that dynamic; but the real weight of the film is on the main character's (positive or negative) evolution and the relationships she carefully builds with the people who round on her. In the negative aspect, I can mention a few redundant scenes, and some details from the screenplay which should have been better polished.Nevertheless, Albert Nobbs is a very interesting drama which deserves a recommendation because of the generally solid screenplay, Rodrigo Garc√≠a's precise direction, and the excellent performances from Close, Janet McTeer, Mia Wasikowska and Brendan Glesson.
I was feeling some restlessness before watching The Secret World of Arrietty, because even though I'm a big admirer of Studio Ghibli's, this one wasn't directed by the great Hayao Miyazaki. So, like many other fans, I had some doubts about the quality from a product which didn't directly feature Miyazaki's vision. Fortunately, I shouldn't have been worried at all, because even though I don't think The Secret World of Arriety is Studio Ghibli's best film, it definitely counts with many artistic, visual and emotional attributes. In summary, a fascinating experience for the whole family, which proves the value of traditional animation and all the things that can be achieved in an animation film when there's nobody saying "What does it matter? It's just for children".I think The Secret World of Arrietty is Studio Ghibli's most "normal" film so far, because it's (more or less) developed in the real world, and there aren't any gods, monsters nor similar mystic creatures (well, with the exception of the "borrowers"). That promoted an attractive visual style, which director Hiromasa Yonebayashi took advantage of in order to create settings of an impressive beauty, precisely because they reflect real places. In other words, you won't find in here the haunted woods from Princess Mononoke, nor the colorful submarine landscapes from Ponyo; but that doesn't extract even a pinch of the visual richness with which everything is portrayed.In the narrative aspect, co-screenwriters Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa combined fantastic elements with prosaic reality in the proper proportion in order to keep a natural equilibrium which invites us to accept the premise without any problem. And sure, Miyazaki and Niwa put a huge attention in developing integral and credible characters, so that we can feel genuine affect for them and get interested in their destiny, specially when it's on risk due to external threats. The only thing I could say against the screenplay is that a few minor details could have been better polished. As for the direction, Yonebayashi reveals a big talent in various scenes of a precise visual delicacy and big emotional impact. In order not to reveal too much, I will point out a sequence which happens almost on the beginning of the film, when the main character and her father make a night expedition to the inside of the house in search of sugar and paper. The suspense Yonebayashi makes us feel during that sequence surpasses the one of many expensive and elaborate recent thrillers.And, above everything, The Secret World of Arrietty offers us a message about optimism, humanity and tolerance which feels more sincere for not adjusting itself to the Hollywood scheme. And the bittersweet ending was a very good decision, because it's a way to show that not everything in life is solved as magic and conveniently as we expect. That attitude of not simplifying the narrative level of a film only because it's a family one is what makes The Secret World of Arrietty such a good movie, and the main reason why I consider it worthy of a very enthusiastic recommendation.
If we can swallow the fact that Edge of Tomorrow is basically Groundhog Day with aliens, we will encounter an entertaining film with an ingeniously planned screenplay and excellent special effects. And even though that's not enough to make it something brilliant or very memorable, it works properly as a pleasant experience. Co-screenwriters Jez Butterwoth, Christopher McQuarrie and John-Henry Butterworth have fun with the temporal loop concept, which allows them to kill the hero in many occasions, and at the same time brings him a kind of immortality which is explored with humor and enough logic in order to excuse the most improbable elements from the premise. And I estimate that that will be the main weak point from Edge of Tomorrow... some spectators will accept the ridiculous explanation about time travel, and other ones won't. I personally found it too forced, even though it brings some interesting dramatic levels to the film. Tom Cruise brings a weak performance in Edge of Tomorrow, because he feels listless and bland. I could never feel the intensity and conviction from his best performances; and it's not even necessary to compare it with his classic action roles in Mission: Impossible or Top Gun. It's enough with remembering the work he brought last year in Oblivion, a sci-fi film with multiple ideas taken from better movies; even there, Cruise showed much more life and passion. By the way, the description of Oblivion also applies to Edge of Tomorrow: a series of burrowed concepts (the temporal loop from Groundhog Day, the mechanic suits from Starship Troopers 3: Marauder, the overwhelming combat from Saving Private Ryan, the cyclic drama from the "Cause and Effect" episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, etc.), but ready-made in a story with enough personality in order to earn an own identity, as long as we can excuse its most extreme ravings. In conclusion, Edge of Tomorrow deserves a moderate recommendation as an entertaining sci-fi film. However, it lacks of that "magical touch" in order to be something memorable.
I was quite interested in watching The Big Year because of its trio of main actors, but its subject sounded so strange that I didn't know what to exactly expect from it. And even though the "birding" (the hobby of observing birds) as the axis from the film ended up offering an excessively disperse narrative structure, I liked the film mainly because of the characters and the solid performances which bring them to life.An indispensable element in The Big Year is John Cleese's narration, which constantly orientates us about the secrets of "birding", at the same time it describes us the emotional state from the main characters. And Cleese's narration has that precise touch of sarcasm which makes us part of the humor, without openly laughing at the obsessed observers of birds.And then, we have the competent performances from Steve Martin, Owen Wilson and Jack Black, who feel credible and sincere in their roles. What is more, they are well complemented by Rashida Jones, Rosamund Pike, Kevin Pollak, Joel McHale, Dianne Wiest, Jim Parsons, Anjelica Huston, Tim Blake Nelson and Brian Dennehy. On the negative side, we have various disjointed scenes which couldn't harmonically unite the adventures from the three main characters. That's why The Big Year feels confusing and disorganized for part of the time.On the other hand, I understand the difficulty of bringing structure to a diffuse and casual competence which lasts for 1 year and doesn't follow a conventional sports format. That's why it was a good idea to focus the drama on the characters' nature and let the other elements fit around them anyhow they can (something which unfortunately rarely happens). What did fit was the subtext of the screenplay, because the "birding" could be easily replaced by other hobby, and the story would keep working as an interesting analysis of the obsessive behavior, which occasionally fills in some hole in our life, or is useful to compensate limitations in other aspects, or it simply designates a concrete task in a life lacking of course. So, I can give The Big Year a moderate recommendation more as a didactic experience than as a comedy. It's not very funny, I found it occasionally a bit dull, but it offers solid moments of reflection endorsed by interesting characters and the good performances from the whole cast.
I accepted to suffer the torture watching G-Force because I was impressed by the animation technique which had been shown on the trailers and because I wanted to see a movie in 3-D.On the special effect field,the movie fulfilled my expectations.However,this is a very bad movie which absolutely lacks of ingenuity,substance or intelligent humor.I guess that G-Force was born after the "creative" mind from a Disney executive who was trying to re-imagine para-military penguins from Madagascar.In order to avoiding the infraction of copyright,this hypothetical fool looked for another animal whose charm and natural tenderness would be funnily incongruous with a heroic and organized behaviour : guinea pigs.After that,this movie was added with a generic soundtrack,a few comedians to take the human roles,famous actors lending their voices in order to have their names on the poster and hiring a legendary special effects supervisor as a director,in order to guarantee the quality of the animation.In other words,another typical strategy from Disney,where the people are experts in selling commercial products but inept at the time of creating interesting stories.The most irritating things from this movie are the absolutely antipathetic characters,the human cast (making Bill Nighy to bring a boring performance is something very difficult!) and the huge number of fails from the screenplay.The only thing which adds a few points to this crappy movie are the amazing special effects.The animation is simply perfect : the integration of the characters to real scenarios surpasses anything I have seen so far (with the possible exception of Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen,which has some similar scenes to this movie,by the way),and the hair simulation is extraordinary.Director Hoyt Yeatman is one of those artisans of the special effects who are legend on the field but unknown to the general spectators.His brilliant work started on the prehistoric era of optical composition as a photography assistant (on movies like E.T.,Blade Runner or The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension),and after that,he evolved as a visual effects supervisor on films like the remakes of The Fly,The Blob and Mighty Joe Young,where he showed his skillful assimilation of the digital tools which on a big way replaced the practices from the "old school".Although he does not appear on the credits of the special effects field from G-Force,it is easy to note that he put some of his hand on them.I have to congratulate the studio Sony Picture Imageworks and Yeatman for the extraordinary work they did on the special effects.However,I think Yeatman should only stick to the special effects,because the direction of G-Force is horrible because of all the continuity problems and the inability for finding a good rhythm and tone.With the exception of the special effects,G-Force is a very crappy movie which does not offer any positive elements.I would not recommend this movie even for the children,because there are hugely superior family action movies (among my favourite ones,I can mention Sky High,The Incredibles and Spy Kids).
The Amazing Kreskin (real name: George J. Kresge) was a famous mentalist during the 70's and the 80's, whose appearances in many TV programmes brought him a strange level of fame, simultaneously respectful and mocking, which is similar to the one enjoyed by eccentric people such as Siegfried & Roy, Richard Simmons and Liberace.Nowadays, Kreskin's popularity significantly decreased, but the veteran seer (who denies any suggestion of "paranormal" powers) keeps being active, and besides of occasional personal presentations, he also offers seminars to members from the police force in order to improve their techniques of psychological and analytical investigation.The film The Great Buck Howard represents a tribute to Kreskin, and even though it alters many details (including his name), it is a vaguely autobiographical story of director and screenwriter Sean McGingly, who worked for Kreskin in the decline of his career.The result is a moderately entertaining film, but at the same time, I found it too bland and not very satisfactory.The performances (with two exceptions), the direction and the screenplay from The Great Buck Howard are so insipid that I could never get very compelled in this film.Besides, I think the characters are underdeveloped by the screenplay.Do not misunderstand...this film did not bore me.But McGingly's direction lacks of energy, and his apathetic style exacerbates the story, so we never feel the natural "push" from the narrative; we only have an insipid sequence of scenes with an adequate flow, but without a natural connection with each other.One of the main reasons this movie did not bore me is due to the solid performances from John Malkovich, who brings another one of his detailed works, full of affections but eminently human; and from the great Emily Blunt, who also feels spontaneous and credible in her role.Colin Hanks showed an adequate charisma and talent in other movies (Orange County specially), but his work in The Great Buck Howard feels too forced, something which is one of the biggest cons from the movie, since he has one of the leading roles, and I personally had difficulties in "connecting" with his character due to his performance.And the rest of the cast (with the exceptions of Malkovich and Blunt) also feels listless and uninterested in their characters.In conclusion, I think that The Great Buck Howard deserves a slight recommendation despite its various fails, mainly because it kept me moderately entertained.However, I feel that this film could have been better.
Director Werner Herzog's films have always interested me because they all are audacious experiments which challenge the spectator.Even when his experiments fail,they deserve respect,because they failed for being ambitious (for example,Nosferatu) and,as I have said many times,I will always prefer a movie which failed for going beyond its limits than another one which failed for not risking.Rescue Dawn,Herzog's most recent film,is another very interesting experiment with many good elements.First of all,the best element from this movie are the performances.Christian Bale makes a phenomenal work because he completely becomes on his character and he results very natural and credible.The great Steve Zahn and the underrated Jeremy Davies also bring perfect performances and they show an unusual level of intensity and credibility.Another good points from this movie are the slow tone,which helps us to perfectly know the characters,and the precise and detailed portrait of life in the jungle.Herzog achieved a good atmosphere in this movie.The fails I found on this movie are two.For one sight,it feels a little bit long on some moments and,for the other sight,some elements from the screenplay feel forced.It's not an excellent film and,in spite of that two fails,Rescue Dawn is a very interesting experiment which deserves a recommendation.
Director and screenwriter David S. Goyer must have thought the following before making The Unborn : "I will take the best scenes from my favourite horror movies and I'm gonna use them to join a story".The result will be seen by two different ways by the people : some will think that the movie is a honest tribute from Goyer to the horror genre; some others will think that the movie is a tiring parade of clich√©s unashamedly copied from better movies.At the beginning of the movie,I had the feeling my perception from this movie was going to be the second one; but when it advanced a little bit,Goyer's energetic direction,the enthusiasm from the cast and the exuberant screenplay made me see the movie from the first perception.The synopsis from this movie may sound similar to some Asian horror movies which round on twins and fraternal relationships (like Alone or A Tale of Two Sisters).However,although The Unborn shares some elements with that films,it is not a copy.During the first half hour,everything seems to be going to take us to a predictable route,but,after that,the screenplay takes some unexpected bearings.And,when we lead to the frenetic ending,the logic abandoned the story...but I must admit I liked Goyer's audacity very much,because he does not stop at anything for bringing us a very entertaining experience,at the same time he gets it.I ignore the veracity of Jewish legends and rites shown on this movie,but that elements add an additional level which makes the story from this movie richer.The direction from Goyer is more mature and polished than the one from his previous movies (Blade : Trinity and Invisible),and he could get a good atmosphere on this movie.The cast he directs is competent.On the leading roles,we have young actors who fit on their characters and are credible.On the supporting cast,we have solid performances from the excellent character actors Gary Oldman,James Remar and Idris Elba.The special effects from this movie are also very competent.If I had to summarize this movie,I would say the clich√©s are well used and they create a very entertaining combination of ideas,concepts and images which is not going to stay in the history of horror genre,but which works perfectly well for having a good time.Goyer has accumulated a good quantity of fervor and "geek" hate on his career.As a co-screenwriter of Batman Begins,Dark City and Blade,he has received critical and commercial applause.But,he has also been involved (only on the screen writing field,also) on crap like Jumper,Nick Fury : Agent of Shield and the intolerable The Crow : City of Angels.All this makes me think that,although Goyer knows and appreciates the fantastic genre,he does not always know how to balance the elements for telling solid stories.In The Unborn,he has achieved that difficult point,and although he has done better things on his career,this movie is a good addition to his filmography.
Paranormal Activity took the place of Saw as the annual franchise of the horror genre which, with every new movie, recycles a same formula changing some elements, or deepening more into the original story. And even though technically more sequels could be made (or prequels), I think that Paranormal Activity 3 should be the last film from this franchise.I appreciated the fact that Paranormal Activity 3 bothered itself to follow and solve the mystery of the ghost presence established in the two previous films. However, the explanation did not leave me very satisfied, nor I found it particularly ingenious (in fact, I think it is pretty much of a clich√©). I think that one of the best elements from Paranormal Activity and Paranormal Activity 2 was the balance they kept between realism and fantasy; the environment was very real, the characters were credible, and the supernatural manifestations suggested a sinister purpose, exacerbated by the fact that they were quite vague. Most of Paranormal Activity 3 kept that attitude...but when the moment of the big revelation comes, I felt that it crossed the line to a fantastic field which is not very compatible with the tone from this saga. In other words, I did not find it a well-founded explanation, but an improvised excuse.For the rest, Paranormal Activity 3 brings us more from the same: long takes of the family sleeping, minimum special effects and some shock scenes in order to break the suspense (I have to admit that some of those shocks produced involuntary laughs on me). And besides, the "home video" scenes have a lower quality, something which extracted definition and clarity to those moments in which we do not know what is going to happen. As for the actors, Lauren Bittner and Christopher Nicholas Smith bring adequate performances, even though their characters are a bit hollowly written. And the girls Chloe Csengary and specially Jessica Tyler Brown are quite credible in their roles.In conclusion, Paranormal Activity 3 is a film which offers more from the same, but which is inferior to the two previous installments from the saga, and which offers a quite disappointing ending, specially because it alters my perception of the two previous films. However, I can slightly recommend it because it kept me moderately entertained despite its mediocrity. Nevertheless, I think that the door from this saga should be closed down, unless someone finds the appropriate angle to bring new life to it.
I was very interested in watching Rango for being the first completely animated film from the studio Industrial Light and Magic. For more than 30 years, ILM has represented the undeniable vanguard from the special effects, and what precisely interested me before watching Rango was to see how they faced the new challenges of creating a movie from "the inside", when their job usually consists on complementing other filmmakers' ideas. And the result is a very entertaining movie which puts ILM in direct competition with other specialized studios, such as DreamWorks Animation, Sony Picture Imageworks and Animal Logic. And Pixar? Not really. Even though ILM achieved an impressive visual virtuosity which may be equal or even superior to the one from films like Up and Wall-E, its narrative expertise is not at the same level from Pixar.Among the things I most liked from Rango, I can mention the animated design from the characters and the voice works which bring them to life. I usually distrust of a cast composed by famous actors in an animated film, because the talent "in front of the cameras" sometimes does not extend to the drier and more solitary work of talking to a microphone to bring a character to life. Fortunately, it seems that Johnny Depp learned pretty much about that job when he provided his voice to Corpse Bride, because he brings a lot of energy and personality to the leading talkative chameleon. The same achievement also applies to the rest of the actors, from Ned Beatty and Alfred Molina to Isla Fisher and Harry Dean Stanton, without forgetting about Bill Nighy. And the excellent voice work from all those actors is perfectly complemented by the animated design from their characters; and I am not only talking about the technical aspect, such as the facial animation, the "shaders" and textures they are adorned with, but to the "soul" which evokes the combination of all those elements. Very good work from ILM, which makes me to have good expectation on their future animated work; well, big part of this achievement is undoubtedly thanks to director Gore Verbinski, but that does not demerit the work from ILM.Among the things I least liked from Rango, I have to mention the action scenes. Do not misunderstand me...they are very well planned and directed, and they include some of the funniest moments from the film (like for example, "The Flight of the Valkyries" during an air attack) but, like it happened in other animation films, I felt them a bit forced; like added pieces to something which was working very well, and did not require of any ornaments in order to satisfy some marketing requirement. What takes me to another point (which is positive by my point of view, but which could be perceived on other way by other people): I am not sure if Rango is a childish film. There is nothing vulgar or "inappropiate" in it (well, at least not too much), but the general tone of the story and the subversive humor seem to be more directed to the adults which will assimilate the most sophisticated jokes, the tribute to the western and the introspective scenes which go beyond of the typical homilies from this kind of cinema better.In summary, I had a very good time while watching Rango, and I can definitely recommend it because of its sparkling voice performances, fluid direction, solid screenplay and extraordinary technical aspects. Rango may not be a great movie, but I liked it pretty much, mainly because it made me to see that Pixar is not the only one which sees the potential of the animation to tell interesting stories and not only to sell toys.
We already know what to expect in a film from the Transformers saga: irrelevant characters, a superficial story, and extraordinary special effects which overwhelm the senses and distract us from the various weaknesses from the screenplay. However, I must say that, despite its mediocrity, I found Transformers: Age of Extinction superior to its predecessors, because even though the devastation and explosions were reduced a bit (specially comparing it to the mega-epic Transformers: Dark of the Moon), the screenplay is unexpectedly clear and easy to follow. Sure, the 165 -minute running time means that there's excessive filler and action sequences which are so inflated that they end up tiring a little bit, but even like that, I could notice a conscious effort to tune the narrative, and accompany it with slightly substantial characters whose motivation we can occasionally discern (it's a such a frugal compliment that it looks like an insult, but I'm saying it with a good intention). That doesn't mean Transformers: Age of Extinction is a very good movie; in fact, it occasionally makes some of the same mistakes of the previous films (overlong action, forced drama, irritating humor); and even though the screenplay is more congruent, it's not very credible either. In the past, we had already seen the collaboration of normal people with the North American army, whose unlimited resources were barely enough to combat against the Decepticons. But this time, everything depends on three or four incompetent individuals who somehow manage to be always on the appropriate place, miraculously surviving the attacks of super-powerful robotic creatures, and magically knowing what to do under circumstances which would overwhelm any other human being (for example, using exotic alien weapons, getting up and down from extraterrestrial spaceships as if it was the local bus, and casually infiltrating into high security labs). The romantic aspect from this film doesn't work at all; Nicola Peltz brings an atrocious performance, and Jack Reynor, as her gallant, lacks of any credibility and personality. On the positive side, Mark Wahlberg makes a good work in his character, bringing sincerity to his vacuous dialogs; and Stanley Tucci brings a decent performance as the obligatory mad genius. So, in conclusion, Transformers: Age of Extinction isn't the most epic film from the saga, but it's the least chaotic one from the narrative point of view. It keeps making some of the same mistakes (special effects instead of drama, bombastic music instead of emotions), and it never knows when its scenes should end; however, the balance between story and visual spectacle is better, and even Michael Bay's direction feels more mature and measured. So, even though Transformes: Age of Extinction isn't a very good film, I can slightly recommend it because it managed to keep me moderately entertained in general.
The Other Guys is the fourth time in which actor Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay work together. They obviously have compatible styles and a similar sense of humor...but the screenplays they work with have always been unfunny so far, and the most recent example is this diffuse satire of the cop films which fails both as a comedy and as an action film due to its repetitive jokes and uncertain tone.I understand what co-screenwriters McKay and Chris Henchy tried to do in The Other Guys, and I appreciate their intention of trampling the clich√©s of "the odd couple" and "good cop, bad cop" (among other ones) which infest the action cinema since they were established many years ago in films like Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop. Unfortunately, The Other Guys ended up having more cons than pros mainly due to its ambiguous focus and poor narrative cohesion, which become it into a collection of confrontations and insults vaguely connected by a weak story. And the worst thing of all is that The Other Guys ends up having various of the fails from the movies it makes a parody of. Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg bring enthusiasm to their characters, but they are so poorly written that they cannot do too much with them.In conclusion, I cannot recommend The Other Guys, because I found it completely unfunny as a comedy, and tedious as an action film. I personally prefer the film Hot Fuzz and the TV series The Good Guys and Chuck, in which we can find more consistent humor and satire of the cop sub-genus.
I am generally not very attracted by the marital dramas which seek to contrast the perfect appearances a couple shows to the society, and the vices and problems which lay in the center from their relationship.However, I decided to watch The Other Man because its cast included some solid actors (Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Romola Garai), and because its director was Richard Eyre, whose previous movies (Iris; Stage Beauty; and Notes on a Scandal) I liked very much.Unfortunately, The Other Man ended up being an unbearable movie, with a diffuse and very poor screenplay.The Other Man is based on a short story written by Bernhard Schlink (who is more famous as the author of the controversial book The Reader, on which an excellent movie with the same title was based), and I understand how the story can work better in the page than in the screen.Under the hand of co-screenwriters Eyre and Charles Wood, the arbitrary twists from the screenplay of The Other Man require an illogical structure and a confusing "secret" which is not very secret, and which seems the capricious trick from a screenwriter from the 30's.I do not have any inconvenience when an ambiguous narrative forces us to "fill the holes" from the story, but I find that strategy to be irritating when it does not offer an adequate basis to draw conclusions, and that is the case with The Other Man.So, when we lead to the uncertain ending, we only find frustration, instead of satisfactory (whether they are tacit or explicit) explanations about the incognitos generated by the lazy screenplay.The competent performances from Neeson, Linney, Garai and even Antonio Banderas are the only positive things I can say about this movie.Despite their work, I found The Other Man to be an uninteresting and hugely tedious movie in which I genuinely feel I wasted my time.As an alternative to this atrocious movie, I recommend you the brilliant The Ice Storm, which offers an immensely better interpretation of the family collapse.
Alien Trespass can be added to the increasing number of "retro" movies which pretend to imitate the cinematographic style from previous decades,evoking a more simple,gentle and free from cynicism time.Unfortunately,this movie makes the mistake of thinking that intentional anachronism will be enough for making it interesting or entertaining.That is like thinking a book will be better if it was impressed with a different typography...after all,the stylistic details do not care too much when the story is not solid.The story of Alien Trespass makes a tribute (or,better said,copies) to various classical sci-fi movies made in the 50's and 60's.Its basic structure is similar to It Came from Outer Space,but there are also some elements from The Day the Earth Stood Still,The Creeping Terror,The War of the Worlds and The Blob.Alien Trespass is not a comedy at the style of The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra; it is not a post-modern experiment like Grindhouse; and it is not a serious historical manifest like Prometheus Triumphant : A Fugue in the Key of Flesh.It is simply a recreation of the fantastic cinema which set the backgrounds of the genre,combining the serious and intellectual themes from literary science fiction with the accessible formulas from heroic cinema.The movies from this style I have liked are the ones which do not only posses nostalgic value and naif manufacture,but also a good story and some brief comments about the human condition.I did not found anything of that in Alien Trespass,so the final experience feels boring and very weak.Besides,I would have preferred the "retro" style would have gone much more far away.The sets,"props" and costumes are well designed,but a lot of elements make the movie to seem too modern,like the clean colour cinematography (which is also done in "widescreen") and the tri-dimensional animation in which the flight of the spaceship is shown.In fact,all the special effects do not fit with the movie.I think they should have been done on a more "classical" way,like the way they were done on the previously mentioned The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.I would not consider Alien Trespass to be a bad movie...I would simply say it is a pretty mediocre one for various elements,but specially for its complete lack of ambition and its lack of a solid story and entertainment value.I do not recommend it,because a boring movie does not deserve that.
I declare myself unable to write an objective review of the remake of Oldboy. The original film is a fascinating experience full of memorable scenes, excellent performances and an extraordinary ending. Why was a North American remake made? I have no idea. And why was it directed by Spike Lee, a filmmaker with a unique and personal vision? I don't know. It would have been easier to condemn this remake of Oldboy if it had been directed by an anonymous studio puppet; but with Lee behind the cameras of this piece of junk, it's more difficult to accept the laziness with which it was made. Supposedly, screenwriter Mark Protosevich didn't attempt to write a formal remake of the original film, but a new adaptation of the "manga" which inspired it. And I haven't read that comic, so I'm unable to evaluate which film was more faithful to it... but I honestly think that's irrelevant. The key points of the story are the same ones, and the changes feel artificial and forced, drawing the attention to themselves as "innovations" which can't remotely make us forget about the original film. Among the very few pros from Oldboy (2013), I can mention the performances from Josh Brolin, who makes a credible work as a man who lost big part of his life, and Elizabeth Olsen, who feels sincere as a nurse who feels compassion for the main character. Samuel L. Jackson is completely wasted in his character, and Sharlto Copley's performance as the main villain is atrocious, and the way his character was written, even worse. I would truly like to hear opinions of spectators who saw Oldboy (2013) without having seen the original film. Even though I tried, it was impossible for me to watch this remake with objectivity, so I recommend you not to waste your time in this pathetic movie. I think that not even the remake of Psycho was as bad as Oldboy (2013)... there's no need to say more than that.
I have never been a big follower of the TV programme Jackass, but I enjoyed the first film very much.And even though it was far from reaching the level of the first movie, I also liked Jackass 2.Now, Jackass 3D disappointed me; not only because I expected more from the 3D, but also because Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Bee Man and the other "artists" (or louts in a desperate search of fame?) seem to have lost the enthusiasm in risking their lives for delight of their fans.Do not misunderstand me...they keep risking it, and it is a miracle to find them still alive after 10 years of doing things like these.I simply did not find their stuff to be as spontaneous or subversive as in the first movie or as in some episodes from the TV programme.The scatological exploits or the "stunts" which show the limits of the human body in front of the gravity or the fury of some animals did not make me laugh very much.The moments which made me laugh were those surrealistic ones, such as the one where the midgets ask for a beer in a bar.So, Jackass 3D kept me moderately entertained, but I expected much more from it.Nevertheless, I think I can give it a slight recommendation only to those people who know what kind of things they can find in this movie, because this is not a film for sensitive or easily offended people at all.
I had low expectations before watching Battle Los Angeles, because even though I generally enjoy the "extraterrestrial invasion" sub-genus, the previous filmograpy from director Jonathan Liebesman includes the atrocious Darkness Falls (one of the worst films I saw in the '2000s) and the tedious The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. However, Battle: Los Angeles did not end up being as bad as I expected, and I found it to be mediocre but moderately entertaining.I understand what screenwriter Christopher Bertolini tried to do in here: a sci-fi movie which would not focus into the classic clich√©s of extraterrestrial invasions, but into the drama from the soldiers and their tireless fight spirit. In order to achieve that, Battle Los Angeles had to stay a bit away from the epic spectacle of massive destruction (such as the ones we saw in Independence Day or Skyline) and limit its attention into the experiences from characters who are only a little and almost insignificant part from the battlefield. Strictly speaking, Battle Los Angeles does not use the trick of the "homemade camera" at the style of Cloverfield, but that is the impression it brings, by putting us on the side from the soldiers in order to experience the terror, confusion and visceral intensity from urban combat, with few visibility, bad orientation and constant insecurity about the precedence from the next attack. In other words (and I know that many people have already made this comparison), Battle Los Angeles is like Black Hawk Dawn, but with aliens instead of Somalian rebels.The idea is good and it is not badly executed, but it has the same problem we have seen in many movies from this style: with one or two exceptions, the soldiers are generic cannon fodder who die according to the need of dramatic pauses to bring "deepness" to the shootouts and explosions. It is true that Battle Los Angeles took the job of defining the identities from these disposable characters...the rookie one, the one who is nervous about his marriage, the noble Nigerian doctor, etc. But that seems like lost time, because they all result absolutely exchangeable and anonymous during the battle, at the same time they scream the same tiring dialogs ("Move, move, move!", "Cover me!", "I'm on it, Sarge!"). Even the few ones we can identify (because they are interpreted by more famous actors) have to carry with their obligatory "personal dramas" in order to bring an additional sense to their actions. For example: the main character is tormented by an event in his past he must come through in order to make his "boys" to stay alive during the combat. And he is also about to retire.As for the science fiction angle, I think that Battle Los Angeles is totally irregular. All the elements, from the production design to the motivation from the aliens, seem a distillation of movies which had the same subject. I even seemed to identify scenes and dialogs from Independence Day (the soldiers watching a destroyed military base), District 9 (some moments of urban guerrilla), and...um...I think mentioning the other ones would imply spoilers. Besides, the logical abysses from the screenplay reduce the level of credibility and realism to the minimum. However, I think that Battle Los Angeles deserves a slight recommendation for what it is: a moderately entertaining but disposable combination of sci-fi and war cinema.
Despite the classic high school setting, The Spectacular Now isn't a juvenile comedy; and even though the screenplay (based on a novel written by Tom Tharp) fits into the coming of age formula, I don't think that would be a completely proper classification. Like director James Ponsoldt's previous movie (the devastating Smashed), The Spectacular Now employs common formulas in order to make an intense and deep character study more accessible. This film's main character, Sutter, (brilliantly played by Miles Teller) displays an interesting contrast of attitude and ideology, employing his charisma and affability in order to successfully navigate the difficult social setting of a school; but at the same time, he has deep insecurities and fears in his inside, which are making him sabotage (whether it's consciously or unconsciously) his future. So, when he meets Aimee (another perfect performance from Shailene Woodley, who had already left me astonished in The Descendants), Sutter doesn't know how to react, because the honest girl could equally represent his salvation, or the perfect excuse to make the same mistakes from yesteryear. Despite those dense themes, The Spectacular Now never feels excessively serious or solemn. On the opposite, the agile screenplay seasons the drama with moments of humor which naturally flow between the characters, bringing as a result a perfectly balanced and dramatically satisfactory story with a potent message which stays in our minds for a long time after the movie ends. Some people might find the main character too unlikable, narcissistic and not necessarily deserving of redemption. However, that's a calculated risk, and I think that one of the main reasons why The Spectacular Now works so well is because of that constant contradiction, along with the fascinating screenplay, magnificent performances and perfect direction. In summary, an extraordinary juvenile drama completely worthy of an enthusiastic recommendation.
Some people say that half of the work from a director consists of an adequate selection of actors, and I tend to think that when I watch a movie like The Town, whose not completely original screenplay comes to life thanks to a good combination of solid performances and perfect direction.So, what could have been a simple rehash of Heat ended up being a very interesting movie by its own merit, as interesting for the drama which is developed between the characters as for the action which keeps us on suspense.It may not be a great movie, but I liked it pretty much.The story from The Town (based on a book written by Chuck Hogan) looks like a copy of Heat, with the same premise of a talented bank robber who puts his career in danger when he falls in love with a woman, while a relentless policeman follows his track.Fortunately, there are various elements to bring The Town an own identity, starting by the setting of the story in a humble neighborhood in the underworld from Boston, where Gone Baby Gone, the previous (and first) film from Ben Affleck as a director, was also developed.Some people may say that he is typecasting himself with the dark side from his favorite city, but nobody claims that to directors like Barry Levinson, Woody Allen or Martin Scorsese, so I would simply call it as his recurrent subject.And besides of the setting from the story, I also liked the performances, from Rebecca Hall as the woman who never expected to fall in love with a thief, to Jon Hamm as the policeman who took the pursuit of the robbers as something personal.Even Blake Lively (more famous for her acting in the frivolous TV series Gossip Girl) brings a competent performance in a role which simultaneously takes advantage from her physical attraction and melancholic look.However, Jeremy Renner steals the show with his phenomenal performance.Renner proves that his perfect performance in The Hurt Locker was not by chance, because his work in The Town is equally intense and detailed.His mere presence produces inquietude because he transmits, without the need of words, the potential of violence and aggression which is hidden behind the friendly surface from his character.I am not a big fan of the Oscars, but I wish that the Academy remembers his performance in here at the moment of the nominations (or at least, I hope that his publicist has the appropriate connections to get him nominated).As for Affleck's work as an actor, he did not totally convince me in his role, due to the lack of expression from his face; in other words, he has the same exact aspect when he is declaring eternal love to his girlfriend than when he is in the middle of a terrible shootout with the police from Boston.What takes me to one of the best elements from the movie: the extraordinary action scenes.They do not have the Hollywood style, but they are filmed with such a brutality and realism that they produce a big impact, even though nobody makes stunts or violates the laws from Physics.In conclusion, I think The Town deserves a safe recommendation, because despite not being perfect, I definitely had a very entertaining time while I was watching it.With Gone Baby Gone and The Town, Affleck definitely proves that he is a much better director than actor.I hope his career as a filmmaker to continue like this, at the same time that would make us forget of the various atrocious films he has been involved in as an actor, such as Phantoms, Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, Pearl Harbor and Armageddon.
Like the recent The Legend of Hercules, Pompeii is a bad imitation of Gladiator, with a bland hero and an insipid romance which doesn't evoke any emotion. On the positive side, we have a good production design which portrays urban life during the first century on a credible way; on the other hand, the action scenes aren't very well filmed. However, the weak melodrama is mere filler until the epic eruption comes. And the special effects technicians didn't disappoint, because the destruction scenes have the precise balance of realism and exaggeration. Unfortunately, that doesn't make Pompeii a good movie, but a flamboyant reel of special effects I would undoubtedly want to see again on HD, in the comfort of my home... after having made fast-forward during all the boring scenes. So, I can't recommend Pompeii, because even though I liked its production design and special effects, it fails as a movie.
I do not want to even insinuate that Harry Brown is a copy of Gran Torino, because it is not.However, they both have elements in common, and therefore, it is pertinent to use that director Clint Eastwood's film as an indicator of the style and subject from Harry Brown: an old man apparently defeated by time, who is living in a modern world he barely understands, and enraged by the injustices surrounding him every day, until he finally decides to do something about it...something which can even surprise himself.The story from Harry Brown is not complicated or innovative, but I do not consider that as something negative in this case, because I liked to see a linear story which puts the emphasis on the characters and their emotions.And something which helps to Harry Brown a lot is Michael Caine's extraordinary performance.He shows he keeps having absolute control in his craft, and he brings a performance which is full of humanity and even subtle humor, at the same time he evokes facets which separate his character from the caricature urban vigilante we are used to see in this kind of movies.On the negative side from this movie, we have the fact that the screenplay feels occasionally lazy and ordinary.As an example, I can mention the character of "sensible female cop disrespected by her stupid male colleagues"; only the talent from actress Emily Mortimer rescues that character from the absolute clich√©.And I also have to mention the convenient coincidences with which screenwriter Gary Young solves impossible situations.Those improbable coincidences worked well in his previous movie (the brilliant The Tournament), but in the more solemn setting from Harry Brown, they feel out of place and they betray the realism the story needed.In conclusion, I will not deny that Harry Brown has various fails; but Caine's performance is so good that it lessens that fails to some point, and he is the main reason why I found this film to be interesting.So, I think I can recommend this film, despite the fact I did not find it to be completely satisfactory.I truly hope that, in the future, Caine will be offered more leading roles, because it is obvious that he still has enough dramatic weight as an actor to carry a movie on his shoulders.
I do not understand the reason of its sudden popularity very well, but I like to see the recent production of some movies with a medieval subject dedicated to show the brutality from that period combined with interesting stories. They might be a bit repetitive and come accompanied by their own variety of formulas and clich√©s...but I think they represent a pleasant variation after so many giant robots, tormented superheroes and criminal anti-heroes who have been hoarding the modern action cinema for a long time. Ironclad is an example of this new medieval cinema, and even though I did not find it completely satisfactory, it kept me entertained and I consider it worthy of a moderate recommendation.Ironclad is an action movie which revels in the brutality from its fights and in the bravery from its heroes, which uses clich√©s and archetypal characters from the action genre. For example, we all know the scene in which the bad guy uses the woman as a shield while he threatens to kill her; so, the hero makes a precise shot which kills the villain and leaves the woman amazed. In Ironclad we have exactly that scene (but with swords, obviously), as well as various others which feel pretty trite (another example: the woman tenderly cures the wounds from the hero, while the air fills itself with romance...ugh). Meanwhile, Paul Giamatti is so over the top as the villain that he borders the involuntary humor with his performance.As for the heroes, we have a collection of picturesque "misfits" with well defined personalities, from the templar who is tired of the war to the ex-soldier who only fights for the money (and the women), without forgetting the monosyllabic titan who compensates his short intellect with a big talent for killing his enemies. The main hero is interpreted by James Purefoy, who makes a very good work in his character, because he can express the remorse his character has without the need of words, at the same time he is in a much better histrionic shape than the one he showed in Solomon Kane, a film with points in common to Ironclad. Brian Cox also makes a solid work as the man who accepts the suicide mission with the pragmatic philosophy of the authentic patriot. On the negative side, Kate Mara is a bit irritating in her character, something which is exacerbated by the fact that the sub-plot about forbidden romance in which her character is involved feels unnecessary, and I think that those scenes could have easily been omitted.Despite my complains, I had a good time while watching Ironclad because of the well filmed action scenes, the interesting screenplay and some good performances.
I usually find the films which face the challenge of telling an interesting story in one location and with a minimum number of characters to be fascinating, such as Tape, Cube, Oleanna and, more recently, Buried.The difference from the latter is that it takes the premise to its maximum (or minimum?) point, because it invites us to spend an hour and a half in company of a man buried in a wooden box.I admit that I had a lot of curiosity in seeing this movie, but the film is so good that it even surpassed my expectations.Buried is not a horror film, but an incredibly tense thriller set in the context of the Iraq war.The main character is a truck driver for a civil company which helps to the army, until his convoy is attacked by Iraqi insurgents, and he later wakes up in the darkness of the wooden box.So, you do not have to expect supernatural elements or illustrative flashbacks: the movie simply offers the desperate actions from a man who must take the maximum advantage of the few available tools (including his mind) he has to survive.I found the screenplay from Buried to be great.The narrative is very well structured, and the good decisions from screenwriter Chris Sparling allow the gradual introduction of elements to bring shape to the story, so the spectator discovers the increasingly wide resonance of the situation at the same time of the main character.And if all that were not enough, Buried also offers a fresh angle on the implicit message it expresses about the Iraq war.The only thing I can say against this movie is that there are a few occasions in which Sparling makes some traps to bring more impact to the emotions from the main character.However, that minor glitch does not avoid me from enthusiastically recommending Buried, because I think it is a brilliant thriller with an excellent screenplay, solid direction and an extraordinary performance from Ryan Reynolds.
One month ago,a film which really irritated me was Marley and Me because of its cloying sentimentalism.I thought the film Hotel for Dogs would cause the same reaction on me.But although Hotel for Dogs is still forced and artificial,I liked it more than Marley and Me because the difference of both is their intention.While Marley and Me pretends to be a serious and realistic portrait of living with a dog,Hotel for Dogs only pretends being a childish fantasy without a pinch of seriousness,credibility and innovation.And I have to say that Hotel for Dogs fulfills its humble intention.The screenplay from Hotel for Dogs does not let things like reality appear on the story but it did not bother me that.As I mentioned,the film is a fantasy and it fulfills that intention.The humor of the movie is at the level of any TV programme from Nickelodeon and,although the film only provoked on me various smiles,the kids who were at the cinema laughed pretty frequently,so I have lead to the conclusion that the movie worked well for the kind of spectators it was made for.Besides,the characters from this movie are sympathetic.I had very low expectations for this movie but it resulted to be much better than I expected.It is not a great movie at all but I cannot deny I had a good time watching it.
It was absolutely refreshing to see an alien invasion movie which does not try to compensate a weak screenplay with excessive special effects and Hollywood stars. On the opposite, Attack the Block preferred to employ ingenuity, perfect direction and competent performances in order to make us believe the battle between fierce aliens and a tenacious teen gang.Director and screenwriter Joe Cornish initially presents the "heroes" as amoral criminals and social parasites, something which makes it difficult for us to empathize with them. But the trick is, of course, in taking advantage of the alien invasion for them to find the value, altruism or at least the geniality to redeem them and put us on their side. And I think that the movie shows the characters' evolution on a credible way, to the point in which I ended up empathizing with the characters.And besides of the narrative aspect being brilliant, Attack the Block does not neglect the visual aspect either. Needless to say that we will not see huge fleets of UFOs, nor epic battles between the army and the invaders; but the movie managed to generate suspense and makes us believe the ferocity from the creatures without the need of those ornaments. Speaking of which, I found the alien design simultaneously practical, realistic and creative, because they come to life with a minimum number of special effects. Besides, the cinematography increments the sensation of threaten and paranoia, while the abundant humor moments work very well.Despite a few questionable decisions from the screenplay, I liked Attack the Block very much, and I can definitely give it a very enthusiastic recommendation as an excellent alien invasion movie.
One of the best espionage books ever written taken to the big screen by the director of the excellent Let the Right One In? Sounds like a brilliant combination of talent and material, but there are also big risks at condensing a very complex story in only two hours of a film. Yes, in that aspect, the film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy requires an effort from the spectator, but whoever is willing to face the challenge will be rewarded with a fascinating, narratively hypnotic and intellectually stimulating experience.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is an excellent thriller made with an "old school" style, so that its paused rhythm and methodic narrative have more in common with The Quiet American and The Conversation than with the Bourne saga or the Mission: Impossible franchise. In other words, we won't find in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy chases on a high speed, martial arts fights, nor high-technology gadgets. Fortunately, there is no need for any modern ornament in order to keep us captivated with this story about mystery, paranoia and betrayal, in which we can constantly find new clues or details which enrich the screenplay and make us pay a lot of attention, because co-screenwriters Bridget O'Connor (1961-2010) and Peter Straughan generally leave us on a scene without explaining what is going on, or who the characters are. It's up to us to deduce the sequence of events and the ties between the characters, something which makes every discovery from the investigation doubly satisfactory.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy keeps a sober tone from the beginning to the end, and even though we are occasionally witnesses of violence and danger, director Tomas Alfredson handles those scenes as something casual, certainly tragic but common in the espionage world. And the best thing of all is that the complex story is only half of what makes this such an interesting film. The other half consists of gradually meeting the characters, guessing their secrets and discovering their nature, something which is as important to solve the mystery as the ambiguous clues the screenplay brings to us. And something which definitely helped to that are the perfect performances from the whole cast. Gary Oldman received deserved acclamation for his extraordinary work, but I think the rest of the actors is equally worthy of applause, highlighting John Hurt, Tom Hardy, Mark Strong and the great Toby Jones.The only thing I can say against Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is that, during a brief moment, the rhythm seems to go down a little bit. However, that minor complaint did not avoid me from liking this film very much, and I definitely bring it an enthusiastic recommendation, specially to the fans of the genuine espionage movies. As for Alfredson, I think Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy consecrates him as one of the best contemporary directors, and I will definitely be expecting his future movies with high expectations.
After reading so many very positive reviews about Crazy, Stupid, Love, I expected it to be a challenging deconstruction of the romantic comedy, or at least a version with enough intelligence in order to make it a remarkable film of the genre, reaching that weird combination of genuinely funny comedy and sincere and credible romance. And I have to say that Crazy, Stupid, Love certainly tried to achieve that; unfortunately, its occasional deviations from the known formula, as well as its unexpected encroachments of the habitual clich√©s made it not be very satisfactory, despite having some positive elements.The main problem from Crazy, Stupid, Love is that its screenplay feels imbalanced, due to the fact that it pays more attention to the "main" romances while it ignores the supporting characters, which were more interesting in my humble opinion. And something which does not help is that those main romances frequently loose the course and tend to repeat themselves due to their lack of a narrative impulse. For example: How many times do we have to see Cal making a fool of himself in the bar? We already understood it...he is weak and shy with women; let's move on, please. Meanwhile, even though I consider Ryan Gosling one of the best contemporary actors, I found him antipathetic and not very credible in this movie as the co-star. As for Julianne Moore, her huge talent is wasted with a weakly written character.On the positive side, Steve Carell brings a solid performance, even though it is not very different to his previous work. In fact, his character in this movie is a combination of the boring husband he interpreted in the comedy Date Night and the depressed loser from the drama Dan in Real Life...something which is not bad at all. That simply reveals the fact that Carell has the necessary range to go from the comedy to the drama with fluidity, as long as the road between both extremes does not go very far from his "comfortable area". Emma Stone also brings a competent work in this movie. However, my favorite performances from Crazy, Stupid, Love were unexpectedly the ones from Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton, at the same time that their "romance" (or romance attempt) was the most honest and emotive one from the whole film. Unfortunately, their screen-time is reduced, but they both share the best scene from Crazy, Stupid, Love, which was a breath of fresh air after the various missteps the screenplay had committed before it. Unfortunately, they both also share the WORST scene from the movie: a classic "big romantic gesture" which supposedly solves it all, when in fact, it made me angry for being such badly raised and executed.I was left with the impression that Crazy, Stupid, Love aspired to be a hybrid of Love Actually and American Beauty, and no wonder that it failed to achieve that very high ambition. However, at least it tried it, and because of that and the fact that it kept me moderately entertained, I think it deserves a slight recommendation. Nevertheless, I would have mainly preferred a better balanced and more credible screenplay, which did not fall into the clich√©s it tried to laugh at.
In the hilarious and provocative film Borat, comedian Sacha Baron Cohen used some sly strategies to put in evidence the stupidity, intolerance and hypocrisy from many sectors of North American culture.The result was wildly satirical and very funny, simultaneously working as a comedy and as a sharp social commentary.Now, with Bruno, Baron Cohen and director Larry Charles try to repeat their audacious artistic experiment, relying on the identity of an Austrian homosexual whose biggest dream is being famous, something which works as an excuse to examine the world of fashion, the hollow cult to being a celebrity and the homophobia which persists on big part from the United States.However, the result in Bruno is mediocre, and very below of Borat.One of the main problems is that the situations shown in Bruno do not feel natural or spontaneous, and as a consequence, the message looses force for lacking of ingenuity and honesty.However, the biggest problem in Bruno is that I did not find it to be very funny.Sure, I laughed on a few moments because of Baron Cohen's irreverence, but the homosexual routines and scandalous diatribes feel so forced that the negative reactions from the "victims" do not seem to be directed to Bruno's sexual orientation, but to his simple antipathy.Besides, the focus from the movie changes constantly, and there is not too much cohesion to justify the irregular twists.For example, at the beginning, Bruno provokes chaos on a fashion parade; he later laughs at Paula Abdul making her to sit on "Mexican furniture"; and he later has fun showing videos of his penis to a "focus group" which determines the TV programmes the chain CBS exhibits.How exactly can we move from that to a Bruno's visit to Palestine disguised as a Jewish rabbi? It seems that co-screenwriters Baron Cohen, Anthony Hines, Dan Mazer and Jeff Schaffer made a list of targets to aim their satirical weapons, but they never materialized a natural flow to take us from one point to the other.The result is a series of confusing sketches which, on a few moments, tire the spectator a little bit because of the lack of narrative cohesion.However, in spite of all those important fails, I can give a slight recommendation to Bruno because there are good intentions, there are a few solid moments and, in general, the experience is not boring.Nevertheless, I took a disappointment with this movie, since I expected much more after Borat and because of all the previously mentioned fails.
The impressive cast of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is like a "dream team" of British talent, and it was the main reason why I was interested in watching it. However, even though the actors bring excellent works, I found the screenplay predictable and weak, at the same time it could never "hook" on me emotionally.The plot synopsis of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel might sound as a modern fable about old people's value, but the film approached a more realistic focus, in which the problems aren't magically solved thanks to a change of scenery. So, like in the real life, the humor moments are combined with the tragedies and the remorse which obstruct the happiness and the satisfaction of the "golden years". I respect that sober focus, but the main problem is that I didn't find the main characters' dramatic arc very interesting, because they are too predictable (Will the racist old lady learn a lesson and defeat her prejudices against Hindi people?).In conclusion, I can give The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel a slight recommendation mainly because of the brilliant performances. However, I think that the screenplay should have been better polished, and that John Madden's direction should have shown more "spark".
After so many movies about noble teachers who inspire their students, it was already time for someone to reverse the roles. Sure, School of Rock excellently did it 8 years ago, but anyway...there is undoubtedly enough space in the damaged world of contemporary comedy for two movies with the same concept. Bad Teacher pretended to do that with solid actors and a talented director (Jake Kasdan, whose previous filmography includes the underrated Orange County and the extraordinary The TV Set); with both things, it might seem that the result will be good. But...one moment...I forgot to mention the screenplay! That does not matter. With actors who already proved their talent for the comedy, there is no need of a good screenplay, right? Obviously no, and that is the lesson this horrible comedy brings us.Bad Teacher is one of those movies which confuse irreverence with comedy. There might be some humorous potential in the scenes showing Cameron Diaz's character laughing at the poetries from a boy; or calculating the balance of huge operated breasts with her hands; or advising an ambitious girl to abandon her plans of being a President of the United States to become into a masseuse. However, the poor screenplay is not vulgar or irreverent enough to subsist with those cheap tricks; nor ingenious enough to create an interesting story as an endorsement of the humor. In fact, the story never totally "curdles", at the same time that it is very unfunny and tedious. And the worst thing of all is that co-screenwriters Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg did not have the courage to reach genuinely subversive levels in the interaction between the teacher and her students. I think that there was pretty much potential in fulfilling with the implicit premise of a "bad teacher", but due to the fear of the scandal in the real world, Stupnitsky and Eisenberg decided to self-censor themselves, wasting various opportunities of creating uncomfortably humorous situations. And I am not even talking about entering into a sexual field; just the political correction from the school environment, its obsession with the psychiatric medication and the low academic levels which are sinking the North American educative system would have offered enough satirical material to provoke laughs and also adding a social commentary to the movie.Besides, the characters completely lack of any charm. The main character is too antipathetic in order to ingratiate with the spectator. I generally like Diaz's work as an actress, but her character is so badly written that she cannot do much with it. Justin Timberlake is talented for the comedy (like he proved in his multiple appearances in Saturday Night Live), but the screenplay betrays him with an insipid and unfunny character. Jason Segel is adequate on his characteristic role of a loser, while Lucy Punch is correctly strident in her character.In conclusion, Bad Teacher is a pathetic comedy whose main fail is a badly written and unfunny screenplay. That fatal fail is the main reason why I hated this movie, and why I suggest you not to waste your time with it. If you wanna watch a great parody of the "inspiring teacher" clich√©, I recommend you the previously mentioned School of Rock.
In the mid-'80s, I discovered the TV programme At the Movies, in which two film critics (Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel) passionately talked about movies... all kinds of movies, from the most recent film directed by Federico Fellini to A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. I became an addict to that programme and I watched it every Sunday, even knowing that months, maybe years, would go by until I could watch some of the films they talked about. In the mid-'90s, I made a new discovery thanks to the then incipient Internet (or CompuServe, specifically): the film reviews written by Ebert, which were much deeper and more substantial than the 5 or 6 minutes he and Siskel could dedicate to a movie in the TV programme. I read hundreds of those reviews, and I think their best attribute was the casual and accessible style in which they were written. I allowed myself this indulgent autobiographical passage for two reasons: the first one is establishing the fact that I'm a big admirer of Ebert's; and the second one is because, honestly, I don't have much to say about the documentary Life Itself. It's a sincere and emotive tribute to Ebert's life, with contributions from many friends and relatives, including his tireless wife Chaz, his grandchildren, Marlene Iglitzen (Siskel's widow) and filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese (who was also a co-producer of this film), Werner Herzog and Ava DuVernay. Life Itself is definitely a good documentary, even though it occasionally gets too intimate that it seems to exploit the painful final months in the critic's life. But, after all, the genuine reflection of Ebert's life is in his writings, and that's all we need to understand the person. Knowing the dates, places and events of his biography end up being secondary when he compare them to the huge contribution to cinematographic critic, and that's why I prefer to remember his words instead of the chronological trivia or the details of his illness. Nevertheless, Life Itself is a solid documentary which will be undoubtedly appreciated by the fans of Ebert's; but if you want to understand the reasons of his importance, I suggest you to visit rogerebert.com, or watch Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, one of my favorite films, which also says a lot about Ebert and his love for cinema in each one of its shapes.
Every year, the Oscar voters include one or two independent films among the nominated ones for Best Picture; by doing that, they prove the fact that they aren't elitist and that they give the same opportunity to every strata of production, and not only to the big studios. This year, the film Whiplash was chosen as a sample of the generosity and democracy of the Oscars, and even though I don't think it deserves its nomination for Best Picture, I found it a very entertaining film with excellent performances and a solid screenplay. I would have personally preferred to see Nightcrawler in that "underdog" position. But, well... let's leave aside my cynicism and bitterness against the Oscars, and let's go back to the many pros of Whiplash. To start with, we have magnificent performances from two great actors who had been a bit underrated in the past: Miles Teller is practically initiating his career, but he has already shown huge talent. The other perfect performance is from J.K. Simmons, an acting veteran who shines in every thing he's involved, and elevates the quality from the projects he participates with his mere presence, either in cinema or TV (yes, I'm one of the few people who enjoyed the sitcom Growing Up Fisher, starred by him). The chemistry between these two actors is electrical, and brings intensity and emotional impact to many scenes. And then, we have the music. I'm not a fan of jazz, but the dynamism and energy of the musical numbers presented in Whiplash infect the spectator. In conclusion, I don't think I would consider Whiplash an excellent film, but I definitely think it's a solid one which deserves to be recommended.
I cannot believe it...a romantic comedy which made me laugh.Well, they may not were constant laughters, but I certainly laughed enough to have a good time watching Going the Distance, at the same time that helped me to ignore some of its clich√©s.And I have to mention that I also found an unusual level of honesty and realism in this romantic comedy, with which I ended up taking a pleasant surprise.Going the Distance is not a great film; however, the standards from romantic comedies tend to be so low that even the slightest effort to surpass them brings good results.In Going the Distance, I think the effort is on the details.The screenplay roughly covers the attraction between the main characters, and the obligatory conflict which puts their happiness in danger.But the screenplay complements that with various dialogs and unexpected moments which almost feel improvised, and which fit in the story very well.As for the fails, besides of some clich√©s, there are some elements which feel a bit out of place in the story.For the rest, the performances are adequate, and the film finds a good balance between vulgar humor and honest emotions.In conclusion, as I said on the previous paragraph, Going the Distance is not an excellent film, but it made me have a very good time, something which is very weird for me to happen with a romantic comedy, so I think I can recommend it.
Director Cameron Crowe is not very prolific, but he has a big number of followers thanks to the semi-independent sensibility he brings to common subjects of commercial cinema, from the "grunge" romantic comedy Singles to the "coming of age" in a rock-and-roll environment Almost Famous (by the way, my favorite film from his filmography so far). Now, we see him applying the same tactics in the family cinema with his most recent film, We Bought a Zoo, and the result is excellent.The story from We Bought a Zoo might sound manipulative and excessively sentimental, but the truth is that We Bought a Zoo is developed with elegance and dignity, with good moments of humor and dosing the dramatic scenes in order to emphasize the characters' evolution, and not to make us cry with easy narrative traps. We Bought a Zoo also includes a sub-plot of romantic tension between the main character and the responsible woman of the zoo, but it is enough subtle not to obstruct the flow from the screenplay nor to divert the focus of the story, so it is very satisfactory to see how the challenges presented by the restoration of the zoo fill in the "emotional holes" in the lives of the characters. And, sure, the animals themselves have an important participation with their antics, cunning and some unavoidable sad moments in order to remind us that "chasing the dreams" is not always magical and pleasurable.In the leading role, Matt Damon is totally credible as a common man whose overwhelming responsibilities are not enough to cloud his optimism, nor his determination to bring up his family. Scarlett Johansson also makes a solid work in a character which transcends the mere romantic interest in order to become the main character's conscience. The rest of the actors fit perfectly in their roles, from Elle Fanning to Angus Macfayden without forgetting Thomas Haden Church, who is very funny as the main character's skeptical brother.The only thing I can say against this movie is that a few moments feel a bit artificial. For the rest, I enjoyed We Bought a Zoo very much, and I definitely recommend it, specially to parents who are tired of noisy animated films; and to the fans of Crowe who needed validation after the badly received Elizabethtown (which I personally did not feel bad, but mediocre). I doubt the fact that Crowe will reach the height of Almost Famous ever again, but his career is definitely on the right track.
Couples Retreat is a horrible comedy, but its cast includes some solid comedians who provoke a few smiles due to their natural talent.But the rest of the movie is constituted by prefabricated situations, artificial emotions and the typical modern humor, which combines the clich√©s from uncountable sitcoms with a bit of bad taste in order to pretend "sophistication".Couples Retreat works much better as a touristic pamphlet of Bora Bora than as a comedy.The humor lacks of the enough audacity and ingenuity for it to really work; what is more, it is excessively obvious, predictable and lacking of soul.The characters are absolutely generic: the men are immature idiots; the women are weak and indulgent; and the supporting characters are unidimensional constructions.As for the cast, Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau and Jason Bateman made me to have the few smiles I mentioned on the first paragraph.Jean Reno, Peter Serafinowicz and Temuera Morrison are totally wasted.They are competent actors, but this movie wastes them as ridiculous jesters who only provoke irritation.And the female main cast is only used to show them using bikins, and occasionally contributing a sensible and conciliator comment.I cannot recommend Couples Retreat, mainly because it is a comedy which did not make me laugh.And on a movie from this genre, that is an epic fail for me.
Back in 1979, director Ridley Scott took a screenplay written by Dan O'Bannon (1946-2009) which was deeply inspired in the semi-classic film It! The Terror from Beyond Space to the big screen. The screenplay was simple...it was basically "haunted house" in the space; however, the film ended up reaching a totally unexpected level because of its solid performances, Scott's tense direction with a rigorous emphasis on the suspense, and an amazing production design. Needless to say that Alien is one of my favorite films, and an undisputed classic not only from the fantastic genre, but also from universal cinema. That's why I felt more distrust than enthusiasm when it was announced that Scott, after having declined the offer to direct the other films from the Alien saga, would finally return to that universe with Prometheus, which didn't pretend to be a direct prequel, but a tale connected to the original story by mysterious ties.Before watching Prometheus, I had the awe that co-screenwriters Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts would bring us an unnecessary dose of "ret-con" which would unavoidably tarnish the legacy from Alien and Aliens. Now, after having watched it, I realize that, effectively, Prometheus is 100% "ret-con", from the beginning to the end...but, you know what? That ended up not bothering me at all. Lindelof and Spaihts created a story which fits pretty well into the original mythology. Another thing which didn't bother me at all is the sudden change the story makes in its half, beginning as a languid and cerebral manifest of "exo-archeology" in order to later become a more traditional horror film, with abundant violence and grotesque moments of a delicious gore. The unexpected duality from Prometheus reminded me of the film Sunshine; they both begin with a serious and intellectual tone which promises to explore some deep ideas about humanity, and they suddenly change their course to a destiny which is incompatible with their sober beginnings. However, I think Prometheus did it better than Sunshine, specially when we consider its function as an integral part from a saga which refuses to be typecast into one genre or style.And then, we have the exceptional technical elements from Prometheus. The special effects are wonderful, and thanks to them, we have various scenes of an epic beauty and big imagination. The production design is also worthy of applause, because it's simultaneously elegant and practical, with elements from Alien and Aliens craftily integrated in order to remind us that everything is part from the same cinematographic universe. As for the actors, I don't have any complaints (with one exception). Charlize Theron is the most famous member from the cast, but her participation is relatively short and almost irrelevant, because there isn't too much need of a "corporative villain" when the true destiny of the crew is revealed. However, Theron made a decent work in her role. Noomi Rapace is a competent successor of Ripley, and Michael Fassbender makes a perfect work as a friendly and helpful android, even though he has a disturbing coldness in his look. The only member of the cast I didn't like is Guy Pearce as Peter Weyland. Better said, my problem isn't with Pearce's performance, but with his physical appearance. Seriously, what was the point of hiring a young actor and making him look older with painfully mediocre make-up? His appearance is so brief that it would have been more realistic (and cheaper) to hire an actor with the appropriate age, and not breaking the film's reality with such an obviously fake latex mask (Why didn't they put Lance Henriksen in that role? Such a good cameo would have provoked applause in the cinema -well, at least, I would have applauded-).In conclusion, I think Prometheus works very well as a thematic and visual prequel of the Alien saga; that's already enough reason to be satisfied with this movie. I can't deny that Prometheus has some fails...there are poorly defined characters who are simple "cannon fodder", logical jumps which don't make too much sense, and a general superficiality which doesn't feel appropriate in the context of a planetary expedition. Nevertheless, those fails don't avoid Prometheus from being a very competent film, and I can recommend it as a good addition to the mythology of Alien, Aliens and Alien 3 (yes, that's where I stop counting).
At first sight, Moon looks like an hybrid between 2001 and Silent Running, but I think it would be unfair to say that, because although it shares some narrative and stylistic elements with those two classics of the sci-fi genre, its story is totally different, and it presents fascinating ideas about human identity and the function of memory as the individual basis.Besides, this extraordinary film has brilliant moments of suspense, humor and a perfect atmosphere of loneliness.Revealing too much about the story from this film is forbidden, because big part of its attractive is on the gradual discovery of data and events which clear the situation from the main character, and they offer a fascinating psychological study.And something which helps that psychological study to be so interesting is Sam Rockwell's phenomenal performance.His performance is so credible and natural that the spectator feels identified with the events his character lives.I think this is Rockwell's best performance to date, something which means a lot when we contemplate the fact he has brought many excellent performances as interesting characters like, for example, the pusillanimous cowboy of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford or the multifaceted murderer from Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.I hope that his monumental performance in Moon will get recognized by the Oscars and other awards, because he would really deserve it.Even though we only hear the voice from Kevin Spacey, he also made a very solid job by finding the perfect grade of personality and indifference the robot GERTY needs to express the "feelings" trapped between conflictive directives which test its conscience.I also have to applaud the detailed models which represent the lunar surface, and the perfect cinematography which complements the illusion of scale and deepness.I liked to see that, on these times of visual excesses, someone decided to exploit the innocent tools from decades ago, corrected and improved by some digital touches.The best elements from this film are definitely Rockwell and the brilliant screenplay, which challenges our expectations and is based on fascinating ideas in order to express a deep and interesting message.In the tradition of the best science fiction, Moon combines intellectual challenges with an excellent narrative to bring a reflection on human condition.This film is a real masterpiece, and it is one of the best ones I have seen this year.So, Moon deserves the most enthusiastic of the recommendations, because it is hugely entertaining and it leaves us thinking at the same time.We need more movies like this one.
I have complained on a few times on those movies which combine genres in their desperate search for identity, and they end up diluting their impact because of their inability for finding a tone or appropriate style for the narrative.However, the film Up in the Air proves that the unexpected combination of comedy, drama and romance is able to work with the help of an intelligent screenplay, excellent performances and perfect direction, bringing as a result a great amalgam of a difficult classification, which is emotive without cheap sentimentalism, funny, and at the same time honest on its examination of the human behaviour and worldwide contemporary situation.The screenplay from Up in the Air (based on a book I have not read, but I am definitely planning to) has a very rich emotional tapestry and it creates fascinating characters, at the same time it avoids every dramatic clich√© and humor formula in order to achieve a perfect tone which challenges our expectations and makes us "plunge" into the lives of the characters, who feel simultaneously familiar but enough unpredictable for us to following with interest their development.George Clooney brings an excellent performance, and his involvement with the character is so deep that I never saw a film star, but his character, Ryan Bingham.Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick also bring perfect performances, and I would also like to mention J.K. Simmons, Jason Bateman, Melanie Lynskey and the great Zack Galifianakis, who bring solid performances, even though their screen time is brief.The narrative from Up in the Air is modern because of its flow and consistency, but also classic because it focuses on simple personal experiences, which do not require dramatic exaggerations or the typical "big gestures" we are accustomed to see on contemporary cinema.So far this century, director Jason Reitman has made three excellent movies (his previous ones were Thank You for Smoking and Juno), and I think that they have made of him one of the best contemporary directors, so I look very forward to his next projects.Up in the Air is an extraordinary film, which is hugely entertaining at the same time it leaves us thinking and has something to say.We definitely need more films like this one.
Before watching 12 Years a Slave, I feared it to be too depressing, and on some way, it ended up being like that. However, screenwriter John Ridley and director Steve McQueen show us the most terrible sufferings of the slaves without losing of sight the main character's internal fortitude, avoiding the film to degenerate into a hollow parade of pain capable of desensitizing the audience. The excellent performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor (one of my favorite actors, by the way) is focused on keeping the hope alive despite the adversity, and he achieved it with an amazing subtleness in the use of his expressions. The supporting cast also made a solid work, highlighting Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch and Paul Giamatti in characters which must have been incredibly difficult to play. On the negative side from 12 Years a Slave, a few scenes feel too sentimental, while other ones feel a bit forced. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend 12 Years a Slave as a very solid drama.
I remember that there was a time in which I was enthusiastic to see the phrase "A new movie from co-directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly!", but that was 10 years ago. The Farrelly bros. made four brilliant comedies in a row (Dumb and Dumber; Kingpin; There's Something About Mary; and Me, Myself and Irene), and back in that time, many people (including me) considered them as the kings of the modern cinematographic comedy. However, it seems that the time diluted the sense of humor they showed in those four movies, or maybe, the commercial success impulsed them to "evolute" to a less coarse and more emotional style (which would eventually be usurped by director Judd Apatow and his imitators). Anyway, I found the films they made after Me, Myself and Irene to be insipid comedies with trite scatological humor and cloying emotions. Now, Hall Pass is another mediocre comedy in their filmography, but I found it to be much better than their two previous films (Fever Pitch -2005- and The Heartbreak Kid -2007-).The screenplay from Hall Pass is too predictable and a bit weak, but that is partially redeemed by some good moments of reflexive comedy. On the other side of the coin, we also have too many apparatus scenes of slapstick and vulgarity which feel too forced. Something which was done well by the Farrelly bros. in Hall Pass was filling some supporting roles with exaggerated characters which satirize very particular strata from North American society. I have to say that the absurd version of the perfect suburban family led by the characters Ed and Britney made me to have some laughs, something which is also a merit of the competent performances from Rob Moran and Lauren Bowles; and I also liked the character of the classic old-young man, which is well interpreted by Richard Jenkins.I think it would have been more interesting to see an interpretation of the story told by Hall Pass made with the style of films like Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice or An Unmarried Woman, but well, I guess that the political correction has became more important for the Farrelly bros. than the narrative irreverence, so we can expect in here the trite moral lessons, various illogical jokes and forced comic rudeness which already characterize the work from these filmmakers. At least, Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis managed to take the maximum advantage out of the mediocre screenplay by bringing good performances, something which also applies to Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate as their characters' wives. In summary, I did not like Hall Pass very much, but at least it did not bore me and it occasionally made me laugh, something which makes it worthy of a slight recommendation.
The only time I read the comics of Ghost Rider with a certain frequency was during the mid-2000s, when it took part of the "Marvel Knights" line, which pretended to be a collection of titles destined to "mature readers", with more violent, raw and sordid stories than what we are used to find in Marvel's "normal" comics. However, I quickly abandoned them, because I comprehended that Ghost Rider didn't need more violence nor profanity, but writers which could find an appropriate angle in order to exploit the character's (doubtful) potential. Unfortunately, the same can be said about Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, because despite the intensity of the action and the main character's ferocity, the screenplay lacks of narrative cohesion, and it only brings us a parade of situations in order to display bizarre camera angles, slow-motion stunts and extraordinary special effects. Nevertheless, I have to say that the film managed to keep me moderately entertained.The screenplay of Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance consists of a modular adventure with a "mcguffin" (a kid in this case) as the plot's detonator, and with an anti-hero searching for redemption in order to justify the presence of action scenes of an increasing complexity, but null suspense. I liked the films Crank and Crank: High Voltage, in which co-directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor forged their frantic visual style, but the formula they had employed in those films doesn't adapt itself very well in the world of super-heroes, because they couldn't generate any connection to the spectator in here. What is more, I wasn't interested in the main character's suffering, nor in any threaten from the villain.On the other hand, the magnificent cinematography and brilliant special effects from Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance were the main reasons why this movie kept me moderately entertained, and why I consider it worthy of a slight recommendation, even though it's a bit painful for me to say that, because I'm generally against the "style over substance" mentality. But when the "style" is so overwhelming, I have to accept an ideological defeat. Pity that those impressive technical aspects were included in a film with a trite and not very interesting screenplay.In the leading role, Nicolas Cage shows conviction and energy. As for the rest of the cast, Idris Elba seems to be there only for the paycheck; Ciar√°n Hinds is absolutely insipid as the villain; and Violante Placido is only employed as a pretty face. Nevertheless, the technical aspects are the main stars, and as I previously said, the reason this film isn't boring is mainly because of them.
I will say it from the beginning: Crazy Heart is on many aspects a copy of the brilliant film The Wrestler.Both follow a famous mature man in the decline of his career, who is defeated by life and survives thanks to the nostalgia, until a new romance renews his wishes of living and inspires him to look for redemption.I do not know if that similarity is due to the chance or the marketing, and I frankly do not care (to be fair, Crazy Heart is based on a novel written 30 years ago).Whatever the way it is, Crazy Heart is mediocre, but moderately entertaining, and it offers three great performances.Leaving the comparisons with The Wrestler aside, the story from Crazy Heart tends to ramble and loose the focus.However, we are fortunately in company of Jeff Bridges in the leading role, and his magnificent performance keeps afloat even the most insipid scenes (How many times we must see him vomiting in order to establish the fact he is an alcoholic?).And, besides of Bridges, we have Robert Duvall and Maggie Gyllenhaal, two excellent actors who show credibility and conviction on their roles.However, Colin Farrell is absolutely out of place with his performance in this movie.One of the most important fails from Crazy Heart is that I did not found the romance between Bridges' character and Gyllenhaal's very credible.I said I would not keep making comparisons, but on occasions like this one, that is unavoidable.In The Wrestler, we had two "broken" people, who had deep emotional scars which on some way made them similar people and also justified their mutual attraction.In Crazy Heart, we have a modest and intelligent reporter falling in love with a finished alcoholic musician.The problem is that the screenplay cannot establish the connection between both characters on a plausible way, so big part of the posterior drama simply feels as a whim from the screenplay.Crazy Heart is a mediocre movie, but the performances from Bridges, Gyllenhaal and Duvall made me to be moderately interested, and I think I can give to it a slight recommendation because of that.However, I cannot deny that the movie lacks of enough deepness and substance, and that is the main thing which makes a bland experience of it.
The "film" Killers combines the worst elements from romantic comedies with the most hateful vices from modern action cinema, and the result is a genuinely execrable and repulsive experience I recommend you to avoid like a plague.Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl found pretty much success in TV, but in cinema, they have mostly been involved in no quality projects.I think that Killers is the worst film Kutcher has ever been involved in...something which is a huge insult when we contemplate the fact that his filmography includes atrocities such as A Lot Like Love and Just Married.As for Heigl, she had also participated in bad movies, such as 27 Dresses and The Ugly Truth...however, Killers is much, much worse than those ones.The worst problem from Killers is its absolute ineptitude to provoke any emotion.It is not funny, it does not generate any suspense, and I was only waiting for the holy end credits to come, which are the authentic heroes from this film.The screenplay is a pathetic combination of fragments from Mr. and Mrs. Smith, various sitcoms and the weakest "funny" James Bond movies (in which Roger Moore made a fool of himself).Director Robert Luketic made a horrible work, specially during the action scenes, because he felt so insecure with the fights and shootouts that he had to appeal to the trick of the camera with confusing movements and abysmal edition in order to create the illusion of action.So, in conclusion, Killers is a vomiting and atrocious film, and one of the worst ones I have seen this year.As I said on the first paragraph, I suggest you to avoid it at any cost.
Back in 2001, when Shrek was released, the studio DreamWorks Animation loomed to be an authentic rival of Pixar, with the potential of even surpassing it for not being subject to the marketing whims from Disney.However, almost 10 years later, it is clear that Shrek was an exception, because even though DremWorks made a few good movies after Shrek (Shrek 2, Shrek Forever After, Over the Hedge and Kung Fu Panda), I think that most of the films produced by that company range from mediocre to horrible.But the studio keeps trying, by copying formulas and always trusting that the abuse of references to the popular culture will rescue them.Megamind is another bad animation movie from DreamWorks.Despite the solid voice acting, Megamind did not make me laugh even once.The actors make their best to bring the forced and lacking of any spark dialogs to life, and the few commentaries which are barely likable only stress the lack of originality and ingenuity from the pathetic screenplay.Co-screenwriters Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons tried to make a tribute to the world of the comics, and the references to the archetypes which abound in the super-hero movies are not absent; however, the simple repetition of clich√©s is not a synonymous of real humor.In fact, with so many interesting "deconstructions" of heroes and villains (from The Incredibles and Despicable Me to more mature movies such as Defendor and Kick-Ass), Megamind feels redundant and unnecessary...something which could have been ignored if the film had been funny; but well, I already spoke about that.And if you think that this is only the typical reaction from an embittered old man like me, I have to add that the whole cinema was alarmingly silent, even during the most elaborated "comical" sequences.And no, not even a soundtrack full of classic rock was enough to dispel the unlikeable air of corporate committee which is noticeable in every scene of Megamind.On the positive side, the animation is good; however, any visual attribute is immediately forgotten when we face the poor story.I lost the count of all the times I looked to my watch during the "exciting" final battle, because I was desperately waiting for the holy end credits to come.And I was surprised when I checked that the running time of Megamind is only of 95 minutes, because I truly felt that it was near the two hours.In conclusion, Megamind is a disastrous hybrid between Despicable Me and The Incredibles, but without the pleasantness from the first one or the ingenuity from the second one.In other words, Megamind is a badly done copy which came too late and with a boring and insipid screenplay.In summary, another false move from DreamWorks, at least in my humble opinion.
Lucy is a spectacularly ridiculous but very entertaining film which is the best one Luc Besson has directed in a long time... even though, considering all the missteps he has had since he returned from "retirement" 9 years ago, that isn't a big compliment. For better or for worse, Lucy employs Besson's habitual style, combining abundant action, a creative visual style and an accelerated rhythm which, in this case, distract us from the parade of nonsense and inconsistencies from the screenplay (Hasn't the "we only use 10% of our brain" myth already been discarded?). Fortunately, this film counts with solid performances from the whole cast, starting by Scarlett Johansson, who brings charisma and credibility. Morgan Freeman brings his usual conviction, serene presence and persuasive voice, while Choi Min-sik and Nicolas Phongpheth bring quite a personality to their villain roles. Besides, with only 89 minutes of running time, Lucy ends as quickly as it began, it never gets boring at all and it leaves us with some philosophical reflections I found interesting. Lucy is not a great film, but it entertained me very much, and I recommend it as a pleasant distraction which doesn't require us to pay too much attention. And besides of that, I like to see Besson back on the right track in his career as a director.
For some reason, the films about "body switch" had always been a province of the childish (or juvenile) cinema, but this time, The Change-Up tries to transplant that classic formula to the vulgar and scatological field of the modern adult comedy, with a mediocre result. However, even though the main characters in here are two immature men (instead of mother and daughter, father and son, young man and old man, etc.), we can be sure that the lessons will be exactly the same, even though in order to learn them, it is necessary to eat excrement from digital babies, seduce the secretary, and participate in a "lorno" (light porn) flick. I wish the film was as funny as it sounds.The two previous films from director David Dobkin were the tedious Wedding Crashers and the atrocious Fred Claus. The Change-Up is better than those two films (something which is not big compliment), because it creates a credible friendship between two men with different but compatible personalities, there are some moderately funny moments and the fleeting dramatic moments feel well executed. However, on the other hand, the film show few narrative ambition, many excessively predictable jokes and improbable situations, not exactly because of the implicit "magic" on the premise, but because the supporting characters have to act like authentic idiots in order to let the idiot main characters continue with their chain of bilge without worrying about bulky logic or inconvenient credibility.Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds bring charisma to their performances, but I think that the individuality from their characters should have been better handled, independently from the actor who represents them. While I was watching The Change-Up, I remembered the remake of Freaky Friday, where Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis found the exact tone to mutually interpret each other, to the point in which we stopped watching the actress and accepted the character. However, Bateman and Reynolds simply change their clothes and say more (or less) rudeness according to the character they interpret. I think that this film would have been better if it had employed two main actors completely different with each other, in order to accentuate the "exchange" with genuine acting. For example, imagine if instead of Bateman, we had Jonah Hill; or if instead of Reynolds, Chris Rock would have been hired.Despite its mediocrity, The Change-Up kept me moderately entertained, something which makes it worthy of a slight recommendation. However, I have to say that there are much better adult comedies, and much better films about "body switch" than this one.
Fantasies inside fantasies inside fantasies...that is basically the structure from the mediocre but moderately entertaining film Sucker Punch. For better or for worse, this is the first time in which director Zack Snyder could take an original screenplay to the big screen (after the remake of Dawn of the Dead, the film adaptations of the comics 300 and Watchmen, and Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, which was based on a book). And curiously, the "original" screenplay from Sucker Punch is a distillation of modern video games, video-clips and sensual heroines taken straight from the most trite "anime". That idea might sound attractive on the paper, but due to the lack of a good narrative endorsement, the final result is a hollow and not very satisfactory film.Those who have seen the trailers of Sucker Punch might be asking to themselves how the samurai robots, Nazi zombies and biplane (and triptan) airplanes fit into the story. So, I do not think it will be a spoiler to reveal that that is part of the imaginary worlds the main character travels to, where her battles in order to survive to her experiences into a madhouse are expressed by elaborated action sequences full of special effects and attractive images. The problem is that the existence or meaning of those imaginary worlds are never adequately justified, so they only seem like an arbitrary trick from co-screenwriters Snyder and Steve Shibuya for creating delirious scenes with the only objective of satisfying the "geeks". And even though I moderately enjoyed that scenes, I need more than that in order to feel myself fully satisfied with a film.I also have complaints about the function of the music in Sucker Punch. The previously mentioned action sequences round on specific songs, and most of them are covers, remixes or mash-ups of songs I like very much (Army of Me, Sweet Dreams, Tomorrow Never Knows, White Rabbit and Where is My Mind), but even though they work well in order to emphasize the rhythm and atmosphere from the imaginary worlds, the result is more similar to a collection of expensive video-clips, fragmenting the narrative flow from the movie and constantly "taking us out" of the story, which already has various forced elements by itself.Anyway, I appreciated the work from the actresses, not only when they perform stunts or when they fight against robots, orcs and dragons, but also during some dramatic moments. Her performances are competent for what the screenplay required, and if there are a few occasions in which they do not work, I would not blame Emily Browning, Vanessa Hudgens, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Jamie Chung or Carla Gugino, but to the screenplay, which does not bring them enough material to develop some of their characters' emotions. The one I did find as a weak spot from the cast is Oscar Isaac, who feels insipid and lacking of any screen presence as the villain. Maybe, Snyder did not want to distract us with a very famous actor in that role, but due to the very superficial development of that character, he should have may used someone with more dramatic weight (imagine Brad Dourif or Lance Henriksen in that role...).But well...as I said on the beginning, Sucker Punch kept me moderately entertained after all, so I think it deserves a slight recommendation. I would have mainly wished more ingenuity in order to "stick" the eclectic elements from the film, in order to make the movie a coherent and fluid whole, instead of being a juvenile soap-opera occasionally interrupted by video-clips and apparatus "cut-scenes" from a video game.
I went to see Twilight without any acknowledge about the popular book the movie is based on and with low expectations,because the commentaries and announcements I had heard made it seem as a simple rip-off of Buffy : The Vampire Slayer but without its action,humor and intelligence; in other words,I expected a tragic and forbidden romance,full of love declarations but condemned to the failure because of the differences between the lovers.But,when I went out of the cinema,the movie was much better than I expected and it resulted to be an interesting and entertaining experience,although it is nothing special.As I said,I have never read any of the books from this saga written by Stephanie Meyer,so I cannot judge the fidelity this film has to its original source.Director Catherine Hardwicke made a good work because she could combine romantic fantasy and juvenile adventure with touches of suspense and soft horror in entertaining proportions.But,this film has some important fails.For one sight,it is obvious some scenes worked better on the book than in the screen.For example,the skin of the vampires which makes them look like mimes; the reaction they have against the Sun.Things like that do not work well on the movie.Plus,I felt the movie is a bit excessive with the sentimentalism on some occasions.And,although it kept me entertained,this film has nothing special to make it memorable.I think I can recommend Twilight because I had a good time watching it,although the final experience was not too memorable.
I don't know how necessary this remake was, but something is true about it: the perfect director was chosen to take to the big screen author Stieg Larsson (1954-2004)'s famous book The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, whose sordid elements could have degenerated into a feast of excesses; but under David Fincher's brilliant direction, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) keeps a sober and controlled tone which slowly increases the tension until leading to a memorable ending.As the first part of a trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) takes its time to establish the characters, not only in their attitudes and nature, but also on the very different contexts which round them; and even though the central mystery is very interesting, the best thing about this film is gradually meeting the main characters, contrasting their methods, personalities, and the reactions they have in front of the discoveries of the investigation. And then we have the excellent performances from the cast, starting by Daniel Craig, who displays the ability to "think on camera", letting us to see in his eyes and expressions all the things that are going through in his character's mind. Rooney Mara makes an extraordinary work as Lisbeth Salander, which is in my humble opinion, as intense and credible as the one brought by Noomi Rapace in the original film. The supporting actors also bring perfect performances, highlighting Steven Berkoff, who makes a simultaneously subtle and detailed work; and Yorick Van Wageningen as Lisbeth's legal guardian, a disgusting character the actor could humanize despite his horrible actions.As for Fincher, I hugely enjoyed the way in which he displays meticulously planned scenes, but without extinguishing the spontaneity of the performances nor the tension from the story. For fans of the book or the original film (like me), I have to say that there are some substantial changes in this new interpretation, but that does not make this movie bad at all; it just makes it different. And I also have to warn that the film might feel excessively slow for the people who expected a typical Hollywood thriller full of action and violence. I admire the fact that Fincher had the conviction of showing the characters in a passive reflection, or thoughtfully looking at the computer for long whiles...but all the audiences might not accept the challenge of paying attention to every single detail from the investigation, and they might be disappointed by the fact that the movie refuses to present us the story pre-digested to our comfort.In conclusion, I enthusiastically recommend The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) because, independently from the book and the original film, I think it is an excellent film on its own right, which kept me fascinated and very entertained the whole time because of its big number of attributes.
I know that the main "hook" for many people to watch The Woman in Black is the presence of Daniel Radcliffe in his first important role after the conclusion of the Harry Potter saga, but I was more interested in watching a new production from the Hammer Films studio, which finally went back to the Gothic horror which made it famous many years ago. And they certainly chose the perfect material in the book The Woman in Black (written by Susan Hill and previously adapted to the TV and the theatre), because it counts with all the elements of supernatural horror, endorsed by an interesting story which feels familiar in various aspects, but not trite.James Watkins' previous work as a director and/or screenwriter includes the mediocre horror films Eden Lake, My Little Eye and The Descent: Part 2. However, The Woman in Black (which he only directed) is very different to those films, in shape as well as in substance, because it is completely distant to the gore in order to focus on the suspense and the "simmer" tension, something Watkins achieved very well thanks to the good atmosphere he created, overflowing of shadows, fog and elegant compositions which make us suspect about what is hidden in the limits of the shot. Besides, Watkins shows patience and discipline in order to let the scenes be developed at their own rhythm; that makes the drama to gain as much importance as the frequent shocks, which made me jump in more than one occasion.Having said that, I have to mention that The Woman in Black also includes some cheap scares which did not make me jump. In fact, I think that the moments in which The Woman in Black works at its best are the almost silent ones, which suggest instead of showing.Nevertheless, The Woman in Black is a very entertaining horror film with a well written screenplay, generally solid direction and an unexpected ending which fits very well. As for Radcliffe, I think he brings a decent performance, mainly because he efficiently transmits the depression of his character. So, in conclusion, I can recommend The Woman in Black, and in the context of this new phase of Hammer Films, I liked it more than Let Me In and The Resident, but less than Wake Wood.
I started watching Soul Surfer with the hope of finding well filmed surf scenes and beautiful Hawaiian landscapes, in order to compensate what would surely be a bland story about semi-religious inspiration. To my huge surprise, I ended up liking the movie very much, not only because of the genuinely touching story it tells (which is based on a true story), but also because of the brilliant performances from the whole cast and Sean McNamara (who gets redeemed for having made the execrable movies Raise Your Voice and Bratz)'s solid direction. And if all that were not enough, we also have exciting surf sequences and the majestic views from the Hawaiian coasts.On its most basic level, Soul Surfer might seem as a continuation of those "dramas of the week" which were quite popular on the TV from the previous century. Besides, the Christian ideology peaked by the story threatens to making the movie an educational pamphlet of a difficult digestion. However, co-screenwriters McNamara, Douglas Schwartz, Michael Berk and Debora Schwartz did not let that to happen, because they kept the religious angle as a peripheral element whose function is not convincing us of anything, but bringing a context to the main character's indomitable spirit and the faith from her parents (and her entire family), who never opposed to her passion, even when she faced impossible obstacles. So, the screenplay avoided to stagnate itself into a "technical" superficial level (which is interesting by itself...imagine practicing surf with only one arm!), in order to dedicate equal time to the main character's internal conflict. Her emotional journey is amazing, and it takes us from the initial depression of not being able to do things which seemed easy before to the passion with which she analyzes and defeats any obstacle which appears on her road.Along with that fascinating screenplay, what impulses Soul Surfer with the biggest strength is the extraordinary performance from AnnaSophia Robb. Her work finds the exact emotional range to make the impact from the accident, the temporary depression and the tenacity with which her character undertakes her "rebirth" absolutely credible. Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt also bring perfect performances as two comprehensive parents with the impossible task of supporting their daughter and at the same time protect her from her own enthusiasm. And Kevin Sorbo also makes an excellent dramatic work; I liked to see him in a "normal" movie, in which he does not have to wield swords nor fight against aliens poorly created by computer.The studio Engine Work made a magnificent work at creating the illusion of the amputated arm. Their achievement is so perfect that I quickly forgot about that that was a trick. So, in conclusion, Soul Surfer is an excellent movie which deserved a very enthusiastic recommendation because of all the positive elements I previously mentioned.
I did not hear the music from the group The Runaways until the early '80s, various years after its dissolution. However, I do not think that the nostalgic element is necessary in order to enjoy the irregular but energetic movie The Runaways, or to appreciate this musical group's historical importance, which broke barriers and opened the road to many other female interpreters who had not previously dared to venture into the male chauvinist and exclusive world of rock and roll.Independently from its historical veracity, the film The Runaways fulfills with the purpose of portraying the members from the rock band as the classic rebels and outsiders who would have been condemned to a life of oppression if the destiny had not helped them to find a common voice to express their frustrations. I guess that the creation of a hard rock group integrated by women could be considered as important to the feminist movement from the 70's, but screenwriter Floria Sigismondi (who was also the director) avoided tarnishing the story with indulgent political platforms. On the contrary, she made the good decision of simplifying the narrative and focusing into the harshest human impulse as a way to push the story, something which is also noticed in the sober visual style she used as a director, with a colour palette which is reminiscent of the cinema from that moment. The movie has a good level of energy up until the last half hour; the rhythm looses speed and the predictable ending takes too long to come. Sure, I cannot blame Sigismondi for submitting herself to the truth; the problem is that there are too many movies about artists who are tormented by the success which follow the same dramatic ark, so as a consequence, the last half hour feels a bit tiring.On the positive side, I can mention Dakota Fanning's performance, which besides of being credible in every scene, perfectly transmits a shy but potent teenage sensuality, and it leaves us with the disturbing sensation of being witnesses of the corruption which was made to an innocent girl who is blinded by her enthusiasm and inexperience. Kristen Stewart gets a bit darkened by Fanning, but her performance is solid on her own merits. The actresses who interpret the other members from the rock group are reduced to being simple extras who occasionally react to the surprises from their new life.And that is one of the biggest complains I have against this movie. The screenplay from The Runaways is based on the book Neon Angel, written by Cherie Currie (who was the group's singer), and I think that justifies the fact that the story is principally told from her point of view; and since Joan Jett (who was the group's guitarist) was one of the producers of the film, I think the fact that the dramatic knot is based on the volatile relationship between singer and guitarist is natural. However, that is not enough reason to ignore the other members of the band, even to the point of omitting their names when the typical epilogue of "Where are they now?" comes. Sure, Sandy West quickly abandoned the scenarios to give drum lessons, and the bassist "Robin" is a fictitious character who combines the various characters who filled that position along the years. However, Lita Ford found a moderate success as a soloist during the 80's; and Micki Steele was co-founder of The Bangles. Did not that at least deserve a mention? I think that the lack of importance which is given to those members of the group is not something positive in a movie which pretends to be a biography of a musical group.In conclusion, The Runaways is very far from reaching the sublime heights of The Commitments, Almost Famous and The Doors into the sub-genus of "musical biography" (whether it is real or fictitious), but I liked it anyway, and I think it deserves a recommendation mainly due to Fanning's and Stewart's performances, the fact that it is entertaining and the lack of devices and forced emotions in the screenplay.
I thought that I was never going to find a worse premise for a romantic comedy than the one from the execrable The Accidental Husband (in which Uma Thurman's character is married to a lout as a consequence of a joke from a hacker).Of course that I was wrong in thinking that Hollywood could not fall any lower, and as a hard lesson, we now have the film The Switch to show that there is not any enough stupid idea to avoid it from being taken to the big screen.I guess that such a forced idea like the one from the screenplay of The Switch could have worked if its screenplay had been really funny or romantic.Unfortunately, The Switch fatally fails on both levels, and it ended up being a horrible film, despite Jason Bateman's solid performance.After becoming semi-famous during the 80's thanks to his work in the sitcom The Hogan Family (besides of his tangential fame as the brother of the then famous Justine Bateman -who was something like a light version of Lindsay Lohan-), his career was in declination for many years, until he was re-discovered by the producers of the excellent TV series Arrested Development.Thanks to his new popularity, we have seen Bateman in various movies in which he repeats the same character of a sarcastic and slightly neurotic man.However, he always fits perfectly for those characters, because he always makes them credible.Pity that in The Switch, he is caught in a boring screenplay with unconvincing romantic tension and weak decisions which make the main characters to look like idiots.In conclusion, I cannot recommend The Switch, because I think it is a deplorable movie with a badly written screenplay with uninteresting characters and without enough energy or humor to make the spectator to have some interest in the story.
Even though I did not like the most recent films from director Ron Howard (with the honourable exception of Frost/Nixon), I keep getting interested in his filmography because I never loose the hope of finding the solid dominion of emotions and balance of humor and drama which distinguished him as an important personality in North American cinema, whose movies fulfilled with the difficult task of raising a lot of money, and at the same time satisfying the professional critics. However, that was a long time ago, and even though a pair of his most recent films had box office success (The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons), I think that he has already lost his artistic credibility. To prove that, we have the horrible The Dilemma, his most recent film.The screenplay from The Dilemma raises a moderately interesting question, which is rounded by internal and external factors which make the decision even harder to take. However, this film's huge problem is that it adopts an absolutely inappropriate tone. The premise has the ingredients to become into an interesting drama, but the whole film is filmed as a comedy. To start with, the two main actors are completely inappropriate for the characters they interpret. I generally like the work from Vince Vaughn and Kevin James, but The Dilemma required genuine character actors, and not comedians whose antics betray the essence itself from every scene. I am under the impression that Allan Loeb's original screenplay had a more serious and mature tone; but maybe, a studio executive thought that nobody would want to see a depressing marital drama, so the only way he could "rescue" the movie was making it comedy. What could go wrong? The answer: practically everything. In the credits, Loeb's name is the only one mentioned as the screenwriter, but the screenplay leaves that ugly impression of having been written by a committee, with a parade of "suits" and "yes-men" destroying the original screenplay with their tiring "funny" ideas. If the film had at least been funny, that thematic inconsistency may have been excused; but in little less than two hours of endless wordiness, confusions and conflicts, I did not laugh even once; on the opposite, I was constantly looking at my watch impatiently waiting for the holy end credits to come. And something which does not help at all either is that Howard has forgotten how to bring any style to the scenes. It is true that he has never been a very "visual" director, but in films like Apollo 13, The Paper, Parenthood and the previously mentioned Frost/Nixon, he showed an elegant work with the cameras, good eye for the composition and a comprehension of the rhythm required by the screenplay. Needless to say that nothing of that is present in The Dilemma; if I had not known this film was directed by Howard, I would have supposed that it was made by some atrocious director like Dennis Dugan or Shawn Levy.In conclusion, The Dilemma is a horrible movie which made me feel like genuinely wasting my time. Don't make the same mistake I did, and avoid this movie. Howard's career really bottomed with this film, and I hope him to recover from it in future movies.
Even though the interest in celebrities has increased very much during recent years, the fact that the cinema prefers to ignore the subject is totally natural.After all, it is not convenient to satirize people with a big influence on the motion of an industry which is based on the narcissism of its members and on the capricious popular taste.And even though How to Lose Friends & Alienate People makes an appropriate satire of that and is moderately entertaining, it did not leave me very satisfied.I have been a fan of screenwriter and actor Simon Pegg for a long time.I think his legendary sitcom Spaced is one of the best TV comedies from History (I am not exaggerating); the film Shaun of the Dead (which he co-wrote with Edgar Wright) is an excellent parody of the horror genre; and even though I did not find Hot Fuzz (which he also co-wrote with Wright) to be great, I still think it is a very entertaining satire of the action cinema.However, aside from all that, his career has not been very solid.His talent as a comedian was wasted in the weak romantic comedy Run Fatboy Run (which he also co-wrote) and in the horrible film The Good Night.However, Pegg has better luck in How to Lose Friends & Alienate People, because his character gives him the opportunity to show his talent, and I think he represents the best element from the film.Nevertheless, the screenplay from How to Lose Friends & Alienate People is puerile, because it does not have a narrative thread which impulses the story.We have three recurrent subjects: the ascent of an incipient star; the conflicts the main character has with his boss and rival; and the sexual tension between the main character and the only woman who takes him seriously.Those slopes take us from one scene to the other, but neither of them engage with a defined story.Maybe because he noticed that important deficiency, screenwriter Peter Straughan added some of the most archaic narrative tricks, from the separation between lovers to the obligatory public humiliation.Fortunately, we have the solid performances, which are the main thing because the film is moderately entertaining.And besides of the previously mentioned Pegg, I also liked the work from Kirsten Dunst, who keeps her credibility even during some irritating "funny" scenes; Jeff Bridges as the director of the magazine Sharp's; Gillian Anderson as a fierce publicist; and even Megan Fox as a superficial, manipulative and attractive actress.How to Lose Friends & Alienate People could have been better if it had ignored the conventions it did not even know how to follow.However, I think I can give a slight recommendation to it, because of the performances and because it is not boring.
Once in a while, there is a horror film acclaimed as the "the most extreme one" or "the bloodiest one" in the History of cinema; something which will violate our senses and melt our brain; something genuinely lawbreaker and unpredictable. Unfortunately, what most of those movies achieve are just a shrug and an apathetic "meh". On the opposite, The Human Centipede (First Sequence) justifies the hyperbole which acclaims it, and even though I would not consider it as a masterpiece of the horror genre, I cannot deny the fact that I found it shocking and repulsively original. In short, this is a fascinating horror film.The force from The Human Centipede (First Sequence) does not reside on its images, because it is not even very bloody. Its considerable impact is more conceptual than visceral, and even though the physical viability of its premise is very questionable, I cannot deny the fact that the film generates various moments of a delicious repulsion, accompanied by the primeval fear of finding something which is totally anti-natural and perverse. In summary, a horror film like few...something which does not mean that it will be admired by every single fan of the genre. It is very probable that it will disappoint to those who expect a parade of amateur excesses, at the style of Slaughtered Vomit Dolls; or to the disciples of Troma Films, because there is not even a pinch of that characteristically irreverent and vulgar humor in here. For better or for worse, The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is a mature and cerebral film, which was made with few money, but which is brilliantly directed and conducted by excellent performances.Actresses Ashley C. Williams and Ashlynn Yennie bring perfect works, specially when their characters do not speak and they only act with their expressive eyes. Akihiro Kitamura credibly reacts to the things that happen to his character, and there is a particular moment in which his performance is touching.The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is definitely a very strong film; however, I unhealthily enjoyed its concepts, its grotesque imagination and its icy exhibition of cruelty and human suffering. Some might say that this film's visual style lacks of identity, but I think that the prosaic way in which the camera captures the horrors shown in here is much more effective than the edition tricks we can find in less ambitious films. In conclusion, I enthusiastically recommend The Human Centipede (First Sequence), with the warning that it is definitely not a film for everyone. The subtitle "First Sequence" suggests future sequels, and even though I am interested in watching them, I doubt that they will be able to duplicate the impact from the first encounter I had with this excellent film.
After receiving so much applause in film festivals, the Norwegian film TrollHunter was finally released on DVD in my country, and even though I consider it an entertaining experience, I did not find it AS good as many other people did. To start with, I am already a bit tired of the "pseudo-documentary" format employed by many independent horror films in order to add a "fresh and original" angle. Sure, TrollHunter has locations and some aspects which are not very conventional, but its structure, rhythm and even characters are too similar to the ones from films like The Last Exorcism and Lake Mungo. In other words...either they are aliens, ghosts or trolls, they are simply ingredients in an old recipe.On the positive side, the actors from TrollHunter possess that European casual style of acting which makes them credible and realistic. While I was watching TrollHunter, I was thinking that if it had been a North American film, the characters would have been tiring archetypes of the genre: the shy nerd, the hateful lout, the innocent attractive girl, etc. But in the hands of co-screenwriters Andr√© √òvredal (who was also the director) and H√•vard S. Johansen, we have natural characters who never loose their reactions of sincere surprise, doubt and terror. As for the character of "the hunter", he is simply a tenacious and brave man, with enough pragmatism not to romanticize his strange work; and even though the character is pretty eccentric, actor Otto Jespersen avoided him to become into a melodramatic caricature.We also have the excellent cinematography, which takes the maximum advantage of the Norwegian landscapes in order to create an atmosphere of a serene beauty highlighted by a sensation of constant threaten, not only from the trolls, but also from the cruel environment. And I also liked the special effects because of their fluid animation, realistic textures and perfect integration between the monsters and the real scenarios.Now, on the negative side...the screenplay includes many forced and inconsistent elements. Of course that I am not referring to the existence of the creatures, but to the political and biological elements employed by √òvredal and Johansen in order to bring a more "mundane" context to the story. In order not to reveal "spoilers", I will not keep deepening on that, but needless to say that none intelligent government would waste the opportunity of employing the trolls as an irresistible tourist attraction.Another negative element from TrollHunter is that it does not define its purpose very well. It has funny moments, but it is not really a comedy; and it has some tense moments, but not enough of them in order to consider it a horror film (and I have not even mentioned the lack of gore). Nevertheless, I liked TrollHunter despite those complaints; however, I did not find it very memorable, and I do not consider it nearly as good as many people say it is.
Che: Part One was a fascinating experiment, which did not only tell a very interesting story, but it also tried to do something different with the "biopic" genre.Che: Part Two is the excellent culmination of this experiment.This movie offers all of the same attributes from the first one, from the extraordinary performances (specially from Benicio del Toro) to Steven Soderbergh's brilliant direction, without forgetting its intention of breaking with the conventional rules from the biopics.That is what I admire from Soderbergh's experiments...they always try to do something different and unusual, and they succeed most of the times.The final message from this film is perfect, and it includes everything we have been told about Che Guervara's life.The only fail I found on Che: Part Two is that a few parts felt a bit irrelevant.In summary, I give Che: Part Two a very enthusiastic recommendation because, as the first one, it is a brave and fascinating experiment which challenges the spectator and leaves us thinking.
I like animals very much, and that's the reason why I have been interested since I'm a child in all the books and films about four-legged, winged and aquatic adventures, which (in retrospect) were generally built with the same formulas and clich√©s. I think that that considerable "emotional baggage" is the main thing which avoided me from feeling completely satisfied with War Horse.Like few directors, Steven Spielberg knows how to "press the buttons" from the audience, provoking without any difficulty the appropriate emotional reactions which elevate the story and make us "plunge" into the characters' adventures. However, with such a manipulative screenplay like the one from War Horse, Spielberg's ability becomes a bit redundant, mainly because we already have various scenes and situations which want to make us cry despite feeling a bit forced and convenient.What I most liked in War Horse are definitely the excellent technical aspects. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography makes every frame to look like either an exquisite pastoral landscape, or a visually attractive portrait, or a dynamic military composition full of energy and Historical detail. The work of the studio Framestore is also worthy of applause for having created epic battle scenes which duplicate the scale and intensity from Saving Private Ryan (but without any blood in this case...let's remember that War Horse is a PG-13 movie). And the digital horses are well created, at the same time that I also appreciated the fact that that technique has been employed in order not to put any animal in risk during the most extreme moments of action and cruelty.So, in conclusion, I found the screenplay from War Horse a bit weak, affected and predictable; and we also have a few moments which are a bit dull in the film. The human drama does not work as well as it should, and it's occasionally darkened by the one developed between the horses. In the context of Spielberg's filmography, War Horse is good, but very distant to his best movies. However, this film kept me entertained in general, and I think that that fact, along with the perfect technical aspects, make it worthy of a moderate recommendation.
When I was a kid, I had the fortune of growing up in a house full of books, and through my childhood, I obsessively read and re-read various of them.Among them, there were The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Robin Hood...and a biography about Amelia Earhart (1897-1937), whose author I have unfortunately forgotten his/her name (searching in Amazon, I found too many books with the simple title "Amelia Earhart", and I do not recognize their modern covers).What I do remember is that it was written for juvenile readers, more interested in the aviation feats from that legendary woman, and not so much in her important role as a proto-feminist, celebrity and promoter of the commercial aviation.Now, the film Amelia leaves Earhart's life as an aviator in the background, focusing on her turbulent life, the positive and negative elements from her fame and the romantic triangle she kept with two men who may loved her on different levels.But even with that wide narrative angle, co-screenwriters Ronald Bass and Anna Hamilon Phelan could barely rough out the real person behind the legend.Director Mira Nair has talent for generating potent and honest emotions with her movies (the clearest cases are Salaam Bombay! and Monsoon Wedding), and because of that, it surprised me that in Amelia, she made such a shy biography of a woman who was famous for her passion and intensity.Maybe, Nair recognized that her force is on the melodrama, and not on the adventure, and her influence imbalanced the movie, minimizing the most significant attributes from the story which is told.Anyway, she offers us various recreations of the flights Earhart made, but they cannot express the difficulty, tension and danger they really represented.There are very nice aerial shots, competent special effects and a good cinematography...but very few sensation of the freedom and joy which impulsed Earhart on her hobby and craft.However, I think Amelia deserves a slight recommendation despite so many fails, mainly because of the brilliant performances from the cast.Hilary Swank does not only physically look like Earhart, but she is also perfect at expressing Earhart's rural charm, and at taking complete possession of her character.This is definitely an outstanding performance caught into a mediocre movie.Richard Gere is very solid as an unconditional support and romantic interest of the aviator.Ewan McGregor and Christopher Eccleston have less screen time, but they still bring memorable performances due to the dramatic weight and credibility they bring to their characters.In summary, Amelia is a mediocre biography, but it kept me moderately interested and it offers great performances, so I think I can give a slight recommendation to it.However, I cannot deny this movie could have been much better.
I would like to say that Rubber is a humorous horror film about a tire which kills people. But that would be a superficial description of it. In fact, Rubber is an ambitious art-house film which employs the clich√©s of slasher cinema and post-modern humor in order to examine deeper subjects. However, on its most basic shape, Rubber is a funny, intelligent and very entertaining film, which despite not being great, displays narrative ingenuity and an attractive visual style.Rubber is a definitely strange movie, and I have not even mentioned the part of the film dedicated to the "spectators", a group of people who are watching the same movie as us, occasionally expressing similar opinions to the ones we are thinking of. The interventions of that "Greek chorus" are generally funny, but they do not always work, because they occasionally pretend to be so "meta" that they end up being antipathetic.I also have to mention the special effects from Rubber, which were made with a huge craft ingenuity (in what regards to the living tire) and with a good assistance of digital creations (in what regards to the bloody deaths). Nevertheless, beyond of the realism of the images, I liked Quentin Dupieux's direction pretty much, because it is stylish but not bulky, and magically convincing in order to represent the tire's emotions. Without the need of dialogs or explanations, I could perfectly understand whenever the tire was sad, happy or angry. I can assure you that there are Hollywood stars (such as Channing Tatum or Katherine Heigl) with much less histrionic range than the one from this tire.In conclusion, despite some weak performances from the human cast and the occasionally forced commentaries made by the "spectators", Rubber is a very interesting film experience, and I recommend it with the warning that I still do not know whether you do not have to take it seriously...or if you have to take it VERY seriously in order to analyze its deep philosophical messages.
I haven't read the novel Horns, but I have read other works from author Joe Hill (Stephen King's son), and I have noticed the fact that he has an unusual talent to establish extremely unusual situations with a security and confidence which inspire the reader to say: "Sure, why not?". That attitude will be essential to appreciate the various pros of the film Horns, because its bizarre premise defies the conventional logic. I have seen this film publicized as a horror one, but I would describe it as a noir thriller, with the desperate anti-hero trying to clean up his name and find the murderer, while he navigates a complex network of betrayal and picturesque characters who are rarely what they seem. The issue of the horns and the "extraction of secrets" power seem mere tools to facilitate the flow of the story, and not the elements which categorically define the genre of the film. But well, let's leave the label which would belong to Horns aside. As I previously said, the premise is very strange, but it's developed with naturalness thanks to Keith Bunin's interesting (but imperfect) screenplay and Alexandre Aja's stylized direction. I particularly liked the rich palette of colors employed by Aja, as well as the accent of bright colors which contrast with the grey setting of the small lumber town in which the story is set. As for the performances, Daniel Radcliffe makes a good work in some scenes, but in other ones, he doesn't show enough dramatic gravity. The great Juno Temple plays a relatively small role, but she feels absolutely credible in it. My main complaint against Horns is that its running time is longer than it should, because it occasionally takes unnecessary tangents which might have worked well in the book, but in the translation to a screenplay, they contribute little or nothing to the central mystery. And I found the ending absurd and too simple, breaking the fragile balance the rest of the film was keeping. Nevertheless, Horns has enough positive elements in order to make it worthy of a moderate recommendation, even though I think that the screenplay might have needed additional revisions and an ending more consistent with the rest of the story.
I liked the original Wall Street very much, mainly because of its energy and its strident critic against the personal and professional excesses from the North American financial leaders, but I could not understand some elements from the screenplay very well, due to the fact I am not very familiarized with economic issues.The financial jargon in the sequel, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, is more comprehensible (at least in my case), because it revolves around the worldwide economic crisis from 2008, which keeps being felt to nowadays.Besides, I have to say I liked this fascinating sequel a bit more than the original film.I generally like the work of director Oliver Stone very much, but I have been disappointed by some of his movies.In his most "mature" (translation: bland) works, such as Nixon, Alexander and W., I did not find any traces of the maniac energy and aggressive style from his best films (which are, in my humble opinion, JFK, Natural Born Killers and The Doors).Fortunately, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps shows us to Stone in a much better shape, which is relentless but precise and perfectly modulated, at the same time he is able to hypnotize us with almost every scene, and to keep us in suspense with the help of sharp dialogs full of meaning and emotion.I think the best elements from Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps are its intelligent screenplay and great performances.Michael Douglas brings an extraordinary work, because he perfectly shows us the multiple facets from his character on a credible way.Shia LaBeouf had left me impressed with his performance in the film A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, and he also brings a perfect performance in here.And I also liked the performances from Josh Brolin and the great Frank Langella very much.I will refuse to mention the message from this film in here.Suffice to say is that the moralist angle is well mixed with the experiences from the characters and their intense emotions, so we never feel that we are being given ethic lessons.The only thing I can say against Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is that I found the scenes with Susan Sarandon to be a little bit unnecessary.Nevertheless, that does not avoid me from enthusiastically recommending this excellent movie, because this is definitely first-class entertainment, something we are unfortunately not very used to find in modern cinema.
I wasn't very interested in watching Wild, because I don't like those films dedicated to delight themselves in the suffering of the characters (examples: 21 Grams, The Burning Plain); and this movie is based on a true story who decided to make a walk in order to overcome a devastating personal tragedy. Fortunately, Wild didn't end up being one of those films... even though that doesn't mean I found it very good. The main problem from Wild is the fractured structure from its screenplay, which doesn't adequately tell the story or fully develops the main character, making her walk feel more like a whim than a genuine search of sense, or an atonement for the bad decisions she made. Many people compared Wild with Into the Wild, but I liked that film much more; in that one, we could really feel the main character's catharsis, as well as his relentless search of deep personal truths. Wild examines the same subjects, but on a superficial and almost intranscendent way. The emotions this film should generate shyly poke out only occasionally, and it's thanks to the solid work from Laura Dern and Gaby Hoffman in supporting roles. As for Reese Witherspoon's performance in the main character, I didn't like it, because she never transmits the tiredness and ravages her character suffers. Director Jean-Marc Vall√©e's previous filmography includes the excellent films The Young Victoria and Dallas Buyers Club, both of them full of emotions and fascinating characters. In Wild, he didn't work with a such a good screenplay as the ones from those films, but he could at least manage not to make the film boring. In conclusion, I don't regret having watched Wild, but it didn't leave me very satisfied. Nevertheless, I think I can give a slight recommendation to this movie, specially to hikers who want to have some fun pointing out all the mistakes the main character makes. I personally lose my breath when walking just some blocks, so I don't have enough basis to judge someone who walked 1700 kilometres.
This time, the phrase "From the producers of Despicable Me" did not sound like a warning, but as a recommendation, because I moderately enjoyed that movie. Unfortunately, Hop ended up being a horrible film which uses the most cloying and tiring routines from the family cinema. In a few words, I found the story to be boring, the humor to be excessively simple and trite, and the performances (with one exception) to be lacking of any life or energy. However, the solid animation and vivacious music might fool to some kids to make them believe they are having fun.I previously mentioned that almost all the performances (also the voice ones) feel listless. The only actor who shows conviction in his role is James Marsden as the leading character. His best attribute in this movie is that he makes us to believe he is genuinely interacting with a rabbit which would not exist on the screen until months later, during the post-production. And I also liked the fact that he takes his character seriously; thinking about it better, I think that that is what makes the relationship between his character and the rabbit credible. Unfortunately, Marsden's competent work was not enough for saving this movie from being an absolute tedium.And just in case the screenplay was not questionable enough, Hop forces its premise even more in order to justify the use of sporadic rock-and-roll songs, with the hope of looking "cooler". Besides, the excuse of the rabbit wanting to be a rock singer is simply a rehash of the old clich√© "son who refuses to follow his father's steps". Anyway, I think that Hop is an atrocious movie which made me feel like genuinely wasting my time. In other words, avoid it at any cost.
Having squeezed even the last commercial drop of the "princesses", the executives from Disney now focus their attention on the villains. And, undoubtedly inspired by the success of the musical play Wicked (a ret-con prequel of The Wizard of Oz), they now bring us the story of Maleficient, in which her motivation for becoming the villain of the tale (and the movie, of course) Sleeping Beauty is revealed. The result is a hollow and tedious film with failed epic aspirations and lacking of the necessary emotion or drama in order to bring sense to its cloying digital aesthetic. Every frame of Maleficient is over-designed to the point of saturation, something which might leave the spectators who only want to see spectacular landscapes and bizarre creatures satisfied. That's a pity because, after all, the villains from Disney have always been more interesting than the heroes or princesses, and I think that Maleficient had the potential of being an interesting character study with touches of dark fantasy. Unfortunately, screenwriter Linda Woolverton doesn't show the slightest interest in bringing dramatic relevance to the story, and as a result, the special effects end up replacing the narrative, throwing as many pixels to the screen as necessary in order to simulate the fact that important and interesting things are happening. On the positive side, Maleficient offers solid performances from Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning, Lesley Manville, Imelda Staunton and Juno Temple. Unfortunately, despite their performances, this film bored me very much, and I can't recommend it.
The first warning I have to make about Adventureland is that it is not a juvenile comedy with a lot of laughs and grotesque excesses.Unfortunately,the trailers and all the promotion behind this movie wanted to make us believe that,with the phrase "From the director of Superbad" as a hook to capture the teen spectators who want to see vulgar humor.However,although it has some funny moments,I would consider Adventureland as a melancholic melodrama which belongs to the coming-of-age sub-genus.In other words,this movie does not show us the madness of youngsters who are desperate to having sex,but the story about a young man who has to start facing his adult life,at the same time he starts falling in love.And I have to say that the final result is far from greatness,but it is still pretty solid.Do not misunderstand me : on the previous paragraph,I did not wanna say that the sex is absolutely ignored by the screenplay,since the main character is very eager to loose his virginity.However,the detailed and very well structured screenplay focuses on the emotions that situation brings.Besides,all the characters are deeply developed.On the previously mentioned movie Superbad,director Greg Mottola had made the actors to have a wonderful chemistry with each other.Besides,that movie had endorsed its rudeness with a deep screenplay,which showed,among other things,good moments of friendship and human warmth.On Adventureland,Mottola backed to achieve a very good chemistry between the actors;and on the screenplay,like screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg had made on Superbad,he showed good moments of friendship and human warmth,although we do not have the rude humor from Superbad this time.But Mottola would not have achieved such a good chemistry between the actors if their performances had not been so good.Kristen Stewart had the good/bad luck of participating on the popular movie Twilight,which has left her undoubtedly stereotyped forever,but her performance in Adventureland proves the fact that she is an excellent actress,although many people will unfortunately not recognise that.Jesse Eisenberg brought adequate performances on his previous movies (specially on The Squid and the Whale),but he had never left me very impressed.However,he is truly brilliant on this movie.I do not think of any other actor who would have suited better for his role.And,on the supporting cast,we also have solid performances from Ryan Reynolds,Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig.I found some fails on this movie.One of them is that some scenes feel a little bit boring,and I think they could have been edited out.And,for the other side,there are a few forced elements on the screenplay.However,in spite of that,I liked this movie pretty much.As I said,you do not have to expect to see Superbad : Part 2,but a movie whose style and tone is a bit similar to Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist (which is superior to this movie,by my humble point of view).Adventureland is a pretty interesting coming-of-age movie which is worthy of a recommendation.
G.I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra,the last movie in the chain of Hollywood blockbusters from 2009,resulted to be a retrograde rehash of the most hollow action cinema from the 90's (movies like Die Hard: With A Vengeance or Lethal Weapon 4 come to my mind).After the extraordinary special effects from Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen,the tenderness and warmth from Up and the brilliant back-to-start of Star Trek,we now have a pathetic movie which reminds us the worst elements from the 90's blockbusters...although it does not lack of various negative elements from some modern blockbusters.It seems that the only intention from director and co-screenwriter Stephen Sommers was making an expensive and reloaded version of the caricature from the 80's whose function was disguising a successful line of toys with insipid adventures.With all this I wanna say that,if you are expecting something interesting and exciting,look for somewhere else,because if not,you will feel greatly disappointed by this movie.G.I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra has a huge quantity of negative elements,but the most significant one is its complete lack of ambition.Sure,on the visual aspect it trips us with mediocre special effects.But the story is practically non-existent and it only works as an excuse for showing us elaborate but horribly tedious action sequences which feel completely irrelevant and unnecessary,so at the time we lead to the final battle,we do not care about who is shooting who and why they are doing it.On this movie,we also have a deeply stupid screenplay which is full of stupid characters who only say and do stupid things.From the irritant jokes said by Marlon Wayans (who had left me astonished with his performance on Requiem for a Dream) to the ridiculous plan from the villain there is not even a pinch of...I would not say "intelligence" because it would be useless to hope for so much,but something of creativity would have been welcome.In summary,this movie does not produce any emotion or suspense,and the pathetic humor causes anger instead of laughs.On the cast from this film,there are various competent actors (Jonathan Pryce,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Christopher Eccleston,Dennis Quaid and Adewale Akinnououye-Agbaje),but Sommers' direction is so insipid that their performances lack of any energy and conviction.The hero from this movie could not have been chosen worse: Channing Tatum,who "acts" with only one facial expression.Rachel Nichols is undoubtedly attractive,but her performance is truly horrible,something which also applies for Sienna Miller.Director Stephen Sommers made two very entertaining films (Deep Rising,The Mummy),his career declined a lot with the atrocious The Mummy Returns and Van Helsing.On G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,Sommers backs to prove that he has completely lost the talent he had shown on Deep Rising and The Mummy.This movie is a real piece of crap,and of course I do not recommend it by any means.
I know very little about sports, but I'm not worried in watching films about that topic, because they almost always employ easily recognizable dramatic structures, and we don't need to be experts in football, baseball or whatever in order to follow the screenplay. However, I was getting a bit worried during the first minutes of Draft Day, because it's not exactly about sports, but about the arcane negotiations and intrigues which raise every year in the highest spheres of NFL during the recruitment time, and I was frankly having difficulties in understanding some very technical dialogs. Fortunately, the things get simplified as the film advances, and we realize that all that wordiness is distilled into a fascinating story about personal redemption and family pride. Co-screenwriters Scott Rothman and Rajiv Joseph know how to manipulate the narrative of Draft Day in order to gradually introduce us into the rules of recruitment, and as a consequence, our (my) ignorance doesn't obstruct the flow of the story. And besides, the actors make an excellent work in their roles, bringing a sensation of reality which extols the drama and makes us think we are witnessing life or death conflicts, instead of simple routines from a playground: "if you pick John, I stay with Peter". Except that, in this case, "Peter" and "John" represent tens of millions of dollars for their respective teams. After all, they might indeed be life or death conflicts. As I previously said, the cast makes a perfect work, highlighting Kevin Costner, who very credibly projects strength or vulnerability, depending what every situation requires. In conclusion, I liked Draft Day very much, it taught me new things about football, and, specially, it proves that, despite the various missteps he has had in his filmography, director Ivan Reitman still has a lot to offer whenever he works with the right material.
I feel the necessity of repeating my habitual warning: I haven't read any of the novels from the Twilight saga. In my humble opinion, any film adaptation should work as a movie by itself, and not as a visual complement of the book. But at the same time, I understand the fact that the producers of Twilight (and similar sagas) need to satisfy the millions of readers who expect to find the same characters and scenes of the books on the big screen, something which can provoke structure and narrative problems, as we have seen in all the films from this franchise.I don't consider The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 a very good film, but at least, I found it much better than the two previous movies from this saga, for the simple fact that something is truly happening this time. The screenplay feels more fluid, better structured, and even possesses a certain dramatic impulse in order to logically take us from one scene to the other. Yes, we still have dull "romantic" scenes and useless melodrama between Jacob, Bella and Edward, but the conflict between the clans takes precedence and makes the filler be reduced as much as possible without opposing the fans of the novels (I guess).The performances from The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 are functional, and the characters follow their well known routines. The special effects are adequate, and director Bill Condon made a creative work during the final battle...pity that it's ruined by an absolutely coward and unintentionally hilarious twist.So, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is a mediocre film, but I have to admit it was better than I expected. I keep thinking that the entire saga could have been summarized in two films, but anyway...I don't think there's any Hollywood executive disposed to sacrifice so many millions of dollars in order to tell a more agile and efficient story.
As an avid reader of comics, I have a huge respect for the brilliant author Jack Kirby (1917-1994), whose work for Marvel produced some of the most memorable characters and stories from sequential art.However, even though it may sound heretic, I do not feel the same love for the complex mythologies Kirby created to DC Comics.I honestly never swallowed the stories about the "New Gods", because I found the characters not to be very well developed, not to mention that the stories were confusing.So, I started watching Superman/Batman: Apocalypse with some mistrust, because big part of the graphic novel it is inspired on (a compilation of the title Superman/Batman) has some similarities with the work Kirby made to DC Comics.To my surprise, screenwriter Tab Murphy made an excellent work at tuning the narrative and compressing the action in order to bring a dynamic, tremendously entertaining and even deep film experience.The main target from Superman/Batman: Apocalypse are the comic readers, so it does not loose any time at establishing the origins of every characters, or explaining the relationships between them.So, I understand why the casual spectators may have difficulties at "plunging" into the movie.Personally, I hugely enjoyed Superman/Batman: Apocalypse and I think that, with the exception of Justice League: The New Frontier, it is the movie from DC Comics I have mist enjoyed.Besides of the screenplay, the characters and the awesome action scenes, it was also a pleasure for me to hear the classic voices from Superman and Batman (in other words, the ones which were used in their respective animated series), as well as the solid contributions from Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman, Andre Braugher as Darkseid and Summer Glau as Kara Zor-El.The only fail I found on this movie is that some details from the screenplay could have been better polished.But despite of that, Superman/Batman: Apocalypse is a great movie I enthusiastically recommend with the previous warning that the lack of context and explanations may make it a bit difficult to be assimilated by casual spectators.
Under the Skin is just his third film, but director Jonathan Glazer is already being compared to filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch, something which seems simultaneously appropriate and a bit condescending. Yes, his movies possess a certain coldness and a cadence which are similar to Kubrick's style (specially Birth), while the characters experiment the opposite: explosive emotions they can't always express (well, in Sexy Beast, that was the only thing which could be expressed by Ben Kingsley's character). And now, with Under the Skin, Glazer ventures into the oblique and experimental kind of cinema Lynch uses to make. However, I think the film is good enough to transcend comparisons; and Glazer's vision feels so deep and personal that it deserves to be evaluated on its own merits, and not on its (hypothetical) similarity to another director's work. In those terms, Under the Skin is one of the best films I have seen this year, and I'm sure that I will keep discovering new details and new interpretations every time I will re-visit it, something which is quite remarkable if we consider its languid rhythm and simple structure. The film has very few dialogs, and big part of the scenes seem to extend themselves without too much sense. But instead of getting boring, it captured me from the first scene because of its hypnotic intensity and Scarlett Johansson's extraordinary performance. I simply think she brings her best performance so far in Under the Skin, because it's deceptively simple at first sight, but incredibly eloquent and detailed when we appreciate the wide emotional range transmitted by her most subtle variations of expression and body language. And that combination of performance and subtext is what distinguishes Under the Skin, making it an excellent sample of science fiction which is minimalistic on its shape, but with many levels of meaning and interpretation. On the negative side, there are a few logical holes in the screenplay. However, that doesn't avoid me from enthusiastically recommending Under the Skin as a unique and unforgettable experience. Having said that, I also have to point out the fact that this film won't be for every taste. Some people might find Under the Skin boring and pretentious. But those who accept the challenge of exploring diffuse subjects of identity, humanity and genre will probably enjoy this fascinating variation of a science fiction clich√© filtered through a reflexive and philosophical sensibility.
I always have a bad predisposition against Argentinian movies, because they tend to be boring and pretentious.However, there are some exceptions, because films like Nueve Reinas, Tiempo de Valientes and El Secreto de sus Ojos are clear proofs that excellent cinema can be made in Argentina.The screenplay from El Secreto de sus Ojos is very well written, since it is simultaneously detailed and fascinating, at the same time it presents complex and very interesting characters.Juan Jos√© Campanella's direction is perfect, since he drives the movie at a perfect rhythm and he creates a memorable sequence in a football stadium.That scene is simply magnificent.And, as for the performances, they are also very good.The only thing I can say against this movie is that a few elements near the ending feel a bit forced.However, that is a minor fail.El Secreto de sus Ojos is an excellent movie, and the kind of film Argentina needs to have more frequently.I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm.
When I was a teenager,I liked spending time at my grandpa's bedroom,because he had an impressive collection of North American magazines,like Popular Mechanics,Victory! or True Crime,which was my favourite one,because it described on a very interesting way the adventures from famous policemen and criminals,using marvelous sensationalistic prose and "creative license" which made the stories to be more exciting and heroic.Thanks to that magazine,I knew about the existence of John Dillinger (1903-1934) and his rival Melvin Purvis (1903-1960) who,with the help of his G-Men,fought against the organized crime with the same or more enthusiasm than Elliot Ness' Untouchables.The film Public Enemies may have needed a little bit of that sensationalistic enthusiasm to make it more exciting,because in spite of its solid performances and competent direction,it did not leave completely satisfied because of the lack of focus the screenplay shows specially on the first hour.On previous decades,director Michael Mann showed an extraordinary visual style (the most notorious examples of that are the TV series Crime Story and the film Heat).On this decade,he made a change on his visual style,which is now rawer,realistic and completely lacking of visual ornaments.This style worked well on "contemporary" films like Collateral and Miami Vice; but I do not think it was totally appropriate for a period film like Public Enemies.Mann's fluid digital camera enhances the intensity of various action sequences and it contributes to creating a good atmosphere on more relaxing and dramatic moments.But,during the whole movie,I felt a strange anachronism which avoided me of getting into the movie.In other words,the whole film lacks of historic sensation,in spite of the old cars,clothes and hats,and that is because Mann's modern techniques negatively contrast with a period film.Another important fail from this movie is that,as I have previously mentioned,the screenplay is too diffuse,specially on the first hour.The character development is excessively superficial and the abundance of faces (on the law side as well as on the criminal one) invite to the confusion and what is worse,to the apathy,because it is difficult to establish an emotional connexion with the characters when we do not know very well who is who and how they are related with each other.For example,near the ending,a friend of Dillinger dies and I guess Mann wants to make us feel that emotional "punch".However,there has not been a previous scene where we can see the relationship between both,or at least something which separates that victim from all the anonymous henchmen who are killed like flies.But,although this film has various fails,it also has various positive elements.The second hour from Public Enemies finally finds a focus and it scraps all the dramatic "filler" from the first hour.Besides,the "haunting" becomes more interesting.The action scenes are well filmed,because they are perfectly clear and they lack from the glamorization we usually see on Hollywood cinema.But the best element from this movie is Johnny Depp's performance.He brings a simultaneously detailed,subtle and brilliant work and although the rest of the cast also brings solid performances,he clearly steals the show.A great achievement from Depp,proving once more he is one of the best contemporary actors.So,because of all those positive elements Public Enemies deserves a recommendation.I keep having faith on Mann,but I hope he does not fall on the marketing trap which has trapped many directors,who are amazed by the possibilities of the digital cinema until loosing of sight the genuine porpoise of narrative art.If I had to summarize Public Enemies,I would say it is an interesting film but which is not completely satisfactory.
The end of the world is a common subject in sci-fi cinema, but it is occasionally usurped by other cinematographic genres in order to bring it a different perspective. A clear example is the film Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, whose interest doesn't lie on the physical aspects of the catastrophe, but on the diverse reactions from a group of characters with diverse attitudes in front of their imminent extinction. This focus had previously been adopted by movies such as Miracle Mile and On the Beach, but Seeking a Friend for the End of the World exposes a different interpretation, while leaving the following message: death doesn't end life; it simply defines it. Unfortunately, the result is boring and pretentious.Nevertheless, the whole cast from Seeking a Friend for the End of the World brings a solid work. Steve Carell is perfect in his character, expressing contradictory emotions without the need of words. Keira Knightley can go from the nervous mania to the solemnity in a matter of seconds, without losing any credibility. And in supporting characters, we can find competent performances from Rob Corddry, Rob Huebel, Gillian Jacobs, Nancy Carell and the great Patton Oswalt.However, the rhythm from Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is terribly boring, and the characters' "hyper-sensibility" feels like a forced and irritating affectation, so as a consequence, I could never get interested in their melodramatic existential crusade. And if we add to that "funny" moments which are completely unfunny, big logical mistakes (Who the hell could think that a small plane could fly to Europe?) and a ridiculously corny ending, the final result is a tedious film which I can't recommend, despite the good performances.
The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) is one of my favourite movies,not only by its own merit,but also because of the context in which it was made.In the first decade of the post-war,with the North American economy on its explosive development and on its road on being the biggest potency in the world,the movie proposed the valid idea that the supremacy of power over the rest of the world was not the correct road to follow and that every military or ideological expansion should be carefully controlled by the science and the morality.Now,the crappy remake of that extraordinary movie,uses the ecologic movement in a painfully unambitious way.Even without making any comparisons with the original film,The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) is a very bad film.With only two other movies on his filmography (the pathetic Hellraiser : Inferno and the brilliant The Exorcism of Emily Rose), director Scott Derrickson was completely inappropriate for a movie like this,which aspires to have an epic tone,but which does not produce even the minimum level of suspense or emotion.As many other catastrophic movies,this movie pretends to tell,on a parallel way,two stories: a big conflict which makes uncertain the future of the humanity; and the emotional journey of some characters.But this movie is so poorly written that it produces a big boredom on both aspects.Jennifer Connelly has made good performances on other movies but not in here.Keanu Reeves is appropriately cold on his character and I honestly do not know if it was for his talent or the lack of it.But the worst member of the cast is Jaden Smith,who is irritating when he should be sympathetic,and forced when his character needs honesty.I think the best member of the cast is John Cleese,who shows he has not only talent for comedy,but also for serious roles.Believe me : I did not hate The Day the Earth Stood Still for being a poor re-interpretation of one of my favourite movies,but because it is bad by itself.The screenplay is full of inconsistencies,there are a lot of scenes very badly filmed and I did not have even the minimum level of tension and suspense.Come on,this film is bad even if we only take it as a Hollywood blockbuster and nothing else.I do not recommend this crappy and enormously boring remake.Instead,try to see the original film.
I like to see The Expendables saga tuning its screenplays with every new sequel, achieving what the first film couldn't: feeling like a concrete story, instead of poorly related vignettes whose only purpose is displaying the "special guest" in turn. The second film started with that positive change, and the third film continues on that path with a well built screenplay, making the famous cast to naturally integrate itself into the story. What gave me less taste in The Expendables 3 is the PG-13 rating, which indicates a considerable reduction in the quantity of blood shed. I don't mean the fact that the blood is indispensable in the making of a good film, but its absence is noticed in a franchise like this one. Fortunately, the intensity of the violence was incremented in enough degree in order to make us forget about the inconsistency of shooting hundreds and hundreds of bullets without a single drop of blood. And by the time we reach the exciting ending, I had already forgotten the fact I was watching a PG-13 film (not to mention that I had also forgotten the concept of "realism"). Director Patrick Hughes made a fluid work, taking us from one action scene to the other in a natural way, and, with one exception, there are many opportunities to take advantage of the cast. Talking about the cast, my only objection is the fact that the female character wasn't played by Gina Carano, but other MMA fighter, called Ronda Rousey. Needless to say that I don't know anything about her trajectory; she might be better as a ring athlete... but as an actress, she lacks of Carano's presence and talent. For the rest, I had a very good time while watching The Expendables 3, and I think it fulfilled with its mission of making a tribute to the '80s action cinema and preparing the road of future sequels I will have good expectations for, as long as they can combine humor, story and action with similar ease and diligence.
In 2005,the animation film Madagascar promised a little bit because,from its trailer,it seemed to promote a subtle and very important ecological message.The movie resulted to be a disappointment and every shadow of intelligence or sophistication was buried by stupid gags and weak references which were completely out of context and which they only worked as a replacement of good humor.But,that crappy film was economically successful,so we now have the sequel of it,which is equally bad and boring.This movie is nothing else than a rip-off of the first part.Its screenplay seems to have been written in two or three pages which were inflated with several musical parts and comedy routines which left to be funny 30 years ago.And,besides of that,we have obligatory elements,like forced drama,romance and a mission which will teach the animals lessons about love,friendship and life.In summary,another animation movie made with a very poor screenplay and which its only intention is to sell toys and make alliances with companies (like McDonald's).The only positive element from this film was the amazing animation.I did not rate this movie lower only for respecting the enormous effort the animators put.Madagascar : Escape 2 Africa is another mercenary movie,made with the only intention of winning money.It's OK to want to win money...anybody wants.But that's not an excuse for telling an extremely weak story.This movie made me yawn a lot.I would put it at the same level of the original.They are equally tedious and mercenary.
I was not very interested in watching 17 Again,but I decided to do it because of the presence of some solid comedians on the cast and the fact that it was directed by Burr Steers,who some years ago impressed me with the film Igby Goes Down pretty much.I obviously could not expect something as unpredictable and subversive on this family comedy,but I considered that his presence would add something interesting to the formula of "adult mind in a young body" as a possibility.Unfortunately it was not like that,and 17 Again resulted to be a boring rehash of the old formula.I think I have seen about 10 movies about body,minds or ages (whatever) exchanges,from the original Freaky Friday to its remake,without forgetting the wave of 80's movies with a similar story (Big; Like Father,Like Son; Vice Versa; Dream a Little Dream...have I forgotten any?).The first half of 17 Again is unbearably tedious,because it was constructed by elements from all the previously mentioned films.The second half gets a little bit better,but it is still boring.Besides,this movie is full of sentimental clich√©s we have seen many times,and the comedians whose work I enjoyed on other occasions (Matthew Perry,Melora Hardin and Nicole Sullivan) do not have much to do.Besides the episode from Saturday Night Live in which he participated and his role on the movie Hairspray (2007),I had not seen anywhere else to the famous Zac Efron,so I was not very familiar with his work.After having seen him for first time in a leading role in 17 Again,I have to say his performance lacks of weight and deepness,even though he shows some charisma.Like other juvenile actors (like Michael Cera or Jonah Hill),he seems to be destined to interpret the same character for a very long time,something which is not precisely bad...when the material is not bad.Unfortunately,17 Again qualifies as bad material, and it is a boring movie,which does not offer too many positive elements,so I do not recommend it.
Even though I am old and bitter, I can imagine the impact the film How to Train Your Dragon could have on a 5-year-old boy who goes to the cinema for his first time.This hypothetical boy may not know Harry Potter yet, he is not tired of seeing the same story again, and he neither has cultivated a deep cynicism as an answer to the condescendence Hollywood shows for the child spectators.From that innocent point of view, How to Train Your Dragon could be a good experience, with a message of tolerance and a young hero who must fight against his own insecurities in order to triumph over adversity.But to the cynical people like me who are tired of seeing the same formulas, How to Train Your Dragon is another tedious animation film.In this film, we have ANOTHER main character who feels misunderstood, isolated from his community and unable to please his father, until a magical event helps him to discover his potential and brings him the impulse to fulfill with his dream.Big yawn.To be fair, there are a few interesting small things on the screenplay, but the movie unfortunately does not deepen into them.In the technical aspect, the design from the characters is bland, but the animation itself and the special effects are well done.However, I cannot recommend How to Train Your Dragon, because it bored me and I did not like the story.In summary, another proof that, with some exceptions, the current quality of animation cinema in Hollywood is quite poor.
I highly doubt the fact that the next big step in cinema will be the 4K image projected through 48 c.p.s. (despite how much director Peter Jackson insists on that); neither will be the advance in digital cameras on a low cost; and even on a lesser degree will be the improvement of the 3D photography and projection. No, the following big step won't be on the technical aspects of cinema, but on a rethinking of the economical and creative schemes which nowadays support the entire industry. The proliferation of the "crowdsurcing" and "crowdfunding" is proving (for better or for worse) that the Internet puts the power in the hands of common people. In the past, the contribution of fans was limited to "web series" such as The Guild and Pioneer One; but we have been recently finding "real" movies financed with public donations (The Tunnel), through Kickstarter (the brilliant Absentia) or made in creative collaboration with its target audience, such as Iron Sky. Sure, this "creative collaboration" still needs to mature, but for the moment, this film is an undeniable evidence that it's possible to create cinema with interesting content and excellent manufacture without the interference of old-fashioned studios or intrusive executives.The "Nazis on the Moon" concept would have been been enough in order to make an amusing "retro" sci-fi movie; but co-screenwriters Michael Kalesniko and Timo Vuorensola (the latter was also the director) attempted to do something more relevant, and they took the route of the political satire in order to denounce the ideological extremism from some governors (or governor applicants) who exploit the racism and intolerance from people for their personal benefit, instead of promoting the common welfare. I understand the point of that message, and it definitely offers various valid (and very funny) observations...but I honestly felt that kinda unnecessary, because it sometimes ends up obstructing the most interesting and creative aspects of "alternative History" offered by the screenplay. The experience reminded me of the film Black Dynamite...it's totally different to Iron Sky regarding subject and style, but they both relied excessively on the satire, when their "pure" narrative elements would have been enough to make them very competent and entertaining movies.Regarding the science fiction angle, Iron Sky proposes interesting ideas as the endorsement of genuinely impressive images. The supposed existence of "Nazi UFOs" has been one of the most controversial and provocative subjects in contemporary "ufology", and even though that lacks of historical livelihood, I found it a very good starting point to elaborate the eccentric and imaginative screenplay from Iron Sky. I particularly liked the sub-plot about the teacher Renate Richter, who is part of the new generation of "Nazis" who have been educated under the precepts from that doctrine since they were children, and as a consequence, they don't have any malice when they talk about "racial purity" or when they are amazed by the existence of a black man. I found that an interesting subversion (or refutation, according to points of view) of the fascist subjects employed by the '50s sci-fi films. As for the special effects, they are definitely worthy of applause, because their high quality defies the film's low budget. They might not reach the level of The Avengers or Transformers, but they clearly show the potential of small studios with the necessary tools and talent in order to compete with Hollywood establishment without sacrificing the scale of the project or the realism of the images. I hope this works as an inspiration for a new generation of "DIY" ("Do It Yourself") filmmakers: the special effects don't save a film, but they always help to make it more attractive.In conclusion, I recommend Iron Sky as a very entertaining experience, in spite of the heaviness from its ideological discourse (don't misunderstand me...I agree with the political message; the problem was that, in my humble opinion, it should have been more subtle in order not to kinda dilute the solid sci-fi concepts which support it).
Race to Witch Mountain is one of that movies in which things happen.There may be a vague story behind the images,but we never feel the narrative propulsion which logically takes us scene after scene.On this movie,we simply see things happening after other ones,not to mention that,at the same time,it is also tremendously boring and irritating.Race to Witch Mountain is a remake which integrates elements from two movies : Escape to Witch Mountain and Return from Witch Mountain.I have seen that films but I honestly do not remember anything from them.So,Race to Witch Mountain counted with that plus,because before watching it,I knew it was going to be impossible to make comparisons.However,this film resulted to be very bad.Composer Trevor Rabin made his best effort to convince us with his music that we are seeing something exciting,sad,triumphal or whatever tone every scene wants to have.For example,when the movie shows us an extraterrestrial greenhouse,the music elevates to spielbergian heights of wonder and amazement,when we are in fact seeing a very cheap set.There are practically no redeeming elements on this movie.The action scenes are tremendously weak filmed,because they do not get even the minimum level of tension and suspense.Near the ending,Race to Witch Mountain shows us an unintentionally hilarious scene which tries to make us cry.In my case,I was laughing to tears on that scene,because I could not believe how pathetic it was.Race to Witch Mountain is a big piece of crap in which I wasted my time and my money,and that is what I mostly regret.Once more,the phrase "family movie" is used as an excuse to tell a completely stupid and illogic story,which insults the intelligence from the spectator.Avoid this movie at any cost.
I think it was a good idea to keep Captain America: The Winter Soldier on a more or less realistic level, with human antagonists and mundane threatens, instead of inventing something more "cosmic" such as in The Avengers (like writer Rick Remender is currently doing in the Captain America comic). But this film doesn't feel simple or lacking of ambition because of that; on the opposite, Captain America: The Winter Soldier might use a political thriller mask, but its secret identity is an epic superheroes story where the the huge battles have a deeper motivation than the destruction of buildings, and the global threatens don't come from a magalomaniac villain (well, a little bit), but from noble people with noble intentions (at least by their own opinion). I honestly didn't know what to expect from co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo, because their career is almost exclusively integrated by sitcoms. Sure, they are sitcoms I like very much (Community, Happy Endings, Arrested Development), but I didn't know whether they were going to be able to handle such a big and complicated project. Fortunately, my fears resulted to be unfounded, and I think that Captain America: The Winter Soldier ended up being one of the most solid Marvel movies in the narrative aspect, perfectly structured and with a good balance between the action and the emotional content. For example, in Iron Man 3, I couldn't swallow the convenient post- traumatic stress suffered by Tony Stark; but in the case of Steve Rogers, the nostalgia and pain of having lost his world is transmitted with more subtleness and dramatic effectiveness. That's partially due to Chris Evans' excellent performance, which feels mature and "modern", but never abandoning his character's innocence. The rest of the cast also brings a perfect work in their roles, and the screenplay brings them many opportunities to stand out in the action moments as well as in the interesting evolution of their characters. And, well, the special effects are really extraordinary... even better than the ones from The Avengers, not only because of their realism, but also because of the naturalness in which they were "shot". Sure, there are some "money shots" in order to leave us jaw-dropped, but the effects generally work as a complement of the narrative, and not as the center of attention. My only complaints are focused on the "political thriller" aspect. As I said, I liked the use of that formula, but on the other hand, it's similar to many political thrillers from the last 10 years, with some ornaments to integrate it to the Marvel Universe. The villain is a bit predictable, and the only thing missing was a cameo from Dick Cheney in order to make the message more evident (speaking of cameos, there are many of them which made me smile, and I'm not only talking about the one from the great Stan Lee). For the rest, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an excellent film I very enthusiastically recommend. I already want to see it again, and that didn't happen to me with all the Marvel films.
The satire is my favourite type of comedy because it is a tool for saying interesting things using intelligence and,of course,humor.Unfortunately,on recent years,that difficult type of comedy has been used by stupid filmmakers in some of the most intolerable "comedies" from this decade,like Date Movie,Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans.But,we never have to loose our hope,because there will always be some occult joys in the satire sub-genus,like now Hamlet 2.This is an excellent comedy which goes much more far away than making us laugh,pointing obvious things on an original way and giving important messages about people.This hilarious comedy makes a satire of a movie genre which has always existed but which has had a kind of resurrection in the last years : the teacher who finds a way to inspire on his students the intellect,the self-love and other aspects.But the great screenplay does not stop there because its acid and critic style also examines on a very funny way,aspects like the politic,the popular culture and the religion.The excellent comedian Steve Coogan has not found popularity outside his native England (Hollywood has wasted his big talent with small roles in films like Tropic Thunder and Night at the Museum).But,on this movie,Coogan is not wasted at all and he brings a magnificent performance,making his character very memorable.On the supporting cast,we have solid performances from Elisabeth Shue,Skylar Astin and the great Catherine Keener.The only fail I found on this movie is the ending,which was a little bit abrupt by my point of view.In spite of that minor fail,Hamlet 2 is an excellent comedy which is very entertaining and brutally incisive.One of the best movies from 2008.
I usually like the work of director Oliver Stone very much.My favourite movies from him are JFK,The Doors and Natural Born Killers,because they were audacious and explosive,at the same time they exposed valid messages.His film Nixon had disappointed me pretty much because it had lacked of any controversy and audacity and it had decided to make a moderate and bland biography without the incisive political vision Stone is accustomed to show.Now,W.,his new biography of a President of the United States,also made that mistakes,although I liked this film more than Nixon.W. looses any opportunity to show an acid and incisive political vision and it results a bland and moderate biography of Bush.Plus,I think this movie should have had a better edition on some parts,because some scenes are a little bit boring and irrelevant.Still,W. is a good film.On the one hand,Josh Brolin brings an excellent performance.The rest of the cast is also competent but the member who most stands out is undoubtedly Brolin.With the exception of some scenes,this movie is not boring because it generally has a dynamic style.W. is a good film...I do not deny it.But it disappointed me that the movie did not try to be as incisive as other Stone's films.Still,I moderately recommend this film.
Director and screenwriter Woody Allen's "European facet" continues with the brilliant film To Rome With Love, and while I was watching it, I think I found the factor which determines the quality from the films from this facet: when Allen employs the "spirit" from a city as an integral part of the narrative, the films end up being very good (Match Point, Cassandra's Dream, Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Midnight in Paris). But when he only employs the city in turn as a picturesque setting, the result is less solid (Scoop and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger). To Rome With Love belongs to the first group, and it definitely offers a charming and hugely entertaining experience which is full of the classic humor and acute observations which have identified Allen many times.Four short stories with romance, humor and a little bit of drama in order to remind us that not everything is as simple as it seems. That's the recipe Allen employed in here, and it works wonderfully well, because of his ability to present simultaneously strange and assimilable situations, inhabited by idealized characters, but with the precise balance of humanity in order for us to feel identified with their fears, ambitions and hopes. To Rome With Love employs a light, but not lacking of deepness, tone, and as a consequence, the frequent laughs are always accompanied by some message or reflection which enriches the experience and transcends the mere humorous intention from the stories. I guess every spectator will have his/her favorite segment according to their personal tastes and ideology (mine was the one with Allen himself, because besides of its likable characters, it also offers some extraordinary moments of surrealistic humor); but they all have something to say, and none of them feels as frivolous filler.And then we have the excellent performances brought by the whole cast, from the Hollywood stars (such as Allen, Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg and Judy Davis) to the Italian cast, represented by Roberto Benigni, Alessandra Mastronardi and Alessandro Tiberi, not to mention likable cameos from Ornella Muti and Antonio Albanese. I would particularly like to point out Fabio Armiliato's brilliant work. I also liked the unexpected use of Ellen Page as a "sexual predator" who is deceptively frail and modest. And Pen√©lope Cruz brings huge enthusiasm and absolute conviction to a character inspired by the Italian "hussy comedies" from the '70s.In conclusion, I enjoyed To Rome With Love very much. The only thing I can say against it is that some details feel a bit convenient. Nevertheless, I give an enthusiastic recommendation to this light but delicious Italian dish as one of Allen's best modern comedies.
The film Wrong Turn pleasantly surprised me for being a modest but very efficient tribute to the "rural horror" of the '70s (represented by films such as The Hills Have Eyes, Deliverance and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). The sequel Wrong Turn 2: Dead End was even superior to the first film for introducing bizarre post-modern humor and expanding the mythology of the deformed cannibal villains. However, the third film, called Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead, disappointed me very much, at the same time it ruined its ingenious premise of cops and thieves against fierce mutants. And now, we have the fourth part, titled Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings, and even though I would put it below the first two films of the saga, I liked it much more than the third one, at the same time that I generally had a good time while I was watching it.The characters from Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings are reasonably well defined, and they are not AS stupid as what we are accustomed to see in the horror genre. Besides, the performances show enough conviction, while the gory scenes are appropriately grotesque.On the negative side of Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings, we have logical holes in the screenplay, some brief moments of boredom, and an irritating deviation of the original setting, because instead of being developed in the remote woods of Virginia, most of the film is developed inside an abandoned hospital, which makes me suspect two things: 1) Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings is adapted from a screenplay which was originally written without the intention of being part of this franchise; or 2) director Declan O' Brien had to alter the locations when he found an excessively hostile weather in the woods of Manitoba (Canada), where the film was shot.Nevertheless, I liked Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings despite not being a highly memorable horror film, and it is pleasant to see this franchise again on the right track after the tedious third movie. In conclusion, I think this film is worthy of a moderate recommendation.
I do not know if it was because I have already seen too many "indie" films about normal people trying to overcome family tragedies, but the truth is that it took some time to me to "plunge" myself into the story of The Descendants. It is undoubtedly a solid film with excellent performances, very good direction and a screenplay which offers deep reflections about the marriage, the parental responsibility and even the human nature itself. However, I think that I have already become partially immune to this kind of stories, so I feel like needing something else, something which surpasses the typical family melodrama in order for me to feel that the movie transcended that common cinematographic niche.Director Alexander Payne is accustomed to work with this kind of tragicomedies focused on bizarre situations, simultaneously prosaic and unusual, and based on the unexpected reactions from their characters. Thanks to that narrative strategy, The Descendants works on an unpredictable way, adding sudden humor to sad moments, and surprising us with subtle melancholy on light scenes. Besides, the screenplay possesses that literary quality (maybe as a consequence of being based on a book) which separates it from the classic Hollywood formulas, but without removing the agile and satisfactory structure from a good movie.George Clooney brings an amazing performance in the leading role, leaving his "Hollywood star" image aside in order to be absolutely credible as a common man, who is overwhelmed by the circumstances but enough reasonable in order to overcome them...or at least to try it. I would also like to mention his "daughters" Amara Miller (making an impressive debut) and Shailene Woodley, whose perfect chemistry with each other expresses the classic relationship of affection and exasperation between the sisters. And I think the supporting cast also makes a solid work, highlighting Robert Forster as the main character's stern father-in-law; Judy Greer finally interpreting a character which takes advantage of her big histrionic talent; and Beau Bridges as a hearty cousin.And I also liked the way in which The Descendants captures the lifestyle in Hawaii. As frivolous as that might be, I think that that is the element which made me "plunge" into this film after a while. In conclusion, I would not consider The Descendants an excellent film (mainly because I think that the screenplay includes some forced details), but I enjoyed it pretty much nevertheless, and I can definitely recommend it for those people who like movies which are difficult to classify, but easy to enjoy because of their many attributes. In the context of Payne's filmography, I liked The Descendants more than Citizen Ruth and Sideways, but less than Election and About Schmidt.
On its simplest level, American Sniper is a war film of a solid manufacture, with perfectly defined good ones and evil ones and without any doubt about the causes or morality of the conflict. In other words, it's like any video-game (Call of Duty or Battlefield come to mind) with vaguely defined characters, abundant urban combat and simple but functional drama which outlines the most elementary emotions (guess what happens to the soldier who is excited for his wedding). Don't misunderstand me... I like those video-games very much, and I have enjoyed similarly unidimensional films, such as Lone Survivor and Act of Valor. But I think I expected more from American Sniper due to the difficult subjects handled by the screenplay and, specially, the controversial true events which inspired this film. Chris Kyle has been equally described as one of the biggest military heroes of the United States, and as a racist cold-blooded killer who murdered out of pleasure (not only during war, but supposedly also in New Orleans, during the looting after Katrina hurricane, even though this hasn't been confirmed), and he once said "I wish I had killed more people during war". For better or for worse, screenwriter Jason Hall decided to exclusively adopt the hero perspective, ignoring the problematic position of North American invasion in Iraq. I understand his commercial and narrative decisions; the fantasy sells better than the reality, and besides, we have already seen many movies which denounced the uncertainty of that conflict. However, American Sniper feels less like war cinema and more like propaganda. Unless director Clint Eastwood pretends to make another film which portrays the other side of this war (something like what he did with the diptych of Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima). But it doesn't seem he's going to do so. Anyway, this is a film review, and not a politics commentary, but those were my thoughts while I was watching American Sniper. For the rest, this is a decent and realistic war film with solid performances and fluid direction, even though the screenplay has an abundant number of clich√©s. On the positive side, the absence of a subtext helps us to get involved into the chaos of combat, and comprehend that old homily about war better: during the most difficult moments of battle, when every second can lead them to death from any direction, the soldiers don't fight for their country or abstract political ideals, but for their partners. However, on the other hand, I would have also liked to see an ideological foundation to support the skirmishes between collapsed buildings and patrols over the streets of Fallujah. Bradley Cooper brings a very good performance in the leading role, and Sienna Miller is also credible as the housewife who doesn't understand why his husband is so distant after his return to the United States. I wish I could mention more actors, but they weren't able to leave any impression in their hollow roles of friends or victims. In conclusion, American Sniper is a competent war film with an appropriate balance between drama and action, even though it's not very memorable in either of both aspects. Regarding war tales, I prefer the previously mentioned Act of Valor and Lone Survivor. As a drama about the psychological ravages of war, I liked The Hurt Locker much more. And regarding the true events of Kyle's life... I prefer not to give an opinion.
I have not read the book in which Eat Pray Love is based on, but it may have more substance and honesty than this artificial movie, which at least takes a slightly different road to the one of other female fantasies about international travel and exotic love (such as Under the Tuscan Sun and Letters to Juliet).The main virtue from Eat Pray Love is that it moves a bit (not too much) away from the obligatory romance in order to examine other factors in the lives of modern women...but it is still after all another one of many movies about the "big" problems from pretty, rich and successful people.Before watching Eat Pray Love, I was prejudiced to hate it, and even though it ended up having various of the fails I expected to find, it also has some moderately interesting elements I did not expect to find, such as ideas which contradict the classic formula of "love=happiness".It may not contradict it with enough conviction, but it was respectable to find a movie which is endorsed by a different perspective which goes a bit further than the trite "girl power" or the typical "big gesture" with which many chick-flicks conclude in our days.Besides, the film has good locations and nice cinematography.On the negative side, the screenplay has convenient coincidences, and it also feels affected and occasionally not very credible.In the leading role, Julia Roberts is adequate on some scenes, but forced on other ones.I would have preferred to see an actress with a bigger dramatic deepness interpreting that character, like for example, Naomi Watts or Cate Blanchett.The male cast made a good work; their characters are not very well written, but Billy Crudup, James Franco, Javier Bardem and Richard Jenkins bring solid performances.In conclusion, I think Eat Pray Love is a mediocre movie, but I consider it worthy of a slight recommendation, because it never bored me and it kept me moderately entertained.
It is truly impressive the longevity of the Saw franchise.The sixth part of any saga in horror cinema (or better said, on every genre) would probably be a cheap and forced sequel made straight-to-DVD.But the release in cinemas of Saw VI shows the confidence the studio Lionsgate has to this saga.However, many people (including me) put the validity of that confidence in doubt, because Saw V had been pretty bad (even worse than Saw III) and it damaged the saga because of its forced twists, uninteresting characters and an excessively confusing story.So, I honestly went to see Saw VI with very little enthusiasm, expecting that it would definitely mark the end of my interest in this franchise.However, Saw VI ended up being better than I expected, and although it has various forced elements on its screenplay, screenwriters Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton made the good decision of returning the formula to its origins, with a new cruel and bloody "game", but endorsed by the villain's intention, avoiding the movie to become hollow.At the difference of Saw IV and V, I think this time it is not necessary to have a PhD on Jigsaw in order to completely understand the story, and that's definitely a good point, because the story results more comprehensible.Besides, Saw VI is much more entertaining than part V.To start with, there is not any manipulation of time or tricks which cheat to our perception.The story is easy to follow and most of the scenes happen on real time.Of course, there are two twists at near the end of the movie; one of them is a bit predictable, and the other one is kinda ingenious, but it feels irrelevant in the context of the movie.The performances are properly intense and the special effects are grotesque and creative, as always.As I said before, Saw VI ended up being better than I expected, and I think it is the second best movie from this franchise (the first position still belongs to the brilliant first part).I recommend this film, because although the final experience may not be highly memorable, it made me have a good time.
I went to see The Double with neutral expectations, but it ended up being a pleasant surprise, because of a solid screenplay in the purest tradition of B cinema, two competent performances and good direction.The veteran who returns for one last job; the rookie who has to get trained in the "battlefield"; the expert murderer with a pending case...it's obvious that The Double was prepared with the same ingredients of an uncountable number of thrillers; but the astute screenplay incorporates some unexpected twists which kept me in suspense till the end. There's one big twist during the first half hour of The Double, and for a moment, I was worried about the fact that co-screenwriters Michael Brandt (who was also the director) and Derek Haas had ruined the film; but it fortunately happened the opposite, because the early revelation of a certain detail changes the dynamic between the main characters, and puts their motivations in doubt until the end itself, when we have new surprises which perfectly tie the loose ends, and we realize that everything was precisely planned from the beginning.Richard Gere and Topher Grace bring credible and enthusiastic performances in the leading roles. On the opposite, Martin Sheen seems to have participated only in order to charge a paycheck. Another negative element is that some details in the "Cassius" investigation feel a bit forced. Nevertheless, I can recommend The Double as an exciting and very entertaining film with various positive elements.
The Joneses begins with the arrival of a perfect family to a perfect community, with elegant houses, manicured courtyards and friendly neighbors; needless to say that the things are not like they seem. Like many other movies, The Joneses pretends to show us the dark side of the life in the idyllic North American suburbs, and it puts the focus on transmitting a message about the infinite ambition from modern marketing in order to make us automaton consumers, guided by the impulse and not by the reason.Many other films, books and TV series have censored the blind consumerism which infects the humanity; The Joneses comes too late to the party, and besides of that, it does not go as far as it should in order to provoke a genuine impact on the spectator. However, the message keeps feeling valid, and I also liked the humanity that screenwriter Derrick Borte (who was also the director) brought to the characters. Nevertheless, it could be said from another point of view that the emphasis on the characters' relationships with each other withdraws force to the satire, and as a consequence, I could not feel an adequate connection between both aspects.I think that the performances are this film's main pro. I think that David Duchovny already surpassed the stigmata of Agent Mulder thanks to his work in independent films and in the excellent TV series Californication; I think his performance in The Joneses shows him equally credible. As for Demi Moore, she reminds us that she is not only a celebrity, but also a solid actress whenever she works with the right material. Her work in The Joneses is subtle and honest, something which can perfectly express the internal conflict her character has during the whole movie. And I also liked the performances from Gary Cole and Glenne Headly pretty much.In conclusion, the lack of focus from the screenplay, its bland satire and its weak ending make The Joneses not to be a very satisfactory film. However, I can give it a slight recommendation because it kept me moderately entertained because of the solid performances and some interesting aspects from the screenplay.
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is an entertaining and funny movie, but it did not leave me completely satisfied, because it contains more style than substance.The screenplay from Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is not very logical, and it only works as an excuse to bring a constant parade of imaginative scenes full of likable visual details, from the onomatopoeia from the comics (POW, SOCK) to fights filmed with the Mortal Kombat style, with a marker, "combos" and an imperative narrator ("Fight!"). However, Edgar Wright's energetic direction, the irreverent humor and the good performances were enough to keep me entertained, despite the hollow screenplay and the lack of real emotions which should be inspired by the characters.I know that Michael Cera has many haters with his eternal attitude of a sensible nerd; I am not of those people, and I found him perfect in the leading role from Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, because his energy and affable personality made me to like his character. Some people may say that Cera does not have a very good physical development during the action scenes, but I do not think that is something negative, because that fits into the epic fantasy from his character.The rest of the actors also fits perfectly into their characters: Mary Elizabeth Winstead is absolutely credible as a "geek" girlfriend; Kieran Culkin is funny as the main character's homosexual friend; and Anna Kendrick achieves a perfect combination between the affection and exasperation her character has with her brother. And I could go on mentioning the whole cast, because all the actors fit well on their characters.So, in conclusion, I had a good time while watching Scott Pilgrim vs. the World; I just wish it had endorsed its gags, visual tricks and pop references with bigger narrative and emotional substance. In summary, I liked it, but I found it to be a bit hollow.
Let's accept it: even if Knight and Day had been a good film, it would have been difficult to convince Tom Cruise's haters to leave their prejudices aside and enjoy this Hollywood film with the open mind and wanting to have fun.The problem is that Knight and Day is a pathetic film, and Cruise's presence only worsens the horrible screenplay, not to mention James Mangold's listless direction, which undoubtedly lost the reins from this hollow and tedious story about espionage and romance.Despite what I said on the first paragraph, I do not hate Cruise.I do not care about his personal life and religious preferences; I admit I liked various movies he has been involved in (my favorite one is Magnolia, by the way), and that I appreciate his talent as an actor (not to mention the big sense of humor he showed in Tropic Thunder).However, he is not one of those actors who are able to "rescue" a movie with their mere presence, and Knight and Day is a very clear example of that.The irritating story is an arbitrary parade of action scenes and exotic locations which are joined by the weakest narrative thread; it seems as if Mangold and screenwriter Patrick O'Neill thought we were going to swallow any narrative deficiency only because of the millionaire smiles from Cruise and Cameron Diaz.Unfortunately, they were wrong, because there are not any white teeth or blue eyes which can compensate the disastrous screenplay or the very poor direction.As for the chase scenes, I found them to be laughable, because the cars look like toys, since they fly through the air and they make impossible maneuvers which manifest their lack of mass and inertia; I have played video-games with much more realistic and attractive vehicular physics.My expectations before watching Knight and Day were low, and I was prepared to get myself satisfied with a disposable "summer flick", as long as it had some ingenuity, nice characters and an at least moderate level of entertainment.Unfortunately, this movie could not even fulfill with that, and the result is an authentic film disaster.So, needless to say I suggest you to avoid Knight and Day, because I am truly sorry of having wasted my time and my money on this film.
Despite not being a great movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was an entertaining film, but it was Johnny Depp's extraordinary performance as Captain Jack Sparrow what made it seem much better than what it really was. That character resonated strongly with many spectators, and I guess that that was the reason why two sequels were made, which were equally successful, but increasingly scrambled and incoherent. I mean...did someone really care about the romance between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, the betrayal from Captain Norrington, or Davy Jones' heart? Maybe (finally) recognizing that fact, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the greedy executives from Walt Disney Pictures decided to make a fourth part exclusively focused on Sparrow, cutting all the superfluous elements out in order to bring us a pirates adventure with a charismatic actor in the leading role. Sounds perfect...in theory. Unfortunately, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides makes similar mistakes from the ones of its two predecessors (even though in a lesser degree), by incorporating useless sub-plots, an excessive number of characters and insipid romance.Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a typical "quest movie", dotted by arbitrary action, fight and chase scenes adorned by the magnificent special effects from Industrial Light & Magic (along with nine additional studios!) and by Hans Zimmer's loud music, which acquires ridiculously epic proportions every time a sword is drawn or kicks are exchanged. It seems like if director Rob Marshall knew the fact that the movie does not generate too much emotion or suspense, so the music tries to convince us that we are having a lot of fun, when in fact, I did not feel very "hooked" by the movie and I even occasionally snoozed. And I think that the main reason of that is the screenplay. The dialogs are redundant and occasionally unnecessary, because they simply repeat what we already knew, what is evident and what we had already guessed. The story is not very complicated by itself; but, as I said on the beginning, the excess of characters and sub-plots entangles the story much more than the necessary, and instead of incrementing the drama, that only increases the indifference for the story.Nevertheless, I have to say that I liked Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides a bit more than the two previous films. The purpose from the characters is clear during the whole movie, and the various fails from the screenplay did not avoid me from being (with a few exceptions) moderately entertained with the film. Ian McShane brings a very good performance as the villain, because he keeps a solid balance of humor, madness and evilness. On the other side of the coin, I could not swallow Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey at all in the characters Phillip and Syrena (respectively). I found them irritating and lacking of any charisma, and what is more, their characters feel like an obligatory glue in order to satisfy the teenagers who are looking for a dose of innocuous romance.As for Depp, I think he already visited the character too many times, and he cannot bring the same spirit of mischief and irreverence which made Captain Sparrow memorable in the first movie. However, I think that he could bring a competent and likable performance in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Pen√©lope Cruz seems to only have participated in order to charge a juicy paycheck. She is an undoubtedly excellent actress, but it it easy to notice that she was not very interested in her character in here.Besides of Disney's commercial ambition, I did not see any point for the existence of this fourth part. It is a bit superior than the two previous films and it kept me moderately entertained in general, but the screenplay lacks of energy, there is not too much tension nor laughs, and the supernatural elements look like whims from co-screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio to facilitate their job, and not to make the adventure more interesting. In summary, I do not regret having watched it, but I would not have suffered in case I skipped it.
With his brother Paul, Chris Weitz co-directed Down to Earth and About a Boy, which despite not being highly memorable movies, were enough entertaining in order to have a good time. However, he later made the tedious The Golden Compass and the mediocre The Twilight Saga: New Moon. Now, Weitz decided to make his incursion into the "serious" cinema with the film A Better Life, which deals with undoubtedly valid subjects regarding the problems from the Mexican immigrants in the United States...however, the movie did not leave me very satisfied due to its limited narrative ambition.As I previously mentioned, I appreciate the valid message from A Better Life, as well as its intention of showing the working and honest side from the immigrants, defying the stereotypes of gangsters or drug dealers. However, I think that screenwriter Eric Eason diluted the complexity from the story until reaching the level of a Mexican soap-opera. I think that this film should have been more honest and realistic, and with a less simplified narrative. Besides, Eason included some questionable elements in order to facilitate the drama, from improbable coincidences to absurd omissions of the common sense.Nevertheless, I found A Better Life moderately interesting, mainly because of the excellent performances from the two leading actors. Demi√°n Bichir is absolutely credible and efficient, because he can perfectly express the multiple contradictions his character has to face without the need of words. And I think that Jos√© Juli√°n also made a perfect work in his role.In conclusion, I can give A Better Life a slight recommendation, despite the multiple cons from its screenplay which make the film not very satisfactory. Going back to the initial subject from this review, I think that Weitz made a superior work in A Better Life than the one he made in his two previous films; nevertheless, I wish he had picked a better screenplay to work with.
Back in 1978, the film I Spit on Your Grave (also known as Day of the Woman) provoked controversy due to its violence, gore and for daring to show a woman taking revenge on her own hands against the louts who raped her. As the time went by, the film became into a cult classic, not so much due to its intrinsic merits, but for having been censored (or forbidden) in many countries, something which helped to make it more popular. Personally, I respect its influence on horror cinema, but into the sub-genus of "female revenge", I prefer movies like Thriller: A Cruel Picture and Ms. 45, because I found them to be better written, acted and directed.However, I Spit on Your Grave (1978) is definitely an intense and visceral experience thanks to its semi-amateur manufacture, rural locations and realistic style. Besides, the revenge methods from the main character seemed like a direct answer to the then rising slasher cinema, something which brought an additional level to the narrative. So, with all that "cultural baggage" carried by I Spit on Your Grave, how would a modern remake work? Considering the standards of the contemporary horror cinema, we can be sure that it will be more brutal and cruel; but would it reach the same historical and emotional impact from the original film? Even though the answer ended up being "no", I have to admit that on its own merit, I Spit on Your Grave (2010) is a disturbing, satisfactory and very competent horror film.As I expected, I Spit on Your Grave (2010) adds more blood and some new narrative elements. Some of them feel a bit irrelevant (for example, the destiny of the camera with which the rape is filmed), but other ones deepen into the private life from the villains, revealing the hypocrisy of monsters who disguise their evilness with a facade of respectable civilization. However, the biggest change is made on the main character's revenge, which adds a very interesting psychological component to the movie. Fortunately, I Spit on Your Grave (2010) remains within a plausible field, and even though it follows the torture-porn formula, the cruelty and grotesque violence feel justified and organic in the story. I truly appreciate the fact that screenwriter Stuart Morse found an appropriate variation which respects the original formula, at the same time he added a new subtext which avoids the film from being another hollow torture film.So, despite not being a great horror film and having some fails, I Spit on Your Grave (2010) is a very interesting horror film which ended up being better than I expected. The first half of the film is very disturbing and impossible to "enjoy" in the conventional sense of the word; however, the second half is cathartic and very satisfactory, compensating the suffering we had to go through previously. In conclusion, I recommend it unless you are a sensible person.
I have complained many times about the films which pretend to capture the same childish spirit from Harry Potter. However, the flood of Harry Potter imitators seems to have diminished in recent months. The reason? The success of the Twilight saga provoked a "change of direction" from the Hollywood executives, and instead of exploring variations of "magic boys save the world", they are now desperately searching for new instances of "forbidden romances between teenagers with supernatural powers". For better or for worse, I Am Number Four belongs to this nascent sub-genus, and I found it to be boring and lacking of any emotion and originality.I Am Number Four covers a well-known ground from the fantastic cinema as well as from the juvenile romance one. And I am not precisely against of that; director D.J. Caruso previously made two unoriginal but dynamic and entertaining movies (Disturbia and Eagle Eye), something which gave me hopes of finding some redeemable elements in I Am Number Four. Unfortunately, very few things worked in this movie (at least in my personal experience), because I could never get interested in the characters or in their forced romance, and much less in the horribly trite sci-fi concepts with which it pretends to adorn its tiring narrative.To start with...Mogadorians? Was that the best name which came to mind to author Pittacus Lore (in fact a pseudonym of Jobie Hughes and James Frey) for the villains of the book on which this movie was based? Sure, the name by itself does not have too much importance, but it is a good example of the creativity level from the whole film. The heroes are handsome young people who look like models; the villains are bald and pale, with piranha teeth, and they suffer from the "talkative villain syndrome", revealing their plans or talking more than they should when they could easily exterminate the heroes.One of the few things I liked in I Am Number Four is Teresa Palmer's energetic performance. In fact, I think the film would have been much more entertaining with her in the leading role, instead of the insipid couple of Alex Pettyfer and Dianna Agron. However, I cannot recommend this film, because I found it to be bland, repetitive and tedious.
I do not wanna make unfair comparisons between this new version of The Karate Kid and the famous original film, because even though that one is undoubtedly one of the most iconic films from the 80's, I have personally never found it to be exceptional or very memorable.So, I was not upset by the various changes screenwriter Christopher Murphey made to this modern interpretation, starting by the new setting of the story, its melodrama and the change from "karate" to "kung fu".The problems I had with this horrible new version mainly were its poor screenplay, its lazy rhythm and the lack of enthusiasm and credibility from almost all the actors.But, most of all, I was bothered by the "americanism" from the story, which irritated me a lot during the excessive running time (140 minutes) from this film.In summary, I could never get interested in what was happening during this predictable and tedious movie.The first hour from The Karate Kid bored me to tears because it constantly shows us the discontent from the kid, his difficulties to adapt himself to the new setting and his antipathetic attempts to being "cool".Fortunately, after all that, Jackie Chan appears, and his credible performance is one of the few positive elements from the movie.However, the whole screenplay is so bad that his presence does not improve the movie too much...instead of being atrocious like in the first hour, the film is "only" horrible in the remaining time.So, all in all, the final experience of The Karate Kid (2010) is truly hateful.But, I guess nobody is going to watch The Karate Kid (2010) to appreciate the subtleness from the drama, but to watch an inspiring story about overcoming and martial arts.And the movie also fails on that aspect, because we have already seen TOO MANY movies about brave "losers" who overcome to themselves with effort and dedication with the help of friendly mentors.In summary, The Karate Kid (2010) is a piece of crap which is tedious, bland and even antipathetic.In other words, my best suggestion is for you not to watch this movie.
I generally try to give the benefit of the doubt to the films based on successful juvenile novels, assuming the fact that the book was good, but it had problems in its transition to cinema. However, in the case of Insurgent (and, from what I have seen, the entire saga), it's hard for me to believe that the novel was more comprehensible or logical, and that only because of Hollywood mistakes, it became this confusing parade of vaguely connected scenes with irrelevant characters whose importance is never established, or whose function isn't clearly specified. As a simple spectator who hasn't memorized or even read the books, I found Insurgent terribly obtuse, boring and absolutely lacking of any emotion or interest. The main character from Insurgent feels like a passive puppet who only weakly reacts before her insecurities and the conflictive tide of events which round on her, getting into trouble and situations from which she has to be rescued. In other words, the main character is a damsel in distress who only stands out inside the imaginary world of "simulations" (don't ask me to explain them), in which she makes exploits and stunts which are laughable due to their exaggeration and the insipid special effects through which they were made. The action seems more appropriate for a Tom and Jerry cartoon than for a supposedly solemn saga, in which the supporting characters constantly die in a useless attempt to create the dramatic impact the screenplay is never able to evoke. After such many chases, betrayals and tedious action, it is revealed (SPOILER? I'm not sure and I'm not interested in confirming it either) the fact that the villain is after the main character because only she, with her divergent ability (or whatever it is), will be able to open a McGuffin which contains a secret message about the founders of the ridiculous futuristic society divided into "factions". For a moment, I had the hope that the "revelation" would bring some sense to the previous two hours of filler and special effects, but after all, it doesn't solve anything, and only confirms the general stupidity of the premise, which had already been pretty questionable in Divergent, the previous film of this saga. While reading this review, some people might be thinking "You can't give an opinion if you haven't read the books". However, I went to see a film, and this was my reaction. Maybe, if I had minutely studied the novels and known the personal story of every tiny character who says two lines in order to later disappear (or arbitrarily die), it would have been easier for me to follow the story and understand why it was necessary to give such many turns to the story without reaching something more concrete or interesting. Anyway, the point is that, in my personal case, Insurgent was an unbearable experience, and I truly regret having watched it.
The advertising images of The Signal made me think it was going to be a biological horror film, but in fact, the film ended up being something much more complicated than that. This film offers beautiful images and very good special effects, but it doesn't rely on them in order to capture our attention. On the opposite, the emphasis is on the enigmatic story, in which some classic elements of science fiction take new shapes and perspectives in order to create something unique and fascinating. It's convenient not to reveal anything about the story of The Signal, because its main pro is the constant confrontation of unexpected situations which keep us on a delicious suspense, trying to guess what is going on, but with the overwhelming sensation that it will be stranger than what we expect. The Signal might make a few small traps, but that's a minor complaint which doesn't demerit the admirable achievements from this film. Brenton Thwaites, Olivia Cooke and Beau Knapp bring solid performances and have a perfect chemistry with each other, immediately making us believe the affection between their characters, while Laurence Fishburne brings conviction and an imposing gravity to his role. In conclusion, I liked The Signal very much, and I enthusiastically recommend it as an intelligent science fiction film.
I liked the film Sin City very much because it emulated the images from the iconic comic with an amazing precision and beauty, and because it respected its melodramatic tone, perfectly balanced between a sincere tribute to the "noir" genre and a warm parody which didn't have to be taken very seriously, despite its sordid subjects and stylized violence. And now, the sequel/prequel Sin City: A Dame to Kill For tried to repeat the formula, but the result is extremely far from reaching the impact and excitement from the first movie. That might be because the visual style doesn't look as attractive as it did in Sin City (even though the special effects techniques and tools have improved during the 9 years which have gone by after it), or due to the inefficient distribution of short stories, less connected than they were before and with an emotional climax which comes half an hour before the end of the film, leaving the rest as simple filler which doesn't reach the necessary catharsis in order to feel like a satisfactory conclusion. Or the problem might be the fact that two new stories were specially written for the film, and they hadn't been published in the comic format, so therefore, they don't totally fit into the impressionistic narrative which made those graphic novels so popular. Anyway, the point is that Sin City: A Dame to Kill For isn't a very satisfactory film, despite being moderately entertaining and offering good performances from most of the cast. The actors we had already seen in Sin City take total possession of their characters, highlighting Mickey Rourke, Powers Boothe and Rosario Dawson. As for the new faces, I particularly want to mention the solid performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and, specially, Eva Green, who makes an extraordinary work as the "femme fatale". The only weak spot of the cast is Josh Brolin, who feels a bit forced in his character. Oh, and I have to give bad news to the fans of Lady Gaga's: what she she does in this movie is an irrelevant 2-second cameo. In conclusion, I can give a slight recommendation to Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, but it completely lost everything which had made the first film magical. As a comparison point, I consider it very superior to The Spirit, and at the same level of 300: Rise of an Empire... another sequel which was made for the money instead of genuine artistic passion.
Ghosts of Girlfriends Past uses elements from the classical book A Christmas Carol for dressing a typical romantic comedy which has nothing special to offer.There are two reasons why it is appropriate to use the supernatural subject : first,because director Mark Waters obtained some economical success using a ghost premise with the movie Just Like Heaven; and second,because the unreal addition of ghosts complements the forced fantasy which works as a basis for the story : a happily single man who discovers he has wasted his life on quick relationships,when the true happiness is on the marriage.When I say that Ghosts of Girlfriends Past uses elements from the book A Christmas Carol,I am talking about the visits of ghost to make the main character to think about his life.Let's leave aside the message about conformism and the fantasy that the woman redeems the man thanks to her love and perseverance.What it matters is that Ghosts of Girlfriends Past is a very mediocre film whose main fail is its total lack of any ambition.Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Garner do not seem to be too interested on their characters,so their performances lack of energy and conviction.But the supporting cast is solid,and it added some points to this movie.My favourite performances from this movie come from Michael Douglas,Lacey Chabert and the always entertaining Robert Forster.I think that female spectators are going to appreciate this movie much more than me.But,from the narrative aspect,I did not like this movie,because it is full of clich√©s and it gets quickly boring.On Waters' filmography,there are two very competent comedies (Mean Girls and Freaky Friday),but the irreverent humor which made them very entertaining is completely absent on this movie.Instead of irreverent humor,Ghosts of Girlfriends Past offers us recycled jokes (like the wedding pie which was accidentally destroyed),romantic clich√©s (the obligatory gesture which solved everything at last moment) and generic characters.So,in sight of so many negative elements,I cannot recommend Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.
Director McG has many (many, many) haters, but I generally like his movies. I don't consider him a "misunderstood genius", nor anything similar; I just generally find his exuberant visual style and frantic energy entertaining. I found Charlie's Angels and its sequel amusing parodies of the action cinema; I liked Terminator Salvation for having found an interesting angle to the franchise; and We Are Marshall...well, that one was mediocre. Anyway, I can't defend McG with This Means War, his most recent film, because it ended up being truly horrible.The most important problem from This Means War is its screenplay, which I found incredibly weak and predictable (if you don't guess during the first minutes which one of the two gallants will stay with the girl, you haven't seen any romantic comedy in your whole life). The humor lacks of any spontaneity, the jokes are terribly predictable, and the performances are pathetic, specially Reese Witherspoon's, which feels so false and studied that I hated her character even more than the two gallants.The action scenes lack of any suspense or emotion. There are various fights, chases and explosions, but everything is so uninspired that I wouldn't be surprised if editors Nicolas De Toth and Jesse Driebusch made a confusion with the reels and included in this film scenes from Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Knight and Day, Killers, or any other deplorable "action romantic comedy".It's easy to note that nobody that worked in This Means War put any effort to it, and that makes it a horrible film which I suggest you to avoid by any means.
Eden Lake is a mediocre rehash of the torture horror films, which were pretty popular a few years ago.The film is not bad, but I found it a bit tiring to see the maniacs torturing normal people who have to become in similar monsters to survive again.However, I have to admit the film has some good moments of tension and it did not bore me.The first 20 minutes work well, because they make a good introduction of the main characters.Besides, actors Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbender bring adequate works.When the conflict starts, the movie follows the expected curse, with moments of suspense and some convenient coincidences which feel very forced and break the flow of the story.And then, we have the ending...Does screenwriter James Watkins (who is also the director) bring us a happy ending or a sad one? Of course I am not going to mention which one of those two he chooses, but it honestly does not matter too much, because the ending feels as a simple whim from Watkins, and not as a logical conclusion.And finally, as in many torture films, the villains are generic, because they do not have any motivation to torture people...they just do it because the screenplay says so.However, in spite of its many fails, I think Eden Lake deserves a slight recommendation, mainly because it is never boring.This film is not bad...it is simply more from the same.
I perfectly remember the first time in which I saw the trailer of A Nightmare on Elm Street in the cinema back in 1984, because it had left me perplexed and intensely interested in that strange villain with supernatural powers, who had nothing in common with Jason Voorhess, Michael Myers and the uncountable clones who were part of the "slasher" cinema from that time.I remember that even after going out of the cinema, instead of thinking of the movie I had just seen (I do not remember at all which one it was), I was thinking of the trailer of A Nightmare on Elm Street, at the same time I was analyzing theories about the origins of the mysterious monster.I first thought he was a sorcerer; then, my theory was changed, and I thought of a ghost.Anyway, I had never seen scenes like the one of the tongue going out of the phone, or the one in which the stairs become into a viscous liquid.I had to wait various months to see the movie, but I was sure it was going to be something special.I mentioned those old memories because I think it is impossible for the contemporary spectators to feel the same anticipation for A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010), the new version of that extraordinary horror film.The first mistake from this pathetic remake is trying to re-invent a too famous character, with a solid presence in the popular conscience, and whose most recent film is only 7 years old (the unmemorable but entertaining Freddy Vs. Jason).Besides, as dictated by modern tendency, director Samuel Bayer stays away from the style evoked by 80's horror cinema in order to make a more violent, brutal and "realistic" movie, ignoring the sinister personality from the villain and the grotesque surrealism from the original film.So, the result is a bland and totally unnecessary rehash which fails on its attempt of resurrecting the franchise, and at the same time, it is absolutely tedious.I will assure you that I went to see A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) without prejudices or unfair comparisons with the original film, but when the movie started, it was very difficult for me not to make them, because it insists on reproducing classic scenes without any other motive than satisfying the fans of the original film (needless to say it did not achieve it).What is more, the movie never provoked on me even the minimum levels of emotion, horror or suspense.I will attribute a big part of the problem to Bayer, whose poor narrative sense cannot integrate the scenes on a fluid whole.That is a classic symptom of directors with a wide experience on TV commercials and video-clips, where the emphasis is on the images, and not on the flow of a story.So, his efforts on the visual aspect from A Nightmare on Elm Street are irrelevant, because they never complement a story told with a good rhythm.And besides of that, the juvenile cast brings bad performances.Between all of them, they cannot construct even a pinch of personality, and their poor attempts of drama are reduced to shouting, groaning and saying the "F" word as many times as possible.As for the rest of the cast, the competent actor Clancy Brown is absolutely wasted with a too brief and almost invisible participation; and I now have to talk about the new Freddy: Jackie Earle Haley.After the good answer he had with Watchmen, there were big expectations on his interpretation of the new Freddy Krueger.Unfortunately, the screenplay did not give Haley too much space to develop his character, so he stays on the typical "monster of the week", buried under a stylish make-up which is something like a combination between a turtle and Gary Oldman in the film Hannibal.My expectations for A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) were pretty low, and the movie ended up being even worse than I expected because of its lack of ambition, hollow direction and the pathetic performances from the juvenile cast.This remake is one of those movie in which I really feel I wasted my time and my money, and which as a consequence, I regret having watched it.And what is more, it is hugely boring.So, do not make the same mistake I did and do not watch it.
Before watching Bachelorette, I expected to find a cheap imitation of Bridesmaids, and that ended up being true to some point. The subject is pretty much the same (bridesmaids planning a friend's wedding), the type of humor is similar, and both films even share a same supporting actress (Rebel Wilson). On its own merit, I found Bachelorette a moderately entertaining but mediocre comedy with a screenplay which includes many forced and improbable elements.Screenwriter Leslye Headland (who was also the director) employs the comedy as a sporadic seasoning in Bachelorette, putting the emphasis on the personal drama from the main characters. Regan has a boyfriend (or at least she says so), but there's obviously too much distance among them (physical as well as emotional), something which spreads bitterness to all her other relationships. Gena lives into a vicious circle of alcoholism and fleeting sexual encounters which only increment her frustration and wishes of drinking. And Katie is so accustomed to employ her body as a tool of social advance that there doesn't seem to be too much brain left into her head. So, even though there are many "funny" scenes with misunderstandings, vulgarities and a broken wedding dress, I appreciated the evolution of those characters until leading to the point of catharsis more.On the other hand, I might be over-analyzing what is a mediocre comedy. As I previously said, there are various forced elements in the screenplay, as well as predictable and tiring jokes (ho, ho, women speaking of sex...How controversial!). However, this film didn't bore me, mainly because of the solid performances. Lizzy Caplan is able to express internal pain behind the cynical smile from her face. Isla Fisher seems to repeat her usual role of a dumb young woman, but she adds a touch of desperation in here which feels appropriate. And Wilson is also credible in her role, despite playing quite a weakly written character. However, I think Kirsten Dunst brings the best performance of Bachelorette. I have always considered her an excellent actress, and after seeing her wasted in the tedious Melancholia, I liked to re-discover her in a more mature stage in Bachelorette, competently expressing her character's deep dysfunction. I don't know why Dunst doesn't work more frequently, but I would like her to.So, Bachelorette isn't a very good comedy, but I can give it a slight recommendation because of the good performances and some interesting aspects of the screenplay.
The films about female revenge represent a slope from "B" cinema (and occasionally, from the "A" one), from classics like Ms. 45 and I Spit on Your Grave (1978) to modern interpretations such as The Brave One and Kill Bill. Nurse 3-D partially fits into that category, but its uncertain screenplay blurs the premise with a strange duality, making the main character simultaneously a heroin and a villain. On the one hand, it seems like an audacious strategy which craftily reveals the grey morality from these female revenge tales; but on the other hand, I think that it destroys the balance of the film and confuses the audience's loyalty: Must we support the main character's psychosis and celebrate the bloody murder of misogynists and adulterers? Or is she just an out-of-control serial killer who must be stopped before she kills more "innocent" men who only committed the sin of cheating their couples? That sounds interesting on paper; but in the shape of a film, it ends up being too unstable. Worsening the situation, Paz de la Huerta brings an atrocious performance in the leading role; she feels so rigid and monotonous that it's impossible to take her melodramatic monologues seriously... specially when they look like excuses for her to take her clothes off. With one exception, the supporting cast also brings weak works, specially the most famous members: Judd Nelson and Kathleen Turner. The exception I previously mentioned is Katrina Bowden, who brings a credible performance as the rookie nurse who had the bad (or good?) luck of attracting the main character as a mentor and protector. Bowden had already left me a good impression in Tucker & Dale vs. Evil and Piranha 3DD, and she confirms her talent in Nurse 3-D. In summary, Nurse 3-D is a mediocre film, but at least, it managed to keep me moderately entertained. I think that the combination of feminist subjects and an exploitation tone is an interesting contrast which deserved a deeper analysis than the one from this film. In other words, I think those ideas could have been better integrated, maybe on a different format (less horror and more thriller). Nevertheless, I give Nurse 3-D a slight recommendation as a disposable but moderately interesting horror film.
The dramas which show the tribulations from a marriage generally bore me, unless they have a solid narrative "hook" which transcends the tragic but predictable process of the loss of love. That is the reason why I had low expectations before watching Blue Valentine, despite the very enthusiastic reviews I had read about it, because it looked exactly like what I described: a movie which does not portray anything else than the romantic failure from a couple. However, the brilliant screenplay, the perfect direction and the monumental performances evoke such intense emotions that I ended up finding Blue Valentine a great and absolutely memorable film.In some way, the absence of a narrative "hook" is what gives Blue Valentine force...there is not an infidelity (like in Far From Heaven); there is not any dark social rancor (like in Revolutionary Road), nor a middle age crisis (like in American Beauty). And there does not even seem to be hate nor (at least physical) violence in the couple. In other words, there are not any malicious villains nor helpless victims (well, with the exception of the couple's little daughter); just passive sacrifices in the altar of the routine which wears and finally extinguishes even the most intense romantic enthusiasm. Blue Valentine shows us the fallacy from that feeling, and how easy it is for many people to get carried away by it without questioning the other factors which will eventually define the relationship.What is more, Blue Valentine displays Derek Cianfrance's excellent direction, which perfectly captures the key moments in the emotional trip from the main characters with sordid detail. And his direction is fantastically complemented by the wonderful performances from Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, two great actors who have always shown a predilection for difficult and complex characters, such as the ones they interpret in here. Their work is perfect, subtle when it must be and intense during the scenes which provoke the biggest emotional impact. And at the same time, they avoid falling into an "acting duel", because all their effort is put into the honesty from their work. By the way; the sex scene which caused such a controversy is not as scandalous as I expected so, nor even remotely "sexy", because its purpose is illustrating the transformation from the passion to the apathy, even in the carnal aspect from the marriage.So, I very enthusiastically recommend Blue Valentine as an extraordinary and devastating marital drama which is also inspiring, because it celebrates the reality, instead of delighting itself with the most commercial and accessible romantic clich√©s we see in cinema with such a frequency.
I generally like the movies about werewolves, but I have never been a big fan of the original The Wolf Man (1941).I respect the great performance from Lon Chaney, Jr. as the victim of the lupine curse and I admire the fact that the film found a fresh angle for the classic subject of "tragic monster"; and besides of that, it has picturesque characters, the excellent actors Claude Rains and Bela Lugosi and a fantastic costume design.However, I found the story to be a bit redundant, with a good emotional conflict on its centre (the monster is afraid of killing, but it has to survive) diluted by an excessive slowness and melodramatic dialogs.Maybe understanding those negative elements (not to mention the reduced attention of contemporary spectators -including me-), co-screenwriters Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self decided to fill the story from the new version of The Wolfman with other classic elements from Gothic cinema, from a tenacious detective to the horrors from pre-Freudian psychiatry.That was a good idea, and the film ended up being moderately entertaining; however, I found it to be mediocre.Director Joe Johnston (ex-supervisor from Industrial Light and Magic) is accustomed to work with stories which require a good amount of special effects, but he has also shown good hand to work with unadorned drama in the excellent film October Sky.Unfortunately, The Wolfman falls short on both aspects.The performances from Benicio del Toro, Emily Blunt and Anthony Hopkins lack of passion and energy, so they feel cold.The only actor who seems to be interested in his character is Hugo Weaving.Besides, the movie has pre-fabricated scenes and trite dialogs which indicate us what the characters feel, but without enough emotional evidence in the screenplay to endorse it.I am a big fan of make-up artist Rick Baker since I saw his work in The Incredible Melting Man, and he also made extraordinary works in An American Werewolf in London, Videodrome and Gorillas in the Mist.His work is truly legendary, and I was intrigued by the potential of his collaboration with Johnston, who is a veteran in the revolution of the digital effects.However, the result was disappointing.On the one hand, I respect the fact that The Wolfman uses the special effects as a support of the story, exclusively focusing on the metamorphosis.But on the other hand, the visual work is mediocre and lacking of creativity.I suppose that Baker and Johnston wanted to make a tribute to the artist Jack Pierce; however, at this moment of 21st century, it is difficult for me to feeling amazed by the atavism of the hairy man, dressed with rags and howling to the Moon.It may not be fair to compare the objective of this film with the one from other movies, but after seeing many creative re-inventions of the werewolf in the last decades, it is difficult to feel amazed by the monster created by Baker and Johnston.In summary, I think I can give a slight recommendation to The Wolfman, because despite being mediocre, it is moderately entertaining and it is never boring.However, if you are looking for an excellent werewolf movie, I totally recommend you An American Werewolf in London, The Howling or Dog Soldiers.
3 years ago, I found the film Rise of the Planet of the Apes an excellent prequel/reboot of that famous saga which left a mark in 20th century science fiction. And even though I didn't like Dawn of the Planet of the Apes as much as Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I found it a very competent sequel with an intelligent screenplay, solid performances and phenomenal special effects from the Weta Digital studio, whose wide experience in creating characters with "soul" truly benefits the film. But, as it should be, the images aren't as important as the story. The classic "territory conflict" formula hides a thematic and emotional deepness, because co-screenwriters Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver blurred the line between "good ones" and "evil ones" in order to create a film with an ambiguous moral balance. Both the apes and the humans have positive and negative aspects; and even like that, it's difficult to find authentic malice when we consider the characters' previous experiences. I imagine that every spectator will have his/her own interpretation about this balance; and after all, the answer isn't as important as the lessons it brings us. Those lessons might not be very new, but they validate the story and bring the characters substance. And that takes me to the main pro from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes... characters who overflow humanity in every scene (yes, even the apes), not only because of the credible performances (the human ones as well as the digital ones), but also because of the roles they symbolize in the context of contemporary society. In other words, the interaction between humans and apes transcends the mere science fiction premise in order to illustrate us about the origin of those conflicts in the real world which seem absurd when we see them from afar, and unavoidable when we analyze the internal dynamic of fear and intolerance. In the simian roles, the actor who stands out the most is Andy Serkis, who brings another excellent "motion capture" performance which will surely be ignored by the Oscars. In the human roles, there are competent performances from Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman and Keri Russell. On the negative side, a few parts from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes feel a bit redundant, while the screenplay has a few holes. Nevertheless, I found this movie exciting, satisfactory and very entertaining, and I recommend it as a solid sequel.
In my humble opinion, the most interesting thing from The Pirates! Band of Misfits was the change of title it went through around the world. In its native England, the "official" title is "The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists", but in the United States and other countries, the title "The Pirates! Band of Misfits" was employed. The distributors were obviously afraid that the mention of "scientists" would keep the children away (and maybe some parents also), because they could have thought this was an educative film. Anyway, I'll let people more intelligent than me draw conclusions; I just wanted to point out that anecdote. In the cinematographic aspect, The Pirates! Band of Misfits is moderately entertaining, but it is also mediocre, and very far from the best works made by the Aardman Animations studio.The just mentioned company is mostly famous for the wonderful short films of Wallace and Gromit, with which they won a big quantity of awards. Their first incursion in the cinema was with the excellent Chicken Run, and after it, they made the very entertaining Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and the competent Flushed Away (as for Arthur Christmas, I haven't seen it). Unfortunately, The Pirates! Band of Misfits is the Aardman's work I have least liked, because even though it kept me moderately entertained, the screenplay is so bland that it doesn't generate any excitement nor too much interest in the characters. On the opposite, I appreciated the brusque "scientific" twist made by the screenplay, because it stays a bit away from the pirates' doubtful practices, at the same time it employs some well implemented "meta-humor" mentions; nevertheless, the frequent (and unnecessary) action sequences, as well as the forced ending, demerit to some point the attributes from this film.I admire the stop-motion technique employed in The Pirates! Band of Misfits, and I really like to see Aardman still employing it instead of falling into the easy trap of digital animation. The simple fact that the characters and some settings from this film exist in the real world as puppets with a metallic skeleton and incredibly detailed models is worthy of admiration; however, I think that The Pirates! Band of Misfits excessively relied on digital auxiliaries, and that this film has very few of the imperfect and "handmade" look we could admire in the previously mentioned short films of Wallace and Gromit, or in the TV series Creature Comforts. In that aspect, I think director Henry Selick is keeping a better balance between "handmade" and 3D, as we can see in the films Coraline and Monkeybone. End of the nerd rant. In conclusion, The Pirates! Band of Misfits deserves a slight recommendation, because it didn't bore me despite being mediocre.
I am one of the few people who liked the film Doomsday very much, because I think that director and screenwriter Neil Marshall made an excellent tribute to Mad Max, Escape from New York, Aliens, Excalibur, and other films which eventually inspired him to make movies with a lot of force and character. Now, his most recent film Centurion is another brilliant tribute, but this time to the "layers and swords" cinema, and with a much more mature and focused screenplay.As we can expect on a film directed by Marshall, the action scenes from Centurion are brutal and bloody, because even though there are not any large-scale battles (like the ones we saw in Kingdom of Heaven, King Arthur and Robin Hood), there are abundant face-to-face fights in which swords, spears, axes and even rocks are faced; needless to say that Marshall is not afraid of showing us the cruel consequences of those battles, with either digital blood or with practical effects of an excellent manufacture. However, Centurion is not exclusively a parade of bloody violence; it also tells an accessible and fascinating story, with enough twists and surprises to keep us very interested in the adventure from the soldiers. Besides, the historical period brings a unique "taste" to Centurion, because it lets it to show impressive natural scenarios and minute details of design and costumes.Talking about History, I think it is important to mention that Centurion does not pretend to be an academic dissertation about the disappearance of the Ninth Legion (in case that thing really happened). In the extra material from the DVD, Marshall clearly expresses that his screenplay is a work of fiction inspired on Roman chronicles in order to create an exciting and entertaining story, and I think he perfectly achieved that. Michael Fassbender brings a good performance in the leading role, and he is well supported by David Morrisey, Liam Cunningham, Ulrich Tomsen, Noel Clarke and Dominic West.But Olga Kurylenko undoubtedly steals the show. Her mute performance is simply hypnotic, and even though the range of emotions required by her character is reduced, she projects them with so much intensity that it is impossible to ignore her every time she appears on scene. Imogen Potts brings a decent performance, but her character occasionally feels a bit out of place in the context of the movie. However, I think that Centurion deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation for being an exciting and hugely entertaining adventure film.
Non-Stop is the second collaboration between director Jaume Collet-Serra and actor Liam Neeson, something which made me suppose it was going to be a sequel of Unknown, the previous film in which they worked together; but it wasn't like that. Non-Stop is a boring and insipid thriller in which Neeson repeats his characteristic role of a tough guy (this time, he is an air marshal with a turbulent past and family problems) facing high risk situations with his fists and with some cute women as unexpected allies. Everything about this film is so familiar that it leaves us with the impression of having seen it before... unless the spectator hasn't seen a single film starring Neeson since he was teamed with Jar Jar Binks 15 years ago (wow... Has it been 15 years since I lost the enthusiasm for Star Wars? Time really flies by). Talking about flying, I had the hope that the setting of the story on board of a plane would offer many opportunities to implement exciting action scenes, but they never came (well, there's one, but I didn't find it exciting at all). Non-Stop preferred to take the road of the suspense and the intrigue, throwing complications and twists which try to distract us from the absolute ridiculousness of the screenplay, which is based on the forced stupidity from a main character who repeatedly makes the worst possible decisions without losing his aura of heroism. Neeson brings his habitual gravity to his performance, while Michelle Dockery wears more modern clothes than she uses to in the TV series Downton Abbey. In summary, I didn't like Non-Stop and I can't recommend it, specially considering there are much better air thrillers (Red Eye, United 93).
I was interested in watching Dolphin Tale because it was based on a true story which combines ecology, compassion to the animals and engineering. And even though the corny and sentimental side of that story ended up having the preponderance in the film, I found it moderately entertaining.Just in case that the story about the dolphin was not enough to get the audience interested, the screenplay adds various instances of human drama in order to bring the characters to shape and fill the running time of the movie. Unfortunately, that "drama" is so elementary that I could not take it seriously, and the actors did not make too much effort to make it credible, with the exception of Morgan Freeman.In conclusion, I think I would have preferred to see a documentary about the dolphin Winter, instead of this forced melodrama, which adds too many tangential ornaments to what should have been a simpler story. However, as I mentioned on the beginning, Dolphin Tale did not bore me, and I think that it is more palatable than many modern animated films, or than any rehash of Twilight or Harry Potter for the kids who are hungry of another fantastic franchise. In that aspect, Dolphin Tale is more worried about its story than about the marketing, something which is enough to make it worthy of a slight recommendation, despite having an artificial and recharged screenplay.
I generally like the books from author Chuck Palahniuk,although I comprehend the reason why he has many detractors.His books frequently border on the absurd and they are full of bizarre and antipathetic characters with ambiguous intentions and inexistent morality.However,in my particular case,the vitality of the narrative and the force from the ideas are enough for making his work fascinating,at the same time it presents strange concepts with a simultaneously laconic and poetic style.If what I have just mentioned on the previous paragraph seems confusing,it is because Palahniuk's work is very difficult to describe.So,how difficult would it be to take his work to the big screen? I suppose that the precedent established by the excellent film Fight Club has set a very high standard which will be difficult to surpass on any other film based on a Palahniuk's book.Choke is extremely far away from reaching the level of Fight Club,and it feels as a mediocre film which could not capture the sardonic sense of humor and fascinating characters' psychology from the book.The main problem at adapting a literary work to the cinema is that even if the main story is respected,the author's "voice" which made the book memorable will be missed.And it is exactly there where the vision of the director must get in,in order to achieving that identity or at least replace it with something interesting or unique.The previously mentioned Fight Club is a perfect example of that; but Clark Gregg is far from being David Fincher,and his weak direction cannot transmit too much identity.He only generates the minimum level of energy in order to keep the film on movement.If it was not for Sam Rockwell's excellent performance,we would only have a collection of extravagant scenes and cynic dialogs which are not connected by the solid narrative flow Gregg should have achieved.Fortunately,Rockwell is absolutely credible and natural on his role,and his performance truly elevated the quality from the movie.Choke worked much better on the literary medium thanks to its structure,vivid descriptions and eloquent narrative.The film is an insipid and generic adaptation of the book.However,I did not dislike it,and I think it deserves a slight recommendation,because it did not bore me and,mainly,because of Rockwell's performance.
The Iron Lady isn't a prequel of Iron Man, but a biopic of Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of the UK from 1979 to 1990, and one of the most controversial political figures of 20th century. That's a certainly fascinating subject...So, how could The Iron Lady be so bland and diffuse that it could never make me emotionally "connect" with its main character? The Iron Lady ended up being a very different film than what I expected. Instead of telling a linear story, screenwriter Abi Morgan took a fragmented road, combining the present with the past on an arbitrary way, even though not lacking of a lyric style. So, you don't have to expect a typical biopic obsessed with historical details, but a kind of "tonal poem" whose verses whimsically describe Thatcher's personality, offering us a glimpse over here and a look over there to her nature, motivations, and specially, the relationships which molded her life, in the Parliament as well as in her home. And I didn't dislike that style; however, on the other hand, that makes The Iron Lady feel like an insipid film which refuses to face Thatcher's controversy, taking a tangential way which avoids to deepen into all we would like to see.I don't always swallow Meryl Streep, but I have to admit she brings a solid performance here, because she can express the iron will and persuasive presence from her character without the need of words. And I would also like to mention the excellent performances from Jim Broadbent, Anthony Head, Richard E. Grant and Nicholas Farrell, which sadly went unnoticed.And then, we also have nice cinematography, perfect music score and a solid production design. However, The Iron Lady didn't leave me very satisfied, mainly because I think that a biopic about Thatcher should have been approached by other way. Nevertheless, the film has some positive elements, something which makes it worthy of a slight recommendation.
I have been a fan of director and screenwriter Kevin Smith since 1994,but I am the first one to admit that his real talent as a filmmaker is pretty debatable.Besides,he has a weak visual style (which was even criticized by him) and a limited narrative range.The proof of that last thing is the movie Jersey Girl,where he did something completely different to what he uses to.Although I hated that film,I have to thank the false move he had in there,because that made him to go back to the "Jersey universe".And although Clerks II was pretty funny and solid,it was far away from Smith's best films.So,my expectations for Zack and Miri Make a Porno were below to the ones I had with Smith's "classic" films,a situation a bit worsened because of the presence of Seth Rogen in the leading role.He had always played the character of an immature slacker on a not completely solid way.However,Zack and Miri Make a Porno resulted to be a brilliant comedy with solid performances and whose screenplay hides honest emotions and a rich interaction between the characters behind all its vulgarity.What makes Zack and Miri Make a Porno so much better than a lot of contemporary comedies is that,as I previously mentioned,there is a certain grade of deepness,warm emotions and solid character development behind the vulgarity.As Smith accustoms to in all of his movies,there are references to some hits of the popular culture,like a funny parody of Star Wars (in the shape of the title of a porn movie),the presence of the great Tom Savini and the naughty name of a hockey team: The Monroeville Zombies,something which makes a mention to the film Dawn of the Dead (1978).The cast from this movie makes a very good work (even Rogen brings a very competent performance).My favorite members were Craig Robinson,Jeff Anderson,Jason Mewes,Traci Lords and Katie Morgan.The last one mentioned is a porn actress in the real life,and she impressed me with a pretty natural and credible performance.In summary,Zack and Miri Make a Porno is a great movie which has an excellent screenplay,a very solid cast and which is very funny and hugely entertaining.I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm.
Director Christopher Nolan woke up one day, and he thought: "21st century needs its own version of 2001: A Space Odyssey". And so, he decided to make Interstellar. Well, I might be exaggerating. After all, 2001: A Space Odyssey was an economical failure in the time of its release, and it was as the years went by that its huge ambition and influence on the science fiction genre was recognized. So, time will tell whether Intersteller deserves to occupy that same cultural niche. But in my personal case, I think Interstellar is a brilliant science fiction film which will stay in my memory for a long time. To start with, the ideas exposed by Interstellar are fascinating, audacious, and they belong to the level of "serious" science fiction we rarely find in mainstream cinema. And besides, the ideas are raised with a certain subtleness which makes them more universal. For example, the catastrophe which threatens humanity is ambiguous on its shape, but clear on its effects; on that way, the screenplay filters an ecological message which doesn't feel as such, but as an integral part of a vast story, letting the audience assimilate it in order to enrich the experience. In the same way, many of the subjects from Interstellar reside on the periphery of the drama, making us seek them instead of having them spoon-fed. The actors make an excellent work in their roles, highlighting Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy. My only disappointment regarding the cast was the reduced screen-time from Michael Caine and John Lithgow (two of my favorite actors). Both make a perfect work in their roles, and I truly wanted to see them in an "acting duel"... but they only have one brief scene together, and they barely exchange a few words. I also have to mention the beautiful images and space views created by the studio Double Negative. The special effects share the previously mentioned subtleness, discarding the "space porn" from Star Trek or Guardians of the Galaxy in order to implement a more realistic vision, centered on the vision of the astronauts, where we see only what is necessary in order to understand what is happening without distracting us from the human drama which always leads the film. On the negative side of Interstellar, I will only mention three things: to start with, we have the occasionally forced sentimentality from the film, which feels a bit out of place inside the fascinating story; I also felt the late introduction of an unnecessary villain a bit out of place; and finally, I disliked the lacking of "science" in this excellent science fiction film. On the one hand, I understand the fact that Interstellar decided not to spend time with every single "realistic" detail of space travel, but on the other hand, some big licenses are too notorious (for example, the gravitational equation and its relationship with a space phenomenon). Nevertheless, those complaints didn't avoid Interstellar from being a memorable, fascinating and hugely satisfactory experience. So, I don't know whether Interstellar is truly a landmark which will re-define cinematographic science fiction for the following decades, but it's definitely one of the best films I have seen this year, and another example of Nolan's maturity and talent as a filmmaker. I like the science fiction with the emphasis on science, but sometimes, the emotions are more appropriate to tell stories about humanity and hope.
The division of a book in two films had seemed questionable when it was done in the Harry Potter and Twilight sagas; but in the case of The Hunger Games, it represents an authentic insult to the fans, and a slap in the face of the spectators who will have to pay double in order to see the consequences of the events initiated in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1. I haven't read Suzanne Collins' novels on which this saga is based, and I don't have any plans to do so. And, if there's something I have learned from the two previous films, it's that they were designed as audiovisual complements of the books, and not as authentic cinematographic adaptations meant to tell the story on its own terms. Naturally, the same happens with the third film, which is full of superfluous and badly explained scenes, and full of irrelevant characters which might have had more purpose and deepness in the novel, but who in here only cloud the narrative, which is already forced and poorly structured. Having said that, I have to admit I didn't completely hate The hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1; I can't say I liked it by any means, but I found it a bit superior to the two previous films; however, it commits the capital sin of being boring. Like it had been done in the previous films, the main character's ethic disjunctive is handled with a frustrating frivolity, placing the focus on uninteresting aspects, such as the clothes she's going to wear and the useless advice from the expert in public relations Effie Trinket (what a way to waste actress Elizabeth Banks in that role). In other words, co-screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong get distracted over and over again with irrelevant things I felt out of place in a tale about civil war and political insurrection. Another example (spoilers?): the surreptitious diffusion of videos in which Katniss denounces President Snow's atrocities have the supposed purpose of unifying the districts in their fight against the Capitol; unfortunately, we never see the effect of those videos (with the exception of an isolated attack with terrorist dyes), so when President Coin makes a revolutionary speech, we don't exactly know who she's talking to... Did the propaganda work? Could they unify the remaining districts? Or will we know it in the next film? All that reminded me of that irritating issue with the "sponsors" in the first film, who were used as an excuse to propitiate the romance between Katniss and Peeta... even though we never saw them, or confirmed their relevance, despite being so "important". I repeat: all that might have been explained with detail in the books; but that's not an excuse to leave such big holes in the screenplays from the films. Despite how poorly written her character is, Jennifer Lawrence managed to bring a solid performance, and she's well complemented by excellent actors such as Julianne Moore, Jeffrey Wright and the sadly deceased Philip Seymour Hoffman. I assume the fact that the next film will be action from the beginning to the end, with occasional pauses to accommodate the romantic triangle, display more fashion design and suffer Effie's irritating jokes; but I still think the division was arbitrary, because it was dictated by economical ambition, and not because the story required so. Unfortunately, the one who triumphed was Hollywood Capitol, using its own techniques of propaganda and persuasion. They don't deserve the whistle from the "mockingjay", but the trumpet of contempt.
I was not very interested in watching Rabbit Hole...Another drama about a couple who loose their son? Haven't we already seen too many instances of that clich√©? I obviously do not pretend to underrate the horrible tragedy of losing a son; I am simply tired of so many serious films which use that misfortune as an easy shortcut to generate "instantaneous drama" and let the actors to bring an appropriate level of crying and suffering in order to eventually be nominated to some acting award. On some way, I find that level of exploitation to be more offensive and indecent than any cheap torture-porn film. But well; after all, Rabbit Hole counts with the presence of two excellent actors in the leading roles...and a director who is pretty unusual for this kind of material, so I decided to watch this film for curiosity. Fortunately, my prejudices were wrong, because Rabbit Hole is an intense and brilliant drama with an unusual tone which does not try to leave us depressed, but genuinely inspired, despite the misery the main characters suffer.Director John Cameron Mitchell had left me very impressed with his audacious and fascinating film Shortbus. I guess that some people would consider it "grotesque" and "scandalous", but I liked it very much, because beyond of its graphic sex scenes, there were an interesting story and genuine characters, whose "alternative" lifestyles did not avoid the recognition from their humanity and the realism from their emotions. With Rabbit Hole, Mitchell made a similarly deep but narratively much more conventional movie, and the result is also excellent, sad on some way, but with an unexpected vein of humor which works a a comforting endorsement of the marital drama.Besides of Mitchell's sober sensibility to tell this story, I would also like to mention playwright David Lindsay-Abaire, who adapted his own play to this movie's screenplay keeping an intimate and literary atmosphere, without losing the opportunities that the cinematographic medium offers to expanding the story and making it more attractive. The rhythm he employed is relaxed, trusting the spectator to organically discover the characters' emotions. And I am not only talking about the two main characters, but also about the supporting ones. And since I just mentioned the main characters, I have to talk about the extraordinary performances from Aaron Eckhart and Nicole Kidman. I could not expect less from Eckhart, because this is the kind of roles he is best at: vulnerable men who are occasionally victims of their own feelings. As for Kidman, she came from three consecutive missteps (The Golden Compass, Australia and Nine) which exploited her "Hollywood star" category, but not her big histrionic talent. Fortunately, her role in Rabbit Hole takes the maximum advantage from that talent, and I think that she brings one of the best performances from her career in this film.The only thing I can say against this movie is that a few details from the screenplay could have been better polished. Despite those minor fails, I took a big surprise with Rabbit Hole, and I can definitely recommend it as a cathartic and satisfactory experience which is perfectly acted, brilliantly directed and very well written.
My expectations before watching The King's Speech were not very high, because I expected to find one of those movies which are too light and absolutely inconsequential but at the same time adorned with the refinement and affected charm from the modern British art-house cinema. However, I took a very pleasant surprise with The King's Speech, because it ended up being a hugely entertaining, occasionally touching (without falling into the sentimentality) and very satisfactory experience.There are many historical elements in the screenplay from The King's Speech, like for example, the social scandal which altered the hereditary line from the English crown and the threatening shadow from the Nazi expansion which would end up provoking World War II, which brings a good context about the importance of the diction and rhetorical talents from the governors. But basically, The King's Speech is a fascinating tale about the "bromance" between Prince Albert (1895-1952) and Dr. Lionel Logue (1880-1953), whose relationship begins based on the need from the first one to overcome his stuttering and is then extended to the mutual comprehension from their respective personalities. And I think that the story also works as an examination of the class differences in the United Kingdom, as well as of the monarchical traditions which have always provoked so much division between the people.And besides of all those interesting narrative levels, we have the great performances from Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, which are absolutely credible and overflowing of passion without reaching the theatrical exaggerations we occasionally find in period films. As their respective characters' wives, Helena Bonham Carter and Jennifer Ehle also bring excellent works. And I also liked the performance from Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill (1874-1965) very much...I have always thought that this actor was born for this character, and after seeing his short performance in this movie I confirmed that, so I hope that if one day someone decides to make a Churchill's biography, they choose Spall.Many period films put the emphasis on the decorations and costumes, but The King's Speech is more interested in examining the psychology from its characters and their emotional growth. So, whoever goes to see this film expecting to admire lavish dances from the royalty or monarchic protocols will feel disappointed, because most of the story is developed into offices, cabins and a consulting room. However, that does not avoid The King's Speech from being visually impressive, thanks to cinematographer Danny Cohen and production designer Eve Stewart, who bring unique colors and features to every scene, emphasizing every single visual detail in order to enrich the sober style from the narrative. The only fail I found on The King's Speech is that there was a brief moment which was a bit dull to me; however, that does not avoid me from enthusiastically recommending it as an excellent film which is absolutely deserving of all the acclamation it has received so far.
I had low expectations before watching Red Tails, and even like that, I was surprised by the dramatic clumsiness from this film, despite being based on true events whose historical and social importance undoubtedly deserved a more emotive and honest film.In the interviews and "behind the scenes" which accompany the DVD, we find out that producer George Lucas had been planning this film for almost 30 years. However, none of the Hollywood studios wanted to risk themselves to make such a big investment in a film with an almost exclusively "black" cast, so Lucas ended up putting U$S 100,000,000 from his own pocket in order to finance Red Tails. That was undoubtedly a good gesture, but the film completely lacks of any dramatic weight, reducing the characters to caricatures and their experiences to the crudest clich√©s of war cinema. The dialogs are horrible (for example: "Take this, Mr. Hitler!") and the characters are identified by such elementary features that they border the offensive: the rookie one, the rebel one, the buffoon...we never have the opportunity to explore their human side. And the villains are even worse written than the heroes. The characters are nothing more than gear from a poor screenplay which was filmed with such a coldness that it never reaches the emotions such an inspiring historical moment would deserve. However, I can't deny that the special effects from Red Tails are phenomenal.Nevertheless, the impressive special effects don't save Red Tails from being a weak film because of its poor screenplay, bad performances and insipid direction. If you are interested in knowing the History of the Tuskegee squad, I recommend you the film The Tuskegee Airmen that was made in 1995 for HBO (and which curiously also included Cuba Gooding Jr. in the cast) or the excellent documentary with the same title made by The History Channel, which generates with only one interview, much more emotion and respect than the ones Red Tails could obtain with U$S 100,000,000.
At first sight, the films directed by Wes Anderson look like fables about eccentric characters engaged into absurd activities which are far from the "normal" behavior. But I think that during his career, in films such as Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Anderson has been experimenting with diverse portions of reality and fantasy, until achieving the delicious recipe we can enjoy in his most recent film, Moonrise Kingdom. In fact, I think this is Anderson's film which has best captured the contrast between emotional reality and a fantastic setting, in which the sincerity of the story isn't neglected, and the characters' humanity isn't betrayed.I'm not an unconditional fan of Anderson's, because there have been occasions in which the congruence was sacrificed for the sake of that bizarre humor which doesn't provoke laughs, but confusion and frowns (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums), or in which the story and the characters were excessively extravagant (Bottle Rocket, The Darjeeling Limited). However, when his films find the correct balance of elements, the result is excellent, as we can see in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and now, Moonrise Kingdom. One of the main pros in the latter one was deviating the attention from the typical "weird" characters, keeping them on the periphery in order to contribute to the humorous atmosphere, but without letting their peculiar comic "taste" to contaminate the dynamic between the two main characters. The whole cast of Moonrise Kingdom made an excellent work, from Anderson's traditional collaborators (Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman) to the new additions (Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton). They all took complete possession of their characters, and they perfectly adapted to the style required by the film.However, the whole movie is carried on the shoulders from the two young main characters, and Anderson had the luck of finding Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, the ideal actors for those roles, because they could magnificently face the drama, the comedy and some difficult scenes of "romantic awakening" which conserve the innocence of childhood without ignoring the proximity of the teenage hormones. The main characters possess a special gravity, because their intelligence and melancholy possess an adult sensibility, while the adult characters behave like children. They both know that their journey to freedom is destined to failure, but despite that, they have to try it...and that inflexible conviction is what keeps us in suspense during the whole movie, regretting the obstacles the main characters face and enjoying their ephemeral triumphs. And, sure, the simple run of two preteens ends up acquiring an epic air thanks to the purity of their mission, and to the biblical subtext of the Flood, presented on a literal, metaphorical and even theatrical way. I have rarely found the "coming of age" formula portrayed with so many levels and narrative complexities.The technical aspects of Moonrise Kingdom are phenomenal. Robert D. Yeoman's cinematography is artificially colorful in interiors and organically natural in exteriors, in order to accentuate the differences in the worlds from the two main characters. Alexandre Desplat's score doesn't only adorn the scenes, but also works as an integral part of the narrative with some ingenious musical lessons. And the production design is beautiful. In conclusion, Moonrise Kingdom is an extraordinary movie which masterfully combines drama, humor and nostalgia for the awakening to the adolescence. I definitely think this is Anderson's best film so far, and it won't be easy for any of his future projects to achieve the level of greatness from Moonrise Kingdom. Needless to say I give an enthusiastic recommendation to this masterpiece, either you are a fan of Anderson's or not, because this is an accessible, emotive and hugely entertaining experience.
This does not star Kurt Russell, but rather allows him what amounts to an extended cameo. This work is more centered around the "son of" story line than it is the actual super heroes themselves, thereby failing to deliver the appropriate level of entertainment, and contributing instead, that enigmatic substance known as "kid appeal." I expected more. But having said that, there is more to this work than meets the eye. The story is modeled after the old classic "B" science fiction movies we hate to love, but do. The effects are nothing spectacular, but are still above what you would expect, all things considering. And beneath the camp, lies a stronger feeling, reminiscent of a classic superhero story, yet it still fails to achieve the desired affect; if only marginally.It was entertaining and I still had great fun in watching it.This rates an 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.
The Apparition has a moderately interesting premise which pretended to rethink the "hounted house" concept itself. Unfortunately, screenwriter Todd Lincoln (who was also the director) didn't know where to take that concept, and he ends up employing the clich√©s he had initially wanted to avoid. The result is an insipid and boring soup cooked with odds and ends of Poltergeist, Pulse and both versions of The Haunting dusted with pieces of Asian horror and bathed in sauce of The Asphyx, which I couldn't swallow at all.Something I found curious is that the premise of The Apparition was better explained in the trailer than in the movie itself. I'm going to reveal it here because I don't consider it a SPOILER...it's just something which isn't left completely clear by the film. But anyway, if you prefer not to find out, I suggest you to skip the rest of this paragraph. BEGINNING OF PSEUDO-SPOILER: the "ghost" which wants to be conjured by the experiments at the beginning of the film isn't exactly a dead person's spirit, but an entity created as the result of a shared belief and amplified through technology. In other words, what The Apparition proposes (or at least what its trailer did) is that the paranormal phenomenons don't come from "the beyond", but from the believers' collective conscience. That's a moderately interesting idea, but the absence of explanations during the film and its eventual deviation into incoherence make me think that it suffered severe cuts or re-edition in order to make it...I don't know...more commercial? Whatever it was, it was a mistake, because The Apparition immediately looses any narrative integrity.As for the actors, Sebastian Stan makes a weak work as the hero. His concern expressions seem to aspire to Jeremy Renner's intensity, but they fail because of Stan's lack of personality and conviction in his role. Ashley Greene is undoubtedly attractive, but her performance in here is pathetic...and Lincoln knows it, because he tries to distract us showing her in her underwear as much as he can without trespassing the PG-13 rating (it's not too much, so don't make illusions). The only one who brings some credibility to his character is Tom Felton; besides, his British accent and '70s haircut reminded me of the "crazy scientists" of Hammer Films, always trying to "play God".So, The Apparition didn't have a bad base, but it quickly strayed on the road and never reached its potential. The final result is a tedious horror film which made me feel like wasting my time, so I don't recommend it at all.
I found The Darkest Hour incredibly bad, but I have to recognize this: its mere existence makes other tedious movies about an alien invasion (such as Cowboys & Aliens and Skyline) look good in comparison. I guess that that is a sad consolation for those of us who wasted our time watching this deplorable movie lacking of any suspense, originality or ingenuity.The concept of the invisible aliens employed in The Darkest Hour looks like an excuse to save money on the special effects. And, let's accept it, the special effects tend to be the only redeemable element in movies from this kind. So, without interesting characters, a good story nor visual ornaments, The Darkest Hour does not offer absolutely anything in order to draw our attention.The characters from this film are hollow and completely antipathetic (Are we supposed to get worried in them only because they are North American people lost in Russia?), not to mention stupid, something repeatedly confirmed by their dialogs ("The invaders come with a plan" "Yes...and which one is ours?"). The efforts from screenwriter Jon Spaihts to explode the electromagnetic nature from the aliens border on the ridiculous, or contradict their own rules (I think Spaihts should have investigated the limits of "Faraday cage" better), or they simply lead to forced and lacking of any energy action scenes. And what is more, the ending feels like a rushed attempt to tie loose ends, but without offering a concrete and satisfactory conclusion.In conclusion, I suggest you to avoid The Darkest Hour at any cost, because I found it a really execrable movie. If you wanna watch an genuinely original and entertaining alien invasion film, I highly recommend you Attack the Block.
I have many times mentioned that I usually hate romantic comedies,and it is not only because of the tiring narrative formula they are based on and because of the artificial sentimentalism they have,but also because they are called comedies when they are rarely funny.And I do not mean the hollow "grace" of the obligatory humiliations the main character has to suffer in order to win the heart of his loved one,or the cheap slapstick.I am talking about the lack of real humor,not necessarily the intelligent one,but the honest one,which makes us laugh because we want and not because we feel the obligation to doing it.The main reason I liked the film The Proposal is because,although it is far from being a great romantic comedy,it made me laugh,not out-loud,but something is something.It is easy to laugh at Sandra Bullock and her long chain of romantic comedies,which are barely distinguishable from each other for the simple fact that the leading actor is different on every one.But her sparkling personality and good presence make her sympathetic.Besides,I cannot deny that on many occasions,Bullock has rescued generic movies (like,for example,Two Weeks Notice or Practical Magic) with the force from her presence.I can say exactly the same about Ryan Reynolds,whose long list of mediocre movies he has participated have one thing in common : he has been the highlight of them.His spontaneous and cynical humor make him have an attribute which is dreamed by a lot of Hollywood stars : being attractive for women and sympathetic for men.In other words,Bullock and Reynolds have the ability of choosing characters which adapt to their histrionic range,so their development is always pleasant,as we can see on The Proposal.The screenplay from this film is not too original (has anybody mentioned a film called Green Card ?),but it has various good moments of humor.On the negative side,there are some moments which result to be a little bit boring (like a forced native dance in the woods),but in general the film is entertaining,although the final experience is not too memorable.So,if what you are looking for is a light and good time at the cinema,The Proposal is not a bad option.You just do not have to expect something great or memorable.
I generally like the films starring Jason Statham, but in spite of that, Safe was boring me a little bit during the first half. Fortunately, the film improved during the second half; and even though the final result is mediocre, I appreciate the fact that Safe offers some moderately interesting variations to the old "tough anti-hero with a golden heart" formula.Besides of being confusing and fragmented, the first half of Safe establishes an excessively trite premise which has the potential of becoming intolerably corny (the tough guy who gets softened by the childish innocence). However, the relationship between the main characters isn't the one of girl and babysitter, but the one of two mature and pragmatic persons. That's why the film finally finds its way during the second half, and it takes us to a moderately satisfactory, but not necessarily happy, conclusion.However, I can't deny the fact that Safe has various negative elements. The villains lack of definition and look like mere ethnic caricatures; and I'm not only talking about the Russians and the Asians, but also about the New Yorker policemen. At least, there's a pair of good character actors playing villains (Chris Sarandon and James Hong), and they could both bring credible works despite their badly established characters. Speaking of which...the main character is a retired boxer, a retired policemen and a retired garbage man? Was there a need to cook such a clich√© soup? Fortunately, Statham faces his character with charisma and credibility.So, in conclusion, I think Safe deserves a slight recommendation, because it offers some interesting elements and the second half managed to keep me moderately entertained, despite the general mediocrity of it. There are better films in Statham's filmography (such as The Bank Job and The Expendables 2); better films about New Yorker mafia (such as Goodfellas and Donnie Brasco); and better films about "bad-ass" girls (such as Kick-Ass and the remake of True Grit); but Safe isn't a bad addition to those niches. And at least, I won't identify director Boaz Yakin only as the responsible of the execrable Uptown Girls anymore.
Co-directors and co-screenwriters Joel and Ethan Coen have won their reputation of "artists" by pulse, since they always seem more interested in satisfying their own tastes and idiosyncrasies than in covering the generic commercial requirements from modern cinema.As a result, their movies are usually received with a mixture of automatic acclamation and confusing uncertainty of their intentions and objectives.And if that happened with accessible films such as No Country for Old Men and Burn After Reading, I cannot even imagine how divisive their most recent film, A Serious Man, will be.In the film O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Coen bros. made a modern (and very free) adaptation of The Odyssey, written by the Greek poet Homer.Now, with A Serious Man, they made an equally open interpretation of the biblical book which tells Job's misadventures, who suffered many calamities inflicted by Satan to prove his faith in God (or something like that).Besides, according to testimonies from the filmmakers, they also incorporated auto-biographical elements in the screenplay (but they had also told us that Fargo was based on true events, so who knows?).The result is a parsimonious, confusing and very boring portrait of the life of a Jewish family in a town from the United States during the late 60's.I will not deny that there are solid performances and some ingenious analogies in A Serious Man; but the narrative is so monotonous that it tested my patience and my faith in the talent from the Coen bros.For 106 minutes, I had been waiting for that scene, that moment which would magically unify the elements from the plot on a narrative catharsis which made me to say: "Yes! I now understand everything!".But that moment never came.Instead of that, we have an abrupt and very unsatisfactory ending.While I was watching A Serious Man, I lead to the conclusion that this movie requires erudition about the Torah, the Jewish culture, their rituals and the symbolism which garnishes its parables and stories.My knowledge about those subjects are limited to the TV series Seinfeld and various movies from director and screenwriter Woody Allen; and I only recognized the reference to a "dybbuk" in A Serious Man because I remembered the horror film The Unborn (which is an exorcism movie, but on a Jewish context).So, on the one hand, I am sure I missed messages from this movie; but on the other hand, I do not think it is fair for a movie to require the spectator so many knowledge about the subjects it portraits.So, in summary and by my point of view, A Serious Man is a tedious, self-indulgent, unsatisfactory and even antipathetic film experience which left me frustrated.I will not deny the Coen bros. had good intentions with this movie, but I think they should have found a more accessible (not to mention more entertaining) way to translate them.
I was really interested in watching Universal Soldier: Regeneration.I found the original Universal Soldier, from 1992, to be very entertaining, and with the precise combination of honesty and excess to show it did not take very seriously to itself and that it was not going to stop at anything in order to bring us a good time.Besides, I always though its primary function was to validate the careers from Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren, who back in that time, seemed destined to become into immortal heroes from the action genre.Now, 18 years later, we see that that did not happen, because both actors (or athletes?) have been for a long time trapped in the niche of straight-to-DVD action cinema.And even though they occasionally appear in good movies (JCVD; Direct Contact), I think they have never had the chance of resurrecting the fame Universal Soldier brought to them.Before watching Universal Soldier: Regeneration, I did not know whether their it was going to be a good film or a desperate strategy in order to exploit Van Damme's and Lundgren's fans.The answer was fortunately the first one, and even though it is not a very memorable film experience and it is not at the same level of the original film, it shows Van Damme and Lundgren on a good shape and it is entertaining.By the way, I think this is the most proper moment to say that Universal Soldier: Regeneration ignores the mediocre sequels of the original film made in the 90's...and I will do the same, because I found those films to be absolutely mediocre and mercenary.Even though the strongest point from Universal Soldier: Regeneration is the new confrontation between Van Damme and Lundgren, I took a good impression with the presence of Andrei Arlovski, an expert in "sambo" and worldwide champion of Ultimate Fighting.I will not say he is a good actor, because his character does not bring too much material to act; but he shows an incredible physical presence and enough charisma.As for Van Damme and Lundgren, their confrontation left me satisfied despite the fact it is too short.And I also liked the realistic way in which the action scenes were filmed.So, it may not be an excellent movie, but Universal Soldier: Regeneration is a dynamic and entertaining action film.And I think that is enough reason to recommend it.
The recent remakes of 70's horror movies try to use excessive cruelty and seriousness in order to hide their lack of enthusiasm and spontaneity.The problem with those new versions is that, on their failed attempt for surpassing the original movies, they loose what made them to be memorable...that raw but energetic vision which made them so valuable to many people not only because of their intrinsic quality, but also for capturing a particular moment on popular culture.However, The Last House on the Left ended up being a very competent remake of the controversial film of the same title, directed by Wes Craven in 1972 (and considered by some people as an unofficial remake of the Swedish film The Virgin Spring).I honestly did not like the original film very much, and maybe because of that I appreciated the changes made on this new version, which alters the dynamic of some characters and extirpates the inappropriate black humor used by Craven.Because of that, I think The Last House on the Left (2009) deserves to be valued on its own merits, and not on its fidelity to a mediocre film.Although the criminals from this film kinda belong to the generic mold of villains motivated by their own evilness, we find some humanity on the parents who look for revenge, whose moral disjunctive is easily solved when it becomes on a fight for survival.At the difference of other modern horror films (like for example, The Strangers or the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), the story of The Last House on the Left shows a logical narrative structure of causes and consequences, which is much more interesting than the hollow and repetitive circle of "torture, torture and more torture" those films understand as "horror". Besides, the solid narrative from The Last House on the Left makes the violent scenes to have a bigger impact.It may not be a great film, and it has fails, but I liked this remake pretty much, and I took a nice surprise with it.Unless you are sensitive, I recommend it with enthusiasm, and I hope that more filmmakers from the horror genre take the example from this movie: it is not enough with showing a lot of violence, because it is also necessary the creation of a good story and interesting characters.
The doll Annabelle appeared for the first time in The Conjuring, during a prologue which didn't have much to do with the rest of the film. However, it seems that it had enough resonance with many spectators in order to bring it its own film; and now, in the film Annabelle, we know the origin of the doll and its curse. The result is competent, even though it can be noticed the fact that the screenplay was written hurriedly, with the intention of making some additional dollars until the official sequel of The Conjuring comes. In Annabelle, screenwriter Gary Dauberman employed all the available clich√©s from the modern supernatural cinema: baby in danger, electrical disturbances, skeptic husband, benevolent priest who underrates the danger, expert in occultism who has the exact book to explain the situation... well, the list is endless (I think that the only absent clich√© was the swarms of insects). On the positive side, Annabelle has some good moments of tension, accentuated by a sober atmosphere which brings credibility and a "based on a true story" sensation (the film doesn't presume itself to be so, but it's probably inspired on the legend of "Robert, the haunted dummy"). In conclusion, I can give a moderate recommendation to Annabelle despite not being something very original or highly memorable, because I found it a decent horror film which managed to keep me entertained.
I initially liked to see the humble movies produced by the studio The Asylum because, although they were very far away from being great movies, they showed so much enthusiasm that the final results were imperfect but entertaining movies (like The Beast of Bray Road or Supercroc).However,the studio's economical ambition prevailed on the "artistic" integrity, and they eventually developed a more profitable strategy: filming cheap and fast imitations of any recent box-office success with the hope of betraying distracted people who do not pay too much attention to the movies they rent.And, as an additional benefit, they sell their pieces of crap to the cable TV, whose reduced programming options do not permit too many requirements of originality or quality.That's the way The Asylum found market for films like 18 Year Old Virgin, The Da Vinci Treasure, Death Racers, War of the Worlds (of course this is not the one directed by Steven Spielberg, in spite of having the exact same title) and Pirates of Treasure Island, which are all genuinely execrable "movies" which deserve to be burnt.However, I will admit I had some interest in watching Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus, because at being an "original" production from The Asylum, I thought it would show more dignity.However, it unfortunately kept the same repulsive level from the previous movies.It would seem ridiculous to talk about the performances on a film like this one, but they are really deplorable, starting by Deborah Gibson, who is really hateful in here.However, in comparison with Lorenzo Lamas,her performance is excellent.Lamas is an usually mediocre actor, but his performance on this movie would be bad even on the context of a porn movie.His performance is one of the worst ones I have seen on a very long time.But nobody is gonna watch this movie because of the performances, and the decisive question is: what about the monsters? Unfortunately, the answer is also: horribly bad.The low budget from this movie only makes us to see fleeting sightings from the creatures, something which worsens because of the horrible edition which tries to "fix" the scenes.I guess that "director" Jack Perez said "we fix everything on the post-production", but he should have known that the editor is not a magician, and that he was not going to be able to save the movie.So, my recommendation is for you to stay away from this execrable, tedious and deplorable movie which stole time of my life with disastrous performances, pathetic direction, crappy special effects and a repulsive screenplay.
Because of the use of the word "sunshine" in the title and the presence from actors Amy Adams and Alan Arkin, I thought Sunshine Cleaning was going to occupy the niche of "feel-good" comedy, a sub-genus in which acclaimed films such as Little Miss Sunshine and Juno are located.However, after having watched Sunshine Cleaning, I can say its intention was very different, and I did not expect to like it so much.Following the custom from independent cinema, Sunshine Cleaning is set on a small town which is full of picturesque characters, something which generates a warm atmosphere which results to be very pleasant.Screenwriter Megan Holley shows an excellent instinct to drive the emotions from the story, and she brings it sub-plots (like for example, the grandpa's shrimping business) which enrich the characters.Director Christine Jeffs brings the movie to life with a sober style, which takes the most advantage from the simple locations and the cast.What takes me to the film's strongest point: the actors.Adams and Emily Blunt may be more famous for participating in comedies like Enchanted and The Devil Wears Prada (respectively), but they are also excellent dramatic actresses, and Sunshine Cleaning brings them the opportunity to show the two facets from their talent.I was truly impressed by their ability to handle the tone from every scene, even if it is a confrontation which wakes rancors from the past up, or an unexpected humorous moment.The rest of the cast also makes a very solid work.With his character, Arkin could have simply repeated what he did in Little Miss Sunshine, but he brings another style to his performance in Sunshine Cleaning, making it different and equally memorable.And Jason Spevack and Clifton Collins Jr. also bring conviction to their characters.The only fail I found on this excellent movie is that the sub-plot which involves actress Mary Lynn Rajskub should have ended on a more natural way.However, Sunshine Cleaning deserves an enthusiastic recommendation, mainly because of its excellent performances and its deep and fascinating screenplay.In summary, I really took a very pleasant surprise with this movie.
The Fourth Kind will be accused by many people of copying the style of the excellent film Paranormal Activity but, being fair, both were filmed at more or less the same time, and both show influence of The Blair Witch Project.But The Fourth Kind makes the mistake of combining "reality" with "fiction" on an implausible and, on some occasions, even involuntarily funny way.Having said that, I cannot deny the film has some appropriate moments of tension and a good atmosphere.So, director Olatunde Osunsami (who was also the screenwriter) showed talent for those two aspects, but at the same time, he lacked of the necessary vision to tell the story on a more suitable way.Osunsami combines "real" videos with enactments in this film.Occasionally, we even see the enactment next to the original video, making us to ask ourselves what the intention from Osunsami actually was...¬øshowing the talent of actress Milla Jovovich in order to reproduce the vocal inflections from the main character? Or use the actors to emphasize the drama the "real" tapes cannot capture? It may sound paradoxical, but I think that a more anonymous and "verit√©" focus (at the style of Paranormal Activity) would have made a better result than this unstable fusion of techniques.My point is that I found The Fourth Kind to be at the same time moderately interesting and a bit tiring, because the "real" tapes are sufficiently enigmatic to wake the attention, while the enactments exaggerate the drama until cartooning the characters, and not even the solid performances from Jovovich, Elias Koteas and Will Patton were enough to find the appropriate balance in order to coexist with the "genuine" versions.However, even though I could not swallow the technique from this film very much, there are, as I previously mentioned, some good moments of tension, and that Osunsami made a proper work in the aspect of creating an atmosphere.So, in summary, I found The Fourth Kind to be a mediocre film which is easy to forget.However, I think it deserves a slight recommendation, because I cannot deny it kept me moderately interested and that it tried to do something different, even if it did not completely succeeded on that.
During the initial credits of Lockout, we are informed that the film is "based on an original idea by Luc Besson". And I guess that this is the idea he brought: "Hey guys, let's make a remake of Escape from New York, but in the space or something like that, in order to avoid demands". So, with that concept in hand, Besson decided to co-write the screenplay with James Mather and Stephen St. Leger (who also were the co-directors) in order to adapt that idea to the "euro-action" formula he has been employing for many years: a tough but sensitive anti-hero facing many villains in order to rescue an innocent victim. But instead of using the European setting from The Transporter saga, it now all happens inside a space prison. How innovative (sarcasm).The formula from Lockout could be summarized as: fights, a bit of forced humor, and the slightest varnish of science fiction, with the emphasis on "fiction", because the "science" from this film is virtually non-existent, and it only provokes laughs because of its use of "space" clich√©s. In other words, the orbital station could have been a prison in Bulgaria, or a terrorist camp in Afghanistan, and it would have been exactly the same...the main character fighting against a parade of generic villains and defying increasingly big dangers in his effort for rescuing the President's daughter.One of the things I most disliked in Lockout was the "PG-13" rating. This movie is excessively shy in the intensity of its violence. I'm not saying that that is necessary for a movie to be good...but in the particular case of Lockout, it would have been the last resource to make it at least moderately entertaining, instead of being such bland and tedious. As for the screenplay, there's not too much to analyze...it's obvious that Besson, Mather and St. Leger were inspired by the premise of Escape from New York, but they didn't bother themselves to add the social satire and subversive humor from that film, and as a consequence, Lockout lacks of a more interesting background in order to validate its generic fights, explosions and shootouts.At least, I have to say that Guy Pearce makes a credible work in the leading role. Maggie Grace brought effort to her character, but the screenplay assigns her some deeply stupid decisions in order to impulse the story when there aren't any logical alternatives. That's the ungrateful task of any "human mcguffin". As for the special effects, the studio Bain VFX completely ignored every scientific consideration about gravity, mass and inertia. In conclusion, Lockout is a boring action film, and as a consequence, a waste of time. In order to take the bad taste out of my mouth, I think I'm going to re-watch the very entertaining Fortress, another film about a futuristic prison.
Whether we like it or not, the idea of making remakes of foreign films has become one of the most popular tendencies in Hollywood (sure, they aren't the only ones, but because of the volume, they have earned the title of "kings of creative recycling"). The process looks simple: the rights of a movie spoken in another language are bought; actors with bigger commercial attraction are hired; the screenplay is re-written from the North American cultural perspective; and finally (here comes the fatal mistake) all the "fails" from the original film are "corrected". Naturally, this practically never works as it should, and most of the remakes end up being poor copies completely lacking of any interesting element. What takes me to Silent House, which is a horrible remake of the Uruguayan movie La Casa Muda.La Casa Muda was a very competent horror film, with some quite ingenious elements which undoubtedly attracted the producers of Silent House. That movie was shot in a single take (even though there might have been edition tricks in order to hide some cuts), which added some novelty and promoted a unique narrative style, simultaneously chaotic in order to accentuate the horror, and perfectly planned in order to gradually press the gears of suspense and keep the audience's attention. However, co-directors Chris Kentis (who was previously responsible of the excellent Open Water) and Laura Lau couldn't achieve that effect at all with the same shooting technique. Actress Elizabeth Olsen had previously shown huge talent in the film Martha Marcy May Marlene, and even though the subject from Silent House is very different, she has to express similar emotions of fear, anguish and disorientation in here.Unfortunately, the screenplay from Silent House wastes Olsen's talent, because as much effort she made, her character makes too many absurd mistakes and takes bad decisions which don't feel as a product of panic, but as forced devices from the screenplay. In other words, Olsen is good, but not miraculous. And what is more, Kentis and Lau fatally failed at scaring us. They simply put the camera in front of Olsen's face (and occasionally in front of her generous cleavage), and they expect her screams, whining and cut breathing to do the job they couldn't.Silent House was a truly unbearable experience, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. And I'm not exaggerating; there were moments in which I really wanted to take the DVD off. However, due to my absurd optimism, I decided to watch it to the end...and needless to say that the movie never improved at all. In conclusion, I can't recommend Silent House as a horror film, and even less as an example of what a remake should be. However, Hollywood learns very slowly, so they will unfortunately keep trying...and trying...and trying...
I generally start watching very long movies with distrust,because various of them try to betray us,making their story unnecessarily longer than what it should be to cover fails from the screenplay or the simple fact that they do not know what to say.On the other hand,there are long movies we wish they would never end,because every second makes the previous one richer and the characters become on something like old friends from the spectator.I think The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is on some intermediate point.This is a good movie,I do not deny it,but it is far away from the excellence and,although I liked it,it has various fails.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button tried to be a version of Forrest Gump for 2008.The main characters of both movies see the world from a different sensibility and they also have a physical condition which makes them different to the people they interact with.And what The Curious Case of Benjamin Button also shares with Forrest Gump is the very good manufacture.On this movie,director David Fincher shows a deep attention to the details, and the special effects are excellent,not only because they are perfectly done,but also because they work as a support for telling the story.I also appreciated on this movie that the narration from the voice of the main character results likable and appropriately subtle.But,at the difference of Forrest Gump,the main character results too bland.I mean,there is nothing which makes us emotionally connect to him.I think that the screenplay failed in constructing a deep character.Besides,this movie occasionally falls on cheap sentimentalism which was unnecessary.The consequence is that that moments do not feel honest...they feel forced.And there are various parts on this movie which felt irrelevant.On that parts,it seemed the film was going nowhere.I think the best element from this movie are the performances.Brad Pitt made a good work but I think the best performances are on the supporting cast.I usually like the work of actress Cate Blanchett very much and she did an excellent work in here.But I think the member of the cast who mostly stands out is Tilda Swinton.She completely becomes on her character and she could perfectly transmit all her emotions.Taraji P. Henson (who had left me astonished with her performance on Hustle and Flow),Jared Harris and Julia Ormond also bring solid works.I did not totally understand the main point from this movie...is it a romance?,is it a magic fable?,or is it simply a collection of vignettes without too much meaning,made with the only porpoise of winning Oscars?.I honestly do not know.I think it is a little bit of all that.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a good movie but it is far away from the excellence.Although I liked this movie,it did not result very memorable to me.
I liked the trilogy of X-Men pretty much (yes, even the third one, which was hated by many people) mainly because, independently from their differences with regard to the comic, the movies preserved the thematic knot from the conflict between the humanity and the mutants, and its consequent analogies about racism and intolerance, which added an additional level to the solid screenplays. And now we have X-Men: First Class, a prequel which which works wonderfully well at establishing the bases from the X-Men team.It would be easy to say that director Matthew Vaughn showed his comprehension of the super-heroes when he directed and co-wrote Kick-Ass, but X-Men: First Class is a very different movie which has very few in common with the meta-humor and the deconstruction of the heroic archetypes employed in Kick-Ass. On the opposite, X-Men: First Class could achieve the extremely difficult task of integrating the mutant universe to the real one without making any of them to loose relevance over the other. And in order to achieve that, co-screenwriters Vaughn, Zack Stentz, Ashley Miller and Jane Goldman took one of the key moments in modern History as a setting (the missile crisis in Cuba), something which could look unlikeable if it was not raised by a perfect "comic logic", and with the additional level of bringing a delicious "retro" taste to the story, setting it into a social and political context where the interaction between super-powers, spies, Cold War and mutant conspiracies makes sense.However, what I most liked in this movie are the characters and their adventures. I will try not to reveal more than the necessary in order not to ruin the film's best moments and the most delicious details which will delight to the comics readers. To start with, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender bring brilliant performances. They are not only physically perfect as the younger versions of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen (respectively), but they could also perfectly capture the intense dynamic between their characters. As good the special effects from this film were, what I remember the most is the great interaction between their characters, because of how naturally we see the evolution from their friendship and the latent threaten from their contradictory points of view in what regards to the integration of mutants and "normal" humans.The rest of the cast also makes an excellent work, starting by Kevin Bacon; the arrogance and aura of threaten he brings as the villain are perfect. Jennifer Lawrence (who had already left me amazed in Winter's Bone) brings sincerity and a good emotional range to her character. Rose Byrne shows a good presence and is very credible in her character. And, well, I could go on and on mentioning the whole cast...January Jones is appropriately lethal and sensual as Emma Frost; Nicholas Hoult is very good as Hank McCoy; and Oliver Platt is totally credible as a bureaucrat.And I finally have to mention the extraordinary special effects from John Dysktra, whose alchemical combination of miniatures, camera tricks and digital magic creates scenes of an imposing scale and dynamic. The thing I can say against X-Men: First Class is that some details from the screenplay could have been better polished. However, that is a minor fail which did not avoid me from enjoying this excellent movie much, and I enthusiastically recommend it whether you are a fan of the comic or not.
Comedian Bobcat Goldthwait achieved fame in 1985 for playing a whining lout in Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment, but whoever has seen his stand-up routines will know that, behind his affected voice and neurotic appearance, there's an intelligent person who is deeply critical of North American society. And, well, his style of comedy isn't exactly refined or subtle, and as a consequence, there are times in which his cunning message ends up straying into the strident humorous monologues. For better or for worse, his career as a film director and screenwriter has found the same problem, and as good the intentions from the films Shakes the Clown and World's Greatest Dad were, it's occasionally difficult to separate the shape from the substance. The same can be said about God Bless America, Goldthawit's most recent film, which is simultaneously over the top, offensive and moderately funny in its examination about the problems of contemporary society.God Bless America should obviously not be taken very seriously, because it's definitely a fantasy with cathartic intentions, whose tangential purpose is making us reflect about the new values which drive contemporary conduct. Its theory is that the media (and its corporative patrons) pretend to exploit the natural selfishness, stupidity and arrogance from people in order to make them consumers completely lacking of common sense or critical thought. It's undoubtedly a problem with deep causes, and I don't think a simplistic attitude such as "let's kill everyone" is the real solution...but at least, I have to admit that God Bless America works on a visceral level. Nevertheless, this film didn't leave me totally satisfied on the narrative angle; the main characters try to keep their humanity during the violent crusade, but they aren't more than hollow puppets designed in order to express Goldthwait's ideology and tastes. In spite of that, I felt myself identified sometimes with the main characters, not only with their contempt to the "celebrity culture", but also with more trivial details, such as the fondness to Alice Cooper's music and the fascination with the philosophy of Star Trek: The Next Generation.Joel Murray and Tara Lynne Barr bring solid performances in the leading roles, because they make their characters' eccentric behaviors completely credible. Going back to the cons of God Bless America, there are some post-modern and elaborate dialogues which don't fit very well into the surrealistic environment of the film. Nevertheless, I think I can give God Bless America a moderate recommendation, because despite not being completely satisfactory, I found it entertaining, well acted and with some interesting ideas. Inside the micro-universe of films with a similar plot, I would put God Bless America very below Natural Born Killers, but at the same level of Falling Down, which made similar observations, but about the problems from the early '90s. In fact, it's interesting to compare the subjects of Falling Down to the ones of God Bless America; in 20 years, the things seem to have gotten much worse, and we are evidently losing the battle against the infection of ignorance and selfishness which affects society. Or it might be natural evolution, and humanity is adapting itself to a new and different environment of instantaneous gratification, saturated of trivial information and irrelevant connections. Anyway, I hope not to be alive when this human "de-evolution" will reach its critical point. It will already be a problem of the generation who made the Kardashian family and those troglodytes of Jersey Shore famous.
Baby Mama is the kind of chick-flick I usually try to avoid,but I have been enjoying for a long time the work of the great Tina Fey,from her contribution as a screenwriter for Saturday Night Live to her current series 30 Rock,which has obsessed me with its brilliant screenplays with hilarious characters and a great sense of humor,which is simultaneously intelligent and absurd.Having said all that,I had low expectations for Baby Mama because it counts with Fey as an actress but not as a screenwriter.And although I admire her screenplays,I have to admit she is not a particularly good actress.In other words,I cannot imagine her on a deep character...I do not think her range as an actress goes much more far away than the works she has done.Fortunately,her character in Baby Mama is not a difficult one and I think she made a competent work.This movie resulted to be a little bit better than I expected but this is an average movie without any memorable elements.Some negative points I found on this movie are its tired speeches of feminism,the bland romance and the cheap lessons of friendship.The element I mostly appreciated from this movie is that the screenplay has some touches of intelligence which make the movie win some credibility.Amy Poehler brings a good performance and the supporting cast brings some good moments to this movie,like Dax Shepard,Steve Martin and the brilliant Sigourney Weaver.The only members from the cast who did not convince me at all are Greg Kinnear,who brings an insipid and generic performance,and Romany Malco,who is too forced on his role.I think the element which most bothered from this movie is that it's only correct on almost all the aspects,and that makes of it a very average movie which is easy to forget.I can recommend this movie if you wanna have a light time and nothing else.Rating:6.5
Maybe because of having read in my childhood so many stories written by Agatha Christie (1890-1976), Raymond Chandler (1880-1959) and Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930), I find the first decades from the 20th century to be fascinating, not only because of its historical importance and contrasting extremes of progress and anachronism, but also because they represent the prototype of modern age.In the last four decades, we have experienced impressive social and technological advances, but it was during the 20's and the 30's when it started the tendency of seeing the development as an end in itself, and not as a scientific or economic tool.In summary, we can find many similarities between the modern obsession and the one from those days, and because of that, the movies which faithfully portray that time interest to me.With all this, I wanna explain the main reason I liked Easy Virtue pretty much.However, that is not the only thing which makes it worthy of an enthusiastic recommendation.The performances from this film are very good.Kristin Scott-Thomas and Colin Firth are credible and natural on their roles.But the performance I most liked was surprisingly the one from the usually mediocre Jessica Biel, who brings a very detailed work.The screenplay is very well written, since the structure is good and the characters are perfectly developed.Stephan Elliot (who is reminded for his work on the excellent The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert)'s direction is generally good, specially on the dramatic scenes, which feel honest and natural.On the only points his direction stumbles are on a few elements of affectation and extravagance which crush a little bit with the good tone from the film.And, finally, the screenplay has a few forced elements.However, in spite of those fails, I can recommend Easy Virtue with confidence, because I found it to be entertaining and very interesting, not to mention it also works very well as a study of the culture and customs from the early 20th century.
I will summarize the saga of The Fast and the Furious : on the first movie,Paul Walker was brutally darkened by the landslide presence from Vin Diesel,so the villain resulted to be much more interesting than the hero.The movie itself was mediocre; the second movie was hollow and tedious,not only because the screenplay was generic and predictable,but also because of Diesel's absence; the third movie wanted to restart with the franchise changing of location and putting new characters and more attention to the cars and,although that film was better than the second part,it was mediocre and unnecessary.In the new episode from this saga,Fast and Furious,director Justin Lin decided to go back to the tone and style from the first movie.The result is not a memorable movie at all,but at least,it is entertaining and I personally found it superior to the first film.The story from this movie is too simple,although it is well structured and it is developed on the way it could be expected in a movie from this franchise,where all the aspects from life are reduced to car races in which the laws from the physics are only optional suggestions.However,the emphasis the screenplay puts to the investigation from the main characters kills some importance to the car race scenes and we only see a fraction from the "cromo-porno" from the previous movies,which had dedicated more time to the cars.I think that change of focus is a positive element in this movie although I am sure some spectators will consider it as an unforgiven fail.The performances from this movie are as deep as the paper in which the screenplay was written; fortunately,the hollow characters do not need too much deepness to be performed.Diesel repeats his serious performance as Toretto,putting the frown gathering,a serious look and a very deep voice.Jordana Brewster works only as a decoration on this movie.Michelle Rodr√≠guez does not look too interested on her character; it is possible that the only reason she participated on this movie was for commitment.Walker has shown some evolution on his career.He passed from being an empty model/actor to being a correct actor.In other words,he may not be excellent,but I definitely appreciate the evolution he has made.Fast and Furious has good sequences of car chases but it commits the mistake of assigning some stunts to the digital effects.The careers and stunts produce a bigger impact when they were made by expert drivers who risked their lives when they filmed a particularly difficult stunt or maneuver.But when we see digital cars doing all those stunts and maneuvers,the emotional impact and credibility are completely lost.The worst sample of this happens near the ending of the movie,when we see a complicated career filmed on underground tunnels which could not have been filmed on the real world.I suppose it seemed a good idea when it was only written on the screenplay...but the result is confusing,visually artificial and as realistic as a replay from the video game Burnout Paradise.Fast and Furious is very far from being a great movie,and it is not memorable at all,but I cannot deny it kept me entertained during its whole running time.Besides,I think this is the best movie from the franchise.I recommend this movie if you wanna have a good time and nothing else.
A remake of a British mini-series seems like a doubtful proposition,starting by the arrogant narrative decision of extirpating the story off London,to set it in Washington.What is more,the cast of solid character actors from the mini-series have been replaced by Hollywood stars who will undoubtedly attract more spectators,but at the same time,steal the atmosphere of anonymous intrigue.Having said that,I have to admit that the six hours from the mini-series were a little bit tiring to me,specially when the story turns its attention to the personal lives from the people who were involved on the political scandal.So,I had some hope that a certain grade of condensation in the story would result on a more interesting movie,with a better rhythm and enough deepness.In the film State of Play,co-screenwriters Tony Gilroy,Matthew Michael Carnahan and Billy Ray condensed the story,although they made it to loose some honesty and deepness.But now,I will stop comparing this movie to the original mini-series,and I will evaluate it by its own merits.And also using that judgment,I found State of Play to be a mediocre movie.On some aspects,this film tries to emulate the atmosphere from All the President's Men,with its combination of political intrigue and conflicts of conscience between reporters who have good intentions,but who have a doubtful ethic on their methods.I also detected some small tributes to the extraordinary JFK.However,the biggest influence from this movie is on the recent wave of similar political thrillers which denounce some aspects of the terrorism on the Middle East,or the war for the oil.But,in spite of its good intention,State of Play suffers from anachronism.It is true that the subjects which are examined on this movie will keep being relevant for years (maybe decades)...but they were more interesting to the general spectator five or six years ago (like when the original mini-series was released).Nowadays,with more urgent preoccupations in the global conscience,the lies from a North American company are less relevant than the virus which are floating on the air or the labour insecurity occasioned by the worldwide economical collapse.Movies should start to define new villains who are more appropriate for the worldwide situation (like in the movie The International),because if not,it will be difficult to wake up the spectator's imagination with tiring comments about a war whose revocation has expired,not on the real life,but on the short attention from the public opinion.It may not be fair to evaluate a movie for the historical context which rounds it,but I mentioned it because that was my perception when I was watching it.On the screenplay from this film,there are various elements which feel very forced.On State of Play,there are not any bad performances; everybody has an adequate development on their roles.But,I could not find passion on any of the actors...the only thing I saw on them was technique.I think that happened because director Kevin MacDonald's work lacks of energy and enthusiasm.I also feel this movie should have had more suspense,instead of a warm parade of scenes and situations which are connected by an old narrative formula (brave reporters looking for the truth),and not by the stimulating discovery of hidden connexions and scandalous secrets.In summary,there are too many coincidences,too many characters with a doubtful narrative value and too many redundant scenes which repeat what we already know...I think all this is a consequence to the previously mentioned condensation of the series.Instead of all my complains,I did not dislike State of Play.I cannot deny it kept me moderately entertained and that,near the ending,the film generates a good level of tension.But,the final experience I had with this movie was mediocre and completely forgettable.I think I can give a slight recommendation to this movie for the fact that it is not boring.
The film Armored represents a clear case of Hollywood's negative influence in cinematographic art.Namely: in 2003, Hungarian director Nimr√≥d Antal found a good answer with the excellent film Kontroll, an exotic hybrid of urban thriller and comedy, which besides of telling us a fascinating story set in Budapest subway train, it also included wise commentaries about the unpredictable development of Hungarian society in the post-communist environment.4 years later, Antal was seduced by Hollywood and he made the mediocre, but moderately entertaining horror film Vacancy.And more recently, he made Armored, a horrible, hollow, full of clich√©s and unsatisfactory action film.I found the screenplay from Armored to be deplorable; the plan from the criminals does not have too much sense, nor it seems credible in the 21st century; and in order to cover some of those holes, screenwriter James V. Simpson decided to leave some significant elements from the story in the darkness (Is it that easy to disable the electronic system from an armored truck? I may may try it some of these days).However, a good director such as Antal could rescue the movie with the help of his cast and a bit of energy, cannot he? Fortunately, the answer is no.Armored is one of the most boring and passive action film I have seen in a long time.The situations this movie portraits did not make me feel suspense or any emotion (Is the boredom an emotion?), even with the help of the distinguished character actors who appear on it.I almost felt pity for Matt Dillon, Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburne and Fred Ward, because they brought such good works in other movies that it was demoralizing to see them as sleepwalkers on Armored.The same applies to Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia, but instead of pity for them, I felt the confirmation of the antipathy they have always provoked on me.So, Armored is an absolutely tedious action film because it lacks of originality, the story is bad, blah blah blah...I do not need to repeat my long list of complaints.What worries to me is that Antal is currently working on Predators, the fourth sequel? "re-imagination"? remake? of Predator, under the supervision of Robert Rodriguez, whose work I usually like, although I cannot deny he has made some big false moves in his career.I truly hope that franchise is not ruined, as it happened with the atrocious Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem; however, the precedent created by Armored is not very encouraging, because it is needed a genuine "anti-talent" to waste four excellent actors, and to make a chase of armored trucks to be boring instead of exciting.Will it happen something similar with the predators? I hope it will not...but the best thing is to have low expectations.
Foremost, I have to say I did not like the film Johnny English, and that I am not a fan of comedian Rowan Atkinson's. Or, better said, I am not a fan of his Mr. Bean facet's, even though he definitely made me laugh in the TV series Black Adder, and in his elegant stand-up routines. I hope that that is enough justification of why I hated the sequel Johnny English Reborn, despite my sincere predisposition not to take it seriously and to assimilate its simpleton style of comedy. I understand that the film intended to bring a gentle and accessible kind of humor for the whole family...but I think it fatally failed on that.The main problem with Johnny English Reborn is that it takes the road of using obvious and predictable jokes we saw coming from afar. The character Johnny English started as a parody of James Bond, and in sight of the evolution from that character in Casino Royale (2006), I think that it would have been interesting to see the change reflected in Johnny English Reborn. Maybe, a subtle varnish of cynical post-modernism would have made this sequel less unbearable.What is more, the supporting cast includes some solid actors (Gillian Anderson, Rosamund Pike and Dominic West) who are absolutely wasted in here. So, in conclusion, Johnny English Reborn is a pathetic film which did not make me laugh at all. If you want to see good parodies of the super agent archetype, I recommend you the Austin Powers trilogy.
Do not misunderstand me...I liked Shutter Island, because it certainly offers various positive elements.However, on a deeper level, it does not look like a film from director Martin Scorsese...I generally could not feel on it that fierce energy which identified many of his movies.Nevertheless, I will not deny this is an entertaining film which produces a good atmosphere.I had special interest in this movie, because it represented the first incursion from Scorsese in the mystery genre; I suppose his remake of Cape Fear could get into that category, but Shutter Island has many traditional elements from the genre, from mysterious disappearances to dark dungeons where the danger lurks everywhere.On that aspect, the first half of the movie works pretty well at establishing the mystery, suggesting a treacherous motivation for the villain and showing the tortuous past from the hero, which adds a personal subtext to the investigation he makes.However, on the second half, the movie looses the focus with false clues, redundant scenes and narrative alleys.Besides, I do not know whether Scorsese did not feel very comfortable working with this material, or if he wanted to make a tribute to films like The Silence of the Lambs, The Shining and Spellbound (1945).However, I would have preferred a more personal vision of the genre, and not a mere reproduction of the innovations introduced by other movies.The aficionados to film or literary thriller will know that the stories which involve asylums, psychiatrists and mental perturbations always end up falling on three or four narrative formulas.Shutter Island is not the exception, and it was pretty easy for me to predict the twist in the end which should have supposedly left us amazed.Dennis Lehane (the author of the book this movie is based on -which, by the way, I have not read-) may noticed that, so he decided to distract us and confuse the road from the story.However, the only thing he made is adding an extra half an hour which makes the story a bit tiring.However, on the positive side from this movie, we have Scorsese's efficient direction and the solid performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo and Michelle Williams.Talking about Williams, she appears on the best moments of the movie, and it was there where I seemed to recognize Scorsese as I usually know him; unfortunately, the rest of the movie lacks of identity, and it limits to be a competent thriller, but which is not very ambitious or highly memorable.However, I recommend it to have a time of interesting mystery.In summary, this is a good movie, but I expected more from it.
It is easy to typecast author Jim Thompson (1906-1977) into the category of famous "noir" novelists, such as Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961) and Raymond Chandler (1888-1959); however, that does not seem as a completely fair comparison when we contemplate the strange style and ambiguous morality Thompson exposed on books such as The Kill-Off, Bad Boy and, of course, The Killer Inside Me. Thinking about it better, I think that "ambiguous morality" is not the appropriate phrase, because instead of the tough but sensible anti-heroes created by Chandler and Hammett, Thompson preferred to adopt an amoral point of view, which did not judge the characters into the context of the good and the evil. And I am not using the word "amoral" on a negative context, but as the strange virtue of examining the most grotesque characters without letting the artificial varnish of the civilization to tarnish the sordid rawness from the narrative. So, even though I do not consider myself as an admirer of Thompson's work, I undoubtedly respect his position into popular culture and his almost accidental validation of "pulp" literature as an integral part of modern art. And even though there are some good films based on his books (The Grifters and After Dark, My Sweet), I had some doubts before watching the recent film adaptation of The Killer Inside Me, despite being directed by the talented Michael Winterbottom: would it be a hollow exercise of excesses and violence, or an intense representation of Thompson's audacious "voice"? Fortunately, the answer ended up being the second one.One of the basic problems Winterbottom had to face before directing The Killer Inside Me was to find an enough audacious cast to get plunged into the psychological depravity from their characters, but with enough talent in order not to become them into caricatures and not to alienate the spectator. Fortunately, he could find the right actors for the roles. Casey Affleck brings an excellent performance in the leading character, who is a psychotic and liar policeman who absolutely lacks of conscience or compassion...but who thanks to Affleck's work, does not lack of humanity. As for the rest of the cast, I liked the work from Elias Koteas, Kate Hudson, Bill Pullman, Ned Beatty and even Jessica Alba; despite having supporting roles, their characters never feel as puppets from the screenplay, but as real people with their own history and character who are accidentally caught into the main character's emotional vortex.The fails I found in this film are the same ones I found in the book: there some moments which feel out of place, and other ones which do not feel very credible. Nevertheless, that does not avoid me from recommending The Killer Inside Me (2010) as a pretty good film adaptation of Thompson's book, and as a very interesting thriller on its own merits.
After his solid English-language debut with 28 Weeks Later, Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo returned to the big screen with a more subtle and psychological kind of horror in Intruders, which pretended to add a more complex dramatic element than the one we usually find in similar films from the "vendictive ghost" type. Unfortunately, the emphasis on the family drama wasn't enough for rescuing the poor screenplay.The premise from Intruders has some potential, but its development is so weak and diffuse that it didn't scare nor entertain me, and it doesn't make us be interested in the characters at all. Of course that this film employs all the clich√©s from the genre...appearances at night, dark cabinets with grating doors, visits to the Church in search of answers...but the story isn't interesting, and the more turns it makes, the more boring it gets, so that when the "big revelation" came, I was almost falling asleep, because I had already guessed it during the first 15 minutes.On the positive side, the performances from Intruders are competent. However, I can't recommend Intruders, basically because it completely failed on the narrative aspect. I hope Fresnadillo to recover from this misstep in his following film.
Cell 211 is not a perfect film, but it is filmed with such a force that its tense narrative kept me very interested from the beginning.Besides, the screenplay (based on a book written by Francisco P√©rez Gandul) brings us material to leave us thinking, at the same time it entertains us the whole time.The "prison cinema" (to call it on some way) does not have many variants; however Cell 211 finds the correct angle to keep its social conscience without neglecting the most basic needs from the genre.In other words, the message about dehumanization and justice is perfectly integrated to the story, which is full of suspense and violence (the physical as well as the emotional one), so its solid lessons of ethic never obstruct the narrative or blur the excellent performances from Luis Tosar and Alberto Ammann, who make their characters to come to life.The rest of the cast also makes a competent work, but Tosar and Ammann are the ones who stand out.Nevertheless, Cell 211 has some fails which avoid it from being an excellent film: there are some forced coincidences; and there is a doubtful logic on some key elements from the film (The most threatening prisoner immediately trusts in the new prisoner nobody knows?).However, despite of that, Cell 211 brings a very entertaining experience which deserves a recommendation because of the performances, the generally very competent screenplay and the perfect direction.
It's natural that Revolutionary Road provokes high expectations on the spectator.On the one hand,it's the return of director Sam Mendes to the "domestic drama" genre which gave him deserved success with American Beauty.And,on the other hand,it's the reunion of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet after working together in the most successful film in the History of cinema (the enormously overrated Titanic).Although I liked Revolutionary Road,I found it to be a predictable drama,which lacks of any special element which would make it something memorable.In other words,this is a good movie but the screenplay completely lacks of some special element which would make it different to many movies from this style.And,something which bothered me from this movie is the obvious trick which uses on the last 15 minutes.That trick pretends to be the emotional climax from the story when in fact,it is a desperate trick for finding a "strong" way out after the soft drama from the rest of the movie.DiCaprio and Winslet bring excellent performances but the member who mostly stands out is Michael Shannon,who earned a very deserved Academy Award nomination for his extraordinary performance.Shannon brought a memorable work because his character stays with spectator a lot of time after the movie is over.Kathy Bates,Dylan Baker,Max Casella and Jay O. Sanders also bring solid performances.Mendes made a good work as a director.He directed his cast very well and he could find a good tone to this movie.I liked Revolutionary Road for all its good elements but the story,the most important aspect,did not totally convince me.And when the story is not completely solid,the final experience I have is not totally satisfactory.Still,I recommend Revolutionary Road as a good movie.It does and says the same we have seen and listened too many times but it does it well,with excellent performances and a good atmosphere.I think there are better works with the same ideas and messages (like the brilliant movies The Ice Storm and Far From Heaven and the ingenious TV programmes Married with Children and Desperate Housewives) but as I said,this movie deserves a recommendation in spite of not being completely satisfactory.
From many centuries ago, the legend of Robin Hood has been captivating people of all ages, and I was not the exception, because when I was a kid, I obsessively read a moldy book with yellowish pages which told the adventures of that noble English bandit who stole to rich people in order to give the money to the poor ones; and who was also an archer who never failed, and who lived in the Sherwood forest in company of his accomplices and friends, laughing at the justice and enjoying a happy and dissipated life.I will start warning that nothing of that is present in the new film Robin Hood.Instead of that, the movie pretends to be a prequel with more political mystery than passion, and the final result is a tedious and very mediocre film experience.It is obvious director Ridley Scott made this film with the intention of recovering the magic he achieved with Gladiator 10 years ago, but I think that he and screenwriter Brian Helgeland failed on making a more serious and adult version of Robin Hood.The main problem is that the story is excessively long, something which makes the movie occasionally unbearable, and full of tremulous moments which pretend to be dramatic and important but which do not provoke any impact.And also, with one exception, the cast brings too affected and forced performances.The only exception from the cast I mentioned is Cate Blanchett as Maiden Marian, the woman who has a romance with Robin Hood.Blanchett's performance is very good.Pity that the relationship between her character and Robin is based on weak jokes and word games which would not be out of place in a comedy starring Cameron Diaz.I cannot recommend Robin Hood, mainly because I think it is absolutely unforgivable that such an expensive and elaborated movie like this one is so boring and lacking of passion.As an alternative to this film, I can recommend you Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, which was not a great movie, but at least, kept me entertained the whole time.
It does not bother me at all when a movie mixes different styles on a natural way.But it bothers me when a movie does that on a very forced way.The comedy Pineapple Express belongs to the second style.The way this film mixes styles on a completely unnatural way and besides of that,the story does not flow completely well.So,in summary,I think the best word for describing Pineapple Express is "forced".Plus,the characters are totally unsympathetic,so I could never identify with them.But,not everything is bad on this movie.In spite of all that fails,I cannot deny it kept me moderately entertained and that it made me laugh on some occasions.I think that positive elements make this movie worthy of a slight recommendation.Pineapple Express is not a bad movie...but it is not too good either.Pineapple Express is a forced comedy which gave me as a final result,a mediocre experience.
Once again, co-directors and co-screenwriters Jay and Mark Duplass have made a film which is sold as one thing and ends up being another one...something I say as positive, even though the general audience might find that tricky. Their film Cyrus had the appearance of being another simple and vulgar comedy made in Judd Apatow style, but it ended up being a very interesting characters study with an unusual deepness and realism, seasoned with occasional moments of humor in order to balance the drama. More recently they did exactly the same with Jeff, Who Lives at Home, even though with a more solid screenplay and more maturity as filmmakers.The screenplay from Jeff, Who Lives at Home includes various sincere moments of revelation and personal inspiration, many of which are obtained playing with our expectations and employing clich√©s which take a different road to the one we expected. Besides, the main character of Jeff, Who Lives at Home kinda reminded me of the Dude from The Big Lebowski, whose funny isolation from reality also brought him the unexpected benefit of seeing beyond the obvious, and accepting the good and bad situations with a balanced and objective philosophy. Nevertheless, the narrative from Jeff, Who Lives at Home is much more modest, because it doesn't pretend to transport us to a magical existential adventure, but to share with us the simple but honest ideology from a "loser" main character who ends up surprising us with his wisdom...even if he obtained it from drugs or from the film Signs.Jason Segel is perfect as the title character, because he brings the exact attitude his character needed. As his brother, Ed Helms also brings a solid performance. On the beginning, it seems that he's going to repeat his routine of innocent and well intentioned twerp, but as the screenplay moves by, Helms displays a dark side we had never seen from him, and he did it really well. And I also liked Susan Sarandon's performance.The only thing I can say against Jeff, Who Lives at Home is that a few details feel a bit forced. Nevertheless, I liked this movie very much, and I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm, not as a comedy, but as an excellent family melodrama in which the laughs are melancholic and the tragedies hide a humorous vein.
Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 are very high in my list of favorite super-hero films, and I think that they were the best ones in conciliating the fantasy universe from the comics with our prosaic "real world". In other words, both films kept the spirit of the character untouchable by putting him into a credible urban environment, without reducing or altering one for the benefit of the other. The "reboot" The Amazing Spider-Man achieved something similar with the character Peter Parker, deepening on his psychological aspects and bringing him the characteristics of a contemporary teenager; however, this film left me with the impression of having watched a diluted copy of the original version, entertaining but much less satisfactory on the emotional level.It's difficult to watch The Amazing Spider-Man without making constant comparisons to the original trilogy directed by the great Sam Raimi, specially considering the last film was released only 5 years ago. One would expect at least some decades in order to justify the re-start of the franchise, but there are apparently legal and financial matters which made the production of this film necessary. And that's where the problems begin, because even though The Amazing Spider-Man is a competent film, it's the mere existence from this "reboot" what deeply alters my perception of it. But anyway...for the sake of objectivity, I will try not to be constantly writing "...even though Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 did it better". I just want you to know that that's definitely what I think.Andrew Garfield makes a good work as Peter Parker in The Amazing Spider-Man, because of the solid balance he keeps between the drama and the humor. His version of the character isn't as nerd as in the comic, because he brought a teenage impetus, which feels quite appropriate in here. Emma Stone has a good chemistry with Garfield, and her work is decent. However, I think her character could have been a bit more extended, as well as the school scenes, which were pretty important in the comics in order to establish her relationship with Parker. Denis Leary brings a perfect combination of cynicism and warmth to his character; in my humble opinion, he brought the best performance from the film. The character I didn't like very much was the villain from the story; but don't misunderstand me...Rhys Ifans made a credible work as the tragic scientist who was a victim of his own investigation; what I didn't like was the lack of development of the Lizard (his evil alter-ego), because I couldn't swallow his motivation nor his methods, and I found them a forced excuse in order to bring us an epic ending, when the character would have been more appropriate for a more personal and touching confrontation.The special effects are generally well made, even though the studio Sony Pictures Imageworks keeps having difficulty in bringing weight and inertia to the digital characters, specially during the fights and action moments. And I didn't like the design of the Lizard...I think it should have been more reptile and less humanoid. Anyway, I originally thought it was a strange idea to leave this film in the hands of Marc Webb, a video-clip director who had made a good job in the brilliant romantic comedy (500) Days of Summer, but hadn't previously proved his talent in a movie from this style and dimensions. Fortunately, Webb ended up making a competent work, and as a result, we have an entertaining movie worthy of a moderate recommendation, even though I didn't find it very memorable.
The Informant! is based on true events even though, as it tells us on the beginning, some elements were changed in order to improve the narrative.According to my exhaustive investigation (5 minutes in Wikipedia), the screenplay follows Mark Whitacre's authentic story with pretty much fidelity; that man reported the illegal activities from many companies specialized on food additives.However, an important alteration screenwriter Scott Z. Burns and director Steven Soderbergh made to the movie was making it a bizarre comedy of a very irregular tone, which has various negative and positive elements.The Informant! is on many aspects a typical film experiment from Soderbergh, where he is more interested in exploring the possibilities of cinema than in obtaining economic success...however, the result he obtained here is not as good as the ones he obtained in, for example, Full Frontal or The Good German.The element which best works in this movie is its constant revelation of new information, which changes the context of the facts, and it eventually alters our interpretation of the characters, their motivation and even our objectivity as spectators.On that aspect, the film is pretty well carried, because with every surprise, I had to elucidate the testimonies from the main character by myself.But I felt the varnish of comedy Soderbergh and Burns bring to the movie to be forced and a bit inopportune.By themselves, the actual events The Informant! portrays are pretty absurd, and they would not have inspired a movie at the style of, for example, State of Play or The Insider.So, I perfectly understand why Soderbergh and Burns wanted to make a comedy out of it.But the problem is I did not find it to be very funny.Despite the playful music and the incongruent commentaries from the main character, it rarely made me laugh.There is certainly humor in the screenplay...but it is not the humor the film tries to sell us, even filling the film with comedians (Patton Oswalt, Scott Adsit, Joel McHale, Paul F. Tompkins and...The Smothers Brothers! -I thought they had disappeared from the planet-) in serious supporting roles.In the leading role, Matt Damon brings a brilliant performance, which definitely helps to the movie.And besides, I also liked the subtle satire about North American corporative world, which comes in the precise moment to remind us why we are sunk in a worldwide economic conflict.Despite the fact it did not leave me completely satisfied, I had an interesting experience watching The Informant!, at the same time I think it deserves respect for the simple fact that it tried to make something different, even though it did not completely achieve it.So, despite its fails, I recommend this film.
When I found out about the project Drive, I thought it was going to be a typical film of automotive action (such as The Fast and the Furious), but with higher artistic aspirations and an excellent actor in the leading role. However, Drive ended up being something much more ambitious and interesting, but without leaving the moments of action promised by the title aside.The inscrutable main character, the innocent damsel in danger and the threatening atmosphere of the criminal underworld in a big city from Drive indicate us that we are in a "noir" territory, but with an existential vein that adds an interesting emotional component, which is as essential to the suspense as the chases, fights and shootouts. In other words, I found the criminal mystery as interesting as the main character's gradual analysis. The screenplay is very well built and balanced in order to provoke the maximum impact without betraying its concise narrative. Many people are comparing Drive to Bullit, but the tone of Drive reminded me more of an exotic hybrid between Vanishing Point (1971) and Point Blank; and even the "retro" (but not very "retro") style employed by director Nicolas Winding Refn accentuates the illusion that we are watching some lost "noir" we had the fortune of re-discovering.Ryan Gosling brings a magnificent performance in Drive, because he feels intense and absolutely credible, and Carey Mulligan brings such a sincere work that her character ends up being touching. The supporting cast also makes a very good work, since the great Bryan Cranston is brilliant as the main character's boss/agent/friend, while Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks are perfect as two villains with more talent for the violence than for the illegal business.The only thing I can say against Drive is that a few small details from the screenplay feel a bit forced. Nevertheless, I consider this film a fascinating and very entertaining experience, and I can definitely recommend it as an intelligent action film, or as a drama with universal subjects of loyalty and redemption. And, sure, the apathy I have against the Oscars is multiplied when I see that this exceptional movie only received one technical nomination.
Even though it's not a sequel, Lone Survivor has various similarities with the film Act of Valor. The fluid camera, the realism of military procedures and the raw brutality of the battle scenes make it transcend the action genre, and make it a docudrama which also works as a tribute to the relentless determination and training of the soldiers. And even though the cast of Lone Survivor includes many famous actors (Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Eric Bana and Ben Foster), their performances are natural enough in order to preserve the illusion of realism, supported by excellent make-up effects which almost make us feel the pain of the wounds, and by semi-documentary cinematography which emulates the disorientation and chaos of the combat. Having said that, a movie about the Afghanistan war with such a patriotic nature could be classified as simple propaganda, and unavoidably wakes some doubts about the validity of that conflict and the justification of North American interventions. However, I think Lone Survivor managed to keep itself aside from any political position, focusing on the discipline from the SEALS and the terrible decisions they have to take under very difficult circumstances. On the negative side, Lone Survivor gets excessively sentimental on the ending, and that feels a bit incongruent with the sober tone of the rest of the movie; besides, I think a few characters could have been a bit more developed. Nevertheless, that doesn't avoid me from recommending this very competent action film. As a comparison point, I liked Lone Survivor a bit less than Act of Valor, but much more than Zero Dark Thirty.
Swedish director Lasse Hallstr√∂m managed to build a reasonably successful career in North American cinema thanks to his accessible style and the European sensibility he generally brings to his films. In the romantic genre, his taste generally seems to be inclined to stories in which the main couple is part of a wider narrative tapestry. The proof is in films such as What's Eating Gilbert Grape, The Shipping News and Chocolat; Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, his first incursion in British cinema, also employs that narrative strategy, and it's Hallstr√∂m's previously mentioned sensibility and the solid performances what make this film moderately entertaining despite its mediocrity.Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is based on a novel written by Paul Torday, which was originally written as a political satire about the unstable relationship between the UK and the Middle East countries. Something of that persists on Simon Beaufoy's screenplay during the beginning; but unfortunately, the romance ends up taking precedence, and it tends to dilute more interesting elements of the story. For example, there's a sub-plot about a group of terrorists who want to kill the Sheik in order to avoid the waste of money into something as trivial as salmon fishing, while most of the population is living in poverty...but those terrorists end up being simple puppets from the screenplay.In the leading roles, Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt have a good chemistry with each other, and despite being very famous actors, they are both perfectly credible as two normal people in a labor situation which invites the romance almost by accident. However, in my humble opinion, Kristin Scott Thomas steals the movie with her energetic intensity and perfect instinct for the humor, two aspects we had never seen in the solemn dramas in which she generally acts. Scott Thomas' performance made me wish to see more politics and less romance in Salmon Fishing in the Yemen; maybe, that would have compensated the forced ecological message, the excessive simplification of the problems in the Middle East, and the trite analogies of "swimming against the currents". Anyway, I can give Salmon Fishing in the Yemen a slight recommendation despite being a mediocre romantic comedy, because as I previously mentioned, I liked the performances and Hallstr√∂m's sensibility.
After the economical disappointment of Superman Returns, DC Comics redeemed itself with the big critical and commercial success of The Dark Knight.However, I am afraid that that victory created unreal expectations which will sabotage the future films from that publishing company (which has more pressure since it became on a producing company).As examples, I can mention the numerous and frustrated adaptations of Wonder Woman, Justice League, Supermax, Aquaman (produced by Leonardo DiCaprio), Green Lantern (with Ryan Reynolds) and Plastic Man (directed by the Wachowski Bros.).Or that projects will never receive the green-light, or their progress is by turtle steps, and as the times go by, their releases seem more far away, instead of getting nearer.It is obvious the executives from the company are obviously re-planning strategies (translation: trying to cypher what made The Dark Knight so successful).Having said all that, I have to admit I am happy to see those delays; I honestly do not think Warner Bros. (DC Comics' owner) will be able to triumph again with any of those movies.It is more probable that those adaptations will follow the same unfortunate destiny as Constantine or Catwoman.But, seeing all that from the positive side, those delays and conflicts have left the free field to the making of solid animation movies whose creators really comprehend the essence of comics, they respect the characters and they take advantage of the animation in order to tell stories which would not be able to be filmed with real actors.And the best thing of all is that they are not subject to the demands and whims from the executives, agents and lawyers from Hollywood.Superman/Batman: Public Enemies is a clear proof that "less is more", and although it does not reach the heights from the extraordinary Justice League: The New Frontier, it represents a fascinating view to the most popular characters from DC Comics.Although their methods are different on practice and ideology, Batman and Superman have worked together on many occasions.Their adventures with each other appear on comics like Justice League of America, World's Finest and Superman/Batman.On those stories, their relationship is occasionally rough, some times friendly and other ones antagonistic...but always with a lot of mutual respect.Superman/Batman: Public Enemies perfectly captures the emotional up and downs from that dynamic, with credible and intelligent dialogs which draw their personalities.The screenplay from this movie is truly brilliant, because it is hugely entertaining and deep at the same time.In summary, I have enjoyed Superman/Batman: Public Enemies much more than most of the "real" super-hero films, because it puts the emphasis on the characters and the story, and not on special effects.So, I recommend Superman/Batman: Public Enemies as a great film, which is ideal for having a very entertaining and satisfactory time.
My Week with Marilyn went through a similar case to the one of The Iron Lady...everybody acclaimed the lead actress' performance, but nobody spoke too much about the film itself. That might be because the people expected a biography of the iconic blonde, when it is in fact a more modest movie in which Marilyn Monroe (1926-1962) is almost a tangential element...an influence who alters the behaviour of those who are around her, even without proposing it to herself. And My Week with Marilyn also offers a look to the English cinematographic industry during the '50s, completely different to the excesses and spectacle from Hollywood. Anyway, you don't have to expect a biography/analysis about Monroe, or you will feel disappointed, like it happened to me.Even though Monroe was one of the most famous people from 20th century, her private life preserves an aura of mystery which still makes it fascinating to the new generations. That's why I think it was strange to make a film about a kinda trivial moment in the actress' life. Monroe had a very difficult childhood, a meteoric rise to fame, and legendary personal relationships with figures from the sport, the literature and the politics...and they decided to make a film about her experiences shooting a rural comedy in England? However, I found My Week with Marilyn moderately entertaining, mainly because of the extraordinary performances.Michelle Williams makes a magnificent work as Monroe, because she doesn't make an imitation of her; instead of that, she completely becomes her character. Kenneth Branagh brings a perfect balance of arrogance and professionalism as Laurence Olivier (1907-1989), while Judi Dench brings a lot of enthusiasm and conviction to her short role. As for Eddie Redmayne, he brings an adequate performance, but he feels darkened by Williams, Branagh and Dench.Nevertheless, My Week with Marilyn didn't leave me very satisfied, because of its weak direction and structural problems in the screenplay which make the film occasionally disjointed and not very credible. However, I can give it a slight recommendation mainly because the performances were enough to keep me moderately entertained.
Director Clint Eastwood's previous film was Changeling,and it's interesting to think that,although that film was developed on another time and it had a completely different story,it shares similar subjects with Gran Torino,although they are explored with different points of view on both movies.I do not think Gran Torino is a great movie,but I found it very interesting.The story from this movie may sound as an intolerable moralistic fable which would result too forced and cloying.But in Gran Torino,the characters have enough credibility which makes them to take an own life,at the same time the movie transmits a very valid message about tolerance and redemption.And of course,the excellent performances from Eastwood himself and the rest of the cast help pretty much.I also appreciated the unexpected sense of humor from the screenplay very much.Walt Kowalski (the main character) is a tragic figure who is full of resentment and hostility,but he never looses the common sense or his humanity,which appears when he finally slows down the emotional defenses he keeps against the strange world that goes around him.And,on that brief moments,the character says some hilarious things.But those hilarious elements from Kowalski never contradict his personality.The humor is also useful to show the ideological evolution from Kowalski...and for making more tragic the dramas he experiments.Now,let's go to the fails from this movie.Although the screenplay is generally honest,there are some very artificial elements which take out some credibility to the story.Besides,I think that those artificial moments are also artificially directed by Eastwood,like if he knows that moments lack a little bit of honesty.I had mentioned on the beginning of this commentary that Gran Torino has some resemblances to Changeling.Both movies have as main characters people who refuse to accept the expectations from all the people they interact with,at the same time they learn new things about themselves and about the world.Those learnings are not too nice in both cases,but they work as backgrounds of very interesting stories which have a certain grade of deepness and force.I can recommend Gran Torino with confidence because,although it is not a great movie,I found it very entertaining,interesting and with some touches of honesty.
I complained in various occasions about the fact that the espionage cinema has been usurped by the action genre, becoming it into a hollow spectacle with more emphasis on stunts and explosions than on the authentic intrigue, paranoia and anguish from the real espionage (at least that is the way in which it is described in books such as Tower of Secrets and The Company We Keep). Fortunately, there are some movies which genuinely belong to the espionage cinema, and even though I did not find The Debt as good as The Lives of Others, Munich or The Quiet American, I liked it pretty much because of its extraordinary performances, interesting screenplay and precise direction.After the commercial Killshot, director John Madden made his return to art-house cinema with The Debt, which I consider his best movie so far. I liked the aplomb shown by Madden in this film, because the minimalistic screenplay did not avoid him from keeping a good rhythm, at the same time he handled very well some tense scenes which balance the intimate narrative.I suppose that many people might think that The Debt is focused on the espionage mechanic...the agents' techniques; the "cat and mouse" game between the Israeli spies and the German police; the betrayals and unexpected turns; etc. But the truth is that The Debt puts the focus on the dynamic between the three main characters, and the gradual psychological collapse which represents living such tense situations. The main characters do not only feel pressure because of working in enemy territory, but also because of their sense of duty and the absolute conviction they have about the fact that their mission means a lot to the Nation's honor. And all those ideologies are multiplied when the story advances in time, and the veteran ex-agents have to deal with the lies and mistakes they made in the past. In other words, it would be more precise to describe The Debt as a movie about spies, and not about espionage...the mission is only the catalyst of the conflict and the detonating of the emotions.And I now have to talk about the magnificent performances from the cast. Helen Mirren, Tom Wilkinson and Ciar√°n Hinds bring perfect works; and their counterparts from the past do not only show pretty much physical similarities, but also equal histrionic talent. Jessica Chastain does not need too much words in order to wonderfully express the contradictions her character has in the inside, while Sam Worthington and Marton Csokas are also absolutely credible in their roles. The complaints I have against The Debt is that a few parts feel a bit dull, and that the story does not deepen enough into some of its aspects. Nevertheless, The Debt is a very interesting film which deserves a recommendation.
After the huge disappointment I took with The Master, director and screenwriter Paul Thomas Anderson redeems himself with Inherent Vice, an unusual hybrid of classic "noir" and "head movie" which challenges expectations and gradually involves us into the clich√©s from both styles, which are somehow transformed into something fresh and fascinating. In the context of Anderson's filmography, Inherent Vice can be considered a complement of Boogie Nights, whose tribute to the '80s was as detailed and complex as the one Inherent Vice makes to the '70s; but in this occasion, the characters are involved in an even more tangled and confusing story... and even like that, it's perfectly clear if we carefully follow the investigation (and accept the methods) of a detective impulsed by love and marijuana, and who is not afraid of employing "alternative" sources of information, such as an ouija and a postcard which revives old memories of a romantic moment with his ex- girlfriend. That's the general tone of Inherent Vice... a cloudy "high" in the sunny coast of California, interrupted by bizarre character who get in and out the story with additional information which gradually outlines the surroundings of a big conspiracy. I also have to say that we will never find a clear explanation of the events investigated by the main character; but it's relatively easy to deduct the necessary if we pay the corresponding attention to the cryptic comments and incongruent scenes we find, which are usually filtered through the sensory cloud from the eternally drugged detective. Regarding the "noir" part, Inherent Vice shares the tone and structure of such influential films as The Big Sleep and The Third Man, including femme fatales, missing tycoons and a tough policeman who is against the main character's diffuse methods, despite chasing the same truth. Joaquin Phoenix brings a perfect performance as the "stoner" detective, and he has a wonderful chemistry with Josh Brolin, who also makes an excellent work as the tough and intolerant policeman who is proud of his violations to civil rights, because the "hippies" don't deserve to enjoy them. It would take too much space to mention all the actors who leave an important mark in the film despite having a limited screen time; so, I will just say that they all make a brilliant work in their roles, highlighting Martin Short and Owen Wilson. And a very special mention to Joanna Newsom as the omnipresent narrator whose sweet voice perfectly contrasts with the rough jargon similar to authors such as Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. In conclusion, I liked Inherent Vice very much, but I understand the fact that its affected style and tangled screenplay will divide the audience and leave away those spectators who were seeking a more "normal" detective story, or a funnier comedy in the traditional sense. But, in my personal case, Inherent Vice was a fascinating experience, and I left the cinema with a smile which accompanies the "buzz" this film transmits after intoxicating us through the view of a world which exists half in dreams and half in reality.
It is impossible to deny the influence the film Predator had on the action cinema from the last two decades.Its perfect combination of violence, machismo and a brilliantly designed monster made it memorable.And even though I enjoyed its sequel, Predator 2, I think the hybrids Alien Vs. Predator and Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem failed pretty much due to their poor screenplays and pathetic performances.Now, with Predators, co-screenwriters Alex Litvak and Michael Finch and director Nimr√≥d Antal tried to make another formal sequel, returning to the jungle setting from the first movie in order to capture a similar narrative and aesthetic style, adding a bit of mystery and increasing the level of violence.The result is moderately entertaining, but nevertheless mediocre.Antal's Hungarian movie Kontroll impressed many people (including me), and it was enough for Hollywood to call him to work there.Unfortunately, his North American filmography has gone from the mediocre (Vacancy) to the horrible (Armored); but I had the hope that, with Predators, producer Robert Rodriguez had found a project which could exploit Antal's talent.On some way, it was like that, but the result disappointed me for being so generic on its concept and its execution.In other words, Predators would have been an acceptable action movie if the legendary main monster had been replaced by any other antagonist.But as a heiress of the legacy from the original Predator, I found this sequel to be painfully "safe" and predictable.As for the actors, none of them show conviction or enthusiasm for their characters; on the contrary, they all appear apathetic and listless.But the biggest fail from Predators is that its screenplay is too simple, and it does not add anything new to the Predator mythology.And the action scenes are not very exciting; I have always said that the visual spectacle does not compensate the fails from a screenplay, but with better planned action scenes, Predators would have earned a little bit of life, in order not to give us the impression that it only copies important moments from the original film and it gives them a slightly different treatment.And what they changed was what they did not have to change: setting the story in a different planet seems a good trick to show a different and threatening environment; however, they did not spend any money in designing an alien jungle, so we only see the actors walking through the Hawaii jungle, where one of them can identify terrestrial plants! What was the point of taking us to another planet if everything is the same? However, not everything is bad on this movie: it has some good moments of tension, competent special effects and, as I said on the beginning of the commentary, it kept me moderately entertained.So, I think it deserves a slight recommendation because of all that.However, this film is not very satisfactory, and although it is better than the Alien Vs. Predator movies, it pales in comparison to Predator and its first sequel.
The "big party" is one of the classic subjects in the juvenile comedies, and it has been used by some of the most iconic films of the genre, from its innocent beginnings (Gidget, Bleach Blanket Bingo) to its peak during the '80s (Weird Science, Sixteen Candles) and the '90s (American Pie, Can't Hardly Wait). Now, Project X follows the tradition, bringing a more modern (translation: more rude and vulgar) sensibility to the recipe, along with the currently fashionable visual style: the "home video". The result isn't very memorable, but the film made me laugh enough times in order to make it worthy of a moderate recommendation.For better or for worse, Project X is a natural evolution of the juvenile comedy transformed into a "reality show", leaving the modesty and messages from the John Hughes (1950-2009) era behind, in order to hug the Youtube generation, in which nothing is real unless it's taped, shared and "liked" by friends (and strange people, of course). So, even though Project X lacks of well built characters, logical structure or formal narrative, it works moderately well as a parade of instantaneous gags, and as a depiction of the perverse voyeuristic pleasure of capturing the people on their worst moments.Director Nima Nourizadeh brought a dynamic rhythm to Project X, something which doesn't leave any place to the boredom. On the other hand, I found the characters of Project X a bit antipathetic...even though there are a few moments in which they are partially redeemed by their sincere emotions and fleeting moments of humanity. As for the performances, I found them all credible and natural.So, in conclusion, Project X is very far from being a remarkable juvenile comedy, but I have to admit that it made me have a good time in spite of that.
Last year, the film Paranormal Activity was compared to The Blair Witch Project not only because of its minimalistic production and pseudo-documentary technique, but also for the division it caused among the spectators.Some people acclaimed it as the new face of horror cinema, while other ones found it boring and uninteresting.Now, we have the obligatory sequel, and even though I found it to be competent, I did not find it to be highly memorable or terrifying, not to mention that it is very inferior to the original film, at least by my point of view.To start with, I appreciate the fact that co-screenwriters Christopher B. Landon, Tom Pabst and Michael R. Perry took their time to introduce us to the characters, establishing their personalities well so that we get interested in them.Besides of that, director Tod Williams creates good suspense and an appropriate atmosphere of anguish.However, when we finally reach to the emotional climax, I did not find it to be as intense or satisfactory as I expected, not to mention that it did not generate authentic horror.On the positive side, I liked the performances, since all the actors are natural on their roles.In conclusion, I have to admit that Paranormal Activity 2 is basically more from the same, with the difference that, as I mentioned on the first paragraph, it is far from reaching the level of its predecessor.The screenplay from this sequel is well written, but its structure is too similar to the one from the original film.Nevertheless, I think I can recommend Paranormal Activity 2, because despite not being a great horror film, I had a good time watching it.
I generally like the work of director Barry Levinson,and I have some of his movies among my favourite ones (Diner,Good Morning Vietnam and Wag the Dog).However,I started to loose a little bit of faith on him with his most recent films.Bandits had been very mediocre and Envy had been an unbearable piece of crap,not to mention I could not believe Levinson was involved on it.He needed to do something really good to redeem himself after such film excrement.And although Man of the Year resulted to be enormously superior to Envy (which means practically nothing),it resulted to be a mediocre film.The main fails from this movie are on the screenplay.It is not bad,but for some reason it did not leave me very satisfied.I think it should have been more incisive and sarcastic,and not so bland.Some humor moments fail because they were not well written.However,there are good elements on this movie which make it moderately entertaining.The best thing from the screenplay is the proper commentaries it makes on the world of politics.Besides,there are some good moments of humor and Robin Williams fits well on his character.For that positive elements,I can give a slight recommendation to Man of the Year,although the final experience is mediocre.I hope Levinson has lifted the aim on What Just Happened,his most recent movie.
The artificial increment of the intelligence is a popular concept from science fiction, and we have seen it applied in different mediums with variable levels of quality, from the classic novel Flowers for Algernon to films like Powder and Phenomenon, without forgetting episodes from the TV series Futurama, Fringe, Star Trek: The Next Generation and even The Simpsons. But what we can be sure about is that the price of the privilege of thinking more and better than the rest of the humanity will be too high. What takes me to the most recent movie which uses that concept, Limitless, which despite being moderately entertaining, has a screenplay that is very predictable, and has too many inconsistencies in order to be genuinely satisfactory.The main challenge faced by a story about a prodigiously intelligent man is that it has to impress us with the main character's intelligence (like for example, the great Arthur Conan Doyle did in the Sherlock Holmes books). The problem with Limitless is that there is nothing to convince us about the main character's greatness. Sure, there are various mounts where we see him analyzing the movements of the stock market, buying elegant clothes, enjoying exotic beaches with exotic women, impressing the "fat cats" of Wall Street...but his behavior is frequently so stupid that it ruins the illusion and revels the lack of imagination from screenwriter Leslie Dixon (or from author Alan Glynn, whose book The Dark Fields inspired this movie). As a moralizing parable about the addiction, its causes and its consequences, Limitless works adequately; needless to say that it is not even remotely as intense as Requiem for a Dream, nor as amusing as Trainspotting, but it moderately fulfills with the purpose of showing the high price of the chemical abuse and the facility with which it can catch us.As for the performances, I liked them. Bradley Cooper shows charisma and credibility in the leading role. Robert De Niro also brings conviction as a powerful "player" from Wall Street who cannot decide whether the main character is a real financial miracle or an astute con-man. And even though the screenplay did not give her very substantial material to work with, Abbie Cornish managed to bring a decent performance.In conclusion, I can give Limitless a slight recommendation, mainly because it did not bore me. However, the many holes and inconsistencies from the screenplay make it mediocre and not very satisfactory.
The fans of cinema have surely seen the colorful descriptions which accompany the movie ratings in the United States. For example: "PG-13 for language and sexual situations". Or, in other cases, "R for violence and strong sexuality". That works very well as a guide for parents who need to evaluate the content of a film before letting their sons watch it, or for sensitive persons who do not want to get offended when they simply wanted to have fun. But, what happens when the film is offensive due to an absolute incompetence in every aspect, and not because of a matter of sex or violence? In that case, I propose the creation of a preventive system to warn us about the clich√©s, problems and inconsistencies we can find in a film.What takes me to New Year's Eve, one of the most painful film experiences I have had this year, and some warnings which could have been made in order to make the spectators know what was expecting them come to my mind. Needless to say that these precautions would have not rescued the movie, but they would have prepared us to face the creative bankruptcy the film industry has fallen into.So, I think that New Year's Eve should have prevented us from the following: -Caution: it contains various prestigious actors trampling their careers only in order to charge a paycheck. -Danger: Ashton Kutcher's acting attempts may cause damage in the optical nerve for making us turn our eyes beyond their normal limit. -Suggestion: as a compensation to men who took their wives or girlfriends to see this movie, they can request free time to play Skyrim or Modern Warfare 3 for at least two entire weekends. -Note: the irritating announcements and constant product placements we see during New Year's Eve are a punishment to us for skipping the commercials when we see recorded TV programmes. -Clarification: Robert De Niro's role as an agonizing man symbolizes his career. -Notification: film directed by a Hollywood hack (Garry Marshall) who keeps getting work despite the multiple pieces of junk he made in his filmography. -Caution: the classic question "Which girl is the gallant going to choose?" had rarely provoked such a little suspense. -Obvious announcement: Jon Bon Jovi is even worse as an actor than as a singer. -Announcement: it is acceptable to use clothes with the number 2010 during the celebration of the year 2012.There should definitely be more warnings, but those are the ones that come to my mind at the moment. In conclusion, New Year's Eve is a deplorable and repulsive "film" which should be avoided by any means. If only I could get my time and my money back...
Faster is a very entertaining action film which made me have a good time of drama and violence, despite its lack of narrative innovation.However, co-screenwriters Tony and Joe Gayton took advantage of that lack of originality in order to build a solid tribute to the exploitation cinema which was pretty popular during the '70s. The main characters do not even have names, and they are identified by their function in the story: driver, policeman, murderer...there is no need to know more about them. However, the Gayton bros. transcend that simplification by introducing contradictory and very interesting aspects to the characters, making the movie to be much more than the simple thriller it could have been. To start with, the driver is not rejoiced by the death of his enemies; thanks to the solid (and almost mute) performance from Dwayne Johnson, it is perfectly clear that the main character only fulfills with his duty in order to honor his dead brother's memory, and that he does not find any pleasure in the revenge. He might not be a brilliant actor, but Johnson has showed a good range in every type of movies, from the comedy to the action, and even though not every movie in which he is involved in is good, he always shows aplomb and credibility with the characters he interprets.Billy Bob Thornton also brings a competent performance as a policeman who is, in noir's best tradition, corrupt, drug-addict and alcoholic. But the attempts to redeem himself at his son's eyes feel sincere, and what could have been a living clich√©, becomes into a real person thanks to the screenplay and Thornton's sincere work. I also liked the work from Oliver Jackson-Cohen as the murderer, because he can credibly express the turbulent emotions which are hidden under his character's apparent coldness. Besides, his character looks like the typical British thug on the beginning, but there are various interesting details in the way in which the character was written (like his unusual past, the reasons why he became into a hired murderer, his warm relationship with the character Lily and the conversations he has with his shrink) which make him to transcend that. And finally, I think that Carla Gugino, Jennifer Carpenter and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje also bring credible performances.In conclusion, I can recommend Faster as a very interesting action film with dynamic direction, good performances and a well written screenplay.
One of the few Norwegian films I have seen is Fritt Vilt, a modest but very entertaining horror film which made an efficient interpretation of the slasher cinema, something which was tried by other European filmmakers with bad results in films like Der Tod Feiert Mit and Drowning Ghost. More recently, the horror film Dead Snow took a subject which was exploited in many occasions in North American cinema (the zombies) and interpreted it with a Norwegian "taste". And I am happy to say I was left very satisfied by this hugely entertaining movie, which is full of blood and humor and never forgets the most basic rules from the genre...including the use of a well achieved suspense, interesting villains (Nazi zombies) and brave victims who are easy to empathize with.Due to its tone and its occasional references to fantastic cinema, some people might consider Dead Snow as a "bloody comedy", but I prefer to describe it as an excellent horror film whose intelligent sense of humor is one of its best attributes. The cast is another positive element from this movie; unlike some North American horror movies (for example, The Final Destination or the remake of Prom Night), in which the actors are so bad and antipathetic that we want their characters to die as soon as possible, the performers from Dead Snow are natural on their roles, and so, they make us to get worried about the destiny from their characters. The special effects work very well, and they help to make the violent scenes more shocking.Besides, Dead Snow represents the return of the zombies sub-genus to the European horror cinema, something which was kinda popular in that continent during the 70's and the 80's. And the Nazi zombies from Dead Snow are the perfect villains, because besides of being unredeemable and very easy to hate, they suggest pure evilness which transcends the mere cannibalism. Oh, and I cannot forget to mention Matthew Weston's extraordinary cinematography, which portrays the "white desert" preserving the greyscale of snow, without losing the definition of the images.So, in conclusion, I had a great time while watching Dead Snow, and I very enthusiastically recommend it, specially if you are a fan of horror cinema. It was truly refreshing to watch a movie like this one, which cleans the palate after so many North American craps from the same genre.
Some people found the film Brick to be pretentious and impenetrable, because its combination of juvenile comedy and "noir" thriller seemed obtuse and incompatible to them.But, personally, I found the combination to be ingenious, and I liked the film very much.Of course, that excellent movie made me to create high expectations on director and screenwriter Rian Johnson's next projects.If he could achieve so much with such few resources in his first movie, what marvels would be waiting for us once Hollywood discovered him? The answer to that question is The Brothers Bloom, and although it is not a marvel, it tells a very entertaining story which is aided by excellent performances and Johnson's solid direction, who confirms us he is a very interesting filmmaker with a promising future.I liked this film pretty much, but I found a few fails on it.Like he made on Brick, Johnson sets the story in a stylized world, full of curious coincidences and reflexive details which do not add too much to the story, but they make it richer with additional levels of meaning or symbolism.However, the problem with The Brothers Bloom is that, on some occasions, those interesting elements feel artificial and the characters do not feel very realistic.However, in spite of those complaints, I enjoyed this film pretty much because of the performances and the very good screenplay, which on some way follows the structure of the "big hit" but with a fresh and unpredictable taste...something I considered impossible after SO many films about cons where the final twist is horribly predictable (like for example The Score or Heist).Adrien Brody is very competent on his role, but the best performance comes from Rachel Weisz, who feels absolutely natural and credible on her role.Rinko Kikuchi also brings an excellent performance as the mute and inexpressive Bang Bang.And although they have small roles, Robbie Coltrane and the great Maximilian Schell bring memorable performances.It may not be an excellent movie, and it has fails, but The Brothers Bloom is a very entertaining film thanks to its performances, its screenplay and its direction, so I recommend it with confidence.
Hadn't I already seen this movie a month ago? One moment...no, that one was Love and Other Drugs. It seems that there can never be enough stories about two attractive persons who decide to have a purely sexual relationship with each other, until they discover that they are falling in love, something which eventually ruins it all. Anyway, No Strings Attached is a tedious and horrible romantic comedy.In a romantic comedy, the idea of "sex without love" can be attractive, because it represents something like an "anti-romance" which defies the expectations and the conventions from the genre. Unfortunately, nobody (at least from what I can remember) has dared to take the concept to its natural consequences without interposing the obligatory romance which will eventually lead us to the happy ending. Maybe, if screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether had found a realistic and satisfactory way of keeping the integrity from the characters and their ideology, No Strings Attached would have been more interesting. Unfortunately, Meriwether did not even try, and the result is an irritating and predictable film which does not offer any surprise, or emotions or laughs. Besides, the profanity and graphic sexual references from the screenplay pretend to be sophisticated, when in fact, they seem to be desperate attempts from Meriwether to make us laugh. Needless to say she did not achieve it.I can't stand Ashton Kutcher; I usually find him hateful as an actor. Some fans of his might appreciate him in No Strings Attached for his characteristic attitude of an immature nerd combined with the looks from a male model. However, I am definitely not one of them, and I found him as irritating as usual in No Strings Attached. As for Natalie Portman, I consider her to be one of the best contemporary actresses (from my point of view, she is much more talented than, for example, Meryl Streep or Julia Roberts). However, her huge talent is absolutely wasted in No Strings Attached, because her character is poorly written and Kutcher's performance is so bad that she does not have the opportunity to have good chemistry with him.In conclusion, No Strings Attached is a horrible film which does not deserve even the slightest recommendation and which made me feel like wasting my time. Besides, I am too ugly and old to feel identified with the pretty people's problems portrayed in this movie.
The classical stag-party has always been a popular subject in sexual comedies.The Hangover makes an innovative twist setting the story on the day after the bachelor party.The result is an excellent comedy which made me have a great time.The Hangover resulted to be much better than what I expected because of its sober tone and ingenious screenplay,which exaggerates enough in order to make us laugh,at the same time it tells us a very interesting story which is well structured.I like to finally see a comedy which does not forget to endorsing the laughs with a solid story.The movie uses elements we have seen on other comedies (like the prostitute with a good heart or the expensive car of the father-in-law they have to take special care) but they are used on a natural way,and they are well implemented to the story.But I think the best element from this movie is the brilliant cast.Director Todd Phillips made the good decision of selecting a solid cast with excellent instincts for comedy.I also appreciated the fact that the actors are not Hollywood stars,because that makes the situations from the movie more realistic.It would have been very easy (and commercially less risky) to hire Vince Vaughn,Owen Wilson,Ben Stiller or Dane Cook,but I really appreciate that Phillips did not fall on that trap,because if he did that,the situations portrayed in The Hangover would not have felt so real.I also appreciated that besides all the rudeness from the jokes,The Hangover has good moments of human warmth and friendship.I took an enormous surprise with this brilliant comedy,and I gave it a very enthusiastic recommendation to anyone who wants to have a memorable and hugely funny time.
As a dog who urinates the tree which is in front of its home, director Tony Scott marks the remake of The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 with his frenetic style, which does not only produce epilepsy in this case, but which also erases all the positive elements from the original film, which is not particularly famous, but is, by my point of view, an excellent thriller with solid performances and a realistic urban "taste".The remake, on the contrary, could not have been more artificial and forced because of its hollow screenplay, irritating edition tricks and an over-the-top drama which replaces the genuine suspense from the original film.On its most basic shape, the screenplay from this film is reduced to an extensive phone conversation between a worker and a kidnapper (the two main characters).Ideally, the force of the characters and the fight of intellects should have been enough for keeping the spectator's interest.But the screenplay is so poor that it is far from getting it, not to mention it also has a lot of peripheral elements which are designed for expanding the story and showing twists.However, none of those things work, because they all feel as irrelevant filler.The screenplay was so weak that I did not care about what was happening.One of the very few things I liked on this film is Denzel Washington's competent performance; I would have liked to see it on a much better movie.John Travolta is horribly exaggerated on his role; he never feels natural at all.As I said before, Scott's edition tricks on this movie are irritating.That technique of film-making reminds me of the comedians who make a lot of fuss, shout and say rudeness while telling a bad joke; some people laugh because of the spectacle; and other ones impatiently wait the conclusion to see if the joke deserves an applause.In movies like this, there are some people who enjoy the visual spectacle, and other people who get tired of so many tricks and hope them to have a point.Well, I belong to the second group of people.As an excellent alternative to this horrible action film, I can recommend the TV mini-series The Kill Point; it also shows the struggle of freeing hostages during an assault (but in a bank instead of a subway), but the intelligent characters development, the solid screenplay and the motivation from the robbers show authentic ingenuity, instead of the absolutely hollow and ridiculous delirium The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 makes us feel with its arbitrary shootouts and tedious chases.This movie is the fourth collaboration between Scott and Washington and it is clearly the worst one, something which explains the magnitude of the problem when one of those collaborations was the tedious Man on Fire.Instead of watching this insipid and terribly boring remake, I suggest you to watch the original film, which is exciting and hugely entertaining.
Independently of the blood, violence and "trans-post-meta" (or whatever it is) humor, Scream 4 left me satisfied mainly for two reasons: the first one was that I liked to re-discover the characters from the original trilogy and to know how their (fictitious) life developed; it was something like re-encountering with old friends I had not seen for a very long time (I do not know if that speaks well about the movie or badly about my social life, but it does not matter). The second reason was noticing that director Wes Craven has not lost his talent for the horror genre, which means (I hope so) that the two previous pieces of crap he made of that genre (My Soul to Take and Cursed) were simply because of a lack of enthusiasm and the inherent failures from the "system", and not due to atrophied skills. So, I found Scream 4 to be a decent conclusion (?) of that saga, even though I found it to be unnecessary and not very memorable.I liked the original Scream very much and I found it to be a genuine rebirth of the slasher cinema but, like it always happens, the novelty was quickly extinguished with two very mediocre sequels and many bad imitators which tried to incorporate the same irony and referential humor to the horror genre, but without any success. Now, 11 years after Scream 3, we have Scream 4 with the promise of "new decade, new rules". However, the "new rules" are unfortunately too similar to the old ones, and as a consequence, this film cannot reproduce the freshness and innovation which distinguished the original film. Maybe, what was needed was a new structure, or a different recipe which does not limit itself to recycle the typical ingredients from this saga: the talkative nerds who are fans of the cinema; the voluptuous blonde; the innocent heroine; and, of course, the classic "meta" murders with which the movie establishes (from its first minutes) its sapience about the horror cinema and its eternal clich√©s. I understand the fact that many fans expect the timely appearance of those elements, but I would have gladly sacrificed them in order to find a different perspective of slasher cinema, which would have shaken us like the original one did in 1996.But well...it is obvious that screenwriter Kevin Williamson never had the intention of re-inventing the genre (again), but to bring us a late sequel in order to erase the memory of Scream 2 and Scream 3 and to leave the fans satisfied. Oh, and if he could also restart the franchise, better yet. In that aspect, Scream 4 fulfills with its modest purpose because, as I said on the beginning, it shows a good dominion over the classic characters, adequately combining them with the young cast in order to bring us a balance of adult drama and teenage action. On that way, the story becomes more dynamic, it does not has any time to bore us left and, specially, it increments the body count without putting the identity from the killer in danger. When that revelation finally comes, it feels a bit absurd, but it is also kinda ingenious.As for the cast, I found Neve Campbell to be the weak spot, because she does not seem very interested in her character; she was maybe tired of interpreting it again, or she was maybe not paid enough for her to bring emotion to her performance. David Arquette and Courtney Cox show much more enthusiasm in their roles, at the same time they bring solid and convincing performances. As for the young cast, I think that Emma Roberts and Hayden Panettiere bring decent works. Most of the rest of the young actors are simple "cannon fodder", and they do not have enough time to develop their characters because they are only disposable victims from the murderer.I was a bit disappointed by the lack of blood during the murders. Even though all the deaths show red liquid, their volume is so small that they seem more appropriate for a PG-13 movie (with one exception). However, despite my complaints, I liked Scream 4. I do not deny that it is more from the same, but it is entertaining; and the ending might feel a bit improbable, but I still think it was brave and with a good message about the contemporary cultural environment. It might not be highly memorable nor a great film, but Scream 4 deserves a moderate recommendation as a competent horror film.
The Raid: Redemption was a pleasant surprise because of its exciting action scenes, efficient screenplay and solid direction. As for the sequel, The Raid 2: Berandal, we all expected another dose of relentless action from the beginning to the end. However, director and screenwriter Gareth Evans decided to move from that simple formula in order to present a more complicated and complex story, which reminded of the "yakuza" cinema from the '90s, in which criminal diplomacy, negotiations and betrayals ended up being as exciting as the fights and chases. I definitely admire Evans' evolution as a filmmaker, and his ambition to develop this incipient franchise; however, the "infiltrate cop in the mafia" concept is a bit trite, and even though that fulfills with the task of enlarging the film's scale, it ends up employing some clich√©s: the rebel cop who disobeys the rules; the unexpected honor between mobsters; the personal revenge sub-plot. Nevertheless, that doesn't avoid The Raid 2: Berandal from being an excellent action film. Some spectators might feel impatient because of the quantity of passive scenes in which the characters discuss and conspire so much that an effort is required in order to follow the story, as well as the labyrinth of alliances, secrets and betrayals. That contributes to inflate the film's running time to two hours and a half, leaving the action scenes as sporadic accents of the drama. On the other hand, the intricate screenplay makes the fights more meaningful, because they aren't only desperate struggles for survival, but also carefully planned strategies to recruit allies, eliminate enemies or manipulate the balance of power in the organized crime from Jakarta. The rhythm of the film is accelerated during the last 45 minutes, when we have a long and magnificent action sequence which takes us from the interior of a car during a frantic chase to the most elegant bars from the city. That denouement is extraordinary not only because of the martial arts, but also because of the visual style, choreographic creativity and the violence. So, The Raid 2: Berandal is quite different to its predecessor: the screenplay is more complicated, the emotions are deeper and the violence is more shocking. In conclusion, The Raid 2: Berandal is a fascinating and unforgettable experience which I consider superior to the first film, and which I enthusiastically recommend. The problem is that, after having seen this film, it will be even more difficult to take big part of contemporary action films from Hollywood seriously.
I found Kung Fu Panda to be a very entertaining animated comedy which simultaneously worked as a sincere tribute and gentle parody of the "kung fu" cinema from the '70s. The story was not totally original (rookie who defeats his insecurities in order to become into the master), but on the other hand, there were enough positive elements, specially the funny interaction between the main character and his master. Besides, the animation moved a bit away from the boring "DreamWorks standard" in order to amalgamate a semi-3D anime with the ethereal Asian traditional art, achieving a refreshing and innovative aesthetic. Would it be possible for a sequel to reach the level obtained in that film? The executives from DreamWorks thought so, but I do not, because Kung Fu Panda 2, despite being moderately entertaining, feels mediocre and not nearly at the same level of the original film.Unfortunately, Kung Fu Panda 2 could not preserve the humor nor the funny dynamic between the main character and his classmates. There is pretty much action and fights which attempt to be cool, but it rarely made me laugh. At least we have the impressive animation and art design, which are both even richer in colour, shapes and atmospheres and more polished than in the first movie. And I also admired the fire and particles effects.The voice cast from this movie includes various famous actors (Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Michelle Yeoh, Angelina Jolie, Gary Oldman, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu and Jean Claude Van-Damme), but their work lacks of any personality or passion. I guess that that is the price of recording the celebrities' dialogs with too much anticipation and completely out of context. On the positive side, I liked Hans Zimmer's music and Jennifer Yuh's direction, which exploits the incorporeal imaginary camera in order to create elaborated sequences without sacrificing any clarity during the whirlwind of fights, effects and stunts.In conclusion, I did not dislike Kung Fu Panda 2, but it did not leave me very satisfied either because of the narrative aspect. The story is not very compelling, there are various humor moments which fail and only the ending gets a fraction of the emotionality and suspense achieved in the first film. Nevertheless, I think it deserves a slight recommendation because of the animation and because it kept me moderately entertained.
After Alan Moore and Glenn Morrison, I think Warren Ellis is my favorite writer of comics; and even though his fame was established by formal series (such as Transmetropolitan, Planetary and Hellblazer), I think that his huge narrative ingenuity is better displayed in the mini-series he wrote for independent (or "semi-independent") publishing houses.As much as I enjoyed his bizarre period as a writer of Ultimate Fantastic Four, I personally prefer the exuberant pleasures and overflowing imagination from Global Frequency, Desolation Jones and Ocean.Having said all that, I have to admit that I never found his mini-series Red to be particularly exceptional, so I did not have very big expectations for its film adaptation.However, I surprisingly liked the film Red more than the comic, thanks to Jon and Erich Hoeber's entertaining screenplay and Robert Schwentke's solid direction.In summary, I took a pleasant surprise with this film.The differences between the comic and the film do not only consist in the introduction of new characters and villains, but also in an essential change of the tone from the story.The graphic novel Red is a cruel and violent examination of the "price of freedom", and the havoc that causes in the soul of those who accept to commit atrocities in order to protect the interests from a country.On the contrary, the film Red tells a light and dynamic story, which is full of humor, but without neglecting the suspense and the emotions from the characters.Its basic premise is similar to the recent The Losers or, for the case, to many other films about secret agents who are betrayed by the government, such as Secret Agent, The Bourne Identity, Salt and Mission Impossible III.The point is that the story may not be very original, but that is offset by its ingenious execution, the solid performances and the interesting characters, whose interaction with each other organically impulses the movie and wakes our interest in their destinies.In other words, even though Red is an action film, its best moments are not the stunts or shootouts (which are anyway very good), but the dramatic moments between the main characters, or the encounter with a love from the past, or the small revelations which suggest the weight the characters carry in their consciences.Bruce Willis makes a competent work in the action scenes as well as in the dramatic ones.I also liked Mary Louise Parker's performance as Willis' character's love interest.However, I think that Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich bring the best performances, not only because they make their characters to be likable to the spectator, but also because of their subtle gestures which reveal the complexity of the personal story from their characters without words.And I think that Karl Urban is also solid as the villain; his character in here is very similar to the one he interpreted in The Bourne Supremacy, but in Red, he brings his character something which makes it different.I think that Urban is a very underrated actor, but I would not be surprised if we saw him in the "A-list" from Hollywood a few years later, because he would certainly deserve it.In conclusion, Red may not be an excellent movie, but I found it to be very entertaining, so I recommend it.Oh, and I have to make a warning to the fans of Ellis: the violence in Red is what we would expect in a PG-13 movie, so you do not have to expect the famous head-shots or the creative way of killing enemies from the comic.Personally, I did not need the presence of gore or strong violence in the movie, because the screenplay, the performances and the direction were more than enough to leave me satisfied.
It's been almost a decade since producer Judd Apatow revolutionized modern cinema with his vulgar and shameless style of comedy, but sustained by warm and realistic characters whose emotions had as much importance as the scatological jokes and the casual drug use. That style seemed fresh and innovative for a while, but it was copied and repeated so many times that it ended up diluting, specially when the movies stopped getting worried about the genuine humor, and focused themselves on the task of creating a collection of scenes as vulgar as possible, hoping the geniality from the actors to take care of the rest. In other words, the spell had been broken, and it wasn't so easy to make the audience laugh anymore... and the film Neighbors is the most recent example from that. Apatow didn't have anything to do with this film, but his influence is evident. The classic "neighbors in conflict" premise is used to create conflict, the youth from the university students justifies the immaturity from their exploits, and the classic routines from the actors (Seth Rogen's natured stupidity, Rose Byrne's failed dignity, Ike Barinholtz's innocent political incorrectness) can't distract us from a horrible screenplay which lacks of a concrete structure. I will refrain myself from talking about Zac Efron's "performance" in order not to antagonize his fans. They will already have pretty much difficulties seeing their idol in another vain attempt to abandon his Disney image with the help of rudeness and rubber penises (this last thing is becoming a recurring element in his recent filmography... I wonder whether that has any meaning). In conclusion, Neighbors is a pathetic "comedy" which never made me laugh and which made me feel like wasting my time and my money. Instead of this piece of junk, I can recommend some films inspired or produced by Apatow which genuinely made me laugh, such as Superbad and The Hangover. And I could also recommend Animal House, that classic comedy of university humor which seemed scandalously vulgar in its time, even though nowadays, we can almost find it at the childish TV schedule.
Between the late-70s and early-80s, I remember having heard numerous news about the "hostages in Iran", Ayatollah Khomeini (1902-1989) and the Sha of Iran (1919-1980). Many years later, I roughly found out the events which happened on the North American embassy in that country between the late-70s and early-80s. However, an important part from that political chapter was kept in secret until 1997, and when it was finally revealed, it ended up being an interesting story about espionage, political intrigue and government obfuscation. That's the story the film Argo tells us, and the result is an epic film on its political connotations, but intimate in its human details. And it also makes some amusing observations about the film industry and the sci-fi genre.If someone had told me in 1998: "That horrible actor from Phantoms will become a very solid director", I would have probably laughed while I would have put on the headphones of my Walkman and I would have taken out the antenna of my Star*TAC telephone in order to report that maniac. However, that (false) prediction ended up being true. Ben Affleck had already shown talent as a director in Gone Baby Gone and The Town, and he confirms it in Argo. However, I keep finding him quite inexpressive as an actor. Nevertheless, the rest of the cast makes an excellent work in their roles.Taking advantage of the historical period in which Argo is set, Affleck and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto recreated the images and atmosphere of the early-80s, but without letting the shape obstruct the substance. The same happens with the soundtrack, composed by memorable songs which don't only set us on the period, but also accentuate (or sometimes contrast) the suspense of this story about spies, lacking of action and explosions, but full of interesting characters and moral conflicts. As I previously said, I didn't find Affleck very credible in the leading role, but the rest of the cast makes a good work. Bryan Cranston is very solid in a character who fights against the bureaucratic indecision which puts vague ideas about "national security" above people's lives. John Goodman, Alan Arkin and Richard Kind are perfect as Hollywood magnates negotiating the shooting of a film of a questionable quality, but undeniable utility as the screen of an audacious rescue operating.On the negative side, there are some scenes which feel false and grossly manipulated to increment the suspense, which is already pretty good by itself and doesn't need any tricks. Nevertheless, I liked Argo pretty much, and I definitely consider it worthy of a recommendation.
As a fan of the comics,I am a fan of the book (or,better said,graphic novel) Watchmen,written by the great Alan Moore and drawn by Dave Gibbons.Watchmen belongs to the holy trinity (among with The Dark Knight Returns and Marvels) which marked the maturity of the sequential art,and it transformed it into a valid medium for telling stories which can go more far away than the juvenile fantasies which are represented by the battle between superheroes and super-villains.Watchmen did not only tell a fascinating story which is full of realistic and interesting characters,but it also worked as an analysis and demystification of the super-heroic archetype,questioning its virtuosity,putting in doubt its motivation and even criticizing the fans of that genre.However,many people decided to ignore those solemn porpoises for simply staying in the pure level of exciting adventure,graphic violence and twisted sexuality from the characters,ignoring the intellectual background from the novel,whose success provoked (maybe accidentally) of two decades of dark and sinister anti-heroes,which were full of violence but lacking of any ideas.This was one of the main fears the fans of Watchmen (like me) had with the largely promised adaptation of that deep and tremendously rick graphic novel : that some mediocre director would take style,but would ignore the substance.But I am happy to say that in the hands of director Zack Snyder,the movie preserves a little bit of the psychological background from the novel,which is enough for adequately establishing the themes and stories presented in the book.Watchmen is not an excellent movie,but it is a very competent one because it has many positive elements.Watchmen (now I'm talking about the movie) presents a narrative labyrinth which includes visits to various historic periods in which we see the dawn from the modern masked hero as well as the origins of the different vigilantes,whose interconnected stories show a developer portrait of North American society,of the balance of power between the powers from the world from the world; and even from the human nature,whose vices and virtues could be their ruin or their salvation.Screenwriters David Hayter and Alex Tse made a very solid work in compressing the complex book into a deep screenplay,which does not always flow naturally,but which at least keeps coherency across various digressions,flashbacks and arbitrary changes of perspective.It is also a very good achievement that Watchmen did not bore me at all during its long running time,mainly because of the enormous quantity of information it transmits; although I have to admit that,for some people,that quantity of information will be considered a fail,because it may frustrate them without letting them to appreciate the most subtle and interesting points of the story.The fidelity of the movie with respect to its literary version is very adequate.Sure,there are various changes and omissions,but they result perfectly justified,including the controversial alteration from the ending,which I found pretty interesting and original.A fail I found on the screenplay is that some elements feel a little bit out of place.As I have previously said,the best element from this movie is that,behind the amazing visual spectacle and the graphic violence,there is some deepness and complex messages Moore used in his graphic novel.This is one of that movies in which the style is endorsed by substance.It would be unreal to ask for the same level of deepness and dramatic ambition from the graphic novel,but I appreciated the fact that the movie did not completely remove those elements pretty much (the same had happened in the brilliant remake Snyder made of the classic film Dawn of the Dead).The direction from this film is more mature than the one from 300,because in Watchmen,Snyder implemented a sober use of camera tricks for emphasizing the drama,and not for replacing it,like he had done in 300.With one exception,the performances are solid.Jackie Earle Haley and Patrick Wilson bring competent performances because they are credible on every scene they appear.The exception I had mentioned is Malin Akerman.She is attractive but her performance is completely insipid.I would have honestly preferred there was a switch of roles,so that Carla Gugino (who is Akerman's character's mother in this movie) was in Akerman's character and vice-versa.I would have preferred that because Gugino is a better actress who has a good physical presence and ability for being credible in the emotional moments as well as in the heroin's stunts.Finally,I do not completely agree with the idea of representing Dr. Manhattan by digital mediums.His appearance is fantastic,and it suggests a power of enormous intensity,but he can never transmit the emotions the character requires.I comprehend that big part of his personality must reflect the personality of a God and his complete lack of human feelings...but that cannot be successfully made with a digital but emotionless face,but with a human face full of the small subtleties which transmit more information than any dialogue.In spite of the mentioned fails,I liked Watchmen pretty much.I did not hope this movie would have so much fidelity to its original source.I would put this movie at the same level of The Dark Knight,although I understand it may not be as accessible to the casual spectator as that film.Watchmen was a very interesting and entertaining experience in my case and,because of that,I recommend it with confidence.
When a movie uses songs like Video Killed the Radio Star and Hungry Like the Wolf during its first 5 minutes, it is obvious that it is making too much of an effort to sell us its '80s "retro" spirit, something which (in my humble opinion) does not presage anything good. Fortunately, Take Me Home Tonight ended up being much better than I expected, because I found it a funny, sincere and very entertaining tribute to the juvenile comedies from the '80s.Take Me Home Tonight takes elements from the juvenile comedies from the '80s, including tributes to the late John Hughes ("Shermer School"), hilarious clothes and hairstyles and a soundtrack which runs the musical range from M√∂tley Cr√ºe to Opus. However, Take Me Home Tonight is not only based on the nostalgia in order to attract the attention from the audience, but also on a simple but well written screenplay, with interesting characters and a solid balance of the humorous, romantic and dramatic elements from the story. As a part of the classic formula "nerd in love with the popular girl", the screenplay builds a credible main character despite his unusual circumstances, and justifies (to some point) the bad decision of starting a relationship based on lies, which we know from the first moment that they will be revealed on the precise moment to detonate the conflict between the lovers.Topher Grace brings a competent performance in the leading role, because he is credible as a guy who is a "loser", but not because of ineptitude or intrinsic stupidity, but because of internal fears which are easy to understand. Anna Faris also brings a good performance, and she proves that her talent goes further than being the "dumb blonde" she usually interprets. Teresa Palmer feels spontaneous and likable as the woman the main character is in love with. Dan Fogler is quite funny in his character. And I think that Demetri Martin (who I could not swallow in other occasions), Chris Pratt, Lucy Punch, Michael Ian Black, Michelle Trachtenberg and the great Michael Biehn also bring solid performances.In conclusion, Take Me Home Tonight is not a great film, and I think that its screenplay includes a few forced elements which feel kinda out of place. However, I enjoyed it pretty much, and I can recommend it to those who like the juvenile comedies (not so juvenile in this case) and the romantic comedies with the emphasis on the laughs.
Still Alice is a film about a devastating situation which is unfortunately suffered by millions of people, and I appreciated the fact that this film avoided the excessive sentimentality or pre-fabricated drama. In other words, this isn't a lachrymose medical tale in which doctors struggle to find the cure, antidote or magical procedure to save the main character. Instead of that, Still Alice portrays the most trivial moments of daily life, which acquire a new dimension when they are experimented under the influence of Alzheimer. On the negative side, Still Alice doesn't feel very different to those "dramas of the week" which were used as filler in the TV prime-time during the '80s. What makes this film better than those ones is the extraordinary performances. Julianne Moore received deserved acclamation for her magnificent work, but the rest of the cast also brings perfect performances, highlighting Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart. In conclusion, Still Alice is a good film, but I didn't find it particularly memorable; it's a proper vehicle for brilliant performances, and period. Even though it may offer consolation to those who have had relatives or friends with this illness; my maternal grandmother suffered from it, and even like that, I didn't feel too much connection or identification with Still Alice; however, that didn't avoid me to appreciate is sober didactic intention and the quality of the performances.
In 2011, director Bennett Miller gave us Moneyball, a very interesting baseball movie which transcended the sports subject in order to focus on a human story. And now, his most recent film, Foxcatcher, repeats the formula, but in this occasion, the dark side of that humanity is examined. The result is interesting, but not particularly satisfactory or pleasant. Foxcatcher fully plunges us into the psychology of the characters, observing the destructive spiral of two men with a cold indifference. Despite his huge fortune (or maybe because of it), John du Pont needs something for him to feel a "winner" and satisfy his strict mother, while Mark Schultz basically doesn't know how to do anything outside the circular canvas of wrestling, at the difference of his brother Dave, who could forge a family without abandoning the sport he adores. As for the performances, even though Steve Carell has been receiving many recognitions for his work in here, I honestly found his performance a bit forced. On the opposite, I think Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo bring excellent performances. In conclusion, I appreciate Foxcatcher, but it was difficult for me to establish a connection with it, and it didn't leave me totally satisfied. Nevertheless, I think it offers enough attributes in order to make it worthy of a moderate recommendation.
Amnesia...traditional clich√© employed in all kind of stories for the convenience of screenwriters in search of easy drama, with the promise of using some plot twists (specially during the ending).It generally brings me distrust to find such laziness in the screenplay from a movie, but I admit it can bring positive results every time the screenwriter finds fresh angles to examine worn-out formulas.Pandorum fulfills with that objective to some point only during the last 15 minutes, but the rest of the movie suffers from a lack of originality.Before the last 15 minutes, the unoriginality is evident on practically every scene from Pandorum.Risking myself to reveal some minor SPOILERS (which were already shown in the trailers), I will say I found alarming similarities to Alien, The Descent, Sunshine, Doomsday, Event Horizon, Resident Evil, and a long etcetera.It seems that director Christian Alvart thought that telling the story with a vertiginous speed and frantic edition would make us to get the amnesia from the main characters, and we would forget all the movies which were used as an "inspiration" for Pandorum.However, I have to admit Pandorum kept me moderately entertained thanks to Alvart's competent direction and the solid performances from Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster.And the movie makes an unexpected turn during the last 15 minutes, something which worked as an antidote for the long list of clich√©s which drove us to that point.And I think that the characters should have been more endearing.So, even though I found Pandorum to be a mediocre movie, I think it deserves a slight recommendation, because it has some positive elements which rescue the experience to some point.
I keep paying to see the comedies with Adam Sandler,although I hate his kind of humor.There are two reasons for that.The first one is my stupid optimism.The second one is because Sandler worked a few times with good actors,who made that movies to seem better than what they really are.I thought Bedtime Stories was going to be one of those barely tolerable movies (as were I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry or The Longest Yard) but this horrible film is completely intolerable.In this movie,there are actors whose work I usually like (Guy Pearce,Jonathan Pryce,Keri Russell,Courtney Cox and Lucy Lawless) but their talent could not rescue this atrocious and repulsive film.The story from this "movie" is completely ridiculous and it totally lacks of any credibility...even for the standard of a Sandler comedy!.In summary,the screenplay is weak,forced and it completely lacks of humor and charm.What Bedtime Stories only offers are hollow special effects,Sandler trying to balance his fake warmth with his rude humor and the rest of the cast obviously ashamed of being in this movie.I honestly do not have to say more about this "film".Bedtime Stories is a tedious,unbearable and repulsive film.I have lost time of my life watching this big piece of crap and I suggest you not to commit the same mistake as me.
The film Trick 'r Treat honors the classic Creepshow, because it tells on a similar way five horror stories whose naughty humor and presentation emulate the horror comics from the 50's, although it is interpreted on a modern sensibility (well, in the case of Creepshow, modern on its time -27 years ago-).But the difference between both is on the structure, because Trick 'r Treat sets the stories on the same place and time: the Halloween night in a small North American village, where a big party is celebrated and there is a procession commemorating the date in which "the dead ones have access to the living ones"...or something like that.I think that decision makes the narrative richer, because we can see during the movie how the details of one story affect another one, adding an additional level which makes the film more interesting, although the final experience is not very memorable.A good horror story is the long way Trick 'r Treat suffered until its release on the DVD market.Written and directed by Michael Dougherty and produced by Bryan Singer, its original release date on cinemas was going to be during Halloween 2007, but the politics of the studio Warner Bros. delayed the date over and over.Some rumors say that was a corporative revenge for the poor box-office performance of Superman Returns (which had been directed by Singer and co-written by Dougherty); other rumors say that the original release date was postponed in order to avoid competition with Saw IV; and other rumors say that all the release date changes happened because of simple stupidity from the Warner Bros.' executives.But finally, Trick 'r Treat was exhibited on a few film festivals in late 2008, and it received very good commentaries from the few horror aficionados which had achieved to see it, so its recent release on DVD came preceded with high expectations (at least in my case).Did the movie fulfill them? In my humble opinion, not completely, because although the film is entertaining, it has some important fails which play against the final result.Let's see the positive elements first.On the one hand, we have a perfect cast which includes three solid actors with a medium reputation but indubitable talent.They are Dylan Baker, who is absolutely credible and natural in here; Brian Cox, who is also very involved on his role; and Anna Paquin, who is simply perfect on her undecided character.The girls Britt McKillip and Samm Todd surprised me with two excellent performances.And besides, the direction and the style from the movie are also good.Now, I have to mention the negative elements which avoid Trick 'r Treat from bring a completely satisfactory experience.The main problem is that the endings from the stories result predictable.Dougherty tries to confuse us with some false clues, but is easy to guess the "unexpected" endings from the stories.Maybe, the point was not surprising us, but entertaining us until the ending.The movie achieves that...but with more shocking endings, the experience would have been more memorable and disturbing.What is more, the short running time from the movie avoids the creation of complex characters and of more elaborate situations.However, in spite of those important fails, I liked Trick 'r Treat and I recommend it because it is entertaining, the cast made an excellent work and there are some good moments of tension.In summary, a solid horror film, but not a very memorable one.
By chance or cosmic coincidence, the story of Salt emulates the recent scandal of the "sleeping spies" in the United States, and it may bring an unexpected relevance to a simple screenplay of treason and adventure.But besides of that, Salt is mediocre and not highly memorable, but moderately entertaining.I think Angelina Jolie's "private" life unfortunately takes precedence over her artistic career for many people, but in Salt, she shows the big talent she has as an actress, even on a genre which is more interested in violence and action than in character development.Liev Schreiber is an also solid actor, but the screenplay unfortunately does not give him too much to do in here.And Chiwetel Ejiofor, one of my favorite actors, is absolutely wasted as the tenacious haunter of the main character, and it is easy to recognize his part was written following the clich√© created by Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive...speaking of which, Salt frequently feels as a modern rehash of the formula from that movie.However, despite being predictable and not very original, one of the main reasons Salt is moderately entertaining is thanks to director Phillip Noyce, whose career includes three thrillers which were endorsed by solid drama: Dead Calm, Clear and Present Danger and The Quiet American.Salt is far from being at the same level of those films, and I would place it at the same level of Patriot Games.And since I am making comparisons, while I was watching Salt, I remembered the TV series Alias, which also showed the adventures of an audacious female spy who used her considerable training, personal charm and multiple disguises in order to complete her missions.I did not find as entertaining or interesting as that series, despite of counting with much bigger resources.However, the comparison is not very fair, because Alias had many seasons to establish the characters, while this film only had 100 minutes to give them some semblance of humanity and common story.And I think that, in general, Salt did not achieve that, specially during the scenes between the main character and her husband, not only because of the poor work from actor August Diehl, but also because they are obvious devices from screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (who is better known as the director of the underrated Equilibrium and the horrible Ultraviolet) to justify the reckless actions from the main character and distract us from the "surprising" revelations, which do not feel naturally integrated to the story.However, despite all my complains, I have to admit that Salt never bored me, and that I do not regret having invested my time in watching it.But the main problems from this movie are that it is mediocre, and that it is quickly forgettable.Nevertheless, I give a slight recommendation to it.In summary, Salt is not a bad movie, but it is not a very good one either.
By this time, I feel an automatic distrust against any "pseudo-documentary" movie, because what initially was an innovative interpretation of conventional subjects became a tiring tag which doesn't deceive anyone any more, and besides promotes the proliferation of lazy filmmakers with the mistaken belief that a hand-held camera and over the top performances will be enough to rescue mediocre screenplays. However, there are still some fresh and interesting perspectives in the pseudo-documentary, specially when it deals with different subjects and is seasoned by a genuine ingenuity, interesting characters and a really creative vision which isn't afraid of playing with the rules of the sub-genus in order to establish an own identity. The most recent example of that is Chronicle.Independently from the "pseudo-documentary" format, Chronicle could also be included into the "realistic super-hero" sub-genus we saw flourish in the films Defendor, Kick-Ass and Super; but instead of satirizing the super-hero concept, Chronicle makes a tribute to it with a very interesting "origin story" in which the super-powers aren't an end in themselves, but the catalyst of the characters' emotional growth. In other words, the point of the screenplay isn't offering us a simple childish fantasy about "good ones vs. evil ones", but examining the effect the power has over three young men with very different personal circumstances. Screenwriter Max Landis took the "with great power comes great responsibility" premise very seriously; and when that concept is fused with the "pseudo-documentary" style, the result is an entertaining and very satisfactory super-hero film, in which the most forced elements of the genre, such as the disguises and the cosmic threatens, are wisely avoided. The emphasis of the story is on the characters' humanity, and not on their "super-humanity".Sure, the short running time of the film and the archetypal characters avoid this character study to go beyond the superficial, but there's no need for more in order to bring deepness to the screenplay, which already is efficient, concise and free of obstacles which would avoid us of getting "plunged" into the central conflict. What the film can't avoid are the typical vices from the "home video"...and I'm not talking about the sudden camera movements, but to the coincidence that someone is filming during the most significant moments of the story. What is more, I think the screenplay makes a few little narrative traps. Nevertheless, those complaints didn't avoid me from enjoying this film pretty much.The studio Rhythm and Hues is worthy of applause, because they always convince us that we aren't watching special effects, but the reality captured with simple homemade cameras. And I would also like to mention the solid performances from Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan, as well as Josh Trank's dynamic and precise direction. In conclusion, I wouldn't consider Chronicle a great film, but it's definitely a very good one, and I recommend it.
It was a surprise for me to see the Disney logo at the beginning of Mars Needs Moms. I did not know that this film had been made by that studio; I should have investigated that before. But either way...I was already in the cinema, so I did not have any other choice than "enjoying" the bland Disney sensibility, the expensive but cold "stop-motion" animation and the forced story, which pretends to be warm and inspiring, but which in fact is boring, predictable and antipathetic. In summary, Mars Needs Moms ended up being a pathetic animation film; I guess I could not have expected more, because director Simon Wells was previously responsible of the atrocious The Time Machine (2002).The animation style employed by Mars Needs Moms is similar to the one from The Polar Express, Beowulf and A Christmas Carol (2009) (no wonder it was co-produced by Robert Zemeckis, the director of those three films). And, as we could already see in those movies, the use of real human movements in order to bring the characters to life only makes them (paradoxically) look more false and inhuman. And all that is exacerbated by the horrible screenplay.I did not find the main character's adventure to be exciting or interesting. The motivation he has to save his mother could have been valid, but the screenplay did not deepen enough on that and Seth Green's voice work feels absolutely listless. The humor is unfunny and the general message of the movie, irritating.In conclusion, Mars Needs Moms is a tedious waste of time. My suggestion is to avoid this movie at any cost, and if you wanna watch a good animation movie, I recommend you the recent Rango or anything that was done by Pixar.
One would think that a story about the "vibrator" or "personal massager" would be set in the '60s or the '70s, when the "sexual revolution" changed the attitudes from modern society. However, the origin of that gadget was during the late-19th century, as we can see in the film Hysteria, which employs the Victorian setting in order to create a typical British comedy, hussy but inoffensive. The result is moderately entertaining, but mediocre.The best element from Hysteria is the actors, because they all completely adapted to the naughty tone required by the film. Hugh Dancy is credible as a shy doctor who had the genuine desire of helping his patients. Jonathan Pryce is perfect in his role, bringing an aristocratic poise to his character which extinguishes any trace of malice or bad behavior. Rupert Everett also brings a solid performance in his role; and Maggie Gyllenhaal is completely credible in her character, at the same time her British accent is perfect. On the other hand, her character is involved in the element I liked the least in Hysteria.That element is the romance, which feels forced and unnecessary. I would have personally preferred a deeper examination of the medical practices during the Victorian time (even if it had been taken on a humorous context), instead of the insipid emotional stretch-and-loosen from the gallant who can't make his mind between two women. Nevertheless, I can give a slight recommendation to Hysteria as a moderately entertaining, but superficial and forgettable, film.
A Perfect Getaway was released straight to DVD in my country a few months ago, but I spent a long time before watching it because, deeply, I was not very interested in watching ANOTHER film about stupid tourists tortured by generic maniacs in some remote place.However, I decided to finally watch it, because during his career, director and screenwriter David Twohy found fresh angles to tell old stories, like the unusual ghost tale Below, the monsters film Pitch Black and the extraterrestrial invasion in The Arrival.So, I thought he would hopefully achieve the same on A Perfect Getaway.Unfortunately, I was wrong, because the film ended up being a forced and predictable thriller with hollow characters and a slow rhythm which pretends to generate suspense but it only bored me.To start with, the "twist" in the end is not very surprising; in fact, I could predict it with pretty much anticipation, so it did not generate any impact on me.The first hour from A Perfect Getaway is developed with an unbearable slowness while we follow the main characters on their rain-forest walks.I would also like to mention the fact that one of the main characters is a screenwriter, something which is used in order to incorporate some humor about the film industry and the mistakes it commits...and ironically, A Perfect Getaway falls on that mistakes.I noted that Twohy tried to make the violence to look intense and "real".However, he did not achieve that, because he relied so much on edition tricks and slow motion, that the violent scenes do not feel particularly brutal or exciting.As for the cast, Milla Jovovich, Steve Zahn, Timothy Olyphant and Kiele S√°nchez bring competent performances, and they are some of the few positive elements from the movie.In the last half hour, A Perfect Getaway improves a little bit, but not enough in order to recommend it.In summary, A Perfect Getaway is an unsatisfactory and mediocre thriller which frankly bored me.
In 2008, I enjoyed the film Taken mainly because of Liam Neeson's solid performance, which added deepness to the screenplay because of his conviction and intensity (I will refrain from mentioning that the TV series 24 was quite popular in that time, and Neeson basically played Jack Bauer, but on the big screen). Now, 4 years later, we have Taken 2, which unfortunately is a pathetic action film with an incredibly weak screenplay, insipid direction and some of the most boring action scenes I have seen in the last years.Neeson made his best effort in rescuing Taken 2, bringing the seriousness and conviction from an authentic professional actor who trusts in the screenplay...or at least pretends to. For the rest, the film is a collection of forced domestic melodrama (Kim couldn't obtain her driving license; Bryan distrusts of Kim's new boyfriend; Lennie has problems with her new husband; etc.) and confusing action scenes completely lacking of any energy and impact. I was almost falling asleep during the car chase through the narrow streets of Istambul; and the fights are edited into micro-shots of less than a second, and as a consequence, it was very difficult to notice what was happening.But the worst thing of all is that Taken 2 retroactively harms Taken, because the villains are so inept that they make us doubt about the hero's ability. He was maybe just lucky of finding a gang of idiots who leave him alone during long periods of time in order to give him the opportunity to escape; kindly allow him to make phone calls while they are having him held at gunpoint; and start to endlessly make a monologue when they should be having the revenge they enjoy mentioning so much. As for the violence, Taken 2 is strictly PG-13 material; the main character employs magic bullets which always hit the spot, but without shedding a single drop of blood; on the opposite, the villains employ bullets which inoffensively dissolve through the air, or at most, only work on walls. In conclusion, Taken 2 is an unbearable film, whose 90 minutes feel like 180 because of the poor screenplay and director Olivier Megaton's laziness. I liked his previous film (Colombiana), but he fell so low in Taken 2 that it will be difficult to have any enthusiasm in his future films. In other words, save your time and your money, and don't watch Taken 2. I just hope that this piece of junk isn't economically successful, and we won't have a third part, in which Neeson will have to look for the cup of coffee he accidentally left on his car's roof. After Taken 2, I think any foolishness would be viable for producer Luc Besson.
I always have a bit of distrust before watching the British period films because I usually find on them insipid and boring screenplays (such as the ones of, for example, Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl), but a magnificent production design, European landscapes and those thick British accents which make the movies to suggest artistic value which they do not really have.Fortunately, the excellent film The Young Victoria does not fall on that situation, and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating story, the excellent performances from Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, and the costumes and locations which unexpectedly make the movie pretty rich to the view.And I say "unexpectedly" because I usually do not pay too much attention to those details."Victorian era" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key points in contemporary civilization, and not only on the social aspect, but also in the scientific, artistic and cultural ones.But I honestly did not know about the origins from that era very much, and maybe because of that I enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events which prepared the landing of modern era so much.I also liked the way in which Queen Victoria is portrayed, which is as a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good, but they were at least inspired by good intentions.I also found the depiction of the romance between Victoria and Prince Albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects as well as in the emotions it evokes.The only fail I found on this movie is that screenwriter Julian Fellowes used some clich√©s of the romantic cinema on the love story, something which feels a bit out of place on his screenplay.I liked The Young Victoria very much, and I really took a very nice surprise with it.I hope more period films follow the example of this movie: the costumes and the landscapes should work as the support of an interesting story, and not as the replacement of it.
Director and screenwriter Woody Allen's most recent filmography was quite irregular, because on the one hand, he made the very interesting movies Cassandra's Dream and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and on the other hand, he also made the tedious films Whatever Works and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger. So, I did not know what to exactly expect before watching Midnight in Paris. Would it be a forgettable scale in Allen's ride through Europe? Or would it be a delicious look to Paris through an inspired filmmaker's eyes? I am very glad to say that the answer is the second one, because Midnight in Paris is an intelligent, very satisfactory and hugely entertaining tribute to the cultural roots from 20th century.The story from Midnight in Paris is not particularly complicated or ambitious, but it did not need that in order to keep me very interested in its historical travel, whose purpose is not only making a tribute to Allen's cultural heroes, but also making valid reflections about universal subjects on which the contemporary civilization is based, as well as the belief that "past times were better". And the fact that those fascinating ideas exist into an entertaining and very funny screenplay shows Allen's big talent as a screenwriter. Sure, Midnight in Paris might not have the intellectual density from Crimes and Misdemeanors, or the emotional impact from Hanna and Her Sisters; but that does not avoid it from being an excellent movie on its own merits.Owen Wilson is absolutely perfect in the leading role. His reactions to the unusual events he lives (and the titanic figures he meets) have the exact tone to share the surprise with the spectator, and at the same time, he accepts everything with the necessary aplomb and credibility to avoid more questions than the necessary. In fact, big part of the comedy resides on those reactions; as an example, I can mention the commentary he makes the first time he finds an old car which takes him to the '20s. "Is that a Peugeot? A friend of mine collects them in Beverly Hills". Well, written is not funny; it would be better for you to watch the movie in order to appreciate how Wilson's performance increments the humor, drama and sensation of amazement from the screenplay. Rachel McAdams, Michael Sheen and Kurt Fuller are equally good on their respective performances as capricious girlfriend, pretentious erudite and father-in-law; however, their characters tend to be antagonistic figures, so they are not as likable as the main character.I think it was a great idea to use unknown actors to interpret various of the historical figures which inhabit the 20th century, because that does not contaminate our expectations of "meeting" them. The actors who stand out in those roles are Corey Stoll, Tom Hiddleston and Adrien de Van. The only famous actors who interpret historical figures are Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody, and they also bring solid performances.The best thing if all in Midnight in Paris is that, despite its deep cultural vein, it never feels pretentious nor inaccessible. Those who know the works of the characters portrayed in here (even though if it is VERY superficially, like in my case) might enjoy it a bit more for understanding the references and premonitions about future events (for example, the relationship between F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda). But I think that even those without any interest in that historical period will not have any problem enjoying this film. In conclusion, despite a few minor fails from the screenplay, I liked Midnight in Paris very much, and I recommend it very enthusiastically, not only because it has definitely become into one of my favorite films from Allen's filmography, but also because on its own, it is a very entertaining, perfectly directed and brilliantly written movie.
My dad was a big fan of John Wayne (1907-1979)'s, and thanks to him, I saw in my childhood and preadolescence films such as Sands of Iwo Jima, The Quiet Man and True Grit. For better or for worse, I do not remember practically anything from the latter, so I could go to see its remake without prejudices. However, the thing I based my expectations on before watching True Grit (2010) was the career from co-directors and co-screenwriters Joel and Ethan Coen: Would True Grit be another exotic whim disguised as art-house cinema? Or would it reflect the narrative strength they both showed in various of his movies? Fortunately, the answer ended up being the latter.True Grit (2010) is a solid western, but I think I liked it more as a "road movie", in which the final destination is not as important as the characters development and the emotional growth they acquire during their travel. In other words, what kept me the most interested in this film was not precisely the western aspect, but the progress of the relationship between the two main characters. And something which helped to that were the excellent performances from Hailee Steinfeld and Jeff Bridges, who have a perfect chemistry with each other and can credibly express the emotions from their characters without the need of words. However, I also enjoyed the western aspect from True Grit (2010), because the action scenes are tense and very well filmed and also because of some details about life in the Far West.In the previous decade, the Coen bros. occasionally exaggerated with their characteristic creation of bizarre characters and strange stories, and I think that in the films The Ladykillers (2004) and A Serious Man, they exceeded in that so much that they reached the level of boring self-parody. Fortunately, True Grit (2010) shows them into a much firmer dramatic field, where the quirkiness from the characters does not obstruct their humanity and realism. And, when I say "drama", I do not mean that the characteristic humor from these filmmakers is lost in here; on the contrary, they know how to balance the solemnity from the story with good moments of humor which do not make the movie to loose its gravity and suspense.Nevertheless, I would not consider True Grit (2010) to be an excellent movie like many people do. It definitely is a very competent movie with solid performances, good technical aspects and a simultaneously complex and accessible story. I simply do not consider it to be something wonderful, or particularly original. However, that does not avoid me from recommending this film, because I had a very good time while I was watching it.
It was very difficult for me to sit through Night at the Museum : Battle of the Smithsonian.I was restless all the time while watching this "movie"...just like a jaded kid who does not know what to do.And I can assure you I was not the only one who was restless,because there were various families who saw the movie in the same function as me,and all of them seemed to be busy in controlling their children.Night at the Museum 2 feels like a 10 pages screenplay which was extended to 100.It is not only that the scenes are much longer than what they should be,but also,I felt most of them to be irrelevant.As an example,I can mention a tedious sequence in which Larry Daley and Amelia Earhart (the two main characters) are looking for the solution of a secret clue.First,they visit to the Thinker,because he must be good for thinking.However,the metal structure is busy flirting with another exhibition,and the heroes decide to ask the question to Abraham Lincoln,who tells them some wise things,but does not give them the answer.So,Larry remembers he had seen Albert Einstein's "booblehead" toys in the shop from the museum,and they go there to ask the same question.The final solution is incredibly stupid,but that does not matter,because 10 minutes were already "burnt" with useless special effects and insipid "jokes".Like in the first part,this movie wastes a cast of solid comedians (the new victims are Hank Azaria and Christopher Guest).Ben Stiller and Amy Adams do not have much to do with their characters.Night at the Museum : Battle of the Smithsonian is a truly pathetic movie,which is full of noise and action,but which finally is hollow,completely disposable,and the worst thing of all,hugely boring.Shawn Levy backs to prove he is one of the worst contemporary directors.Seriously,this guy must stay away from directing as soon as possible,and do something else.
After the very good film An Education, Danish director Lone Scherfig must have received hundreds of offers from Hollywood to make romantic comedies. And even though she didn't yield to that (hypothetical) temptation, the publicity of her most recent film One Day seems committed to making us believe that she did; in fact, anyone who has seen the poster or the trailer will think that this film is another empty love story, such as the ones we have seen dozens of times. However, the reality is very different...something which doesn't mean this is a very good film.One Day portrays a more realistic vision of the modern relationships than the one from most of the romantic comedies, free from idealized romance, forced conflicts or those typical "big gestures" with which is everything is solved. On the opposite, One Day shows the least glamorous moments from a long friendship, including the fights, the small betrayals and the reconciliations which bring texture to a relationship which transcends the simple romance. In that aspect, I think One Day is a character study about two fallible persons, but somehow compatible on a deeper level. And the excellent performances from Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway make those characters completely credible.However, the screenplay from One Day is so "realistic" that can be considered "prosaic", and I honestly didn't find it very interesting, specially when we say it in occasional glimpses. In other words, when the things start to get interesting...bad luck; a year has gone by and everything is different now. And even though the characters are marginally original and refuse to follow the standard from romantic cinema, I didn't find them very pleasant. Dexter frequently behaves like a hateful lout, while Emma is so insecure that she ends up irritating with her bad decisions and lack of direction. And I also have to mention a forced revelation which looks like a trick from screenwriter David Nicholls (who also wrote the book on which this film is based) who was afraid of not reaching a satisfactory emotional level to the spectator. Some people might find that ending cathartic and honest, but I found it frustrating and unnecessary.In conclusion, I can give One Day a slight recommendation for trying to do something different to what we commonly see in romantic cinema. However, it didn't leave me very satisfied.
It is not a "real" biography, but even like that, Barney's Version presents an efficient model which should be employed by many other biopics, whose typical fail is worrying so much about dramatizing the "facts" that they lose sight of the main character's genuine essence. Having said that, the life examined in Barney's Version is not particularly fascinating or unique. There is not too much scandal nor monumental triumphs; it simply follows the romantic and existential ups and downs in the life of a mediocre TV producer, whose propensity for bad decisions splashes his insipid life with sadness and occasional joys. And even though Barney's Version is a bit diffuse and occasionally tiring, it generally kept me interested mainly because of Paul Giamatti's exceptional performance in the leading role. Oh, and if the snowy landscapes and constant references to ice hockey were not enough, this movie emphasizes its Canadian origin with cameos from directors Atom Egoyan, Denys Arcand and the great David Cronenberg. An interesting detail which reflects part of this film's strange sense of humor.Besides of Giamatti's performance in Barney's Version, I also liked the work from the rest of the cast, highlighting Dustin Hoffman and specially Rosamund Pike. I have to mention that I had found Pike absolutely irritating and incompetent in films like Die Another Day and Doom, but she left me a very good impression in the film An Education. In Barney's Version, she also brings an excellent performance, which proves that she is really improving as an actress very much. Giamatti received an undoubtedly very deserved Golden Globe for his work in this film, but I think that Pike should have also received recognition for bringing so many nuances to her character in Barney's Version.In conclusion, Barney's Version faced the difficult task of focusing on the life of a loser with all the possible detail without telling a conventional story. And despite some boring moments and the fact that it should have been a bit less diffuse, I think that the film could generally achieve its difficult task. Nevertheless, I don't know if I can recommend this film to everyone, because even though I liked it, I recognize that it is not a film for every taste. But if you wanna watch an unusual movie, I think you can give Barney's Version a try.
With Cars and Wall-E, I saw a declination in the narrative quality of the studio Pixar.Do not misunderstand me...I liked them both, but I did not feel in them the charm from films like Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo or The Incredibles.After Wall-E, Pixar made the brilliant Up, which is in my humble opinion, one of the best movies made by the studio so far (I think the only ones which surpass it are Ratatouille and the previously mentioned The Incredibles).So, I did not know what to exactly expect from Toy Story 3...was it going to be made by the magic Pixar or the solid, but not highly memorable Pixar? Now, after having watched the movie, the answer is definitely the first one.Toy Story 3 is a wonderful, very satisfactory and hugely entertaining film which is ideal to be watched by the whole family...and the best thing of all is that, at the difference of many contemporary animation films (like Madagascar or Planet 51), it never insults the audience's intelligence.Toy Story 3's brilliant screenplay is enriched by deep subjects which are hidden behind the characters' adventures, jokes and rescues, which are the key element which distinguish it (along with all the other Pixar movies) from many hollow animation films.The voice acting is very solid, and the members who most stand out are Michael Keaton, Timothy Dalton and the great Ned Beatty.Another thing I liked very much is the animation, which respects the style from Toy Story 1 and 2.In films like Wall-E and Up, Pixar showed it can achieve extraordinary levels of realism on that field, but not because of that they felt obliged to take Toy Story 3 to those levels.Sure, the elements and the illumination feel more natural, and there are many visually impressive scenes; but the general look from the movie keeps the same tone and style from the first two parts from the trilogy.The only fail I found on this movie is that a few narrative elements feel a bit out of place.But that is a minor fail which not in any way tarnished the great experience I had while watching this film.Needless to say I enthusiastically recommend it.
A few years ago,a movie which had really impressed me was Wolf Creek.I went to see it with moderate expectations,and the final result was an excellent horror film,which had an unusual level of tension and cruelty.That made me have very big expectations about Rogue,director Greg McLean's next film.And I think that such big expectations played against the movie.Do not misunderstand me...I liked Rogue,and I think it is a competent horror film,but I did not find it too memorable,and it disappointed me a little bit in sight of McLean's previous film.Let's first see the positive elements from this movie.For one sight,it gets a good level of tension on some scenes,and McLean could create a good atmosphere.With one exception,the cast is very competent and the actors fit very well on their roles.And,finally,the view of the Australian landscapes result truly impressive.Now,let's go to the negative elements.The exception from the cast I had mentioned is Michael Vartan.He seems to be lost with his character,so he does not exactly know how to react on the scenes.Besides,at the difference of the rest of the cast,he does not fit too much on his role.On one specific moment,the rhythm from the movie goes a little bit down.I think a better edition there would have helped.Besides of that,there are not too big fails on Rogue.Its biggest problem is that I did not find it too memorable.However,I think this film deserves a recommendation,because it kept me entertained in general.
The standard of the vigilante movies was undoubtedly set by the brilliant movie Death Wish.In Death Sentence,director James Wan tried to do a 2007 version of that movie but I think he did not completely get it.Death Sentence is an entertaining action film but its biggest problem is that it tells the same story of a lot of vigilante movies : a normal guy who,after a loss,becomes on a vigilante without any mercy.The film has the same structure of all this kind of films.I respect the intention Wan had of making a version of Death Wish for this century but I think that,for achieving that point,he should have taken the film a bit further.Wan gets redeemed after the false move Dead Silence was but he is still far away from his excellent debut in Saw.Although I liked Death Sentence,I expected a bit more from Wan.But still,this movie has many positive elements which made me have a good time.The action sequences are well filmed (my favourite is the one in the parking lot).The violence is surprisingly realistic and I really appreciated that.Kevin Bacon brings a very competent performance because he makes credible the transformation from a normal guy to a vigilante.Death Sentence is a competent movie and I had a good time watching it.But,on the other hand,we have seen the story it tells too many times and the movie does not result very memorable.I can recommend this film but you should not expect nothing really special from it.
The title "Machine Gun Preacher" evokes images of the exploitation cinema, and it can remind us of films such as Machete and Switchblade Sisters; but the reality is very different, because the film is a drama about the humanitarian efforts of a man who radically changed his life in order to help poor people. A film with that subject could have been intense and touching, but unfortunately, that didn't happen in Machine Gun Preacher, because it has a screenplay of a doubtful structure.I don't want to make inappropriate comparisons, but Machine Gun Preacher could be described as an unstable hybrid between Hotel Rwanda and Rambo. The screenplay runs a similar field to the one of both films, because besides of the elements of an action film, we also have a serious component which tries to reveal the atrocities of a war without any sense at the same time it denounces the apathy of the international community, which prefers not to intervene because there isn't any tangible benefit in the solution of the conflict. And if we add a religious subject to all that, the final result is a film which tries to be too many things at the same time, losing the focus and causing conflicts in its narrative which distract us from the main point, or even sacrifice the humanitarian subject in order to focus on the main character's redemption. Having said that, it's difficult to question the way in which a film based on a true story was handled; and we also know that the "personal redemption" formula is one of Hollywood's favorite ones, so I understand its use as a "hook" in order to make this film about sad realities and cruel events more accessible. However, I feel that its divergent aspects should have been better balanced, in order to complement themselves with each other instead of hindering with each other.On the positive side, I can mention the performances. Gerard Butler makes his character's evolution credible, while Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon complement him well with their solid performances. And I also appreciated the fact that director Marc Forster portrays the atrocities on a raw way, without softening them in order to make a more commercial movie.So, in conclusion, I didn't dislike Machine Gun Preacher, and I consider it worthy of a slight recommendation. However, I didn't find it very satisfactory, because I found it weakly structured and quite manipulative.
I went to see The Secret Life of Bees thinking it would be a light version of The Color Purple and,on some way,it resulted to be like that.However,I would not call it a copy,because although it deals with similar subjects to the ones of that excellent movie,The Secret Life of Bees has a different style and sensibility.But the biggest difference is that,while The Color Purple was tremendously honest,The Secret Life of Bees feels thick and a little bit cloying.This is a mediocre film but I cannot deny it kept me moderately entertained.First,let's see positive points.At the difference of many ex-childish actors,Dakota Fanning is facing her adolescence with aplomb,good presence and brilliant histrionic ability,as she shows on this movie.I am also very happy to see that her image as a "miniature adult" has disappeared.It will be very interesting to see the future of her career and I hope she has as much luck as Jodie Foster,Ron Howard and other ex-childish stars who avoided emotional and professional problems on their adult career.Jennifer Hudson and Queen Latifah have conventional characters (independent woman and wise matron,respectively) but they bring very competent performances.However,the member of the cast who most impressed me is Paul Bettany.He completely becomes into his character and he shows an unusual level of intensity and credibility.And,as I have previously said,the movie kept me moderately entertained in spite of being mediocre.Now,let's go to the negative elements.The Secret Life of Bees is based on a book written by Sue Monk Kidd and the adaption director and screenwriter Gina Prince-Bythewood made suffers from the syndrome of "book taken to the big screen".Maybe,Prince-Bythewood wanted to include moments from the book which may were important for her,but not necessarily to the story and as a result,we have many irrelevant moments and other ones which come from nowhere and they do not contribute in anything to the story.Besides,there are various forced scenes which try to make us cry at any cost.In other words,those scenes do not feel honest at all,because they have a lot of manipulation and artificial dramatism.The Secret Life of Bees is not a bad movie.I just found it redundant and too forced,while all the moments which should be honest feel forced.I think I can give this movie a slight recommendation because of its excellent performances and because it kept me moderately entertained.
The first time I found the Dark Shadows franchise wasn't the 1966 soap-opera, but the TV remake from 1991, which I didn't like (I guess I wasn't the only one, because it was immediately canceled). I only had the opportunity of watching some of the original series in early-2000s, and I found it a typical badly produced and full of clich√©s soap-opera, whose only different characteristic was employing vampires, werewolves and similar creatures as main characters, which by the way, wouldn't scare nowadays even to a two-year-old kid. This allowed me to watch the film Dark Shadows without any blinding nostalgia nor devotion, and even though it didn't bore me, it didn't leave me very satisfied, mainly because I found its screenplay too diffuse.On some way, I understand the problem faced by screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith to adapting a soap-opera for the cinema; there are many characters the fans expect to find, and very few time to bring them substantial or interesting sub-plots. The result is a fragmented and meandering screenplay, with too many tangential distractions which detract the attention from the best aspect of the story: the main character and the cultural crash between his ideology of 18th century and the strange world which evolved and left him behind. The main reason why this movie is moderately entertaining despite its various fails is Johnny Depp's perfect performance, which takes the drama and melancholy from the character seriously, but also adding a subtle sense of humor which transcends the predictable "fish out of the water" clich√©s and the semi-humorous anachronisms from the "modern world" of 1972. Director Tim Burton knows Depp's talent very well, and he knew how to control it in order for it not to divert from the thin line between tragedy and comedy their collaborations have always shown.Even though Depp is the main partial redeemer of Dark Shadows, I also have to mention the solid work from the supporting actors. Michelle Pfeiffer offers a good combination of opportunistic merchant and protective mother. Helena Bonham Carter has a short role, but that didn't avoid her from bringing a very good performance. Chlo√´ Grace Moretz is absolutely credible as a rebel teenage girl, while Bella Heathcote makes a competent work as the love interest. And Eva Green brings huge enthusiasm as the villain (besides, is it me or does she really resemble Heather Graham with the blonde wig she wears in this film?).As I previously said, the main problem from Dark Shadows is that it looses the course in many occasions, and its simplistic "family is above everything else" message isn't enough to be the characters' motivation, and as a consequence, we have various irrational behaviors, forced decisions in order to create melodrama and an ending which degenerates into a sample book of special effects lacking of any emotional relevance. As a comedy, Dark Shadows is very irregular; most of the jokes are bland and predictable, while the small moments and reactions are the funniest ones. As a horror film, Dark Shadows doesn't work at all. In conclusion, Dark Shadows attempted to be two things: the adaptation of an old supernatural soap-opera, and a contemporary horror comedy. I don't think the film fulfilled with any of those tasks, but it kept me moderately entertained, mainly because of the good performances from the whole cast. So, I think this film deserves at least a slight recommendation...something I can't say about other films starred by Depp or directed by Burton (such as The Tourist or Planet of the Apes -2001-, respectively).
After the controversial films Crash (2004) and In the Valley of Elah, director and screenwriter Paul Haggis surely chose his next film with care, in order not to enrage to the sectors of the society he had not offended yet. The result is the film The Next Three Days, which despite being a moderately interesting thriller, did not leave me very satisfied, at the same time that Haggis could not achieve in here the energy from Crash or the emotion from In the Valley of Elah.I do not know if the French film Pour Elle (on which The Next Three Days is based) followed the same path because I have not seen it, but what I most appreciated from The Next Three Days is the evolution from the main character, who is a docile teacher who suddenly has to become into a relentless criminal in order to achieve his plan. That element was the main thing which kept me moderately interested during the movie, and even though it has some dull moments, it was interesting to see the fact that the tension does not come from arbitrary external events (like in almost all the Hollywood-style thrillers), but from the internal fight from the main character, defeating his own instincts and kindly nature in order to fulfill with his purpose. Having said all that, I would have liked to see another actor in that role. I do not have anything against Russell Crowe, and I consider him to be a good actor; but for some reason...No. It is not "for some reason". The specific reason is Liam Neeson's cameo. The first half hour from The Next Three Days gets a bit tiring, because after the detention of the main character's wife, we see him facing the difficulties of raising to his little son, who does not comprehend why his mother left him; we also see the frustrations of fighting against the judicial system from the United States; and the tense relationship the main character has with his wife's parents. But when Neeson comes into scene, the movie seems to come to life, and that moment made me to have good expectations with what was going to come next. Unfortunately, Neeson only appears during that scene, and he disappears as fast as he appeared. That made me think that The Next Three Days would have been much better with Neeson in the leading role. Crowe brings a credible performance as that character...but Neeson was literally born for those characters with an ambiguous morality, and I think that the low energy and lazy narrative from the movie would have been compensated on some way with that actor in the leading role.The Next Three Days has a moderately interesting story, but I do not think that the solemn tone which was used to tell it was appropriate. I do not mean that I needed the presence of explosions or stunts...I simply mean that the depressing tone adopted by Haggis decreases the movie's energy, and it runs the risk of occasionally tiring the spectator (well, at least to me) when it is exclusively focused on the predictable family drama from the main character. Besides, Haggis' cold direction occasionally "took me out" of the narrative, and it made me to question the credibility from some elements of the story. However, despite its various fails, I think that The Next Three Days deserves a slight recommendation because it generally did not bore me.
Death Race was many miles away from reaching the same levels of black humor and intelligence from the original Death Race 2000, but it nevertheless kept me entertained mainly thanks to its main actor and the violent automotive sequences. And even though there did not seem to be too much material for a sequel, the studio Universal did not vacillate to exploit the home market with Death Race 2, released straight-to-DVD. Strictly speaking, this is not a sequel, but a prequel, something which allows a better distribution of the low budget with which it was made. That's the reason why Death Race 2 leaves the stunts for the ending (with one exception), while it skilfully uses the first hour to establish the origin of the death races, as well as the motivations from the villains and the anti-hero. And I have to say that the final result is a very entertaining experience.The premise from Death Race 2 avoided to become into a simple rehash of Death Race. I particularly liked to see the fact that the "hero" is not an unfairly accused martyr, nor he is trying to prove his innocence. The main character voluntarily participated in a crime with disastrous consequences and his conviction in the jail is justified; that is the way in which the cruelty from the "real" villains is accentuated, because their total lack of conscience is not illegal...just lucrative. Talking about the villains, the cover from the DVD prominently mentions the presence from the excellent actors Sean Bean and Ving Rhames. Unfortunately, my expectations of seeing them interpreting main characters was unfounded, because they both interpret supporting characters who are not seen involved in the action. That is a pity, because that leaves Luke Goss as the main actor by default, and he is a bit insipid and not very charismatic in his role. I would have undoubtedly preferred to have seen Bean or Rhames in that role.Despite Goss' weak performance, I enjoyed Death Race 2 pretty much because of the screenplay, Roel Rein√©'s dynamic direction and the delirious scenes of action, violence and big explosions. Those sequences are very exciting and well filmed.In conclusion, Death Race 2 is a very competent action film with which I took a pleasant surprise, and I recommend it if you are looking for having an exciting and very entertaining time.
Even though the science fiction subject from Another Earth certainly attracted me, my expectations before watching it were low, because all its other elements suggested another typical "indie" melodrama, simultaneously melancholic and pretentious. However, I ended up taking a pleasant surprise with the film mainly because of its genuine artistic vision and brilliant performances. However, I found the science fiction angle a convenient excuse to channel the characters' emotions in the direction the screenplay needed.Even though I found the science fiction angle hard to swallow, I found the rest of the screenplay credible because of its honest emotions and realistic characters. And then, we have the excellent performances from the two leading actors. Brit Marling perfectly expresses the emotions from her character without the need of too many words. Endorsing her, we have William Mapother bringing an unexpectedly extraordinary performance. And I do not say "unexpectedly extraordinary" as a disguised insult, but as a way to express that Mapother had never previously found a substantial enough role in order to display his big talent.Co-screenwriters Marling and Mike Cahill (who was also the director) present the story in brief and economic strokes which deeply express very much. For example, I will mention a detail from the first minutes of the film: when Rhoda returns to her house after serving a sentence in prison, she enters her room and examines beauty articles, in particular, a small jar of glitter. Without words and with that tiny gesture, it is perfectly clear that the woman from today is very different to the woman from 4 years before. Sure, that is a tiny detail, but as more details from that kind are accumulated, we notice the maturity from Marling and Cahill, who are not afraid of telling the story on its own terms, because they simultaneously bring us the clues and necessary tools in order to follow it clearly, and to "plunge" ourselves into the characters' experiences.In conclusion, I can recommend Another Earth, because despite its science fiction angle feeling a bit forced and some questionable turns near the end (which however did not avoid the film from reaching a satisfactory ending), it kept me very interested and it provoked an emotional effect on me.
The very positive reviews I had read about Cinderella gave me the hope that this new interpretation of the famous fairytale would be equally made for kids and adults, and that it wouldn't be a cloying dose of princesses and "girl power". And I'm glad to say that the film ended up fulfilling with that expectation, and the result is a satisfactory movie whose old- fashioned spirit is its biggest pro. I also liked the fact that Cinderella kept the basic shape of the original tale, with very few "post-modernism" (that term is so old that it doesn't feel very "post" anymore). Cinderella preserves the nature of the fairytale, creating a modern version which respects the original story, but at the same time, offers the visual magic needed by contemporary generations to keep their attention. The main changes in the screenplay are oriented to bring the characters some depth, including a bit of "ret-con" in Ella's first encounter with the Prince; and adding some compassion to the stepmother, well played by Cate Blanchett. The stepsisters Anastasia and Drisella feel more cartoonish than they should, but for the rest, the screenplay flows pretty well. Lily James and Richard Madden bring solid performances and have a good chemistry with each other, and the visual part of Cinderella is very attractive. In conclusion, I wouldn't consider Cinderella an excellent film, but I liked it pretty much, and I can definitely recommend it, either to kids or adults.
I have never been a big fan of the magazine 2000 AD, in which the Judge Dredd comics have been published since 1977. I like its visual style and the dystopian atmosphere of the futuristic universe, but the central character tends to be so inflexible and repetitive that it can tire a little bit. On the other hand, this raises the interesting chance of enriching the narrative through the nightmarish urban setting, the social comments, and the supporting characters, from bizarre villains such as Judge Death, to psychics with a humanist perspective, such as Judge Anderson. The recent film Dredd is a faithful adaptation of the comic, and also an excellent action film which perfectly fulfills with its intention of bringing an exciting and very entertaining time to the audience.The premise from Dredd has a few superficial similarities to the film The Raid: Redemption, but they are such different movies that it wouldn't be appropriate to compare them with each other. Even though Dredd includes various shootouts, chases and head-shots in a slow motion, screenwriter Alex Garland (declared "fanboy" of 2000 AD) put the emphasis on the main character's personality and on his relationship with Judge Anderson, more vulnerable because of her lack of experience, but also more powerful because of her psychic powers. Olivia Thirlby brings a perfect performance in that role, because she can transmit the doubts and fears her character has under the appearance of professionalism and fortitude she has to keep in her job. Karl Urban brings a surprising level of deepness to his character, despite the fact we never see his face (the helmet he wears barely lets us to see his mouth and chin); that would be a difficult challenge to any actor, and Urban could face it with a very good result.As for the creation of the futuristic city Mega-City One, the studio Baseblack made a solid work in creating vast shots of the "urban stain" which is extended to the horizon, with uncountable skyscrapers of one kilometer high...but the scenes which are developed on the streets of the city feel too normal, and can't totally evoke the post-apocalyptic world of the comics. In my humble opinion, the budget of the useless remake of Total Recall would have been better employed recreating Mega-City One, in order to make justice to the design established on the comics. But anyway...that's a minor complaint and most of the film is developed inside a building, so it's not very relevant either. As for the production design, it's pretty good, because it feels consistent with the possible advances of current technology.What I liked the most in Dredd is the main character's characterization, his interaction with Judge Anderson and the perspectives crash which occasionally makes us reflect about the validity from an obviously fascist political system, but maybe necessary when the social conditions are degraded to intolerable extremes. I also liked Paul Leonard-Morgan's electronic music, which is appropriately retro and perfect in order to accentuate the suspense. So, in conclusion, I enjoyed Dredd very much, and I can definitely bring it an enthusiastic recommendation as a brilliant film which puts as much emphasis on the screenplay as on the action scenes.
I generally like the films from director Peter Weir, even though I undoubtedly prefer his first movies, which contributed to forge the "personality" from the modern Australian cinema, and to bring it diffusion around the world. Back in that time, Weir possessed such a natural style that it seemed non-existent...ethereal and subtle but also vigorous and hypnotic. Now, many years after such iconic movies like Picnic at Hanging Rock and The Last Wave, I could see his most recent work, The Way Back, in which Weir shows that he keeps being a filmmaker who is mature and sure of his vision...even though the film falls into some affectation and artificiality, something which avoided me from feeling completely satisfied with it.There was some controversy about the veracity from the story portrayed in The Way Back, which was originally told in a book written by Slavomir Rawicz which pretends to have been based on true events. But the film never affirms to be sticking itself to the reality; it simply declares that it is dedicated to the men who escaped from the Gulag, something which can mean whatever one wants to interpret. And after all, I have always thought that the cinema is not a History class, so I am not very interested in knowing if the story is true, as long as the movie offers an interesting experience. On that aspect, Weir fulfilled with the purpose of creating a fluid narrative style, which divides its attention between the internal and the external conflicts from the characters. Aided by the solid performances, Weir did not have any difficulty for us to get interested in the movie.Jim Sturgess brings a good performance, but since his character is kinda passive, he gets a bit darkened by the brilliant performances from Ed Harris and Colin Farrell, who both steal the show. They are simply magnetic and absolutely credible in every scene they appear. Saoirse Ronan also brings a very good performance. However, as good as the performances are, the movie stagnates itself during its final hour, and it becomes a bit repetitive and tiring. In fact, I think that that is the main problem in The Way Back. I understand the (artistic and technical) necessity of driving the story with a restful rhythm, in order to feel the fatigue and gradual loss of conscience the characters experimented. I am not suggesting by any means that the movie should have included more explosions or been an action film in order to satisfy the short attention span from contemporary spectators (including me). I am simply saying that co-screenwriters Weir and Keith R. Clarke should have found a better balance by interrupting the monotonous walk with introspection moments for us to know the characters better; or at least introducing scenes where the ingenious methods they used to stay alive during the hard Russian winter are revealed.Nevertheless, I liked The Way Back, and I consider it worthy of a moderate recommendation, mainly because the direction is competent and, as I previously mentioned, the performances are very good (despite the fact that the characters are a bit artificially written). On the one hand, I liked to see that The Way Back is far away from the Hollywood style...but on the other hand, I think it should have taken some tricks from there in order to make its narrative more accessible and dynamic.
The trailers of Tower Heist already leave the fact that there is nothing new in its story or execution clear, but I had the hope that its solid actors and competent director would make it at least entertaining. Unfortunately, they could not do too much, because they worked with a very poorly written screenplay full of pre-fabricated characters, clich√©s of the "heist cinema" and unforgivable logical fails. In summary, I did not find Tower Heist funny or exciting at all.To start with, Tower Heist is developed with an alarming slowness, specially during the first half, because it takes itself too much time to establish the situation, introduce the characters and even create an emotional atmosphere to justify the heist. However, even dedicating half of the film to accommodate the elements and present the abilities from every accomplice, the screenplay makes too much traps in order to make us believe that a group of inept men (and a woman) would be able to carry out a robbery of such an audacity. Maybe, if Tower Heist had been a slapstick comedy such as Rush Hour, or a satirical farce such as A Fish Called Wanda, we could have accepted its many exaggerated or improbable elements. But since the film insists on a more or less formal and realistic tone, it ends up stumbling in a lot of occasions, and it was impossible for me to take it seriously as a "heist movie", or excuse the foolishness from the screenplay on the altars of the (non-existent) humor.So, in conclusion, Tower Heist is a pathetic comedy in which I really wasted my time. In other words, don't make the same mistake I did, and don't invest your time and your money in this piece of crap.
Despite the many good commentaries it received, I wasn't very interested in watching The Guest, because its plot sounded like a variation of the trite "domestic invasion" sub-genus, which I generally don't like. And The Guest starts with similar elements to the ones from that formula, but fortunately, it then deviates in order to venture into less predictable and more interesting fields, culminating into a tense and violent movie, which isn't always credible, but is very entertaining and keeps us in expectation until the last frame. Besides, The Guest has an attractive "retro" style, particularly regarding the soundtrack created by Steve Moore, whose combination of electronic rhythms and "synth-pop" reminded me of the film Drive, or those memorable compositions made by Tangerine Dream in the '80s. Sure, the music occasionally stands out too much and runs the risk of "taking us out" of the film, but at the same time, it reinforces its slightly surrealistic atmosphere, and makes us tolerate some improbable twists in the screenplay. That would be my main complaint against The Guest; some important moments feel too convenient, such as the ease with which the main character introduces himself to the Peterson family, and the absence of consequences for some of his psychotic stances. Nevertheless, those occasional whims and dramatic inconsistencies didn't avoid me from enjoying this movie pretty much. One of the best elements of The Guest is Dan Stevens' solid performance in the leading role, whose expressions and details credibly reveal a psychologically complex character. I didn't find The Guest as good as other people did, but I can recommend it as a very entertaining thriller. Besides, the fans of the TV series Downton Abbey will be able to know what Matthew Crawley is up to nowadays. The intrigue is the same as before, but with more shootouts and explosions; even though I doubt that the Countess of Grantham would approve of his activities.
I found the look to the corporate espionage which brings us Duplicity absolutely fascinating.The extracted information from apparently trivial events; the analysis of the vehicular flow; statistics about the use of corporate team to search pornography; the recruiting of ex-"real" spies...all that subjects are examined on a very interesting way in this excellent movie.On Duplicity,the drama and intrigue do not round on atomic bombs,biological weapons or any other "mcguffin" frequently used on espionage movies,but on the industry of personal hygiene.I liked this movie very much,specially because of the fascinating view it makes to the espionage world.Director and screenwriter Tony Gilroy (whose phenomenal debut was the acclaimed movie Michael Clayton) wrote a brilliant screenplay.The structure from this movie is the one of the "big hit" and on the beginning,it seems easy to predict what is going to happen; however,when the movie advances a little bit,Gilroy finds excellent ways to fool us,so the movie finishes being completely unpredictable.And,besides of that,we have very well crafted dialogs and solid characters who are very precisely described.The ending of the movie is also great; I did not see it coming at all.The performances also help to this movie.Clive Owen and Julia Roberts bring competent works but the supporting cast is the one which stands out.Paul Giamatti is brilliant,as always,on the character of the director of a company.Tom Wilkinson also brings a great performance,which backs to show his big talent.And although their names sound unknown,Dan Daily,Rick Worthy,Oleg Shtefanko and Kathleen Chalfant also bring very solid performances.Gilroy made a very competent work as a director.His style of direction in this movie is very different to the one in Michael Clayton,and it is similar on some way to Ocean's Eleven and its sequels,which are enormously inferior movies to this one,at least in my humble opinion.The only negative element I found on this movie is that the sexual tension between the main characters did not feel completely honest and credible on a few occasions.But that is not a too important fail,specially in sight of all the positive elements from this movie.Duplicity kept me tremendously interested and entertained with its intrigue,its view to the espionage and with its completely unexpected twists from the screenplay.Duplicity is a fascinating movie for that reasons and much more and,because of that,I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm.With Michael Clayton and this movie,Gilroy has become on one of the most interesting contemporary directors,and I am very enthusiasmed to see his next projects.
Although on their times they were considered as action films,the classic movies about soldiers on a suicide mission from the 60's and the 70's (like Where Eagles Dare,The Guns of Navarone and The Dirty Dozen) result,on our days,slow and subtle if we compare them with the action cinema of our days.On that movies,the emphasis was on character development,while their brief periods of action and adventure were a culmination of long periods of creating suspense with a detailed and well written screenplay.The brilliant film Valkyrie fortunately follows that formula.The story is built on a slow way which helps for creating a delicious suspense.The movie relentlessly advances to a satisfactory (but unhappy) conclusion,using during the road,some exciting but brief scenes.After the success obtained with The Usual Suspects,director Bryan Singer faced the Nazi subject with the movie Apt Pupil,which examined the emotional collapse of a war criminal hidden in the suburban middle class of the United States.10 years later,Singer returned to the Nazi subject with an also unusual point of view because Valkyire shows the human sight of the movement to kill Hitler.But that unusual subtext does not dark at all the enormous entertainment this movie provokes on the spectator.Valkyire successfully combines the realism from the extraordinary film Downfall with the dynamism and exciting adventure of the also excellent film Zwartboek.I am not a fan of Tom Cruise but I cannot deny that,with a solid director,he can bring great performances (Magnolia,Born on the Fourth of July and Interview with the Vampire are the clearest examples) and Valkyire is one of that cases.He completely becomes on his character,so I could totally forget I was watching a Hollywood star.Excellent achievement from Cruise.On the supporting cast,Bill Nighy,Tom Wilkinson,Terence Stamp and Kenneth Branagh also bring magnificent performances.Singer made an excellent work as a director.He perfectly directed to the cast and he could create brilliant scenes of suspense.I think the best achievement from this movie is its final message.Any person with minimum acknowledge about World War II will know how this movie ends and that would have killed some suspense; but screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie put an additional level to the characters' actions so,if they fail on a mission,they will win another one.I think that subtle but powerful message takes Valkyrie to a different level than so many movies which want to satisfy the spectator with a happy ending and with easy victories from the characters.Making the victory more ideological than material,Valkyire wins what it could have lost because of the predictability of the ending.The only fail I found on this movie is that some dialogs felt a little bit forced.Valkyrie is an excellent movie which kept me enormously entertained and interested at the same time it left me thinking.And there is nothing better than a movie which entertains at the same time it leaves the spectator thinking.
The sad secret of "B cinema" is that the trailers are many times better than the movies they announce, because even though they can fill a few minutes with attractive fragments, they usually lack of the narrative support to keep our interest for two hours.In the case of the film Machete, the challenge of fulfilling with the promise from the trailer was twice as difficult, because co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis had to invert the process, by creating a film on the basis of a short film which was originally part of the experiment Grindhouse.But I have to say that Machete ended up being an entertaining "B film", even though it has some important fails.The main problem from Machete is that it has too many story lines, and as a consequence, the movie looses the focus because it constantly jumps from one sub-plot to the other one, trying to unify them without achieving it.Do not misunderstand me...I had a good time watching Machete, but I would have personally preferred less "cool" moments and more narrative efficiency.As for the cast, I liked the work from all the actors, independently from their individual talent.They all adapt themselves quite well to the tone required by the story, something which automatically excuses the exaggerations and rigidity some of them show.In conclusion, Machete is a movie which works better for its style and intention than for its story, but I would have liked to see some more effort in rounding out the screenplay.For example, when we learn the plan from the villains, we are revealed a solid concept which ties the real controversies of undocumented people, the drug trafficking and the border patrols, but there is not enough time to develop it because we have to go to another "cool" moment.Nevertheless, I can recommend Machete, because despite all my complaints, it kept me entertained the whole time.
It was a pity to see a good actor like Pierce Brosnan wasted during his James Bond period. The films in which he participated (GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day) were among the worst ones of the franchise, not because of him, but because of weak directions and poor screenplays which didn't make any effort to rescue the character from the self-parody it had fallen into. Fortunately, on the other side of the coin, Brosnan has also participated in a few excellent espionage films (The Tailor of Panama, The Ghost Writer). The November Man is another espionage film in Brosnan's filmography, but it didn't leave me very satisfied due to the various weaknesses from the screenplay. The November Man starts well, with an enigmatic woman who knows too much, some international intrigue and a sly Russian villain with a wide motivation in order to erase his turbid past. However, after the first half hour, things get more improbable with every new scene, and eventually degenerate into a parade of clich√©s which leave the world of espionage aside in order to show us trite action sequences and absurd twists which wouldn't have been out of place in any of those bad James Bond films I previously mentioned. What makes The November Man moderately entertaining is the solid performances from Brosnan, who brings charisma and credibility to the leading role, Bill Smitrovich, who shows conviction and has a good chemistry with Brosnan, and Amila Terzimehic, who manages to take the biggest advantage of her character despite her short screen-time. Unfortunately, Luke Bracey feels bland and not very credible as the main character's opponent. In conclusion, I can give a slight recommendation to The Novemeber Man, because it managed to keep me moderately entertained despite its mediocrity. James Bond betrayed Brosnan, but that makes revenge sweeter, even though not very satisfactory.
I still remember the days in which Harrison Ford was the perfect definition of a "Hollywood star" thanks to his good balance of artistic credibility and box-office success.However, a series of wrong decisions brought him to pathetic films such as Extraordinary Measures, which is basically a cheap and disgustingly sentimental made-for-TV film, which was accidentally released on cinemas in many countries and adorned by three famous actors (besides of Ford, we also have Brendan Fraser and Keri Russell) in the cast.And the worst thing of all is that the movie is based on a true event which is much more interesting, dramatic and complex than this tedious films.Besides of the forced scenes which try to make us cry at any cost (needless to say the movie does not achieve that at all), we have such a basic dramatic ark that seems taken from a quick screen writing course ("First, we establish the situation; then, the conflict is created, and we finally lead to the conclusion").And finally, the characters are so hollow that the actors do what they can with them.In summary, Extraordinary Measures is a horrible waste of time, and at the same time, an irritating simplification of its main subject, which does not make justice to the hundreds of children (and parents) who suffer the consequences.I do not recommend it at all.
I was very interested in watching Doomsday because I liked Dog Soldiers and The Descent, director Neil Marshall's previous movies, very much.However, I had read a lot of negative commentaries about this movie, so that made me to start watching it with a bit of caution.However, I finished liking Doomsday very much, but I understand the reasons why many people hate it.I noticed that Marshall's intention was making a "mini-Grindhouse"...in other words, a tribute to movies like Aliens, Escape from New York, Excalibur and Mad Max.Doomsday makes a frantic mixture of styles, events and locations which may seem absurd to the people who is not aware of Marshall's intention.Personally, I am a fan of the mentioned movies Doomsday makes a tribute of, so I enjoyed it a lot.The cast from this movie is full of energy, and Marshall's direction is perfect, because he never looses the rhythm and the action scenes are very well filmed, since they are always clear.So, I recommend Doomsday because it made me have a great time, but I do it with the warning that it is absolutely essential to know Marshall's intention to enjoy this movie.Marshall backs to prove he is one of the most interesting contemporary directors of fantastic cinema.
Uff...another romance with a "twist".I think that I would have found Dear John to be more tolerable if I had not seen Remember Me just last week.Unfortunately, the overdose of lachrymose romance left me gooey, skeptical and more cynical than ever.However, I have to admit I had some optimism before watching Dear John, because of two reasons: a director (Lasse Hallstr√∂m) who has some good movies in his filmography; and an excellent main actress (Amanda Seyfried).Unfortunately, my optimism quickly disappeared when I started watching this film.I do not think it was only my anti-romantic nature what made me find this movie to be tedious.The establishment of the relationship between the two main characters is full of clich√©s, and it is not well written.I think the only element I liked in this film was Seyfried's honest performance.As for her co-star, Channing Tatum, he is simply horrible in his role.Besides, the story makes too many turns in order to lead to an anti-climatic and frustrating ending which does not seem to even have the intention of satisfying the spectator, but of simply finding an easy way out before we start questioning the decisions from screenwriter Jamie Linden.And speaking of way outs, I better stop myself before talking about the uncertain political and military subjects from Dear John.I will only say that I found the ethic of superficially exploiting the true pain from the couples separated by war to be very doubtful.In summary, Dear John is a simultaneously tragic and apathetic romance which enormously bored me.I think the worst fail from this movie is that its story feels listless and lacking of any honesty and passion, so I do not recommend it by any means.
Clint Eastwood has received more acclamation as a director than as an actor, but in the case of Trouble With the Curve, he decided to yield the control of the movie to other filmmaker, while he only acted on it. And director Robert Lorenz closely follows Eastwood's sober and direct style, while the screenplay deals with the habitual subjects in his movies about dignity in the mature age, fortress of spirit and second chances. The result is entertaining and pleasant, but predictable and a bit bland.On some way, Trouble With the Curve takes the opposite attitude to Moneyball (human instinct surpasses technology), but screenwriter Randy Brown isn't really interested in the secret operations of baseball, but in showing the characters' emotional evolution. There's nothing original in that development; the main points of the screenplay are the reparation of family conflicts, redemption of anachronistic ideologies and the dignity of mature age in a world which is so worried about the future that it never looks back. And despite the clich√©s, sentimental manipulation and excessively easy and convenient solutions, Trouble With the Curve managed to keep me entertained mainly thanks to the excellent performances from Eastwood, Amy Adams and John Goodman. Eastwood limits himself to repeat the "irritable old man" character he played in Gran Torino...and I don't have any complaints against that, because it takes the maximum advantage of his talent as an actor. Adams brings deepness and credibility to her shallowly written character, while Goodman steals every scene he's in.Justin Timberlake brings a decent performance in Trouble With the Curve, but I couldn't swallow his character's function as a potential couple of Adams' character. His character of a gallant looks like a commercial trick, and not an integral part of the screenplay. Nevertheless, I think I can give a moderate recommendation to Trouble With the Curve as an inoffensive and pleasant experience, despite not being very memorable.
The studio Capcom may have been disappointed by the three Resident Evil movies the production company Constantin Films made,so they now decided to make their own version,but using digital animation and setting the story in the same universe of the video-games,so we can consider Resident Evil : Degeneration as a "parallel" movie to the other three ones and not a continuation of Resident Evil : Extinction (by the way,the only film of the trilogy I liked).The final result is that Resident Evil : Degeneration is a very mediocre movie with various fails and the most insipid animation I have seen from Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within.I have never been a fan of the first Resident Evil game.The main idea behind it was excellent : an interactive version of the zombie films written and directed by George A. Romero,with a touch of corporative conspiracies and huge monsters.But the weak controls and the disastrous camera made me not to enjoy the video game,so I have not played any of its sequels.So,I am not familiar with the mythology of this saga.But,I found the story of Resident Evil : Degeneration accessible...which does not mean I thought it was good.The story from this movie is very poor and its "mysteries" and weak dramatic attempts result so generic and predictable which did not produce any suspense or interest on me.Another negative point from this movie is the animation of the characters,because they completely lack of expression and emotion,so they result totally bland.In other words,they are very rigid and so,they cannot produce interest on the spectators.That important fail had also appeared in the previously mentioned Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within but that film is from almost 8 years ago.In all this time,the technology has made a big evolution,so that explains that the animators from Resident Evil : Degeneration did not put too much interest to their work.As a result,this film is tremendously cold and sterile.Resident Evil : Degeneration is better than Resident Evil and Resident Evil : Apocalypse,but that's not saying too much,because I had found that two films pathetic while this one is only bad by my point of view.Resident Evil : Degeneration bored me pretty much and that's the worst fail a movie can commit,so I do not recommend it.
The classic "secret agent betrayed by the government" plot is one of the most popular ones in straight-to-DVD cinema, in which we have many times seen "actors" such as Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren and Casper Van Dien in cheap action films, fighting against generic villains and provoking all the destruction permitted by the low budget from the project. Under the direction from the acclaimed Steven Soderbergh, the film Haywire took a similar premise to the big screen, with various famous actors, exotic locations and a visual style much more elegant and elaborated than the one we have seen in the previously mentioned straight-to-DVD cinema.The plot from Haywire is simple, but screenwriter Lem Dobbs complicated it by telling it through flashbacks, and as a consequence, the screenplay takes shape gradually, creating suspense and occasionally surprising us when the connection between apparently isolated events is revealed. I also liked the way in which Dobbs outlined the story in broad strokes so that we take care of filling in the details, basing ourselves on the ambiguous dialogs and other clues left by the screenplay. I also liked the visual style, simultaneously retro and modern, but with an own identity which doesn't feel as an aesthetic ornament, but as a valid technique which complements the dynamic narrative.Gina Carano achieved fame in the Mixed Martial Arts sport, and she also participated in some TV roles. Haywire is her debut as a film actress, and I'm glad to say that her work is extraordinary. She displays a magnetic presence, overflowing charisma and an intensity we will never see in "action actresses" who obviously need stunt doubles even to open the door of a car (Jessica Alba and Katherine Heigl come to mind). In supporting roles, we find Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Bill Paxton, Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender playing characters which are a bit hollowly written, and which represent gear in order to facilitate the screenplay's advance. The only actor who plays a well built supporting role is Ewan McGregor, and he makes a solid work.In conclusion, I recommend Haywire. Despite a few forced details from the story and the previously mentioned hollow supporting characters, I liked it pretty much, because of its interesting screenplay, Carano's brilliant work, and Soderbergh's creative direction.
It is not always easy, but I usually try to consider the intention of a movie in order to appreciate it or evaluate it with a bigger objectivity.Under that criterion, some movies of a questionable quality deserve extra points if they at least fulfill with their purpose, independently of their intrinsic pros and cons.That was exactly what I was thinking while I was watching The Limits of Control even though I do not consider it to be of a questionable quality (all the contrary, in fact), because I could not see the point of the film for a long time, until it came the moment in which I understood what director and screenwriter Jim Jarmusch was trying to say, and it became into a fascinating experience in the whole, at the same time I noticed that every scene has a point in here.Anyway, The Limits of Control is definitely not a movie for everyone, and it will be highly divisive; however, I consider that as one of the best elements of the movie, because it does not leave any place for the indifference.As I said, everything in this movie makes sense and has a logic, and we notice it when we reach a specific moment.I do not think it is convenient to see The Limits of Control as a typical thriller told in three acts; in fact, I would consider it as an excellent work of art which was designed to challenge the spectator, invite to the reflection and generate questions, but without bringing answers.The fact that a movie provokes all that is worthy of admiration, by my point of view.Examining The Limits of Control in the context of Jarmusch's filmography, some parallels with Dead Man could be found, but I prefer to describe it as the other face of Ghost Dog, which I consider to be his best movie.In that film, we had also found a philosophical murderer, but while Ghost Dog externalized his spirituality for practical purposes, the anonymous main character from The Limits of Control internalizes everything, leaving us with the constant doubt about his methods and motivation.That is a truly provocative focus, because it invites us to interpret the meaning of every scene, of every detail.And something which is also a positive element from this film is the cast, because we have solid performances from Isaach De Bankol√©, Tilda Swinton, Paz de la Huerta, Gael Garc√≠a Bernal, John Hurt, Youki Kudoh and the great Bill Murray (even though that, with the exception of Bankol√©, all their roles could be practically considered as cameos).I will repeat what I said on the first paragraph: The Limits of Control is not a movie for everyone.Personally, I liked it very much, but I perfectly understand why some people could hate it.By my point of view, this was a fascinating experience which made me to analyze it in order to totally understand it.And that is something I wish more movies would cause on me.
On the positive side, The Zero Theorem is full of philosophical concepts, explorations of human condition, and a perverse sense of humor which finds laughs in the futility of people; and all that is contained in a space decorated by the same production designers of the TV series Max Headroom with a limited budget. On the negative side... the same reasons. But, in my humble opinion, the positive side surpasses the negative one because I'm accustomed to see the films directed by Terry Gilliam as authentic displays of an unstoppable creativity, vaguely structured by ideas and deep existential questions which are easy to lose of sight, due to the fact that they are expressed through deceptively irrelevant details, when in fact, they contain the films' true essence. However, those who will see The Zero Theorem exclusively focusing on its superficial elements might find the screenplay obtuse and repetitive, and told in confusing settings created by special effects of a doubtful quality. However, I think that this film's authentic value goes much beyond its variegated presentation. It's hard for me to put that on words, but it's exactly why I generally like Gilliam's films: the sensation of a purpose behind the chaos. I don't know if that's real, or just a consequence of my ossified brain trying to process random information, looking for ideas where there's only style. Anyway, it worked for me, and that's why I think The Zero Theorem deserves a recommendation, with the hope that every spectator will find something different and maybe valuable in the experience. And I would also like to mention the excellent work from the whole cast, who brings credibility and enthusiasm to the eccentric characters. In conclusion, I enjoyed The Zero Theorem pretty much. At the difference of its tortured main character, I don't need a concrete answer in order to be left satisfied by a film. It's enough for me with the possibility that the solution exists in some place of the narrative, waiting for the moment of revealing itself and surprising us.
I am generally not very attracted by the "period romances", but director Jane Campion guarantees my interest in anything she does, so I decided to watch Bright Star anyway. And even though it is not as good as The Piano or Holy Smoke, Bright Star is definitely a very interesting film which shows once more the talent and vision from Campion.Some people might suppose that the usually intense Campion filled this poetic romance with febrile expressions of love and operatic drama, but Bright Star might be Campion's most "relaxed" film so far. Those who know something about poet John Keats (1795-1821)' life will know that it is impossible for the film to have a happy ending, but beyond of that, the film is developed with calmness, without any fuss or dramatic excesses. In fact, I almost felt that the point from this film is not exactly the love between the two main characters, but the methodology of the ancient romance, whose emphasis was on the value from the words to express feelings on an elegant and subtle way, which say very much without betraying the good customs from that time.Anyway, I liked Bright Star pretty much, but I do not think it is a film for every taste. The silence is an important part of the language in here, and there are many scenes which extend without dialogs and even without any action, but not without meaning. The actors make an excellent work with their roles (particularly the girl Edie Martin, who steals every scene she is involved in), and the settings and costumes are fascinating for their attention to every single detail and their realism. So, despite not being a great film, I can recommend Bright Star for those who appreciate a solid romantic drama made with a classic sensibility.
At the same time that the super-hero films are exploiting in popularity, the more modest sub-genus of the "real" super-heroes flourishes as a more audacious and "artistic" alternative, proposing an examination of the circumstances and consequences the existence of these colorful characters could have in the real world, where nobody can fly and the violent effects of a POW!, a ZAP! or a BIFF! Two movies which addressed those subjects with different perspectives were Kick-Ass (almost as unreal as a comic) and Defendor (super-hero with mental disturbances). The film Super combines the approaches from those two films, and the result is memorable and genuinely extraordinary.The movies belonging to this style share the idea that a person needs to be severely disturbed in order to put on a super-hero suit and fight against the crime in the streets. Super tacitly accepts that premise, but with a reasonably functional main character, who can be accepted as a man who is desperate to get his wife back, and also as a person who is enough distant from reality for the road to being a super-hero seem like something acceptable and even logical. The visions he has (or he believes to have), in which God himself points him as a "chosen" one of a higher destiny, help very much. By the way, those visions are represented by a combination of digital effects and make-up tricks in order to achieve images of a grotesque gore beauty and surrealistic atmosphere.Rainn Wilson brings a perfect performance in the leading role, because he is absolutely honest and credible in a complex character. Meanwhile, Ellen Page backs to prove why she is one of the best contemporary actresses. As for the supporting cast, Kevin Bacon, Nathan Fillion and Michael Rooker stand out, because of the conviction with which they express the essential features from their characters.Among the things I most appreciated from Super, I can mention the multiple layers from the screenplay, as well as the moral and humanist vein it contains on the background. In conclusion, Super is a magnificent film, which I enthusiastically recommend because of its delicious combination of violence, humor, excellent performances and authentic drama. In summary, I think this movie is an underrated gem.

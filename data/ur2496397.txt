"The Fountain" often feels like an interlocking puzzle of eras, characters and symbolism, yet there is a distinct overall thematic tone to the film, almost a decoder that once utilized brings out the best in the film.It's the kind of movie that for most people will necessitate a second viewing. Once the viewer can set aside thoughts of the plot direction, the film opens up a lot more in its discussion of life and death and the idea of eternal life. Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, Pi) has brought to life an art film that wraps itself in the genres of science-fiction and mythical history.At its core, "The Fountain" is about the relationship between Tommy and Izzy (Jackman and Weisz), the names of their characters in the contemporary storyline. This is the easiest access point for the viewer and consequently the most important, we see a very relatable example in that Izzy is dying and Tommy, a doctor researching tumor cures, would do anything to save her. Arronofsky uses this as a spring board into the more obscure ways of telling the story (inquisition era Spain and conquering the Mayans and the distant future). To keep them connected, he imposes images of the characters from one storyline to another and uses consistent symbols. Also, his brilliant use of lighting gives the film a distinct look and an overall mystical feel.It's tough to give up on making the plot fit and make sense neatly like a normal film, but this is not a normal film. It is a story about themes that are exemplified by the relationship between the main characters. It is a film about emotions and ideas and discussing them in very abstract ways. It is difficult and tough to access, but very ripe for deep thinking or discussion.
There's only one pair of glasses that will make "The Last Airbender" a tolerable adventure and it's not the 3-D kind. Based on the Nickelodeon animated TV series, "Airbender" is a kids movie, fully equipped with a PG rating and young protagonists asked to shoulder a majority of the workload. Expect just that: a film for young audiences.In a post Lord of the Rings movie world, the expectations of fantasy are higher than ever: epic action, breathtaking landscapes and character-driven stories piloted by professional actors. Armed with the budget of an epic, "The Last Airbender" gives the illusion of such a film and will be judged primarily in all the ways that it fails to live up to those standards. But through the lens of a child, this film must appear as an awing big-budget spectacle that delivers itself directly at their eye level. If much-maligned filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan "did it all for the kids," I suspect he succeeded, but for fantasy fans and matured fans of the TV series, the story is a heck of a dud.Shyamalan fails this time as a writer. The script serves only to push the plot and is loaded with almost nothing but background information, running rampant like one of those faulty robotic floor cleaners scurrying about frantically with some false notion of purpose when it hits a corner and keeps backing up and re-treading over the same places, never covering all the desired spots. The oft-repeated concept is that Aang (Noah Ringer) is the last of the Air nation (there's Earth, Water and Fire as well) because they were exterminated by the Fire nation over the course of the last hundred years, during which time he was frozen in ice. The reason for their extermination was because the Fire nation, bent on ruling the planet, knew the next Avatar, or the ever-reincarnating human who is connected to the spirit world, can bend all four elements and exists to preserve peace, would be born an Airbender. That Avatar is Aang. Fire nation is after him (and not to kill him, because he'd be reincarnated so it's pointless) and he's destined to save the world. The script has very little faith in the fact that kids will understand that, which is probably a correct assumption in many ways, but that doesn't mean they wouldn't be able to enjoy it if the script had been geared a bit more toward the 16-and-up crowd.These young actors, Ringer and co-stars Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone as young Water nation friends that accompany Aang's adventure, are asked to deliver almost all of this information-based dialogue, which sometimes even the best actors aren't good at. You can't expect a kid to act without giving them any kind of motivation-driven lines or some kind of an emotion to play out in the scene. Only Dev Patel as the Fire prince Zuko gets that luxury. Exiled by his father and shamed in front of his people, Zuko actually has motivation and it shows in Patel's performance being the only decent one in the film aside from a few moments from the supporting character Princess Yue (Seychelle Gabriel), who impressively finds her character's motivation in a story that doesn't provide it outside of expository dialogue.As for racist accusations in the casting of this film, every race and ethnicity is represented, (Earth people are Far East Asian, Fire are Persian, Indian and Italian, Air is a mixture of ethnicities and so on), but I can certainly understand it being suspect that the main characters (most of whom are Water nation citizens) are Caucasian. Without any frame of reference from the original series and expectations as to what the characters should look like, it did not affect the film experience or manifest itself in any way other than looks alone.The visual effects, which you'd expect to be the saving grace in some way, are not prolific enough to redeem "Airbender." The best scenes were already exposed in the trailers. However, the way that different martial arts styles for each element influence the way that element is "bent" in the fight sequences is interesting and unique and the way ancient Asian beliefs are incorporated into the fantasy lore certainly prevents any accusations of unoriginal or bad material. The presentation of this viable concept is what ends up being a tangled, frantic mess, particularly for those beyond a certain age who can't simply be awe-stricken into enjoying a movie. As a fantasy epic for children, however, "Airbender" will be like nothing they've experienced before because it will feel to them as if meant for older kids but they'll be able to grasp the elaborate concept behind it. Unfortunately, it won't hook their parents or older companions too.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Kurt Vonnegut Jr's book "Slaughterhouse-Five" is a classic and the film version gets by on this fact alone. The rather faithful adaptation is enough to satisfy fans of the novel, but not even the great George Roy Hill can manage to turn Stephen Geller's uninspired script into a more meaningful movie experience.To its credit, the film does find a handful of moments to illustrate how its main character, Billy Pilgrim (Michael Sacks), is unstuck in time. Vonnegut Jr's book is all about its fragmented and displaced structure, making the film's transitions key to visually re-creating "Slaughterhouse-Five." A number of these transitions work nicely, but mostly they feel like shifts between Billy during the war, Billy and his family life and Billy on the planet Tralfamador. They're sometimes quick and uncreative and we fail to ever fully enter Billy's shoes.It's a shame, because Billy Pilgrim is an easy character to sympathize with. His horror stories as a prisoner of war in Germany, living through the bombing of Dresden and the unsatisfactory marriage that he's sort of participating in are emblematic of many average peoples' lives. Compound that with the idea that he experiences his life out of order, unable to put anything in the past or avoid the future and his existence is something we can't help but wonder how we would handle -- and ultimately be glad we don't have to.Part of the problem is that Vonnegut Jr's beautiful but difficult prose is lost. Say "So it goes" at the end of a sentence and any literature lover will get your reference. The phrase doesn't so much as earn a cameo to my recollection in the entire film. Rarely does a film beg for a film-making technique like "Slaughterhouse-Five," but it's painfully obvious that it needs voice-over narration, or some kind of guiding force to help us through this structurally disjointed journey.Hill and Geller create some nice moments that weren't notable or even included in the book, but it's all throwaway without something to tie it together, something to complicate Vonnegut Jr's themes and allude to the epiphany about time at the climax. Instead, Pilgrim's explanation of time in the final ten minutes is the crux of the entire film, the only moment that really exposes the goal of the story's chronological experiment.Geller's adaptation is just not enough. It's satisfying and faithful, but it doesn't leave an imprint like the novel does. The screenplay doesn't match the intensity of the creative energy from Vonnegut Jr's classic, it merely attempts to mimic it in the most basic way.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Look around Hollywood and you get the feeling that the art of the romance movie is either dying or has been dead for some time. Romance as a genre term has practically been replaced by the phrase "rom-com," and the only alternatives are gooey teen-geared fare ("Twilight" or a Nicholas Sparks adaptation) or the occasional period love story. "Silver Linings Playbook" doesn't fit any one category, and perhaps therein is its bit of genius.Although you can't exactly put label on and file away director David O. Russell's follow-up to his heavily awarded ensemble drama "The Fighter," that's not to say this new film is completely unique. Rather, it tells a predictable romance in an unconventional fashion.As part comedy, "Silver Linings" has none of the dramatic weight of "The Fighter" or quite the same storytelling power, but both films share one critical thing in common: convincing turns from an ace ensemble cast. Russell loves familial dysfunction, and while the stakes never feel quite as high as "The Fighter" (that's the last comparison), the performances have this touching humility to them. Russell clearly has a penchant for getting the best from his talent.Stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence receive a special opportunity to take their already proved talent to another level as Pat and Tiffany, two people recovering from recent past traumas with diagnosed mental issues and boatloads of sexual tension. At the same time, as much of an excuse as they have to let their characters snap without warning, they still have to make it convincing and they do.Cooper's Pat comes home to live with his parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) in Philadelphia after the court has allowed for his release from a mental institution in Baltimore. Although he refuses to take meds, we meet Pat in a place where he's on the mend, or at least believes he has the tools to overcome his past: stay positive, work to make yourself better and and look for the silver lining. The trouble is he's still hung up about his wife, Nikki, who is directly connected to the source of his issues.In taking the steps that he believes will allow Nikki to love him again, Pat meets Tiffany, whose husband died recently. She has her own philosophy for coping, and becomes a major curveball in Pat's self-prescribed plan. Her connection to Nikki through her older sister Veronica (Julia Styles) further complicates her and Pat's relationship."Silver Linings" dances around a bit when it comes to its core thread. Pat and Tiffany's relationship and complicated "romance" (it becomes clear from their first scene together that they have chemistry and will end up entangled romantically somehow) is definitely the centerpiece of the film, but it constantly shifts lenses. At first it appears to be about mental illness, then it morphs into a story about acceptance, then it focuses on making connections, then it becomes about perspectives, etc. These are all valid and generally related ideas, but the film drifts through them and the script never makes any deep cathartic breakthroughs as a result.That's when you have to start peeling back the many layers of "Silver Linings Playbook" to see it as a romance story and family drama. As complicated as things are between Pat and Tiffany, the essence of their relationship can be identified as a need for an honest connection, to not let the past or the judgments of others complicate what is clearly pure chemistry.The parallels to the film's family relationships are clear, though the romantic and family threads aren't quite interconnected until a plot device at the end binds them all together. In his best role in years, De Niro plays a caring but emotionally distant father obsessed with the Philadelphia Eagles. He has turned to bookmaking after losing his job and it has brought out the worst of his superstitious compulsions. His own fixation mirrors his son's, yet they are both too blinded to see the similarities in their differences.Relationship dynamics are at the heart of any ensemble film and the praise tends to get limited to acting, but Russell's direction could be the unsung hero of "Silver Linings" among general audiences. His camera is particularly active for a film in this genre cluster and it results in several angles and takes that add to the relationship tension. There's also an almost frenetic pacing at times that he uses to capture some of the mental instability of the main characters. It can be a frustrating tactic, but it forces us to relate to the characters by experiencing the film as they experience the world, Pat specifically.Russell occasionally veers into comic territory as well with his technique. "Silver Linings" draws a lot of its humor from dysfunction between characters both in written dialogue and physicality of performance, but Russell  in a way that feels spontaneous  gives the humor an extra bite so we realize we're also supposed to be enjoying ourselves while watching the film."Silver LInings Playbook" could at any time take a turn for the heavy side of things given the material, but Russell's choice to lean a bit more toward his quirkier roots gives it a real crowd-pleasing quality. The decidedly romantic and satisfying ending definitely assures this, but arguably of more importance, the choice accurately reflects the film's message of optimism, to see things with a certain perspective.So despite not always being cohesive and movingly eloquent, "Silver Linings Playbook" entertains and never apologizes for what it is  or isn't.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Witches and wizards under curses living in harmony in a world of humans in a more futuristic spin on WWII-era England -- let's just say the knowledge that Hayao Miyazaki merely adapted this story from a book (by Diana Wynne Jones) is surprising yet incredibly encouraging for those who love the fantasy genre, that there are artists out there with such free imaginations."Howl's Moving Castle" is another incredible Miyazaki film that captures your imagination in every frame and its teaming up with Disney for the U.S. release proves that there is still some dedication to the animated fantasy genre and that we aren't just enjoying the last few jewels falling out of an old 2D treasure chest.In what seems like a classic Miyazaki story, a girl named Sophie is put under a curse by a witch that turns her into an old woman. Seeking a cure, she ventures out to where the witches and wizards live, only to get swooped up by a mechanical castle owned by a young wizard named Howl (voiced perfectly by Christian Bale in the American version) and powered by a fire demon named Calcifer (Billy Crystal, another fantastic move by Disney). In the background, the country they are from is at war and Howl is on the run from being called into duty. It's a fairytale with romance and action to boot.Imagination abounds in this movie as one would expect. Just when you think you have an understanding of the universe that's been created, there's another something magical to grasp. It can get a bit tough to make sense of as you go along, but fantasy-lovers will be captivated by how vast of a world of possibility the story creates while still sticking to the fairytale conventions that have grounded the genre throughout time: stolen hearts, curses, beastly transformation, etc. Unlike some Miyazaki movies, "Howl" is also more accessible through its in innocent human character living in a world much like ours that gets swept off into unfamiliar territory -- a lot like his last film, the Oscar-winning "Spirited Away."Like its predecessor, "Howl" will excite you in ways you generally don't experience at the movies these days. It is escapism at its finest but not entirely out of touch with our world, a true delight from the master of imaginative film-making.
The first thing that stands out about "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is that it's not gun- shy about its moral storytelling. From the get-go, legendary director John Huston, who wrote the script and directed based on a novel by B. Traven, feeds us foreshadowing about the perils of money and seeking great fortune. In the beginning, the prospector, Howard, played by Huston's father, Walter, in a role that won him an Academy Award, warns us "I know what gold does to men's souls." From there on out we know we're in store for great human conflict fueled by greed, paranoia and the American dream.As a classic Western, "Sierra Madre" is not as exciting or action-packed as it is interpersonal drama and suspense. There are still gun fights and encounters with indigenous people (in this case Native Mexicans), but the focus is on three men, Dobbs (Bogart), Howard (Huston) and Curtin (Holt) who agree in principle to search for gold in Mexico and split the earnings fairly. When they discover gold, the wealth becomes real and paranoia sets in, especially with Dobbs, who cooks up delusional schemes of deception and even threatens to kill without hesitation.Bogart's turn as the dirty, malcontented and often crazy Dobbs is -- in my opinion -- the film's stand-out performance. Huston is written as the complement to that high-strung and distrusting character and that's what makes him noteworthy too. Bogart really pushes our comfort level; he makes us take the film's "who might cross who" game seriously. It doesn't necessarily work without his character putting ideas in the others' (and our) heads. He gives a face to the rotten side of human nature that we're ashamed of but have to acknowledge exists.Huston, most importantly, provides us the sense that these men have honestly nothing else to concern themselves with other than money. Although we want to believe they can take solace in the unexpected friendship they've discovered and inherently trust one another, Huston has convincingly set the stage for doubt and desperation. He's guided by a rigid moral compass in the creation of this film that even manages to express itself poetically once or twice. As Dobbs tries to sleep by the fire believing he has killed someone, the flames of the fire dance brighter to suggest the inner wrongdoing Dobbs is experiencing -- and presumably that he has sinned and is bound for hell.A few scenes felt a bit out of place or unnecessarily dragged out, so "Sierra Madre" doesn't always keep you actively interested, but the inherent human truth that Huston explores that relates so closely to our everyday wants and desires is such a beacon for this film. The shoes of these three men are some of the easiest characters' shoes to step in in all of film because its so fundamental to us. Even as children we make pacts that show we trust others and believe that everything will be fair and equitable. Huston just tells that story from the adult perspective using the trappings of classic Westerns.~Steven CVisit my site at moviemusereviews.com
Sometimes a good story is all a film needs to be successful. Khaled Hosseini's novel is one of those stories and with a more-than-competent director in charge, "The Kite Runner" was set to fly as a film. Maybe not as high as one might expect, but there's nothing but quality storytelling being done here."The Kite Runner" is the touching story of an Afghan-American man named Amir (Khalid Abdalla) who reflects on a childhood friendship with a boy named Hassan, who was the son of his father's servant. Years later in America (having fled Afghanistan when the Soviets invaded in the '70s), Amir is a successful novelist but one of his father's old friends calls him and begs him to return. He agrees and once there, learns something new about his old friend Hassan, the boy he childishly tried to distance himself from out of fear.David Benioff, who adapted "Troy" and collaborated with director Mar Forster ("Finding Neverland") on 2005 thriller "Stay," puts together a strong adaptation, but not an exceptionally creative one. The film is written in three acts: Amir and Hassan as children in Kabul, Amir and his father in America and Amir returning to Afghanistan. Each is effective in its own way, but there's a definite lack of conflict written into the structure. Each "act" has its own dramatic moments, but if they were woven together a bit more intricately, the full effect of Hosseini's story could be felt.Regardless, Forster really makes this a visually stunning film for one that isn't very dependent on visuals having come from a book. Cinematographer Roberto Schaefer, who has collaborated with Forster on all his major projects, manages to turn China into Afghanistan and Pakistan while still capturing the full extent of the landscape. The film in general just has a very bold, rich and realistic feel to it. Hard to explain, but between the lens quality, the lighting and Forster's framing, "Kite Runner" just feels more professional. Even the kite- flying scenes, which are entirely CGI, give the film a more majestic quality.Although adventurous creativity and cinematic risk-taking is decidedly lacking, everyone working on this film has found a way to tell the story in a satisfying and effective way. The film gets the most out of its actors and the most out of its crew, delivering a film experience that will leave its viewers with warm and fuzzy feeling, just not an eye-opening and stimulating one.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Male nudity is not the main dish served in "The Full Monty," it's just the building block for comedy and drama. It's mostly the idea of it and then some shots of men in thongs and bare bottoms, but you never get what the title alleges. I suppose depending on who you are, that will get you to watch the film or disappoint you."The Full Monty" is a straight-forward British comedy accompanied by some family drama. A couple unemployed steelworkers (Carlyle and Addy) struggle to make ends meet when they take notice that there's money to be made in stripping. They bring some other men into the mix, including Tom Wilkinson, and form a group, keeping it silent from there families, except Carlyle's character from his son, who tags along.The real heart of this film is that these men are doing this for noble reasons: Carlyle wants joint custody of his son, Addy's character is dealing self-confidence issues and Wilkinson's character doesn't want to disappoint his wife's vacation plans. While they all lie, they come to terms with that in the film. Then there's plenty of British humor to go around as these men deal with humiliation and desperation.The biggest problem with this film is its 90 minute run time. While I'm impressed with what director Peter Cattaneo and writer Simon Beaufoy fit into that short time, the plot is awfully simple for this type of film and the characters aren't nearly as tapped into as they could be. The humor is also somewhat limited and there's definitely potential for more."Full Monty" is a nice, quick, change-of-pace comedy that takes a good idea and does a solid job of turning it into a film.
Legendary science-fiction novelist Philip K. Dick could probably never have imagined a film adaptation of one of his novels being rotoscoped, but the medium comes off as a perfect fit for a story all about the destructive, mind-altering nature of hallucinogenic drugs. The entire film is like a trip -- an inspiring technique that rolls over the holes and vagueness of the screenplay to create an entirely unique film experience.A film can be made a certain way for style points or it can be made that way for a content- driven reason. Director/writer Richard Linklater does both in "A Scanner Darkly." Well-known by some for his era comedies "Slackers" and "Dazed and Confused" and by others for his indie romances "Before Sunrise" and "Before Sunset," the science-fiction turn is a gutsy one for Linklater. It certainly pays off in a film that's just as daring. Animation outside the property boundaries of Disney World is often dismissed as hokey, but Linklater uses it intelligently. Instead of merely rotoscoping all the live-action shots, the artists create a rendering that breathes more life into the images. Even if it's just the way the characters' hair changes shades in the light, it's fascinating to watch. Sometimes, admittedly, it distracts from a plot too tough to follow at points. The film walks that line finely, but when it adds to the film it really does make an impact.Starring an interesting trio of Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., and Winona Ryder, "A Scanner Darkly" is the story of a not-so-distant future where an epidemic of addiction to a "Substance D" is tearing apart the country. Bob Arctor (Reeves) is an under-cover narcotics officer (he wears a suit concealing his identity to even his co-workers, or most of them) assigned to bust a ring which he soon discovers he is intimately tied to and identified as a possible dealer. When his friend James (Downey Jr.) comes to the police trying to incriminate him, Arctor is forced to study himself essentially, a stress that leads to his own excessive use of Substance D and causes him to plunge toward depression.It's not a surprise that the story was essentially composed based on Dick's own experience with drugs. The idea of the scanner darkly is a deeply introspective one. For those who can connect to the struggle between drug use and identity, this might be the most powerful look at it that one can get. In a way this sort of justifies how confusing the film can be.Others who will like the film are Quentin Tarantino fans. The earlier portions of this film represent his stream of consciousness dialog and the drugged-out characters (one being Woody Harrelson even) contribute to this idea. Guys such as Harrelson and Downey Jr. are perfect in their roles as a result. Reeves is good because once again his character is actually supposed to be stoic and confused all the time. The typecast is a slap in the face, but at least Reeves and his agent clearly know this is the only type of role he can do well.The best way to sum up "Darkly" is to call it a combination of classic literary science-fiction, Hunter S. Thompson and "Pulp Fiction." It's bizarre, humorous in a dark way and ultimately eye-opening.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
When Seth Rogen got his paws on rights to turn the masked crimefighter radio and TV series "The Green Hornet" into a movie, we figured to have it pegged. Rogen would deliver an action comedy "Green Hornet" universe stuffed with his brand of immature moron humor. The only question was whether that combination would work or make Rogen look like an actual idiot.While we think of Rogen and pal Evan Goldberg as co-scriptors of modern bromance and foul-mouthed humor, their 2008 film "Pineapple Express" was an action film, albeit an outlandishly hard-R version centered around smoking weed. "The Green Hornet," like that film, succeeds at escapist action, remaining exciting and fun enough that the humor offers a nice balance and a reminder that typical superhero movie intensity and catharsis are best sought elsewhere.Rogen stars as Britt Reid, partyboy son of a major newspaper owner in Los Angeles. When his father dies, Britt reflects on their tense relationship, which stirs him to actually doing something with his life. After striking up a friendship with his father's mechanic/coffeemaker, a Chinese genius named Kato (Jay Chou), a stress-relief venture to decapitate his father's statue turns into a crimefighting epiphany. Using the newspaper to get out the word, they create The Green Hornet, a hero who poses as a villain to get close to and take down the criminals of the city.Goldberg, Rogen and director Michel Gondry's ("Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind") real handiwork is doing an especially good job of masking or perhaps simply distracting the audience from the hollowness of this plot. That's not intended to be a backhanded compliment: with the exception of a misleading semi-serious beginning, it's clear that the film's quality threshold tops off at "entertaining" and the movie does us a favor in not serving up anything so pathetic as to remind us of its faults.The subplots and side antics keep the attention off the prototypical story. Goldberg and Rogen have keyed in on the relationship between Britt and Kato, flipping it into  not surprisingly  a superhero bromance. Although the conflicts builds itself on Britt's unlikable childish arrogance and ignorance as to Kato's superior skill, the subplot provides for a strong back-and-forth for comedic purposes and distracts from the half-baked pieces of the film: Britt's relationship with his dad, suspect character motivation across the board and Cameron Diaz being in the movie period.Basically, the movie does enough for us to care about Britt and Kato. Diaz, for example, while useless to the rest of the film as Britt's secretary at the paper, serves as a device for mounting tension between our two heroes and to comic results. With that humor, the film builds the entertaining diversion that it needs.The humor has its rough moments, namely in the action-oriented scenes when Rogen chooses to push the quantity of jokes instead of letting us take in the car chase or gun fight. Otherwise, Chou offers an excellent balance for Rogen's bumbling idiot act. Christoph Waltz as Chudnofsky, the crime lord with some serious insecurities, holds the honor of being the only interesting/amusing supporting character. Taking a page from his experience in "Inglourious Basterds," the actor manages to play the role without going over the top or taking the part too seriously either.As an action film, "The Green Hornet" surprises the most. Gondry manages to effectively use slow motion rather than do it for the sake of doing it, for example. Yet Goldberg and Rogen deserve the most credit, as they've drafted up some unique sequences, one being the final showdown inside the newspaper building. Almost all action films of this caliber have predictable outcomes, but "Hornet" keeps the "how" up in the air with that creativity. The whole "Kato kicks ass yet Britt is incompetent" dynamic also provides some amusement.Simply, fans of mindless action and modern comedy ought to find it hard to dwell for too long on the flaws of "The Green Hornet." I might have to toss this one under the guilty pleasure pile, but kudos to Rogen and co. for never letting the film drift into awful or "so cliché it hurts" territory. One bad move and the gleeful distraction would've been lost. Instead, we get a couple solid lead characters, crafty action and several decent jokes.~Steven C
Westerns might be making a comeback. With Americans' newfound appreciation of independent and more artistic film, such a statement isn't too off-base. "3:10 to Yuma" is a hell of a start, showing that great acting is more important than action in making a Western. There's nothing in the action that you can complain about, in fact there's nothing in the whole film that can be complained about, but the acting takes precedence and that's what sets this film apart."Yuma" is a remake that centers around a rancher named Dan Evans (Christian Bale) who is struggling to feed his family and beginning to doubt his image as a father and husband. He gets mixed up in the thievery of Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his band of outlaws and after Wade is caught, agrees (for the money) to be a part of a crew that is to escort Wade to a station where he is to take the 3:10 train to Yuma, or ultimately, his death. Of course the rest of Wade's bandits, led by Charles (Ben Foster) want him back and Wade will surely not be very compliant.The premise is simple, but every moment of the film is exciting. If there isn't action carrying the scene, then there are the great talents of this cast that make it interesting. Crowe is very strong in the antagonist role and Bale is great as always. It is amusing how a Welsh and an Australian actor give such believable portrayals of Americans. Ben Foster is also very easy to despise and moviegoers will be sure to see him more in the future.There might not be anything amazing about "Yuma" but I challenge anyone to find something bad or off about it. Director James Mangold is certainly credible enough to have all his bases covered. It's simply a clean cut Western with a modern mindset that makes itself clear in the characterization which is more about being real and cool than just being a cool and stereotypical cowboy. The acting gives the characters heart and really brings out the themes and morals of a film thats main intention is the action and excitement."Yuma" is the perfect merger of a glitzy Hollywood Western action film with great drama led by great acting: the ideal film in from a money standpoint and from a quality standpoint and arguably those films deserve the most praise.
"Angel Heart" is a '50 noir-style murder mystery done in the 1980s in living -- and bleeding -- color. It's a very straightforward story that ends up being more than meets the eye, mixing in horror and satanic elements to become a one-of-a-kind thriller.Private detective Harry Angel (Rourke) takes on a case to locate an old-time crooner named Johnny Favourite, who has been missing since WWII. He is hired by Louis Cyphre (De Niro) who has an "unfinished contract" with Favourite. It's fairly apparent that the devil is owed someone's soul, but Angel doesn't pick up on these clues as obviously as we do. Angel goes from name to name in search of people who knew Favourite and a trail of murder follows mysteriously behind him.Other than the delightfully creepy performance by De Niro, director and adapter Alan Parker deserves the praise for the enjoyable parts of this movie, namely it's suspense. His use of heartbeats for this dreadful suspense effect and the way he intercuts the scenes of shocking discovery with normal ones (such as a boy tap dancing in the streets of New Orleans) is nearly adrenaline-pumping. His depiction of rotating objects such as the fan and elevator cable spool is a bit blunt, but stylishly effective.Being an '80s film, you definitely get a sense of movement toward the modern thriller as we know it today. The style of the film, its pacing, its tendency to sit quietly at times and be introspective -- these are things we've come to know from the genre 20 years later, but as a '50s period piece as well, there's a definite tribute to film noir in the characterization and acting. Rourke's Angel is much like those P.I.s that get in too deep from the '30s and '40s. The dialogue too is very much the same way.Not spectacular but not disappointing, "Angel Heart" is entertaining and certainly unique. People who are into movies that involve elements of satanism, where the devil is a character, will certainly enjoy it more, but most will get enjoyment out of its classic mystery structure and intriguing twist.
Throughout the course of the modern superhero era, one thing has stayed true: Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. After being a successful piece of the "X-Men" franchise for three films, Wolverine got his own solo gig in 2009's "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," which turned out to be a chaotic smear of superhero film with a cliché-ridden script. Jackman, who has become synonymous with the part in a way that would make even Robert Downey Jr. jealous, deserved better.Thankfully, "The Wolverine" is better. In fact, it bounces back from the very worst failings of "Origins," telling a character-oriented story that borrows from the Chris Claremont-Frank Miller comic featuring Wolverine's Japanese saga.The story takes place post-"X-Men: The Last Stand," as Logan is haunted in his dreams by Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), whom he killed in that film in order to essentially save the world. Hiding out and looking like an imprisoned Jean Valjean somewhere in Alaska (he tends to do that), a Japanese woman named Yukio (Rila Fukushima) finds him and convinces him to travel back with her to Japan to meet her master, Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), whom Wolverine saved during the bombing of Nagasaki in World War II. Yashida is one of Japan's wealthiest men, a technology entrepreneur, and he wants to offer Wolverine the one thing he's never had  mortality. For someone who feels as though their gift has been a curse lately, it's an appealing offer.Of course there has to be a catch, and Wolverine soon finds himself dealing with the venomous Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) and going on the run and protecting Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto), who is being sought after by the Yakuza (Japanese mob).The film almost never leaves Wolverine's side, and provides more than adequate motivational fuel for us to become invested in the story. Wolverine's consideration of his own inner pain and immortality finally gives Jackman something to work with, despite how good he is with all the more exterior elements of the character.Director James Mangold ("Walk the Line" and the underrated remake of "3:10 to Yuma") excels at finding these character moments, while also taking the opportunity to make a Marvel samurai movie. The film's fight sequences take a visceral yet artistic approach reminiscent of a samurai film: violent, but stylized. An R-rated version, however, would've made this an exceptional film, but such is Hollywood.In summer after summer of large-scale blockbusters with immense action sequences, "The Wolverine" will be a tad underwhelming for anyone impartial to the character that is just looking for the "next big movie." Again, this movie is as much about Wolverine's internal struggle as what's happening on screen. It is exciting in small ways, not in big ways (outside of a sequence on top a bullet train). Mangold also does some cool things with a chase sequence through Tokyo in which the archer Harada (Will Yun Lee) snipes Yakuza thugs as Wolverine runs with Mariko.A lot of props go to the script team of Mark Bomback ("Unstoppable," "Total Recall") and Scott Frank ("Minority Report"), who revised the initial draft by Oscar winner Christopher McQuarrie ("The Usual Suspects"). Obviously the character element of the story works well, but the pacing is strong and surprises wait at every turn, even if the plot trajectory follows a pretty traditional superhero movie structure.To put "The Wolverine" in the context of the ever-growing rolodex of superhero movies, it's a rock-solid, entertaining, better-than-most entry, but years from now, will probably get overlooked among the genre's best thanks to the visually ground-breaking event films now and soon to be even more prevalent. It does little to stand out, but the Wolverine character didn't need something to make him stand out; it needed something more personal. Why else would you isolate a character from the X-Men if not to tell his personal story? "The Wolverine" is a superb film that should've come out four years ago, when it would've been a great film. If it were an origin story and not the fifth time Jackman put the claws on (not counting his "X-Men: First Class" cameo), I would put it on par with "Iron Man" minus some of the flashy CGI and a decent percentage of humor. There's no question Wolverine's lack of novelty will play a factor for those who find it unimpressive, but getting down to what it means to make a good superhero film, you can't go wrong with the model used in "The Wolverine." And fans will genuinely be excited about what Wolverine does next, with or without the X-Men.~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
The animation world's two best-kept secrets have always been Wallace and Gromit, and creator Nick Park continues to plant the evidence in the duo's first full-length feature, "Wallace & Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit." Although the stop-motion shorts have won multiple Oscars and the concept seems better suited for more concise storytelling, the quick wit and charms remain along with that trademark tinge of horror."Were-Rabbit" follows Wallace and Gromit's latest business venture, Antipesto, a service that protects the prized vegetables of the town's residents from rabbits using Wallace's high-tech inventions. Fans of the characters will be comforted to hear that Aardman Animation doesn't just reset to zero and reintroduce Wallace and Gromit for the sake of a new audience given that this is a feature. There's a definite sense of continuity, with Gromit putting Wallace on a diet because of his weakness for cheese, a problem that's gotten bad enough that Wallace no longer slips easily through his bedroom trap door and into the kitchen  his longest standing invention.In this chapter, Wallace (Peter Sallis) finds himself in more trouble than usual and of course Gromit has to clean up the mess. The oddball inventor fancies the wealthy Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), host of the annual largest vegetable contest, whom he and Gromit help in regards to her rampant rabbit problem. In hopes of targeting her affection, Wallace tries to combine two of his inventions in a way that would allow him to brainwash rabbits into not wanting any produce. The experiment goes wrong, however, and soon a terrifying monster begins to devour the town's crops at night. If that weren't enough, the Lady's other suitor, Victor Quartermaine (voiced with lovable panache by Ralph Fiennes) poses another threat.At times all of that is a bit much; the story does feel like a short film idea expanded into a feature and most of the twists are foreseeable. Although it doesn't have the same snap because certain sections drag, the craftsmanship and the execution never disappoints."Were-Rabbit" provides that expert blend of family adventure and horror that Aardman Animation has been known for. Like any expert creature feature, our gigantic beast is kept from the camera until the moment is perfect. The action sequences do not lack for excitement either thanks to creativity and the fact that they always give Gromit, cinema's most fiercely loyal canine, a chance to shine.As technology has improved, so has the use of computer effects in this series. Yet for every digital enhancement, an impressive claymation detail grabs our attention. The vegetables in particular have a lifelike appearance, so much so that I wouldn't be surprised to learn that smaller replicas of vegetables were carved out of real ones for use in the film.Yet the staple of the film, as has been the case with the previous shorts, remains the wit, the array of puns, the peripheral easter eggs and the tastefully crude jokes. A perfect family film slides those in without detracting from the entertainment value for children and "Wallace & Gromit" does just that. ~Steven CCheck out my site, moviemusereviews.com
It seems to have taken until the eleventh hour, but Disney has finally found a way to make its classic fairytale stories work in the 21st Century. Thanks to longtime Disney animator Glen Keane (serving as producer) and directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard ("Bolt"), the film stays true to Disney's long line of rich fairytale history while adding a distinct layer of action, adventure and humor that modern audiences now require.2009′s "The Princess and the Frog" marked a complete return to traditional animation for Disney and received much praise, but the film continued the trend of moderate and unsatisfactory box-office success for fairy tales. All hope seemed to be pinned on "Tangled" to revive the genre or it would surely hit Disney's back burner indefinitely. Once titled "Rapunzel," Disney's strategy for this film was clear: appeal to a wider audience. Zachary Levi's character Flynn Rider, a sharp but self-absorbed thief, became a focal point of the marketing, and while this is Rapunzel's (Mandy Moore) story, he does play a more prominent role than a large segment of Disney princes from over the years. In short, "Tangled" appeals to boys, girls and the whole family.Disney has never been known for defying stereotypes, so in that sense, the complexity of Rapunzel and Flynn should be a lauded accomplishment. Like most princesses (or so it seems) Rapunzel is a naive dreamer who sings about longing to see the outside world from her tower, but she's quick with a frying pan (as a weapon, not cooking utensil) and her hair possesses a surprising amount of dexterity. It's rather unrealistic how well she handles the outside world considering her overprotective and narcissistic mother (Donna Murphy) has bred incredible fear in her, but she's by far the most 21st Century princess to date. As for Flynn, despite the cockiness, deception and excessive charm, he has a down-to-earth dry wit too that makes up for his over-the-top nature.The story carries a surprising amount of intensity and emotional pull. With Mother Gothel and the two thug twins in pursuit of Rapunzel and Flynn as they venture to the kingdom so Rapunzel can see the "floating lights" that come out every year on her birthday, there's no shying away from dark elements. The possessive mother motif always works to make you sick inside and considering Rapunzel's sweet nature, you really do wish ill on Mother Gothel.In terms of the animation, "Tangled" feels traditional, but it's a good thing. Keane has worked on countless of the Disney classics of the '90s and he finds a way to adapt that style while using computers. The result is that familiar richness and magic of a hand-drawn animated film with the photorealism and attention to detail of CGI. With big round eyes, all the characters earn our sympathy quickly and make "Tangled" as enchanting as it is action- packed and exciting.As Disney has always done with exceptional skill, the non-verbal but human-like animal characters vastly increase the humor of the film. Paschal the chameleon and Maximus the royal steed both have unpredictable dispositions that make them fun and lovable. As a chameleon, Paschal likes to instigate conflict but quickly recoils and turns the shade of objects around him when he's nervous. Maximus takes it upon himself to track down Flynn with a sense of self-importance, yet he's a sucker for normal animal pleasures like being pet and apples. The brilliance of these characters never fails and will always be part of the Disney legacy.So sigh relief if you're a Disney fairytale fan, because "Tangled" has finally found the answer. Some die-hards will insist on more memorable songs and musical numbers (even with a couple of excellent Alan Menken tunes, especially "I See the Light"), but the trade off (as seen with a "PG" rating for the film as opposed to all previous fairy tales earning a "G") is something more compelling for all audiences.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Spike Jonze's imagining of "Where the Wild Things Are" is nothing like  you'd expect from a film adapted from a beloved children's book. It's  dense with top-notch visuals from the cinematography to the incredible  fusion of costumes, puppetry and CGI used to bring the Wild Things to  life, but its plot is very frank in its approach to anger, sadness and  loneliness.   It should be noted that this is not so much a children's film as it is  a film that children are capable of enjoying. I refuse to insist that  this is not for children, but it would be untruthful to say that this  is a film *intended* for them. "Wild Things" is likely going to be  appreciated most by those who already have experienced what the main  character Max is going through emotionally with regards to his family  and his peers (the wild things). To put a number on it, I think that --  depending on the child -- kids ages nine or older will not only be able  to enjoy it, but take something away from it. As for adults, it should  be a touching and somewhat nostalgic filmgoing experience.  Jonze pretty much perfectly captures the essence of childhood within  the first 20 minutes of this film. Whether it's the way Max (Max  Records, who is excellent) looks up at his mom (Catherine Keener) from  underneath her desk or his imagination taking over as he sails a toy  boat over the curves of his covers, Jonze creates moments that  reconnect us to childhood in simply poetic fashion. Immediately we're  ready for Max's adventure to begin because he helps us so easily recall  that childlike state of mind.  After a bad dispute that ends with Max biting his mom, he runs away and  discovers the island where the wild things are. If you've seen the  trailer, nothing more needs to be said about Jonze's incredible choice  to go with puppets and blend in CGI elements to give it a breath of  realism. As for the characters themselves, Jonze and longtime co-writer  Dave Eggers take an interesting approach.   The wild things are voiced by adult actors and give them a sense humor  appealing to adults, but give them the social functionality of  eight-year-olds. It ends up creating this schism between what we expect  will happen (they're going to behave either like children or adults, it  can't be both) and what does (they carry themselves like adults, but  they interact like children). The results of this concept fall  somewhere between hysterically genius and bizarre/random. On one hand  their child-like behavior makes for some elegant teaching points for  Max and on the other you have one wild thing knocking two gulls out of  the sky and then telling Max their names are Bob and Terry. It's  simultaneously goofy/immature and completely fantastic.  One of the challenges of the film had to be expanding the story to  adapt instead of condensing like most adaptations require. Jonze and  Eggers use this as a chance to establish the real world issues Max is  dealing with (how to handle his need for parental attention and his  anger) and manifest them in this imaginary way in the world of the wild  things. The scenes with the wild things are very physical, which will  help to keep children's attention. They have a dirt clod fight and go  running through the forest before falling into a pile (we all know what  that was like as children).  Some parents who are very sensitive to what their kids see might have  trouble being okay with some of the anger and other extreme emotions.  If there's one good way to put it, it's that the emotional transitions  can be abrupt. One minute is playful and fun, the next can instantly  become lonely or sad and then immediately one of anger mild violence  follows. Some might wonder why this wasn't catered more directly to  kids, but if you stop and think, don't instant emotional mood swings  sounds like a pretty spot-on portrayal of childhood?  Jonze telling of "Wild Things" is a mature albeit truthful one. This is  not pure syrupy children's entertainment. A child should come out of  this movie knowing disputes between family members happen, but that it  doesn't change how much we love each other -- that it's okay to get  angry sometimes, but we should try and understand everyone's feelings  so that next time nobody will do anything they regret. That's daring  storytelling considering the expectation was for something lighter.  Absolute kudos to Jonze and Warner Brothers for letting this unique  film happen. You don't see movies about childhood as beautiful as this  one more than once a blue moon, which is plenty cause for a wild  rumpus. ~Steven C
All the pieces have been put in place for 1982 cult classic "Tron" to reinvent itself as a moder-day sci-fi epic. Between Disney sinking hundreds of millions into "Tron: Legacy," marketing it like the must-see event of the year and then securing a PG rating to make sure anyone and everyone could see it, the film just had to follow through with results. As a technical marvel and stylistic art project emphasizing light, color, sound and symmetry mixed with all kinds of action, "Legacy" shines.Then there's the script, which might be more formidable a foe than the film's antagonist, Clu, a digital (literally) replica of Jeff Bridges from the '80s. Anyway, the script has some familiar/classic story elements that could and should work at the sci-fi level, but don't reach their full cathartic potential. The challenge was to write a movie that would appeal to fans, but mostly modern audiences who need to be caught up on a film concept 28 years old and who also demand some depth to their eye candy these days.Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, who earned their chops writing episodes of "Lost," end up lapsing more and more into explanation and exposition instead of letting character- developing moments blossom. Events also move quickly to get us to the major action sequences. Good thing those are an effective detour from pondering the story.Almost three decades later, the film naturally focuses on not Flynn  owner of massively successful software company Encom  but his 27-year-old son, Sam (Garrett Hedlund), a rebellious young Bruce Wayne type who has forsaken his ownership in Encom for a life of, well, nothing but basically motorcycle riding. Reason is because his father disappeared when he was a kid, which left him orphaned. When Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner), Flynn's old partner, tells Sam he received a page from his father's old office, Sam becomes intrigued as to what happened to his father. He goes to the office at the old arcade and is sucked into the grid, where that replica program of his father, called Clu, has been running a dictatorship of sorts.Hedlund works as a protagonist with his Christian Bale-ish looks and voice (my last reference to anything "Batman") and emotional capability, if only we had a chance to watch his character evolve in some way. The story sets up a typical transformative hero's journey, but Sam's only real lesson is to be patient and not reckless. He accepts the world of the grid easily because his father told him about it, which lessens the tension of the film significantly. We like Sam and his take-charge attitude, but there's no empathy, per se, though Hedlund shows promise. Olivia Wilde's Quorra, a program who is a disciple of the actual Flynn who is stuck in exile, was surprisingly well-written with an innocence and cute sense of humor as well as action co-star ability.However, the "big decision" climax with these characters that is supposed to move us in some way doesn't tug or conflict us in the end and like a "check engine" light, it means something's wrong, even if you can't totally pinpoint what.Also newer to the game in all senses, director Joseph Kosinski demonstrates a heck of an eye. The production design of "Tron: Legacy" is unparalleled in terms of cohesion with all the elements working together under a dominant teal/white/orange theme. "Avatar" aside, there might not be a more visually entrancing design for a science fiction film. The lighting, the costumes  the lighting on the costumes  all very meticulously calculated, but sleek and fluid in their appeal. Kosinski enjoys stepping back to create some symmetrical tableaux and show off the various shapes of the film. The action sequences are pretty and have a definite pop in 3D. The build up to these action scenes could have been more effective in that "ooooh, this gonna be cooool" way, but otherwise he does the film no injustices.Disc Wars and the light cycle scenes don't disappoint either. These modern re-imaginings of the ingenious grid games invented by original "Tron" creators Steve Lisberger and Bonnie MacBird are sleek and exciting without losing the explosiveness that a more realistic and PG- 13 or higher action flick would deliver. As "Legacy" moves from visual spectacle to the next, despite the quickness, there are times when you feel like you're experiencing an epic, like Sam's visit to the club where Zeus (Michael Sheen) runs things with a white-haired quirkiness, a decisive turning point in the film. Great side characters always help create the feeling of a journey and "Legacy" does capture it though fleetingly in this scene, boosted heavily by the score from electronica rockers Daft Punk.But while I could pick apart the issues with the story, "Tron: Legacy" is all kinds of cool. The 1982 film didn't do any of these story/character things any better either, so that's not a standard you can hold the film to by any means. "Tron" was only fresher because it was unlike anything anyone had ever seen. What makes "Legacy" jump out is the vision and the vibe of the film, so unique with an originality that so many action films don't have these days. It's a shame, because with all that going for it, "Legacy" should suck in all kinds of new fans and become a sci-fi phenomenon, but it comes up a notch short in the story department. Still, it won't disappoint in terms of visually glorious entertainment.~Steven C
Lots of comedies in the last year or so have focused on whether two people can be involved sexually without being involved romantically. "Celeste and Jesse Forever" asks if two people who were involved sexually can be involved platonically. Both beat the dead horse of "complicated" relationships in film, but what's nice about "Celeste and Jesse" is that it never loses its comic edge in spite of melodrama.Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg star as the titular couple in the process of a divorce, but because they spent so long as best friends, they have no concept of needing to draw boundaries.It's a tough sell early on, that two people could go through a divorce yet essentially live together and spend time together in a somewhat intimate fashion. Jones, who co-wrote the script with Will McCormack (who has a supporting role), chooses to make Celeste and Jesse opposites in terms of professional status (he's a slacker artist, she's a big-deal trend forecaster) in order to justify why, despite their fabulous on-screen chemistry, they're not meant to stay married. It takes a bit of story wizardry, namely physical obstacles that force them apart, but somehow it makes sense, probably because Jones and Samberg are so likable.The story then plays out like the emotional roller coaster of a relationship between two people who feel one thing but do another. It's exhausting, at times, as a third-party observer, to watch them fall in and out of the same predictable problems. A few scenes will certainly elicit shouts at the screen of "just get back together already!" or "stop screwing around and end it!"  depending on the scene.Naturally, each character has his and her attempts to rebound by going on dates with other people and trying new relationships. To this point we've seen enough of the formula to know how that part of the story goes: two former lovers get mad at each other, the one who didn't really want to split rebounds first, the other says they're really happy for that person but secretly can't stand it, etc. That's all here in "Celeste and Jesse Forever."So what's the saving grace? Something that makes "Celeste and Jesse" stand out from the pack? The answer is the simple refusal to ever take itself too seriously. Without it, the film would likely devolve into a train wreck of predictable moments. In spite of the absurd tear count in the movie, Celeste is never shy about cracking a joke, nor the script afraid go out on a limb with something more extreme and less believable. This, in a movie that so fiercely tries to capture the gray area in relationships in a truthful way. Humor keeps the film in check, especially for us, who would otherwise happily chop up the script and divide the pieces into piles marked "realistic" and "unrealistic." The quirkier tone and moments maintain the soft illusion of a more fantastical real-life relationship story. Director Lee Toland Krieger nicely flows back and forth between both up-close-and-personal realism and more standard-order comedy camera-work. On a few occasions he makes bold choices, some that work, some that backfire, but the comic and dramatic moments almost never butt heads.Life in Los Angeles is, for many, a fantasy of a sort, and "Celeste and Jesse" could easily be deemed a story that could "only happen in L.A." In addition to the frozen yogurt and the exposure of the fraud that is trendy exercise, Celeste works in the entertainment industry and post-Jesse she's set up on all these dates with successful creative people. Scenes take place in all kinds of exotic clubs, so much of the context surrounding these characters oozes with a superficiality that makes the film both great and disturbing.A little more troubling is the legit problem that Jesse disappears in large chunks of this film. There's a reason Celeste comes first in the billing, and that's because the movie only shows intimate moments featuring her (and the ones she shares with Jesse). Samberg doesn't get much of a chance to prove himself as a talent that can go below the surface. The script treats Jesse like a child, kind of like the way Celeste sees him. There's artist value to this decision, but the moments between the two of them are too lopsided in our minds. Great romance movies get you charged up because you feel a certain way about both characters, and in this film we only really feel what Celeste feels.There's something special in "Celeste and Jesse," however, some rare ability to see the humor in the personally tragic, the potential for levity and irony in any situation. The emotional place that these two best friends arrive at in the end might not be as satisfying as that in a strong romance or rom-com, nor as poetic as in a tragedy, but with its playful disposition, it manages to carve out a place that's different, one that stands out from the pack just enough.~Steven CThanks for reading!

George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" is not standard horror. In fact, there are several minutes where this classic zombie film is just plain boring. There is brilliance, however, in the film's static nature, like how one of the main characters, Barbra (Judith O'Dea), is in speechless shock for most of the film. And despite the horror fan's craving for gore, suspense and active characters, "Living Dead" tantalizes its audience and then stuns it with unexpected turns of events instead of using the typical rise-and-fall horror structure."Living Dead" could be described as the king of the B horror movie. Its title, flesh-eating half-humans and cheesy violence keep the movie walking that fine line between horror and comedy. The difference is that the plot contains events that break horror conventions. Look past the use of Bosco chocolate syrup and black and white film in 1968 and you'll notice the film is more about humans vs. humans than it is humans vs. zombies.The story opens with a girl and her brother visiting their father's grave when they're attacked by a zombie. The brother gets knocked out while the girl runs and takes shelter in a nearby vacated home where she's later discovered by Ben (Duane Jones), the take-charge type of horror movie character. They board up the house and light fires to keep the zombies away and soon they discover five other people were hiding in the cellar. Together, all seven of them argue about survival tactics and things get heated between Ben and Mr. Cooper (Karl Hardman)."Living Dead" ends up being one of those films exposing how human nature rears its ugly head in these kinds of life-or-death situations. Padded by some probably unintentional racial tension between Ben and Cooper, as the arguing continues you are forced to wonder who the real savages are: the ones outside the house or the ones inside it. Culminating in an excellent and largely unpredictable ending sequence as the zombie threat becomes imminent in the house, "Living Dead" ends up becoming a surprise to everyone.With sub-par acting, unnecessarily long scenes of the news playing out over the television and nothing that's actually scary, it's amazing how "Living Dead" manages to win over its viewers. There are literally just scenes where Ben is boarding up the windows listening to the radio and you wonder if the zombies are just chilling outside playing cards or something. But there's great effectiveness when Ben keeps telling Barbra to stay calm and not be scared and she just won't say anything, much to our dismay. "Living Dead" is more psychological than you'd ever expect from something with all these B-movie characteristics.
We used to love Greek mythology for its timeless archetypal stories, but screw that if we can't get blood, slow-motion and abs. "Immortals" grabs an assortment of names, locations and stories from that rich well of tradition and blends them together into a visually distinctive feast that bastardizes the entire mythological canon in the name of what looks awesome.Folks who know their gods and demigods to a near scholarly degree may not forgive the liberties that writers Charley and Vlas Parlapanides take in order to tell a story intensely focused on the concept of immortality, and that would be legitimately fair. On the other hand, it's clear that everyone involved in the creative process wanted to create a "300"-like spectacle above all else.At least director Tarsem Singh unifies this total mess of a story with a visual palette and style unlike anything you've seen in a blockbuster. The costumes defy imagination and Singh's eye for visual symmetry and his generally fearless attitude toward the aesthetic makes "Immortals" feel as if it were touched by the gods themselves.With a better and less convoluted story in place, "Immortals" could have been something truly special. The journey of lead character Theseus (Henry Cavill) is easy enough to understand, but his very personal motivation to become the hero gets lost in the maelstrom of a world in which gods, humans and titans all exist and can or cannot interfere with/kill each other.The film begins with a vision by a virgin oracle, Phaedra (Freida Pinto), of King Hyperion entering Mt. Tartaurus and using the legendary Bow of Epirus to free the titans, immortal beings long-ago imprisoned by the gods. Hell-bent on destroying Greece and writing history, Hyperion and his army march to find the bow.In this world, the gods are hands off, as Zeus (Luke Evans) has long commanded that no god interfere with the dealings of humanity (echoing some beliefs of monotheism rather than deism, but whatever). As such, many humans believe the gods don't exist, Hyperion chief among them. Still, Zeus believes there's something special about Theseus, and has groomed him in disguise as a fearless warrior in the event that he be needed.Between gods and men, there are too many characters, none of which we care about, all of whom are built on one-dimensional tropes of good and evil. So the entire film essentially rides on awaiting the next visual morsel Singh will feed us, or the next eye-opening punishment/killing scene (and there are lots). Somehow, that's enough to make "Immortals" work, provided you do in fact like Singh's style, and have a bit of a bloodlust.Comparing to "300," Singh brings much more of an artistic eye to the film. He's less of an action director and more of a visual innovator. His action work doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, with the grand exception of the fighting style of the gods, which is a wild combination of slow-mo, speed blur a golden sheen and victims exploding into a blood pulp. You won't care much for them, but you'll be happy to watch them go berserk."300" also worshipped the eight-pack, and while most guys in "Immortals" play for the skins instead of the shirts team, there's less ogling of the male form on the whole. After all, Singh would much rather give you a costume to ogle instead.True to its title, "Immortals" tries to dig into the notion of immortality, but the film is wholly an exercise in surface-level filmmaking. It does an excellent job at that, nearly consummate, with excellent talent on a production quality level, but all these folks are worthy of greater material.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Adam Sandler's movies have almost always had a family element if they weren't a major part of the story (parental responsibility in 1999's "Big Daddy," father-son relationship in "Billy Madison" and "Little Nicky"). But lately, especially since the birth of his first daughter in 2006, it's begun to drastically shape his film choices. It started with "Click" in 2006, a story about appreciating family moments, and continued especially in 2008 when he teamed with Disney for "Bedtime Stories." The emotional sweetness of family life has been a major force in Sandler's work, but his patented insult and immature humor has not budged over that time. The latest result of that combination of family love and dirty adult humor is "Grown Ups."Despite pooling together the talents of long-time Sandler friends and collaborators Rob Schneider, Chris Rock, David Spade and Kevin James, "Grown Ups" is an aimless comedy that amounts to a string of recurring jokes and improvisational insult humor with a 50-50 success rate. One shouldn't expect much else from a Sandler movie, but it's the plot and attempt to be more family-centric that dampens the humor.The movie focuses on five old friends, each with some quirky character concept (Rock's a stay-at-home dad, Spade is a single man-whore, James is fat ...) who come together years later after the junior high basketball coach who led them to a state championship passes away. They spend the weekend together with all their families at a lake house and do various activities, some funny, some not.That about does it for plot, which ends up as the ultimate problem with "Grown Ups." Each character has a back story that influences how they behave and such and what they learn by the end of the film, but nothing pushes this movie along except the jokes that Sandler and co-writer Fred Wolf whip up. "Grown Ups" survives solely on serving up these jokes of all kinds from creative insults ("you look like a midget Elvis") to physical humor (a few fart jokes and a couple kicks to the groin are examples). Their hope is that at least the majority will get laughs, which works well enough for the first hour, even though some of the recurring gags get sucked to death until they're completely dry, such as Maria Bello, who plays James' wife, breast-feeding her four- year-old son. If you enjoy Sandler's humor, the early barrage of jokes delivers enough decent laughs despite how contrived and even predictable his style has become.Interestingly, the family element looks like it could work toward the beginning: Sandler tries to convince his two boys to stop playing video games and texting and behaving like rich snobs, something recent movies seem to forget in their depiction of today's kids. Family drama and tender husband-wife moments wiggle their way into the story, but to no effective amount of conflict or resolution. All of it remains secondary to Sandler and his buddies clowning around together, even if the film's goal is to clearly balance the two. Unfortunately, it's the gushy family stuff that ends up weighing down the final act because the story climax falls on the sentimental side, not the humorous one. After all, when your movie is just a bunch of jokes and characters interacting with each other in attempt to amuse themselves, there's no obvious trajectory and no "great" ending that makes sense. As many of Sandler's films tend to do, the bottom of the movie drops out with barely a joke and these peripheral cameo characters such as Steve Buscemi are called upon to provide ineffective comic relief."Grown Ups" strives to be funny in that Happy Madison productions way, but also heartfelt and real in its depiction of family life. The objective is admirable, but if families hanging out and various members of them being completely wacko were entertaining in reality, we wouldn't need to go to the movies to watch a movie about that and nothing else -- we'd just do it ourselves.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
A story of average guys who become small-time crooks always has comedic value; add to that the blue-collar motivation of wanting to kill your boss because he/she makes your life miserable? Golden. Documentary director Seth Gordon ("The King of Kong") ropes up an impressive ensemble to make "Horrible Bosses," a vaguely dark comedy with a concept that does half the work. Despite a slightly addled plot, the film offers a variety of laughs from the R-rated sex humor of many of today's comedies to more standard slapstick.Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis star as a trio of friends who despise their bosses for one reason or another. Bateman's the first to arrive and last to leave work every day to get a promotion after eight years, but his asshole boss (Spacey) plays him like a puppet; Day's a dental assistant with plans to be married, but his nymphomaniac boss (Jennifer Aniston) plans to blackmail him into sleeping with her; Sudeikis, on the other hand, loves his job, but when his great boss dies, his soulless coke-head son (Colin Farrell) takes over and looks to ruin everything out of spite. After first joking about taking them out, the three realize they'll be eternally miserable if they don't do something drastic.The three amigos have a classic comic chemistry; they're all idiots in their own respects, namely Day and Sudeikis, which is weird because Bateman  a terrific character actor  has suddenly become the face of the straight-laced everyman. Although we sympathize with Bateman the most, he offers the least amount of entertainment. Sudeikis and Day on the other hand offer dynamic humor. Day's the most lovable as he exercises that doe-eyed stupidity and cluelessness whereas Sudeikis gets to be the jerk who puts sex ahead of everything and thinks he has tact when in fact he's incredibly ignorant. The Stooge-like function of their friendship provides most of the humor, though sometimes the slapstick diverges a bit from the tone of the story.As far as the bosses, all three come off as horrible as they need to for the story to work. Spacey earns points for being particularly despicable and as such gets most of the boss spotlight whereas Aniston earns the most laughs for playing against type. Farrell is practically unrecognizable, which delivers in a couple places, but mostly the script takes the character way over the top.I would've loved to have seen the Coen brothers script this comedy as not only does it perfectly suit their proclivities, but it also would've found some true wit and poignancy amidst the murder-plotting chaos. "Horrible Bosses" does well enough for the sake of humor and shows flashes of cleverness throughout such as the way Jamie Foxx's "Mother****er" Jones" gets involved as a "murder consultant," but the plot has a hard time wrapping up in a satisfying way. Toward the end, the film struggles in determining whether to head down the darker path or take the lighter more farcical one. Instead of choosing, however, the story never fully commits to either.In general, the schizophrenic tone and tendency to pin turning points on the stupidity of the characters doesn't outweigh the comic performances. Although we never get deeper than the characters' personality traits and a motivation to kill their bosses, it's enough of a portrait to take away some hardy laughs as well as interest in what will happen to them. Lastly, the killer (no pun intended) premise provides enough reason to take a vested interest in the final outcome.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
For yet another indie relationship drama without a straightforward plot and more than one central character, David Gordon Green makes something of a quiet masterpiece out of "Snow Angels," based on the 1994 book by Stewart O'Nan. Although the film begins with us overhearing two gun shots and then backing up to show us their origin, "Snow Angels" takes a long time to develop its conflict, which puts pressure on Green to keep our attention. He does so fairly well, using convincing realism to set his characters and audience up for the tragedy that follows.Green, whose previous credits are also of the independent tragedy vein, has a way of self- referencing the story through visuals that interconnect the film's many sub-plots. Taking place in a small town where it's incredibly cold (it's snowing during football season), a high school student named Arthur (Michael Angarano) deals with his parents' separation and the new girl, Lila, (Olivia Thirlby) who he doesn't realize is completely into him. In the Chinese restaurant where he works, his former babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) is living the tough life of a single mother whose ex (Sam Rockwell) is a born-again Christian battling a drinking problem that wants to get his family back together.The stories connect structurally in that they both deal with divided families, but one really admirable quality about it is that Green will take an image or something that a character talks about in one sub-plot and manifest it in another. In one scene, Arthur talks about using his mother's hand mirror when he was younger to peep under the door when Annie was babysitting him and taking a shower. Later, Rockwell's character Glenn is seen holding a hand mirror.This technique really helps unify the story in a way that the plot never really does. "Snow Angels" is collectively about the familial ideal, of wanting things in love and family to work out and trying to make amends for the mistakes that harm it while battling one's own personal feelings and desires. The drama comes from the Annie-Glenn story line and that's supposed to influence how we think about what's going on with Arthur and his family and his girlfriend, which is the more realistic and conflict-free part of the story.There's also a good deal of pressure on the actors when the conflict is really only coming from one source in a multi-plot story. Angarano and Thirlby play wonderful innocent kids falling for each other, but the true talent in the film is Rockwell. His character is the most troubled and the most complex, the one who really drives the conflict by not leaving Annie and their young daughter alone and trying to fight Annie's new boyfriend. He convinces you that he's worthy of a second chance, but then fails to meet your expectations. It's a role that requires him to be completely committed to a flawed point of view and Rockwell nails it.Films without focused and attention-grabbing plots don't often get bonus points, but Green wins about as much of them there are for drawing out some important questions and meaning from the relationship drama of the film. The realism with which he portrays these characters, their softness and fragility, makes them intriguing enough for us to watch carefully so we can understand what it is that really makes their story a tragedy. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Rarely does a film feel as human and believable as "Dan in Real Life" does, but for all the ways that you can relate to this film and its characters, it goes from something "real" to something that is in fact preposterous and all too convenient where thematic epiphany is concerned.To start, "Dan in Real Life" starts out as a film about a widower (Carell) who is having issues raising his three daughters. When the Burns family meets up with the other Burns for their annual family reunion in Rhode Island, the plot takes a surprisingly farcical twist when Dan meets a woman (Binoche) at a bookstore and comes back to tell his family only to find she's dating his brother Mitch (Cook). Touching family drama and farce don't exactly mix and that's where this film becomes schizophrenic and ultimately not poignant. The farce premise has you wanting to laugh out loud, but the humor is light and amusing at best, as is the warm and likable disposition of Carell. Carell is best known for his comedy work, but when he is the sole comedic force of whatever he is in, his film does poorly. He's always been good when his supporting cast is talented. Think "40-Year-Old Virgin" or even "The Office" versus "Evan Almighty." Carell provides a few extra laughs at best and knowing his work it's not anything fresh.Writer and director Peter Hedges, known for his dysfunctional family dramedies, deserves applause for his ability to create believable relationships/characters and for the most part dodge melodrama in dialogue. Though sometimes a bit much, he has a good gage on what a family is like or at least how they interact. However, as the film reaches climax, it seems he tries a bit too hard to create an epiphany and for all the situations and problems between characters to work themselves out in some clever way. To top that off with the obvious irony of Dan being an advice columnist for family is a bit much."Dan in Real Life" is incredibly well-intentioned, but the combination of family and farce formulas is not exactly a perfect marriage. The film needed to go in one of those two directions and eliminating the farce attempts would probably have been the right route. It's fine in premise, but it takes it along for too much of the film. Otherwise, there are a lot of things to like about "Dan" and certainly nothing to hate. It's the cheese-factor that keeps this movie back.
Think about if you were producing a movie about the last man on earth. You *have* to cast one actor. Who do you cast? The answer is clearly Will Smith, "I Am Legend" aside. If the human race was 99.9% wiped out or turned evil by a mutating virus that was initially a cure for cancer, I would personally volunteer Will Smith as the last man alive. He could have my place.Smith plays Robert Neville, a former military officer that before the virus outbreak was the leading figure on a defense plan in case something happened, and afterward is humanity's only hope for a cure. By day Smith and his dog hunt and wait at one spot for any survivors and by night they must remain confined to their home as the infected "super" humans have violent tendencies. Basically he has to survive long enough to find a cure and maybe he can fix the human race. The part just begs for Smith's resume (Independence Day, I-Robot)With the film focusing on almost nothing but Smith, he has to be interesting or the film fails. Director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) helps Smith succeed by using suspense and a writing team of Mark Protosevich and the acclaimed Akiva Goldsman keeps the facts unraveling at the perfect pace for keeping up interest level in mere background alone. The audience is intrigued in Smith's every endeavor.The visuals of this post-apocalyptic Manhattan are astounding and Smith takes command of it brilliantly, yet his character is portrayed as very emotional and unstable, unlike many previous films in which he is in the business of being "the man." It's believable and bad ass.Any actor who can take a film like this that's so basic and make it any bit good and successful financially clearly is a legend. If this doesn't cement Smith's status as one of the greatest stars of this generation (right next to if not above Tom Cruise) then it will just take another box-office shattering action flick to prove it.
The giant gray cloud that hovers over the setting for almost the entirety of Roman Polanski's "The Ghost Writer" is like the film's suspense. The truly excellent mysteries in cinema are drawn out, almost at times torturous, hanging questions over our heads like -- giant gray clouds. I wouldn't say "The Ghost Writer" deserves comparison to Polanski's masterpiece "Chinatown," but it's very much in that tradition, only substitute private investigator for biographer. It's the story of the man who doesn't know what he's gotten into until he's into it and the audience never saw it coming but strangely we knew it all along. In a ten-film Best Picture category, a movie such as "The Ghost Writer" deserves to be bookmarked and reconsidered at year's end. Elevating it above gimmicky thrillers such as this year's "Shutter Island" -- excellently crafted, but gimmicky -- are the performances of McGregor, Brosnan, Cattrall and Olivia Williams that at times make the film feel more parts drama than thriller. Then there's suspense that Polanski creates by use of sheer storytelling, not throwing together a single artsy scene that outwardly forces questions. It's the difference between demanding audience interest and earning it.McGregor stars as The Ghost, a writer hired to replace the recently deceased ghost writer of former British prime minister Adam Lang (a take on Tony Blair no doubt), a figure lately shrouded in human rights controversy. I, for one, went through the whole film thinking I missed The Ghost's name, when it was never given. The effectiveness of that doesn't catch up to you until after the film's end. Much of the film is back-loaded, which is not ideal but it packs a heck of a punch. Anyway, The Ghost begins to uncover a mystery as he learns about Lang's life and Lang tries to quell a PR nightmare.Anchoring it all are great performances. Lang is easily Brosnan's best dramatic role. I haven't seen some of McGregor's recent films, but he's at his best since at least "Big Fish." His inner monologue is nice and subtle, playing this "mystery protagonist" just right, never overdoing it in a role that with all the camera time would seem more important than it really is. It was also refreshing to see Cattrall in a role very far from Samantha that she plays with with class and Williams continues to put herself on the map, this time with a more enigmatic, intriguing role."The Ghost Writer" is the kind of film you could equate to a specific piece of music. It has a distinct tone that creeps over you. Maybe it's just Alexandre Desplat's hauntingly perfect score that makes the comparison easy to draw, but there's an undeniable feel to Polanski's film. He's the kind of director that lets the story tell itself (easy to do when you have a hand in the writing), only allowing moments and images to linger enough to arouse your suspicions. It's more great craft than excellent story, but it's a memorable (and overdue) effort from Polanski.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
They say "time is money," and so it seems filmmaker Andrew Niccol took them too seriously. "In Time" imagines a dystopia in which humans have been genetically modified to stop aging at 25 and at that point receive a year to live as indicated by timers on their forearms. The only way they can prolong their life is by acquiring more time. As a result, the poor live day to day and the rich can live forever."In Time" is Niccol's most extensive imagining of an alternative future. He steeped "The Truman Show" and "Gattaca" in something tangible (reality entertainment, genetic engineering). Those films emphasize the science; "In Time" emphasizes the fiction.This high concept goes higher then most, and it ends up running the show. The idea of tying your internal body clock to your wallet would create such a drastic overhaul of society (think of the economic, social and emotional after effects and the way they would be intertwined) that Niccol's script becomes slave to explanation and simply feeling out what life is like for these characters. It's a cool exploration if you love this kind of science fiction, but because Niccol indulges all these facets of what their life is like, the core story suffers.I am always the first to admit my bias for high-concept dystopian sci fi, so these nerd-tastic indulgences make a film entertaining enough for the likes of me and certainly others, but I also have a soft spot for good storytelling (imagine that). So it's a problem that Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) serves as a vehicle for the story's substance rather than being a part of said substance.Will lives in the one of the poorest time zones (socio-economic classes remain strictly divided) and works in a factory so that he and his mother (Olivia Wilde) can survive each day. But a trip to a bar one night changes his life when he meets a man named Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who has more than a century. After Will saves Hamilton from a "Minuteman" (code for "gangster") named Fortis (Alex Pettyfer), the two exchange some philosophical words and Will wakes up the next day to find that Hamilton has transferred all but five minutes to Will. Knowing that kind of time is dangerous in his zone, he makes plans to flee for wealthy country and plots how he can make the most of his recently acquired time/capital.Will has a lot of options of what to do with his newfound wealth, so one has to wonder how "upset the system" becomes one of them. Hamilton does impart some knowledge of the system's unfairness before offing himself, but Will's journey from blue-collar guy who just cares about family to Robin Hood-like action hero with vengeance in his heart never quite comes across. Slipping in tidbits about Will's father halfway through the movie don't count either. Chalk all this up to the beginning, which spends more time establishing the rules of this universe than Will's character. We're smitten with this at the time, but it costs the film later on.As emotionless as the story gets, "In Time" still boasts some extremely clever moments and examples of effective filmmaking. Niccol has spent a great deal of time (coincidentally) thinking up this universe, that much is clear. A poker game has Will betting his life down to seconds and on countless occasions you will find yourself understanding the stakes involved as life clocks dwindle. When Will has little time left, the film gets extremely tense, and when he has centuries, you'll find yourself unusually more relaxed. The issue is that as much as Niccol has spent time drawing up the parameters of his world in impressive fashion, he doesn't understand the way it inhibits him from telling a good overall story.Much of the film consists of cat-and-mouse chases after Will kidnaps Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), the daughter of a man with time to spare (to say the least). He's pursued by a timekeeper (an law enforcement officer tasked with keeping the system in place) named Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy), easily the film's best character. Murphy transcends the dutiful villain archetype with his performance. Seyfried starts strong as Sylvia, but as her character arc gives way to Stockholm Syndrome, she loses her flairand so does the film."In Time" creates an unparalleled dystopia in terms of sheer complexity, but it boxes out any chance for emotional depth. The "Robin Hood" meets "Bonnie & Clyde" meets a Jane Austen novel love story (set in the future) hardly connects to the "fight the system" motif for which Niccol aims. Having them hold hands every time they run somewhere (and they run a lot) doesn't make it better. Timberlake and Seyfried possess many strong characteristics, but Niccol shortchanges them. For all the interesting questions and philosophy that this "time is money" scenario poses, the rest simply doesn't measure up.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site moviemusereviews.com
What started in 1977 with "Kentucky Fried Movie" continues again in "The Naked Gun," a film version of the TV series "Police Squad!" only this time detective/cop films are the culprit, seemingly perfect fodder for spoofing and the Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker one-two punch of subtle literalist humor and preposterous gags. The only real difference between this and 1980's "Airplane!" is that Lesley Nielsen takes command of this film as opposed to an all-cast effort.Nobody must be able to keep a straighter face than Nielsen. As Lt. Frank Drebin, the things he must do and say while remaining ignorant to their comedic value are absurd in quantity and quality. Drebin is when James Bond meets Inspector Clouseau -- he's completely oblivious yet he knows exactly what he's doing. As contradictory as that sounds, it's completely true. Nielsen does both incredible deadpan and slapstick, a highly specialized skill for a comedian, and unfortunately for the rest Nielsen's career, that's all he has. Nevertheless, it's perfect for "The Naked Gun."Unlike "Airplane!", this film has to be a bit more plot-focused because the cop/detective genre necessitates it. "Airplane!" could descend into utter chaos, whereas "The Naked Gun" feels obligated to make sense in some regard. All you need to know is that O.J Simpson's character got shot and the investigation leads to the uncovering of a possible assassination attempt on the life of Queen Elizabeth II. The challenge for the viewer is to forget making sense of what's going on and pay attention to the small details that make these films even funnier. In some scenes this is easier than others and for the most part, the easier it is, the better "The Naked Gun" gets.A lot of the times these are the laughs that make you smile inside instead of laughing out loud, but especially toward the end when the humor becomes more slapstick, "The Naked Gun" really takes off ... pardon the "Airplane!" lingo. Another fun film from these guys.
Not often does an Oscar winner for leading actor or actress dominate the entire picture through and through. Everything in "Gandhi" gravitates around Ben Kingsley in the role of a lifetime, or quite simply: the role he was born to play. Mahatma Gandhi's story is about the power of one influencing the power of millions. Richard Attenborough's film aspires to spread that message in this fascinating three-hour biopic about the strength and willpower of the human spirit."Gandhi" is in fact responsible in part for the modern day biopic, a genre that has become a huge part of awards season almost every year. Humbly, the film begins with a message that no film could fairly capture the life of one person, let alone Mohandas K. Gandhi, the lawyer that virtually became a prophet. They needn't be so humble: they easily achieve the goal of capturing the essence of Gandhi, the core of his person. The film starts with Gandhi making political waves in South Africa then taking his message of non-violence and non-resistance to India in attempt to force the English out on their own terms.Attenborough, an actor who had made a couple war films and a Winston Churchill biopic "Young Winston" prior, struck gold with this film. It is not a film that begs a director's signature touches, rather one that requires patience and the ability to surrender the film's influential power completely to the main character. With the exception of some key scenes that don't involve Gandhi, Attenborough is nearly invisible. We're meant to hear this man's words and become as magnetized as all South Africa and then of course India does. Attenborough primarily contributes a worldly feel, like that of a true epic, as well as purposeful and quick pacing.Ultimately, writer John Briley keeps "Gandhi" fascinating by bouncing back and forth between plan and action. Gandhi and his followers or Gandhi and the government meet to discuss how they might make a stand, Gandhi says some instantly-quotable wisdom and then we see the impact on the greater country. It seems formulaic, but it keeps "Gandhi" from lingering too long in one place and losing its impact.Holding those "planning" scenes is the poise of Kingsley. He has that intangible "it" factor as Gandhi. Gandhi was well-spoken, strong-willed and never doubted his position of influence, but he had to have been more humble than any man before him with that kind of political influence. Many Oscar winners have the inner demons of their character to wrestle with in order to add power to their performances; Kingsley does it all gracefully and understated.The difference one man can make in the cycle of violence has never been clearer. Martin Luther King Jr. would become the "next Gandhi" perhaps, adapting his principles and continuing to prove that a single voice can lead a people as it has as far back as biblical times. Humanity needs a face to help rally it sometimes and Gandhi was able to fast to quiet a nation of 300 million (at the time). In exploring the power of this one Indian man of short, unimposing stature, "Gandhi" offers discourse on the dynamics of power between oppressor and oppressed and also highlights that despite how easily one single person can start the cycle of violence, say by throwing a rock at a passing group of Muslims as one Hindu does later in the film, one person -- contrary to popular belief -- can under the right circumstances end it.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
For those wondering what happened to the old Woody Allen, here he is. "Whatever Works" is a script from the 1970s. I noticed that without even knowing Allen has been forthright about it. A few script rewrites -- talk about the Taliban and not the Communists -- and old Woody works in a modern context. Then again, "Whatever Works" is not a film that anyone will herald the second coming of great Woody Allen comedy, but it is one that will win over a handful of audience members."Whatever Works" is pure vintage Woody. Boris Yellnikoff (Larry David) is a cynical, neurotic and suicidal man that Allen would've played himself in 1977 had he been old enough. He's an elitist intellectual jerk who loves classical music and literature and spews life philosophy. He is a Harvard grad physicist-turned-chess-teacher who considers himself a genius and everyone else a peon. He delivers an opening monologue. He and the characters in this film go to the movies, reference movies and attend art gallery showcases -- and it takes place in New York. This is the comfort food of Woody Allen movies.If one considers the film's title a mantra, then Allen must've applied it in casting Larry David. David ... works. He's got only a few gears as an actor and we've seen plenty of his main gear on HBO series "Curb Your Enthusiasm." We get lots more of it here, only Boris spouts some of Woody's wittiest lines and insults of all time. It's great, but it comes with the price that Boris is a jerk and his thoughts about life -- we only grow closer to death, love is a waste of time, there's all this crap to worry about -- make him overbearing. It's to Allen's point, but it's difficult to listen to Boris at times.In a twist of Allen's love for cosmic coincidence, Boris meets a 21-year-old runaway Southern girl named Melodie St. Anne Celestine (Evan Rachel Wood) who he takes in and via foot in the door, ends up letting stay. She's a completely naive and uneducated stereotype, the complete opposite of Boris and all Woody prototypes (with great purpose, however). Mistaking his crafty insults and fatalistic world view for great intelligence, Melodie develops a crush on him and Boris, with his "take what you can get/enjoy what you have" mentality, agrees to marry her. All manages to work until Melodie's mother (Patricia Clarkson) finds her in New York and her traditional views act as a major countering force to their relationship.Allen's crafty little concoction about not being able to plan for life and love and all its overwhelming negatives that can pop up at any moment is nearly charming. Truthfully, it's a bit sophomoric for his capability level in terms of comedy. The Southern stereotyping, random sharp turn of events and his choice to break the fourth wall (in a film no less) might all be leading somewhere, but it's nothing you totally bite on. The situations are funny and interesting but not believable or sophisticated enough to convince you to start popping Allen's philosophy pills."Whatever Works" is neo-classical Woody Allen. It's like asking your mother to cook you something she always made when you were a kid only it's 40 years later and not all the same ingredients are present and she uses some different and not as sophisticated ones as a replacement. In other words not quite what it used to be, but it's still pleasantly palatable and it takes you back in a positive way.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
It might just be the mine cart chase sequence at the end, but in reality that scene seems to sum up "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" quite accurately: a theme park ride. When the film was over, I wanted to go to Disneyland to ride the Indiana Jones ride.Harrison Ford stars once again as Hollywood's greatest adventure hero, Indiana Jones, in a film that serves as a prequel to "Raiders of the Lost Ark." In this film, Indy is finishing a job in Shanghai, with the help of his young sidekick Short Round, that goes awry and gets him stuck toting about a singer Willie (Kate Capshaw). On the plane ride out of the East, the three find they've been tricked and crash land in India, where they are sucked into a quest to retrieve an artifact from a hidden temple.The plot is pretty much garbage: all it does is allow for Indiana to fight against a crazy possessed tribe of Indians which means different sets and costumes, but it moves from one suspenseful scene to the next with bits of ridiculous comedy in between and proves to be all together quite fun. You find yourself constantly wondering how Indy will get out of the next death trap, waiting for the next gross insect or dead body to be found, and watching what cool move Indy will pull out of his sleeve next. It's great, quality entertainment. You don't care about the plot after awhile, you just want to see cool action scenes and the stunts in this film are awesome.Kate Capshaw gets a bit annoying in most of her scenes, but at least what happens to her is funny. There is something amusing about an elephant smacking her with his trunk over and over again as she has a normal conversation with Indy. Ford, however, is just as great as ever. Even though Jones spends most of 95% of the time as the adventurer and not the professor in this film, he is so much more human than most action heroes because he's not always getting out of every situation himself and he gets beat up pretty bad. Ford is great at being both humble and cool."Temple of Doom" ends up being a non-stop thrill ride, which is all it needs to be. All the things that made "Raiders" a great film get priority in this film, so it spends less time caring about the bizarre plot and more time testing the physical limits of Harrison Ford's body. While it may not be the strongest in the collection, it certainly holds its own and is not an Indiana Jones film to be passed on.
A raucous take on your typical indie coming-of-age film, "Hesher" paints a portrait of grief and coping with adversity using a diverse palette of humor, sadness, rage, depression and raunch. Certain types will find a good degree of truth to writer/director Spencer Susser's tonal chaos, while others will raise eyebrows, but a part of "Hesher" will resonate with everyone.Devin Brochu stars as T.J., who from the opening scene makes it clear he's trying to get himself killed at some point during the film. He's a bit reckless, and as it turns out he and his father (Rainn Wilson) are grieving for his mother, who died just a couple months before.T.J's troubles lead him to an unfortunate encounter with a probably homeless chain-smoking metal rocker later to be introduced as Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who needless to say plays delightfully against type here.) Turns out that Hesher is about 10 times as reckless as T.J. and in a more brutal and calculating way. He follows T.J. to school, which scares the crap out of him, yet we can only assume it is Hesher who draws indecent images in permanent marker on the car of an older student bullying T.J.Eventually, Hesher comes over uninvited and unannounced to T.J's grandmother's house, where T.J and his father are staying. He inserts himself aggressively yet peacefully into their home and becomes their guest over time, developing a friendship with the grandmother and taking a sort of tough-love mentorship of T.J. We are to presume that the senility of the grandmother and the lifeless apathy of the pill- popping father lead to a casual acceptance of Hesher's newfound presence in their home. It's a significant leap, but Susser and his co-writers are much more preoccupied with creating this unlikely relationship between T.J. and Hesher that logistics take a back seat. Fortunately, the blunt humor spouted off by Hesher, who communicates almost exclusively in sexual metaphors, helps mask the plot's illogical backbone.Although never explicitly stated, it becomes obvious that Hesher wishes to teach T.J. how to stick up for himself, and more importantly how not to fear the consequences. This, of course, is not the world view of an kid in his early teens, and it leads to several emotional whirlwinds for T.J. as he starts to come of age.The script treats T.J. like an adult despite not being one: he curses regularly (which gets worse with Hesher around), he makes friends with people twice his age such as the grocery clerk at the local store (Natalie Portman) and in general he deals with things kids his age would rather not deal with. It's a bit ridiculous, but it does make for an interesting dynamic between him and Hesher.At its core, "Hesher" is about dealing with "the ____ that happens to you," which begins to explain why in some scenes it's just Hesher breaking stuff, or T.J. breaking stuff, or conversely a slow and quiet dramatic and emotional scene such as when T.J. and his dad go to a grief support group. Each character handles it differently, and Hesher's purpose in the story is to shake up the way T.J and his father have handled with it so far with regards to the death of the mother. Susser definitely punches home this message, but it comes through the thick clouds of X- rated humor and with scenes strung together without any cohesive tone. The heavy metal indie image that the film wants to give off doesn't necessarily gel with everything it wants to say. Certain moments are laugh-out-loud hysterical, while others are moving. Then some just feel weird. It's definitely a film that will connect with its audience, but its wired in an awkward way that will likely turn off some viewers.~Steven CThanks for reading!

If the cliché "sex, drugs and rock 'n roll" has seemed obscured or irrelevant the last thirty years, it is no longer. "Get Him to the Greek" serves this unholy trinity buffet style. The latest Judd Apatow-produced laugh fest is a spin-off on the character Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) from 2008's "Forgetting Sarah Marshall," the licentious rock star with a drug addiction. How else, then, do you make a film about a walking stereotype other than expounding on the stereotypes? "Greek" suggests you roll with it, which is easy enough.There's not much of a story here, which limits what this movie can ultimately do, but there's just enough to get the ball rolling. Jonah Hill stars (in a role different than his "Sarah Marshall" character) as Aaron, an aspiring music producer working for millionaire music mogul (Sean "P.Diddy" Combs), who suggests they throw a 10-year anniversary concert featuring Snow's band Infant Sorrow at the Greek Theater, a move which could help the label and resurrect the sunken career of his favorite frontman.He is then charged with the responsibility of personally escorting Mr. Snow from London to the Today Show for a live appearance and performance and then to Los Angeles for the concert. Given Snow's reputation and bacchanalian tendencies, this task will prove much more difficult than the straight-laced Aaron could ever anticipate.What follows is the sex, drugs and rock 'n roll, but mostly drugs. About every scene involves at minimum the consumption of alcohol. If Aaron is not being tempted into it, he needs it to take the edge off because babysitting Snow is a painstaking endeavor. Producer/director Nicholas Stoller, understanding his film is both literally and figuratively laced with substance abuse, doesn't treat it like a physical gag that needs building up to like every other film with a clichéd "drug scene." He uses quick sequences with rapid-fire shots that while seemingly rushed at the time, get the point across without calling any more attention to it than the film already does. This is of course with the exception of the climactic drug scene toward the end when it all hits the fan. Comedian Brand actually plays Snow with unexpected dignity in this film. Here's the potential to just go batty and ridiculous, but Brand tastefully realizes that this is part of Snow's make up; he doesn't need to externalize it with raucous and stumbling behavior. There's also a very human element to the story as we learn Snow's behavior is largely tied to his split from longtime girlfriend and the mother of his children, Jackie Q (Rose Byrne). Then again, the sentimental aspect weakens "Greek" in terms of its lasting impression. It's a bit unrealistic to expect that a film basking in loose morals could possibly have morals of its own and convey them with legitimacy. Aaron too has a love sub plot: his long-term girlfriend ("Mad Men's" Elisabeth Moss) and he get in a fight right before he leaves for London. Stoller admirably hopes to touch the heart as well as the funny bone by keeping these threads going throughout the adventure, but it keeps "Greek" from building into the comedic hurricane its "less plot, more fun" premise suggests (and many fans were likely expecting).As outrageous as "Get Him to the Greek" behaves at times, it will manage to bring just about anyone with a raunchy sense of humor aboard for its shameless and sinful ride. Even Diddy has his moments in a cast of solid characters whose stories might be weak, but performances reflect the underlying maturity that Apatow films have been known for in spite of the boundary-pushing sex and drugs humor.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
It should surprise no one to learn that Baz Luhrmann's "The Great Gatsby" is a towering achievement in art production, costume design, cinematography and music. Luhrmann proved himself capable of as much with "Moulin Rouge!" and first glimpses of "Gatsby" suggested he found ideal source material to match his style in F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby."But for all the technical achievements and the emotion-filled performances from a spot-on cast including Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby, Carrie Mulligan as Daisy and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway (who better to narrate your film? OK, other than Morgan Freeman ...), a definite emotional resonance is missing from Luhrmann's interpretation."Gatsby" is the classic American story of hope, dreams, wealth, excess and love that defined the country in the Roaring '20s. Luhrmann unmistakably celebrates this era with his patented (and mostly tasteful, depending who you ask) exaggeration, and doesn't shy back on the fairy tale qualities of the story either. Nick Carraway is most intrigued by his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, known for his lavish parties that last into the wee hours of the morning. Gatsby soon befriends Carraway, who learns that behind the wealthy facade is a man badly wounded and driven by love and obsession.DiCaprio in presence alone has the chops for Gatsby, and he uses it to his advantage as the shadowy figure in the early parts of the film. As we become more acquainted with Gatsby (and learn to tolerate his excessive use of the term "old sport" when referring to Nick), he becomes a bit more two-faced. Rather than peeling back Gatsby's soul, we get an timid, emotional side that doesn't quick click. Perhaps its the film's use of narration as a crutch for explanation rather than scene work that more visually demonstrates Gatsby's feelings for Daisy.Maguire fits perfectly into the mix, but we don't truly get to access Nick as a character until the end of the film. Mulligan aces the tragic heroine, as you'd expect form Luhrmann. She has a certain strength to her despite of her character's inherent weaknesses from a feminist's perspective. Even Joel Edgerton as Daisy's unfaithful but prideful husband, Tom, excels in his role. It's surprising then, that the film renders us indifferent to them. It can only be ascribed to Luhrmann's style getting in the way of substance.Luhrmann and frequent collaborator Craig Pearce identify beautiful and moving excerpts from the novel to provide Maguire with some excellent narrative work, but the stylistic choices don't gel especially well with Fitzgerald's reflective and much more serious prose. One can envision a film in which "Gatsby's" themes and story can coexist with such grandiose visual context, but for some reason, this film is not it. It engages it audience, captures our attention and scratches at the surface of what makes "Gatsby" a classic, but somehow it never takes the next step. in spite of performances that tell our brains to pay attention because the actors know what they're doing, the characters seem hollow, and as though all that happens to them is a matter of artistic choice rather than necessity.Strangely enough, Luhrmann's "The Great Gatsby" looks and performs like the best possible adaptation of the novel, but the feeling just doesn't cut deep enough.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" is about the closest any major CGI animation studio has come to a classic cartoon done in a modern style. It would appear that somewhere between "Looney Tunes" and Pixar's "Up" that animation has lost a bit of its rule-bending nature. Phil Lord and Chris Miller, co-executive producers of CBS comedy "How I Met Your Mother" and the short-lived cult favorite "Clone High" have restored that sense of abstract physical humor in Judi and Ron Barrett's book while infusing it with a modern sense of humor.You know what I'm talking about: the old cartoons where a TNT explosion or a gunshot would would merely blow all the fur or feathers off (temporarily) of a character. "Meatballs" isn't that old school, but at one point, our narrator, the fearlessly crazy inventor Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader of "SNL") is hiding off the side of a dock after ruining his hometown's big celebration with a presumably failed invention meant to turn water into food. His eventual love interest Sam (Anna Faris) walks to the pier, sits down and accidentally slams her heels into his mega-sized eyeballs. It's the good old concept of animated films being aware of their fictional fantasy world and not being so transfixed on creating realism, which many animated features have in this computer age.Sony Pictures Animation has only continued to get better, with their last film, "Surf's Up," being on the more fun and wacky side for animated features as well. "Meatballs" continues that idea with exaggerated characteristics like bug-eyes on all the characters and general silliness, but the writing is what ties it all together and really nicely.When we're first introduced to Flint, we get to see his many inventions that have gone wrong. But rather than make it just a fun one-minute bit, it's a recurring joke throughout the film. The flying ratbirds that he invents pop up countless times throughout the film and his monkey sidekick named Steve with a thought translator strapped onto his chest gets laughs 80 percent of the time, partly thanks to "How I Met Your Mother" friend Neil Patrick Harris.The story is an important one too, of a wild inventor chasing his dreams, trying to make a difference so that people will love him and dealing with the fame of being a town hero once his machine manages to suck atmospheric moisture and cause it to rain any food imaginable. But also, as we see early but the kiddies will learn later, he's really out to earn the approval of his sardine-grinding father (James Caan) who we tell cares but can't say it in any way other than elaborate fishing metaphors. Then there's that being true to who you are stuff, represented by Sam's shame at growing up a meteorology dork with glasses and a scrunchy.Like every kids film, the shenanigans have a wear-down point, but "Meatballs" is layered with subtle jokes kids won't catch (but that aren't inappropriate either -- a real surprise) that teenagers and adults will really appreciate. In terms of humor, the writing compares favorably with the "Up" script from earlier in 2009 though certainly as a story "Meatballs" is much more cartoon-traditional.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
The zombie genre has gone the way of vampires lately, except that it managed to dodge the romance bits  until now. Yes, it's even possible for the undead to fall in love, though considerably more difficult. "Warm Bodies" introduces the zombie romantic comedy (yes, zom-rom-com), and despite all the ways that in name alone it sounds as though the film could fail, it manages to carve its own niche among zombie pop-culture.Luckily for us, Jonathan Levine adapts and directs this Isaac Marion novel. The director of "50/50" and "The Wackness" has yet to disappoint, and though the premise of "Warm Bodies" brings him dangerously close, his grasp on romance and making young love work on the screen serves him well yet again.Levine's talents aside, "Warm Bodies" is a premise-driven film, which has its pros and cons. Other filmmakers could've executed it in ways that would've yielded countless movie reviews featuring the word "cold" in the headline, but a zombie who struggles with being emotionally dead inside and having to prey on human brains has its inherent merits. Conceptually, it takes on a certain life of its own that Levine mostly capitalizes on whenever possible.The film begins in our main character's (Nicholas Hoult) head as he copes with being a meandering, flesh-craving zombie and dreams (even though the dead can't dream in the literal sense) about getting something more out of this paltry existence. The film widens in scope with each passing scene, and though it never gets any better than it is when it's more intimate, it doesn't go so far off the rails in the finale that it loses sight of the charm that got us to pay attention up to that point.Everything changes for R (that's all he can remember of his first name) when he and a band of hungry corpses encounter some of the survivors from whatever outbreak caused everyone to become zombies eight years ago. A young woman (Teresa Palmer) catches his eye, and he unknowingly devours the brains of her boyfriend (Dave Franco), thereby receiving his memories of the girl, named Julie. R instantly becomes protective of Julie and helps her escape to his personal jet (an airplane stranded on a runway that R calls home).R convinces Julie she is only safe if she stays with him, deceiving her for companionship purposes. They bond in a number of ways as R's use of language drastically begins to improve. It's clear he's becoming more and more human with time.Hoult and Palmer have the difficult task of creating chemistry between their characters, which had to have been one of Levine's biggest challenges making this film. Presumably, Julie would be grossed out by her undead protector, but she senses his humanity rather quickly. To slow things down from there, however, she tries to ditch him at first. If her romantic interest had grown too quickly, it would've trashed the entire film. Given his track record, Levine should get a lot of the credit for allowing the audience time to warm up to their relationship.Palmer has been in a number of young-adult geared action films ("The Sorcerer's Apprentice," "I Am Number Four") but her performances have been either overshadowed or crushed by these giant turd blockbusters. "Warm Bodies" is a better fit with its indie sensibilities. She makes Julie's combination of fear, curiosity and love come together into a smoother blend than you'd expect from this kind of film. Hoult, on the other hand, has to find a perfect balance between zombie caricature and a thinking, emotional person. The narration crucially helps us connect with him, otherwise we'd never get to know him as a character, but he finds a way in the more traditional scenes when he interacts with Julie to express those feelings with grunts and slow-forming words. Think of all the cheesy monster movies when the "thing" expresses his feelings out loud for the first time. Just the mere thought of that has my eyes rolling, but Hoult keeps them firmly interested in what's going on.The story falters a bit toward the end because its trajectory is so apparent. R is becoming more alive, so he'll either become "a real boy" again or get killed before it happens, perhaps even by Julie's cold father, the leader of the survivors (John Malkovich). Suddenly we have a war of ideologies between Julie and those that believe zombies have the capacity to change and become more human and those who think they're nothing but animals who'll snack on your insides the second you let your guard down. It's a pretty classic motif, but you probably never figured someone would apply it to a zombie movie.Some unidentifiable spark between R and Julie, or perhaps between Hoult and Palmer, sticks through to the end of the film, even in the more action-oriented finale. "Warm Bodies" also doesn't ever lose its sense of humor, helping talk us down from taking it too seriously. And even though characters such as the best friend (Analeigh Tipton) appear to serve only comic relief, it doesn't try too hard for the awkward zombie joke."Warm Bodies" twists things up with this unusual genre riff and Levine subdues it rather than ramming its uniqueness down our throats. He makes it foremost about two people who seem like an odd fit that come to love each other  and that's really the essence of the better romantic comedies of all time.~Steven CThanks for reading!

If we learned anything from the film adaptation of "The Da Vinci Code," it's that Dan Brown's best-selling religion-centered mystery novels don't translate into great films. Entertaining, sure, but great, no. The dialogue gets bogged down with historical explanation and the characters get little attention because there's simply no time with all the symbol decoding. But box office receipts are another story: "Da Vinci" fell just sort of earning twice its budget, so great film or not, there would be "Angels & Demons." Not surprisingly, this film suffers from the same deficiencies despite being a bit better.I have read both books and seen both movies and "Angels & Demons" the film is easily a notch better than its film predecessor. Unlike "Da Vinci," focused on the mostly little known ideas of the sacred feminine, "Angels" is about the inner-workings of the Catholic Church, which requires considerably less audience educating than the sacred feminine. Writer Akiva Goldsman, who penned both Brown adaptations, doesn't have to waste all his time explaining the history/mythology as he did in "Da Vinci" ... only most of it. "Angels" is more of a thriller and a tad better suited for film than "Da Vinci." This film is a sprint from start to finish, taking place in under 24 hours and its premise is very simple: 15 minutes in you learn that a legendary group of scientists from the 17th century who were persecuted by the church have risen again and threatened to kill four cardinals every hour starting at 7 p.m. and follow that up at midnight by exploding the Vatican with anti-matter - - unless Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) and an Italian anti-matter scientist (Ayelet Zurer) can stop them by decoding a set of ancient clues planted throughout Rome. The suspense comes much easier because they have to solve the clues on time or people die. "Da Vinci" was much less straightforward. This moves quick and is consequently more entertaining. It also doesn't hurt that the backdrop for the story is the stunningly beautiful Rome: it's more dazzling to watch.As for the problems being the same, Tom Hanks is yet again wasted talent. He has the Robert Langdon look and the reputation to bring in profits, but his character just has to sound like he knows what he's talking about and spit out mythology and history quick enough so that we can get on to the next scene. Of course Hanks does this well, but anyone could. These films just have no room to develop character or elicit any emotion from the audience. At least this time, Goldsman and acclaimed director Ron Howard don't even pretend like they can create catharsis and focus on making this film as fast-paced and thrilling as possible. They succeed here better than in "Da Vinci" and smart artists don't make the same mistakes twice.Viewers that read the books, saw "Da Vinci" and still didn't like "Angels & Demons" have no one to blame but themselves for giving in and buying tickets to see something proved not to translate well into film despite being in the hands of a master like Howard. Anyone who walks in and expects to at least be entertained by a mystery for 2 hours with no expectation of being as good of the book will find they get exactly what they paid for and maybe even find it was better than "Da Vinci."
"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" is a horror movie for epileptics, a 2.5-hour exhibition of a hurricane in a hardware store, a relentlessly loud first movement in a symphony of destruction. It is a summer blockbuster on steroids: you'd like to laud the accomplishment, but it feels like cheating. In other words, "Fallen" appears to be the greatest spectacle of visual effects and stunts ever made, but simultaneously the most overproduced screaming pile of junk Hollywood has served us in this computer-generated era.You have to give Michael Bay credit, the man sticks to his directorial convictions: explosions, chases and more explosions. Despite getting reamed for years for his overkill style, he seems to feel like it's not worth making a sequel unless you're committed to visually dwarfing the first one. What his approach, and the approach of this entire film should have been, was not to overload this thing and instead hit the audience hardest where it counts most. "Fallen" is more than overly ambitious: the script is a barreling mack truck and the audience like roadkill stuck in its grill."Fallen" enlightens us that humans and transformers actually have a history on Earth, the only plausible way to harvest a story after a straight-forward, sensible and enjoyable first film. Two years later, the U.S. Military and the Autobots have joined forces to eliminate the surviving Decepticons that threaten Earth. After the opening scene ravishing China, however, it's not that simple. Our human hero, Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf), has discovered that a shard from the first film's All Spark, an energy source giving life to Transformers, has been with him all this time, and now it's suddenly transferred crucial information to him that contains the whereabouts of another energy source somewhere on Earth that could give the Decepticons their revenge. As with the first film, that's not all. Dozens of characters and subplots (Sam going to college, the Obama administration trying to shut down the operation between the Army and the Autobots and of course the sexiest woman alive, Megan Fox, trying to get her boyfriend to say three small words.As for new Transformers, it seems as if Hasbro, creators of the hit action figures for decades now, put a mandatory quota on needing x number of new products appearing on screen for toy-mongering children to beg their parents for. "Fallen" is loaded with new bots, including the famous Devastator, a five-transformers-joined-into-one monstrosity that resembles a living junkyard and is even equipped with "testicles." Yes, that's part of "Fallen"'s obnoxious and horrific sense of humor. It was pretty even hit- or-miss in the first movie, but this film is even more insulting to its audiences comedic intelligence. Take "the twins" for example: idiotic gold-toothed stereotypes in the form of those compact Chevys (GM, how fitting) throwing insults at each other. They are second to only Jar Jar Binks. The writers also seem to think adding Sam's new college roommate is a good idea -- when John Turturro (also pointlessly back) stuns him to sleep to shut him up, it's almost as if they knew what an annoyance he was. It's hard to believe that at least Orci and Kurtzman, who delivered an awesome "Star Trek" script last month, were behind such frivolous dialogue. I can't fault them for the absurdity of the plot and lack of themes -- they were paid a lot and their hands were tied -- but the forced humor? Terrible.Still, as easy as "Fallen" is to rip on, it gets a few stars out of respect for the man hours it must've taken to turn this film over in less than two years and make it as much of a visual masterpiece as it is. Though Bay could have made it less frenetic with not as many camera circle-arounds, you can tell every sequence had to have been planned so far ahead and done perfectly on every take. Let's hope the next one, Bay or no Bay, condenses quantity into quality and gives this franchise back its storytelling dignity. At the least, let Hollywood learn, in the peak of the CG era, that less is more. ~ Steven CVisit my site: http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
You might remember nothing else from "In the Loop" other than its landmark insults, but that's enough. This high-brow dirty British humor from the writing team behind the hit British political comedy show "The Thick of It" is exceptional and its ability to intelligently prod at politics is almost more of a bonus."In the Loop" puts a finger on politics as the art of undoing hypocrisies. From the beginning, the film is about British Minister of International Development, Simon Foster (Tom Hollander) trying to recant a statement that war with a certain Middle Eastern country is "unforeseeable." He then ends up telling the press one must "climb the mountain of conflict to walk the path of peace." He is a PR nightmare, but his conflicting statements have attracted both pro and anti-war mid-level government powers in America who intend to use him as "meat." Trying to conduct this chaotic orchestra is a fantastic supporting role from Scot Peter Capaldi as the vulgar and disparaging Malcolm Tucker, the prime minister's PR man.It's kind of fascinating to watch a political film where the president and prime minister are faceless. I think that's part of what makes "In the Loop" effective as well. Everyone is just a pawn in what will make or break the image of guy at the top of the chain. There are a lot of young people in the cast, which shows the large percentage of the young workforce in Washington. These characters are slowly evolving into the snide and blunt government veterans they work for, which helps complete the hysterical portrait of politics director Armando Iannucci is going for.Do yourself a service and go straight to the IMDb memorable quote page for this film. That's where "In the Loop" gets its appeal. Certainly the uninhibited superfluous trading of high- brow insults aren't for everyone, but there's definitely an audience of film buffs that will enjoy intellectual humor as a break from its banal physical counterpart.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Whatever stigma exists about movies based on toys both in general and in your mind, "The LEGO Movie" will dismantle it  brick by glorious brick. The writer/director combo of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller ("Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," "21 Jump Street") prove themselves yet again as masterful comic storytellers with an endless stream of wit and imagination, turning a movie adults were quick to dismiss into one they will be overjoyed to watch with or without children.The world of "The LEGO Movie" is made entirely of LEGO pieces and though it was created using digital animation, contains the photorealism of stop-motion films, which is the first of many spot-on artistic choices Lord and Miller make. Even water, smoke and explosions are all made of bricks. So the way the film looks and operates remains unpredictable throughout the film, keeping the visuals engaging from start to finish.In terms of the story, Lord and Miller (along with Dan and Kevin Hageman) follow the instructions as far as family films go, but there are plenty of twists and the film's message is both unique and true to the experience of those who love LEGO. Emmet (Chris Pratt), a LEGO construction worker living in Bricksburg, where everything is awesome (as the city's number one hit song goes) because everyone follows the instructions, conforms, works together and is happy all the time. Turns out that's because Lord/President Business (Will Ferrell) wants it that way. Many years before, he stole a weapon called the Kragle from the master builder Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and now he plans to use it as a doomsday device, as it will stick pieces together and keep everything as it should be. When Emmet comes upon the Piece of Resistance, the one thing that can stop the Kragle, he starts to fulfill a prophecy, and with a team of LEGO friends, tries to stop Lord Business.All eras and styles of LEGO get some spotlight as the adventure grows in scope and imagination. There's the highly skilled action heroine, Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), her boyfriend, Batman (Will Arnett), Benny the '80s spaceman (Charlie Day), Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) and a host of other cameos from the DC Comics universe, "Harry Potter," "Lord of the Rings," "Star Wars," "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and more. References to Octan, the brand featured on many LEGO products of old, proves just how aware Lord and Miller are of their audience.But it's the brilliance and hilarity of Emmet that makes "The LEGO Movie" work so well in terms of the story. The childlike wonder that launched Pratt's career on "Parks and Recreation" plays perfectly into the movie's humor. He's a constant laugh reel and a strong main character; his ineptitude is the butt of the other characters' jokes, making him the unlikely hero who has to prove everyone wrong.Perhaps not so coincidentally, Ferrell is also perfect casting as the dastardly President Business. Both he and Pratt have that man-child silliness in their comedy, and let's face it  LEGO fans are quite often man-children. This is something the film never loses sight of, as an unusual reveal late into the film puts LEGO within a context that its fans will truly appreciate.The reason the Danish building blocks have been around so long is their ability to capture imagination, and that's the primary thing "The LEGO Movie" does so well. The characters are constantly building new eye-popping creations to problem-solve their way through the conflict. Although the film is hilarious, so much of the humor comes from its creativity. There are even clever uses of non-LEGO items that play major roles throughout the film. Audiences who fell in love with Disney's "Wreck-It Ralph," which takes place in the world of video games, will find "The LEGO Movie" to be a kindred spirit. So many different styles and genres converge in a diverse cinematic landscape fueled by the endless creative minds of animators and filmmakers. Both also take time to build emotion connections, not just creative worlds. "The LEGO Movie" will really speak to people who have spent countless hours building with LEGO, but its message will resonate with all ages and LEGO "experience" levels. In other words, Lord, Miller, the Hagemans and the entire creative team have dug down to find what makes LEGO a universally beloved brand and brought out the best of it in a wildly funny, creative and meaningful story.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Begun in 1925, Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" is probably the most ambitious film ever made. Science-Fiction "dystopia" films are still challenging to do in the modern era of computer generated images, let alone telling a good one in 1920s Germany. To think that the producers of this film spent the equivalent of a $200 M summer blockbuster in today's terms in a tattered post-WWI Germany makes a powerful statement about film as an art form."Metropolis" is a silent film set in the future about a city divided between the wealthy, elite city planners and the underground working masses that make the city operate. A hopeful but potentially dangerous link forms between the two when the son of the city leader notices a young and optimistic religious figure named Maria from the underground and his curiosity about her people heightens.The film operates from a mantra: "there can be no understanding between the hand and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator." It's goal is then to show us why this is true and it certainly does. It's a commentary on social class that disapproves of the disconnect between the wealthy and the newly emerged working/middle class of the time period. Lang brings us some impressive images for 1927. From a modern perspective, it's hard to call it riveting, but especially toward the end it keeps your attention. To think of what this film achieved in that time period helps keep "Metropolis" in perspective. It would make for an intriguing modern remake or other sort of adaptation, that's for sure.
After years of success bringing earthbound superheroes to the big screen, Marvel Studios opened eyes when it first endeavored to make a film out of "Guardians of the Galaxy." If Iron Man was once considered an obscure Marvel hero, these guys were total D-league. Yet surprising to no one, the studio's creative process has yielded another hit, even with this ragtag group and set in a galaxy far, far away.Although an ensemble superhero film, Peter Quill a.k.a. "Star Lord" is the clear main character of "Guardians," a human boy abducted by alien mercenaries as a child who has become an adult skilled in scouring the universe for items of value and turning a profit. When he snatches a prized orb, however, he discovers it isn't just some average bounty; Kree warlord Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) wants it badly and sends Gamora (Zoe Saldana), an assassin and daughter of the titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) to retrieve it. On the planet Xandar, Star Lord and Gamora get tangled with bounty hunters Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a genetically engineered raccoon and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a tree-like humanoid, and they all find themselves imprisoned by Xandar's Nova Corps, where they soon unite in common cause  getting a huge payday for the orb.Sounds like overblown science fiction, but "Guardians of the Galaxy" is far from it thanks to director and writer James Gunn ("Super," "Slither"), who, with co-writer Nicole Perlman, utilizes humor as a way to ground the film in something universal (in the non-sci fi sense of the word). The tone of the movie is irreverent and silly, fitting for such the "rag-tag group of heroes" motif and unusual for the genre, which tends to overestimate the average audience's interest in alien species and the names of planets.Start with the "Indiana Jones"-style opening, which is a fairly common technique. Following a brief prologue with young Peter Quill watching his sick mother die, we next see him landing on a strange planet and using some of his gadgetry to search for the orb in a mysterious cave. But then, he puts on his Walkman and headphones (his only belongings from Earth) and "Come and Get Your Love" plays over the title sequence, which features Pratt boogying his way to the orb  an unusual twist on a normally serious-toned genre to say the least.Humor is truly the movie's backbone, and the script takes a page from "The Avengers" in terms of playing up the dynamic of the various personalities in the group. The difference here is these characters don't just have egos, they have unusual quirks. Quill is a stubborn dancing fool; Rocket a cynic with a quick temper and a complex; Groot a powerful simpleton with a soft heart; and Drax (Dave Bautista) a vengeful literalist. This lovable cast of despicable characters, together with jokes based on "Earthly" references, and the humor exudes a freshness and fun seen in few action movies, let alone space operas.Also compared to other "space operas," "Guardians" doesn't downplay the sci fi elements or dismiss the movie/comic nerd's interest in the geekier aspects of the film; it complements them. They serve as context pieces rather than focal points of the story. The imaginative art direction abounds in each and every digital set piece, but no time gets wasted on explaining any of it. You don't have to understand the complex history of the Kree and the Xandarians, for example, to appreciate or take interest in the plot, but if you look and listen close enough, you'll get a taste of it. All compliments to Gunn, and to Marvel for backing another small-budget filmmaker on a film of tremendous scale."Guardians of the Galaxy" could fairly be hailed as the first great alien-filled interplanetary sci-fi movie since "Star Wars." As outrageous an assertion as that sounds, when you look at films such as the "Riddick" series, "John Carter," or "Green Lantern," it's not such a reach. It also doesn't lack for heart and cares deeply about its characters, which should strengthen the comparison. Only the "Star Trek" reboot seems to have done something similar, but that had a pre-established brand  "Guardians" has a just a handful of Marvel Comics readers.The likely box office success of "Guardians" compared to some of those aforementioned films, for example, speaks volumes to the way that Marvel Studios has gone about its business. Just compare this film to the studio's last, "Captain America: The Winter Soldier"  night and day, but both outstanding movies. The fact that the minds and string-pullers behind both movies are the same is astounding, but edge to "Guardians" for being the riskier of the two. The intergalactic components of the Marvel comic universe are now completely available in the cinematic one, when for many years it was largely seen as a pipe dream to sink money into a "Star Wars"-like project and expect a worthwhile return on investment.Although it makes its mark more with humor than science fiction, fans should be grateful for the doors "Guardians of the Galaxy" could open for the genre. At the very least, it will make for one wickedly awesome (and hilarious) cross-over with the Avengers in a few years.~Steven C Thanks for reading!
"Looks are deceiving" would be an adequate way to describe the "The Elephant Man" as a film from the outside, but it would be a horribly amateur way to describe its message. David Lynch's film soars beyond mere pity for those with life-altering physical abnormalities and serves as more than just a slap on the wrist to a generally unsympathetic public. It is a study of the human condition and Lynch's camera a microscope examining one of its most fragile examples.Taking place in Victorian London and filmed like a classic '30s or '40s film in black and white, "The Elephant Man" carries that classic naive sensibility that combined with the hideous deformities of its central character, creates a bit of horror and suspense before it appeals to our better nature by eliciting sympathy and understanding.John Merrick (John Hurt) is "The Elephant Man" to the abusive owner exploiting him in a freak show, but when Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), a doctor studying anatomy, finds him and sees him for the first time, a tear runs down Hopkins' face in a powerful close-up and the doctor brings him to hospital, nursing him to health and soon socializing him.It's a fascinating story. For the first half hour we're hooked by sheer curiosity over what John looks like and how he came to be, a technique that catches one of our most unflattering flaws in that we gape at the unknown and the abnormal. It then shows us more and more of John, slowly unveiling his humanity, and suddenly we're converted and incredibly protective of this unusual character.The film provides an array of human reactions to seeing/meeting someone so terribly disfigured. Treves' wife, for example, cries uncontrollably out of pity, a famous actress treats him like a fascinating human being, a nurse screams at the sight of him and sadly many exploit him. This broad spectrum fully puts you in John's shoes and leaves you with incredible insight into his unique situation.As a filmmaker, Lynch leads us quite easily to our own discoveries about what John's story teaches us. He nudges us toward symbolism without beating us with it and cuts away from scenes just as we react to them instead of giving moments of pause and total resolution. This creates a totally different reaction to what happens in a scene. It's raw, unresolved, maybe even troubling -- but it works and we manage to understand the significance better because he pulls us away at a moment of tension.There are some abstract techniques and shots bookending the film in short scenes with John's mother, but little else is cryptic. Lynch really draws out the similarities and differences between John as an uncared for circus attraction and John as the fascinating man everyone wants to meet, which is the heart of both our and Treves' moral dilemma. Then, as John runs away from a mob at a London train station, we get that simple but powerful line: "I am not an animal! I am a human being! I ... am ... a man!" and suddenly it all clicks. Now that's fantastic film-making. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Turns out they're not too old for this ****."RED," the 2010 action comedy based on the DC comic, earned a deserved dash of praise for delivering on the fun of its concept of aging stars toting deadly weapons. "RED 2" does a job of equal measure, though it doesn't compensate for the loss of its novelty. Essentially, the sequel ought to please fans of the original, and everyone else will be no worse for the wear when all is said and done.Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and his girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) are loving retirement, but their peace is quickly interrupted when they run into their old friend Marvin (John Malkovich), who tells them a document has been leaked connecting him and Frank to a powerful weapon from the Cold War era called Nightshade. Marvin and Frank become everyone's most wanted: American agent Jack Horton (Neil McDonough), Korean assassin Han (Byung-hun Lee) and even Victoria (Helen Mirren) are after them. So they take to Europe and team up with Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones), one of Frank's old flames, to track down information about Nightshade.Original "RED" writers Jon and Erich Hoeber are definitely responsible for the continuity in tone from the first film to this one. The sequel retains the dry wit of the first and the occasional tongue-in-cheek. "RED 2" also doesn't take itself too seriously, though it manages a few eye rolls compared to the first. And the plot actually keeps things interesting with twists, betrayals and the like, which is a huge asset when the story otherwise plays with overdone foreign espionage tropes. Director Dean Parisot doesn't add much to the film, though it doesn't exactly miss "RED" director Robert Schwentke either.The cast once again looks like it's having a total blast. Willis hasn't looked this relaxed in any of his recent action films; Malkovich is less crazy than in the first film and more lovable and Mirren is never more charming than when she's playing with guns. Newcomer to the cast Anthony Hopkins also gets more of a playful character role. Also, Parker gets to build on the "in-over- her-head leading lady" stereotype of Sarah more so than she did in the first film. In some ways she turns out to be the comic relief."RED 2" doesn't offer a whole lot of innovation or excitement as an action film. There is some clever and humorous fight choreography throughout, but it still leans on typical action sequences expected to be funnier given the age of the actors involved. Lee, who is meant to keep the action fresh, is one of the best in the martial arts business, but his skills go a little under-utilized.There are so many more ways to go wrong than "RED 2," which if for no other reason, works by not overreaching, trying to be something it simply can't and being true to its concept. It's hard to see a whole franchise being built from something "decently entertaining," but movie franchises have been built on much worse.~Steven CThanks for reading!

With the number of films based on/around/about the Holocaust/World War II, it's hard to find something original. "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," a historical fiction film gives the perspective of an 8-year-old German boy whose father is in charge of running a death camp, unaware of what's going on at all. To put it simplistically, it is a loss of innocence tale, though it is really quite more than just that. As the boy learns more of what's going on, so do we through the images of the film and actions of the aware characters. That's what makes the film a really good way to break an older child (though no less than 10 years old) into learning about the Holocaust. In this regard and in its very mature storytelling, "Pajamas" is a very good film.The boy's name is Bruno, played by Asa Butterfield, a talented young actor very much in the mold of Freddie Highmore, the young English child star. When Bruno's father (Thewlis of "Harry Potter") and mother (Fermiga of "The Departed") move them to the country, Bruno's curiosity leads him to discover a death camp is only a mile or so away. Little by little, Bruno learns exactly why his parents have been telling him to stay away, though it doesn't stop him from meeting a young Jewish boy named Shmuel on the other side of the fence. This perspective from a non-Jew is unique to Holocaust films for sure.Adapted and directed by little known British director Mark Herman, "Pajamas" unravels as a family film about a serious subject matter but ultimately turns into a tragedy of unnerving proportions. The dialog is light (in quantity only) but Herman really tells it quite well, getting us in Bruno's perspective while occasionally letting us into the adult world where things are more explicit about the horrors of the Holocaust. It's "Schindler's List" without the violence but all the emotional pull.The film's only fault is in its validity. Most Holocaust stories are based on truth at least. "Pajamas" is entirely fictional and in fact the plot is quite preposterous. That doesn't, however, make it less gripping, because it really sells itself under Herman's direction.It must be warned that this is a very hard, tragic film. That's all that can be said without spoilers, but it must be said. This combination of Holocaust through a child's eyes and tragedy could potentially really open up the eyes of some young people. This film has the potential to be a very powerful experience for a young person and will certainly open up dialog in families about the Holocaust.
When you see that "Accepted" stars Justin Long and Jonah Hill, there's a sense that it comes from the same vein of recent successful comedies (Long in "Dodgeball" or Hill in "40-Year- Old Virgin), but the comedy is simply too ridiculous in concept and the characters too uninteresting to bring this movie to that level.In the film, Long plays an unsuccessful high school graduate who doesn't get accepted into any schools of his choice despite his friend (Hill) getting into a reputable Ohio school. Along with some other screw-up friends, Long decides to create his own university where he can fake his own acceptance to to please his disappointed parents. How they go about making this happen, you just have to push past a few large logical hurdles to understand.Long plays the part well as a smart-ass teenager whose best skill is deception. The humor comes from his supporting cast and some of the oddball characters are hit and miss. Ultimately there are too many weirdos and the movie goes back and forth between clever ridiculous and teen trash comedy. The fact that the movie then tries to take itself serious as a social commentary on education is an entire waste of time given how implausible the whole situation is in the first place.In other words, this comedy on premise alone applies it's going nowhere from the start, even if you desperately want it to, and some of the humor makes it a bit above trash level for the most part. This is nothing more than a one time rental flick.
What's the best way to teach the general public, especially in America, about a serious and often misunderstood issue? Make a movie. Al Gore and director David Guggenheim figured it out with "An Inconvenient Truth," a film about the global warming crisis that is part documentary, part video lecture. As a documentary that weaves in Gore's life in attempt to give some emotional depth to the facts, it kind of seems pointless at times, but as an educational film, "Truth" is certainly effective in explaining global warming and empowering the viewer to do something about it.Educationally, the footage of Gore's lectures and the technology at his disposal allow for a very clear although at times very statistical explanation of what global warming is, what causes it, how it affects the planet and what we can do about it. The evidence, while sometimes confusing in the form of charts, is strong and eye-opening. Gore certainly demonstrates his expertise on the subject.Dispersed throughout the film are Gore's reflections on different aspects of his life and career set to pictures, some of which pertains to global warming directly and some of which is supposed to relate metaphorically or symbolically. You can kind of tell why Guggenheim put in these different bits when he did, but sometimes they detract from the issue at hand. There's also several shots of Gore in cars, typing on his Apple PowerBook and waiting in line at airports, none of which, as you'd imagine, are the least bit captivating. So it's hard to decipher if we're supposed to feel pity for Gore or merely get a sense of who he is politics and the 2000 presidential election aside. In general though, the knowledge aspect is quite strong in this film. While it would have benefited from more than just video lectures and actually taken us out to locations to see some specific examples of the impact of global warming, there is plenty to learn and understand that will change your perspective (or enhance it) on environmental issues.
When this film first came out, I was in total shock that there could be a major film released called "The 40-Year-Old Virgin." It seemed so explicit--a film entirely centered around getting laid? Yes, America, we've come and gone this far, and you know what? It's entertaining, hysterical and even good-natured and sweet.Steve Carrell is the 40-year-old virgin, a tech merchandise salesman named Andy Stitzer whose only life concerns are his job and his action figure collection. He lives by himself, he rides a bike and yes, he's never had sex before. So when his tech store co-workers--who've been laid but still have plenty of other issues--find out, they try and set him up for success, offering him a myriad of advice, most of which is terrible. Andy is reluctant to try, but when he meats Trish (Catherine Keener), that starts to change.Carrell really gets you to laugh in this film, but mostly because you pity his sorry existence. The dynamic between him and his funnier co-stars really works well here. Cal (Seth Rogen) is a weird, overly blunt friend, Jay (Romany Malco) is the married one who's a player a heart and has some aggressive advice and David (Paul Rudd) is the sap who always talks about true love. The scenes of this film mostly result from the terrible advice these hilarious guys give him and often times the weird girls he picks up as a result. Because these guys have bad advice, the language in this film is graphic and some of the scenes are too. If you prefer to keep sex talk to the bedroom, this film will have you uncomfortable 75% of the time.This film is good because you feel bad while simultaneously laughing at Andy. Comedy and empathy are two good things for a protagonist to provide. His misadventures trying to get laid and working out a real relationship with Trish is just really well done by the film's creator, Judd Apatow. Keener is also a great choice for Trish. She brings the film down to earth much like Rachel McAdams does in "Wedding Crashers." She's a very believable single middle-aged mom. It's a wonder how this film can be so dirty while simultaneous meaningful and Keener's performance helps make that happen. This was the kind of film she needed for people to notice her talents and recognize her in other work.Though as much as I say this film is sweet, there is no question that this is a dirty comedy first and foremost with some stupid stuff in it no doubt. It's a good date movie if your date can take the R-rated humor, but not just any R-rated humor, generally private R-rated humor. This film is most memorable for the antics--the rest is there to keep it from ever seeming too out of control.
Films rarely capture real life, relatable moments, let alone with any kind of regularity, but Tamara Jenkins' "The Savages" does it. The terrific script is brought to life by really two of the greatest actors working today in Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman. "Savages" is a deeply human drama that focuses on one of the more difficult aspects of aging and family, but with a natural sense of humor all the same. But it's not devoid of any artistic touch either. Jenkins puts some serious thought into her directing and like most (good) films written and directed by the same person, even the smallest of ideas and themes come out of this film.Linney and Hoffman play two middle aged siblings (Wendy and Jon) who had little to no parental influence in their lives, so when they find that their father, who has been on the other side of the country for over twenty years with a woman that wasn't their mother, is suffering from dementia, they must find a new living situation for him. The drama centers around these two sibling who are struggling enough to find direction in their own lives, let alone being able to help their estranged father. Their relationship is touching and so profoundly real on screen in a way that only these two incredible actors could do. Honestly, there are few better real-life and also versatile actors working right now.Jenkins deserves the applause too, however. In addition to a scarily real script, she adds several touches to the film itself with her directing, playing a lot with the rhythm of the film, speeding certain parts up for dramatic effect and slowing others down to elicit more reflection from the viewer. The film does feel long for only being a couple hours, but it's not enough to really hurt the honesty and truthfulness of this film.Even for those that can't directly relate to having to make important decisions for a parent who can no longer make them for themselves, this film finds great poignancy. The entry point is with the protagonists as we relate to their busy and unfruitful lives and contemplate how we would respond in their situation. Wendy is the more emotional one who feels guilty while Jon is more level-headed and practical about it. It's a great dynamic and one which both actors thrive with.This is one of those family, life-like dramas that really hits it on the head with a particular aspect of life at its most relatable. It even uses the fact that Wendy wants to stage a play based on her childhood and relationship with her father to have Jenkins state her concern as to whether the film comes across as "middle class whining." The answer is that it doesn't. The struggles in these characters' lives are too real and founded in the natural truth about relationships.
No film is a greater champion of democracy than "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." One would be hard pressed to find a film that better communicates the ideals upon which America and democracy were founded. Forget all the patriotic war films or political biopics, "Mr. Smith" is the most American film of all time because it reminds us what it means to have a government for the people, by the people.What's most impressive about what is arguably '30s and '40s master Frank Capra's greatest cinematic achievement is that despite not identifying the state Senator Jefferson Smith (Stewart) represents or identifying any political parties, the film is still able to make a profound statement about the complacency among politicians for corruption within government. No one is implicated in this film and no political bias could possibly sway a viewer's opinion -- it's one hundred percent about how in a democracy, people must stand up to their government, opinions and beliefs aside."Mr. Smith" does it by creating a protagonist in Jeff Smith that represents the typical youthful, idealistic American. When a senator dies, the governor of his state feels caught between the people's choice for a replacement and that of an influential businessman named Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold). He decides to appear as if he isn't favoring either influence by appointing Smith, a boy scout leader -- a choice that shocks everyone. At the very least, the governor figures Smith will be so overwhelmed by Washington that he'll stay quiet in the Senate and allow Taylor's hush-hush controversial dam to be passed.Smith arrives in Washington and is awe-struck by the monuments and the buildings, not unlike a young American seeing D.C for the first time. All he's known his whole life are the ideals America stands for, not the inner-workings of the political system. We are in his same shoes and much like the film corrupts this idealism for Smith, it corrupts it for us. Stewart, who officially breaks out in this role, is perfect. He has charm, but he's rather nervous and clueless. He is phenomenal at being nervous and uncertain despite speaking with strong conviction -- he's easy to relate to as he fights for what he believes in as the film progresses.Smiths' emotions are our emotions through the film and that's where "Mr. Smith" draws its true power as a film. Between Capra's work building up Washington and then exposing it and Stewart's ability to demonstrate this same idea through his reactions to it, we want to give up when Smith wants to give up. We're even surprisingly convinced ourselves by Jean Arthur's -- who plays Smith's assistant -- passionate speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, pleading Smith to keep fighting. As he continues the fight, we support him, pity him and much more. It's his fire to keep the purity of American ideals that is truly inspiring.Essentially, Smith is any one of us, a well-respected American, who happens to find his way into a role where he can make a difference, and he single-handedly tries to do what every American wishes he or she could: stand up for what he believes in and never give up, no matter the cost, because it's what's right. There have been films about people making a difference or fighting for the American way, but never one that acts as such a strong metaphor or even a microcosm of when democracy is its most powerful.
As strange as the title "Hot Tub Time Machine" might seem, it oddly fits this movie. You can only expect so much from a flick that has two nouns in the title that are as seemingly opposite as "hot tub" and "time machine." It's the kind of title that says "I'm not going to make sense, but who doesn't love hot tubs or time machines?" It's a silly, mindless film that revels in time travel jokes and an assortment of gags related to the discrepancy between being middle-aged now and being a 20-something in the '80s. It's the kind of pure sugar fun you need to be in the mood for.Sadly, I hold my time travel movies to a higher standard. In fact, Crispin Glover's appearance in this film as one of the more amusing peripheral characters who is part of an effective through-line gag was like having a constant reminder of better time travel movies even if it intended just to be a throw back for '80s nostalgists who love "Back to the Future." The plot moves along so haphazardly that it becomes abundantly clear "Hot Tub" wants nothing more than to exploit the idea of time travel. As far as what going back in time is supposed to teach the characters, there's nothing new here.The film starts with snapshots of four men, three middle aged and the fourth is one of their nephews. Nick (Craig Robinson) is on his wife's leash, Adam's (John Cusack) girlfriend just left him, Jacob (Clark Duke) is Adam's 20-year-old nephew who confines himself to the basement and Lou (Rob Corddry) is a jerk who just tried to off himself, which brings his buddies Adam and Nick to his aid. Together, they decide they need a getaway to their favorite old ski resort, Kodiak Valley. Other than generic personality portraits (Adam's the good guy, Nick's the big baby, Lou's the vehicle for dirty comedy, Jacob for dead-pan comedy), we see nothing else from these guys before they randomly find themselves in 1986. Immediately they decide they have to do exactly what they did when they were at the resort 24 years ago unless they want to drastically change their future.The rest of the film consists of insult exchanges, physical gags, time jokes, pop culture references and a few surprise nuggets we have to wait for, such as who Clark's father is. Most of it isn't funny, but the fact that the whole film is somewhat of a back-handed tribute to the '80s keeps things amusing. You can't laugh with this film, but cleverly the writers convince you that the joke is on the '80s, so you laugh at that rather than the jumbled nonsense that is the plot. Rather than try and make sense with regards to explaining the time travel, there's Chevy Chase as the enigmatic hot tub repair guy that randomly disappears. He's supposed to be a joke confirming that writer Josh Heald, John Morris and Sean Anders are aware of their ridiculous script, but it's not funny enough to make up the difference.Some of the dialogue is pretty funny. It best suits Duke, who despite being the black sheep of the film, gets a lot of the laughs because his character exposes the lunacy of the others with dead-on dry delivery. Corddry works perfectly despite not being likable, Robinson does't stretch himself compared to previous roles and Cusack -- let's all admit he was in the film because he was an '80s icon. Some of the scenes in "Hot Tub" are like straight from "Better Off Dead."Like the '80s, "Hot Tub" was a good time, but in the grand scheme of things, just not very good and not worth doing again.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
What a peculiar film. Tim Burton's first major film was and still is anything but typical. Although his imagination only gets the credit for bringing this strange concept to life, not conceiving it, it's clear why Burton has gone on to have the career he's had. "Beetlejuice" blends the supernatural world with the real one and does it with a wry sense of humor the entire time. Nothing about "Beetlejuice" is predictable, yet it goes off without a hitch, rarely missing. That's what any truly innovative classic does.Like very few but many great characters in cinema history, Beetlejuice steals the show despite a glaring lack of screen time. "Beetlejuice" in reality should probably not be titled as such. The film focuses on The Maitlands, a married couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who die in a car accident and find themselves living as ghosts in their large former home even after the pretentious and dysfunctional Deetz family has moved in. Finding that whenever they try and leave their house they enter a bizarre sand world full of carnivorous worms, the couple desperately attempts to scare the Deetzes away, but to no avail. They soon learn Lydia, the daughter (Winona Ryder), can actually see them.Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) comes into the picture as a ghost who claims to be able to scare the living better than anyone. Full of gusto, Beetlejuice is an inappropriate, obnoxious, outspoken and not to mention decaying figure who can only be called into the world of the living when someone says his name thrice. Keaton makes him out to be the awful creature he is, but you're definitely left wanting him more on screen anyway."Beetlejuice" has an amusing way of walking the line between supernatural and real. Burton gives the film a very realistic tone, in part by basing much of the action in the real world but mostly by portraying the Maitlands as normal people coping with being ghosts. The fantastical and bizarre moments are lightening fast and all the more humorous for it. As the Maitlands try initially to scare the Deetzes, suddenly a closet will open and we'll see Davis hanging and ripping her face off, but the Deetzes can't see her. The "aw, shucks" mentality upon failure makes it all the more amusing. Basically, what normally would be used as scare tactics are embraced as opportunities for humor. Burton decides that simply because it's the afterlife doesn't mean the tone has to fit the scary pagan image or the heaven/hell image. A bit into the story already, Baldwin's character asks out in the open, "is this heaven?" and the comment receives no legitimate consideration. For Burton and writers Michael McDowell and Larry Wilson, it's whatever they darn well want it to be.Then there's the random factor. After establishing "Beetlejuice" as a spontaneous and expectation-breaking film, the living characters all break out into Harry Belafonte's "Day O" at the dinner table as part of the Maitlands' plan. The unforgettable scene has no rhyme or reason, something would likely fail in most other films, but Burton sets the tone so well for "Beetlejuice" that we embrace the random musical outburst.The pervasive strangeness of "Beetlejuice" and its inability to stick to any kind of sensible or effective plot structure for its short running time make the story itself so-so. It's the tone of "Beetlejuice" and the memorable scenes and images it creates that makes Burton's first significant directing achievement a classic.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Biopics have become so commonplace today that they often lack the prestige they carried 10-20 years ago. So when one stands out, it deserves an extra bit of recognition and praise, and "The Imitation Game" is one such film, commanded by a fascinating performance from Benedict Cumberbatch.The "Sherlock" and "Star Trek: Into Darkness" star plays mathematician Alan Turing, the wrongfully disgraced father of the modern day computer and a war hero, the extent of which remained classified until the '90s. Turing was a total genius and a recluse, whom many theorize may have had some degree of Asperger's syndrome. However, his reputation was marred most for being a convicted homosexual, as private sexual acts between men were deemed criminal in England until the late '60s.Turing shares many traits with the character that shot Cumberbatch to fame, Sherlock Holmes, another savant-like character devoid of social manners who puts work ahead of relationships. The difference, however, is the BBC series employs those quirks for kicks, whereas "The Imitation Game" is a thoughtfully constructed portrait of a deeply misunderstood individual.Although the film opens with Turing's arrest in 1951, it uses this to frame the core of the story  Turing's work for British Intelligence during World War II, when he helped crack the German Enigma code and swing the balance of the war into the Allies' favor. It also flashes back to Turing's schoolboy days, which help to explain more of his behavior during his time at Bletchley trying to build a machine to decrypt the Enigma messages.The beautiful thing about Cumberbatch's performance is that it's multi-dimensional  we see Turing's social struggles, his genius, his unlikable qualities and his tenderness. His performance generates a powerful empathy and understanding of who Turing was and how he struggled through the world and his life. These characteristics live in balance, without any exaggeration. Neither his social "quirks" nor his sexuality define this portrayal, yet they are crucial to it.Cumberbatch might be the primary focus, but he doesn't tower over the supporting cast, which includes strong performances from Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Charles Dance ("Game of Thrones") and especially Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, Turing's closest friend whose intelligence in ways dwarfed his own. Joan could've easily been reduced to very little, but Knightley gets good stuff to work with and as always, she brings strength and independence to her character.Still, the film's crowning achievement is Cumberbatch's performance, though much credit for his success in the role belongs to rookie screenwriter Graham Moore, who carefully selects the moments that best encompass Turing's multi-faceted identity and ultimately help us to understand him. And of course director Morten Tyldum deserves props for really giving Cumberbatch the time and space to thrive."The Imitation Game" is also rather impressively paced for a biopic. At two hours long, it rarely drags, nicely interweaving the 1951 arrest story line with the main code-breaking plot and the flashbacks. Perhaps this credit belongs to the fact that Tyldum ("Headhunters") established himself as a director by making thrillers and editor William Goldenberg ("Argo," "Zero Dark Thirty") has made his career on similarly suspenseful films.The only place "Imitation Game" seems to trip up a bit is thematically. Its notions of humans vs. machines as it relates to Turing are a little bold and don't quite land the way Moore intends, but the portrayal of Turing has enough emotional resonance to carry the film from simply being very good and missing something to excellent.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

The one thing that always made the "Planet of the Apes" a bit campy was actors in make up and monkey suits. So in one instance, here's where technology, specifically the use motion- capture technology as seen in "Avatar," can almost single-handedly justify revisiting an old franchise. But the apes of "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" don't just look amazing  they have souls. So does this script, which delivers one of the summer's biggest surprises in terms of pure entertainment and depth of storytelling.Unlike the "Transformers" franchise, where giant steel-crushing robots have gotten lost in inane plots driven by pointless human characters, "Rise" keeps the primates as an almost exclusive focus. Somewhere close to the midpoint, humans even take a back seat to the captivating ape-centered story arcs crafted by writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver. Not only do apes most definitely rise in this movie, but they also do so with clear tremendous purpose. The story of how a potential cure for Alzheimer's went out of control couldn't be more crystal clear, as is the reasoning that inspires an ape named Caesar to incite a rebellion.James Franco plays scientist Will Rodman, who's experimenting with his Alzheimer's cure on apes. His most recent tests show incredible cognitive abilities in one ape and so he makes a presentation to the company's board asking for permission to test the drug on humans. Things go wrong during the presentation, however, when the ape goes, well  ape  and on display for the whole lab. The apes are ordered to be put down and Franco's entire operation gets shut down.However, the trial ape had been hiding a newborn baby. Will secretly takes it home where his father (John Lithgow) suffers from Alzheimer's. Turns out the chimp, which his father names Caesar, inherited the cognitive abilities of the drug through its mother. As Caesar grows and exhibits tremendous mental growth (including helping Will land an otherwise pointless girlfriend in Freida Pinto), Will desperately tests the drug on his father and suddenly he has hope for the project to continue.This origin story plays out for most of the film, but Caesar ends up becoming the focus. Although he says nothing, he generates incredible sympathy through consummate mo-cap actor Andy Serkis (Gollum in "The Lord of the Rings"). Add to that the burgeoning scientific moral dilemma and "Rise" builds quite the captivating story. The turning points for Caesar that result in and arise from his inhumane captivity all wield the impact that pivotal moments should carry in all films. Despite a story that originated almost 45 years ago, the script lays this perfect and scientifically reasonable foundation for the "Planet of the Apes" we already know. The only thing that feels like a reach is the speed with which the apes develop certain tactical abilities once they all receive the drug.Director Rupert Wyatt definitely understands the script handed to him as he provides the appropriate magnitude to these effective plot points and knows how to create mouth-agape moments. When Oyewolo's character arrives at the lab cafeteria to find a bunch of tables overturned, Wyatt pans up to reveal he's surrounded by apes. There's no reason to think they weren't there waiting for him, but we're caught off guard just long enough to know he better make a run for it. Those are the "glory shots" that make a true blockbuster.Much of the action used to promote the movie comes in the film's final act, which uses all the slowly building tension from scenes showing cruelty toward the apes in the second act to fuel the fire. With such strong motivation accumulated during these first two chunks of the film, the action doesn't have to be that explosive or visceral in order to be effective. Apes tearing humans limb for limb would have certainly made for a more interesting film to say the least, but "Rise" manages to get away with the tamer action due to all the powerful setup and Wyatt provokes some imagination-inspired gore. In addition, the fact that the apes just knock people unconscious serves the script's efforts to show how  just like humans  some apes are violent and evil in nature while some are sympathetic and merciful. The film expertly muddles our perception of who to root for in this sense.Considering prequels inherently risk their quality on the fact that we know the end result, it's impressive that "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" maintains our interest consistently throughout. The ending does leave something to be desired because it ends just as the battle between apes and humans seems to be going somewhere, but even though I'm not sure what would happen (or what the title would be for that matter), if the sequel picks up right where this left off  count me in.~Steven C
If you didn't know that "21" was based on the true story of a handful of MIT students taking Vegas for millions by counting cards in blackjack, you'd have no idea. Not that it's not plausible, but the movie plays out so melodramatically, so predictably Hollywood, that it strips the story told in Ben Mezrich's book "Bringin' Down the House" of its uniqueness, its potential to show what happens when young aspiring college students get caught up in the other-worldly glitz and glamor of Las Vegas. "21" chooses to go for style points, moving quickly through a basic plot line simply to deliver what it thinks is slick entertainment. It keeps your attention, but it's amateur-ish in its delivery."21" focuses on the specific story of Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess of "Across the Universe"), a genius MIT student whose one dream is to attend Harvard Medical School and his only obstacle is money. When his professor Micky Rosa (Spacey) discovers his mathematical genius, he enlists his help as a "business partner" training him to join his team of blackjack card-counting students who take weekend trips to Vegas to make bank.Ben is initially very resistant to the idea, saying a definitive no to a very tempting Kate Bosworth. Naturally, he has a change of heart, but the film lets out that it doesn't really care about its characters when we see no motivation for the change. We could assume the money is too hard to pass up, but we really don't know. The characters merely go through all the motions, same with the relationship that eventually buds between Bosworth's character Jill and Ben.The movie follows this basic nobody prodigy discovers a hidden talent and rides the waves of fortune until he becomes cocky and thickheaded and trouble starts. Not that you expect anything different, but that's really all it is. Pepper that with flashy gambling shots and montages of living it up in Las Vegas and that's your movie. There are several scenes that seem so forced or dialog that seems unnecessary that you have to laugh at it. It's just not something you can take too seriously. All this just detracts from the interesting storytelling possibilities that the concept offers.All the same, you root for Ben anyway, you want to know what happens and you feel reasonably entertained. Despite director Robert Luketic ("Legally Blonde") choosing a lot of poor, overdone techniques, "21" is paced well and keeps your attention. The only difference is that you don't care what happens, you just want to know.There's nothing clever, smooth or edgy about "21" though it just seems to come off that way. You're usually a step ahead of what's going on, so there's no way you can be dazzled by the story. It's the thrill of Vegas and winning big that keeps us tagging along with the story.
Rob Marshall knows how to direct a musical for the big screen. We learned that after his vision for "Chicago" earned a the big prize at the Academy Awards. That set the stakes high for "Nine," the movie based on a musical based on a movie: "8 1/2" by Federico Fellini. If that weren't enough, the film assembles one of the most decorated female ensembles in cinema history: seven women, five who have won Oscars, one who was nominated and one who has a Grammy. Then there's Oscar-winning lead male Daniel Day-Lewis. But while the amount of talent is flooring, the film is not."Nine" possesses fantastic production values. As mentioned, Marshall knows what he's doing as far as using a variety of angles, editing them nicely and creating mood from lighting and color. Each musical number takes place on the studio set where famed Italian director Guido Contini (Day-Lewis) is expected to shoot his next film, even though he has no idea what it's about and hasn't written a word of it. As he searches his head and personal relationships for inspiration, they manifest themselves on stage in some form or another. At least that's how "Nine" is supposed to work: it doesn't always. When Contini takes a call from his mistress Carla, played with fantastic dramatic range by Penelope Cruz, he imagines her provocative dance as she whispers similar words to him over the phone. That's the seamless blend that Marshall's known for conducting. Other numbers are random interruptions punctuated by unmemorable songs. It would be one thing if each number came from Contini's imagination and helped us sympathize with his character, to whom we feel pretty indifferent, but not all do. Some, such as the emotional songs sung by Marion Cotillard as Luisa, Guido's estranged wife, are strong ("Take It All," which was written for the movie directly, is one of the few memorables), but they come from Luisa's mind, not his. Much deserved praise has been given to Cotillard for her role, but the credit goes to the writing for skimping out on its lead and making her character easier to sympathize with.Day-Lewis is not bad or unlikable and we certainly understand his character's torment despite its abstract nature, but this understanding is more explicit than implicit. Day-Lewis is an actor of numerous strengths, but expressing complex emotion while singing is not one of them. Missing these opportunities to drum up audience support hurts his character despite the solid character portrait he creates.The are few other highlights revolving around the other phenomenal talents in the film. Judi Dench performs well as Guido's costume designer and psychiatrist of sorts, even holding her own in her musical number. Nicole Kidman and Kate Hudson are peripheral to most intriguing parts of the story and hence feel like a waste despite how their characters are intended to influence Guido's character. Hudson singing "Cinema Italiano," the other number written for the film stands out like a sore thumb. It would make a great Madonna video, but that's it. The timeless Sophia Loren is also pointless as Guido's deceased mother because, well, he ought to have some unresolved mommy issues to explain his problems.Other than Cotillard's numbers, the best of the film is by far Fergie singing "Be Italian" as Saraghina, the prostitute whom Guido and his friends at a young age would pay to dance for them -- Guido's first sexual memory. The song is catchy and the way the sand from the beach in the memory makes its way onto the stage for the "production number" is highly original. That said, I'm not sure the lyrics had anything to do with anything."Nine" is all visual production and talent; the story and the way it works with the musical numbers and the way those numbers work with the characters is shoddy more times than not, which was what made "Chicago" such a successful adaptation. Perhaps with a few less songs or none at all, "Nine" would have been impressive on talent alone, but that would not have been Marshall's forte. As such, we have numerous appreciable elements in what amounts to an okay film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Every so many years, a fantastic dystopian science-fiction film comes around that barely anyone hears about, yet the few who see it spread the gospel and eventually it becomes a cult hit. "Children of Men" and "Equilibrium" are a couple that come to mind. This year's vastly underrated entry sure to develop a following is "Snowpiercer" from Korean director Joon Ho Bong ("The Host").Based conceptually on the French graphic novel "Le Transperceneige," the human survivors of a failed global warming experiment that left the world frozen over are all aboard the Snowpiercer, a train that perpetually circles the globe. The story is set 17 years into the train's journey. Curtis (Chris Evans), who has been on the train since he was 17, is ready to lead the passengers in the back cars, who live in horrid conditions, in revolt. Their plan is to traverse the entirety of the train to the front, where train creator, Mr. Wilford stays with his beloved engine keeping their society running and therefore keep "everything in its place."Revolution is a clichéd yet foundational component of dystopian stories, but containing it all on a train with this video game-like plot of heading from car to car is ingeniously entertaining. In many ways, Bong marries the rich, thematic style of American and English science-fiction with this level-by-level approach of foreign action movies. On one hand, you have John Hurt playing the grandfather of the revolution and spouting thematic wisdom to Curtis, and on the other you have a scene in which the lower class does battle with masked, axe-wielding train guards. (This fight sequence, by the way, is easily the year's most exciting and memorable.)This juxtaposition of Eastern and Western styles even trickles down to the characters. Instrumental to the rebels' success is a man in the prison car named Minsoo (Kang-ho Song), a junkie who knows how to open all the gates to all the cars, whose daughter Yona (Ah-sung Ko) has a sort of clairvoyance and knows what awaits behind each door. So you have these Western heroes in Evans and Jamie Bell, who partner with these characters who are both played by Koreans and are typical of characters in Korean action movies, and they rely on each other to make the story move forward.The wild card of all these characters is Tilda Swinton's Mason, the front of the train's voice to the back of the train. Her character goes from epitomizing the evil of this dystopian autocracy to something else entirely; she's like an even quirkier version of Elizabeth Banks' Effie Trinket in "The Hunger Games" series. Other casting choices including Oscar winner Octavia Spencer as a woman in the back whose son is taken from her at the onset of the film and Alison Pill in a cameo as a propaganda-spouting teacher show just how diverse and entertaining the movie is.The division of classes gives Bong a lot to work with artistically. The beginning of the film is full of grays and browns with the occasional bright color when someone from the front of the train comes to the back. As they make their way forward and discover train cars that include an aquarium, a garden and a classroom, Bong opens the color palette up to drive home the class discrepancy that fuels the story from an emotional standpoint.Like any good Dystopian film, Bong and co-writer Kelly Masterson ("Before the Devil Knows You're Dead") have loaded the movie with all the great hallmarks of the genre including tons of ideas about humanity. Other than the train, however, there's no one aspect of the movie that wasn't inspired by something else or could be considered similar to another film or novel. Yet the train acts as fresh packaging in so many ways, enhancing the presentation as to make everything feel exciting and new, even though it borrows from several time-tested tropes.Thrilling, entertaining and thought-provoking from caboose to engine, "Snowpiercer" caters to all your expectations of the genre and feeds them through a streamlined plot that, like the titular train and its precious engine, never stops moving. Excitement and anticipation strike at the opening of each and every gate as to what lies behind it, especially the last one, where we know Wilford himself and the answers to all our questions await, including the classic notion of "what will our hero do once he knows the truth?" And the best part may be that once you've seen "Snowpiercer," you get to recommend it to all your friends.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more!
As a movie-lover, I had to see what all the fuss was about, so I watched "Twilight" despite minimal knowledge of Stephenie Meyer's books. I didn't like it, but felt it could be done better, so with Catherine Hardwicke switched out for Chris Weitz, I decided to see if the franchise could back-up its hundreds of millions in revenue earned from "The Twilight Saga: New Moon." Weitz improves the action, but the romance is maybe even worse and the story still all over the place.For one thing "New Moon" is a long three-parter for a romance-centered story. To its advantage, you come in with knowledge of the characters, but the movie begins with a lack of momentous conflict. Edward (Pattinson), our vampire, tells Bella (Stewart) he's leaving because she's "not good for him," aka he's a vampire somehow she's gonna pay for that. As this happens we're slapped with Romeo & Juliet references, which for tweens is effective symbolism/analogy usage, but not for anyone over the age of 16.Weitz could have cut 15 minutes at least from "New Moon" by virtue of erasing the pauses between lines of romance dialogue. If Edward and Bella spoke to each other like normal people do and without this weird attempt to understate the melodramatic tension through emotional sucker punch lines such as " ...(pause)...you're not good for me," then "New Moon" could go under the two-hour mark and manage to feel like one film instead of three.When Edward leaves we're treated to indie-music montages of time passing and Bella being depressed and seeing blurred visions of Edward everywhere and wanting a "rush" because she's so completely devastated by his choice. It's too much internalized conflict for the beginning of a film. The franchise's constant, writer Melissa Rosenberg, probably had to fight over book loyalty or drawing out parts that would make the movie flow better -- not an enviable position, but either way "New Moon" is structurally terrible.The middle act is then Bella's budding relationship with Jacob (Taylor Lautner), her washboard abs Native American friend who also has his secrets: he's a werewolf. Poor Bella, she always attracts the late 19th/early 20th Century literary monsters. At least at this point the action starts to pick up when Bella realizes she's being hunted by the bad vampires from the last movie and werewolf Jacob tries to protect her. The movie lets go of the romance for about 45 minutes which is a breath of fresh air.But before all is done the story rockets back to Edward and fast-forwards at lightning pace through the final act that takes Bella on a plane ride to see the Vampire leaders, the Volturi. It's the dessert we have to cram down before we get kicked out of the restaurant because we've sat down for too long. "New Moon" really is a three-course meal that has one or two good items but regardless, lacks anything tying it all together as a "meal" until the final five minutes.Most importantly, Weitz manages not to do one thing Hardwicke did in "Twilight": make me laugh at the movie. I didn't find anything so cheesy that I rolled my eyes and that, as a total outsider to the Twilight books and Twi-hard fandom and such, is a huge victory in my opinion. The action, while abusive of slow-motion, at least has a sense of style, though certainly more budget flexibility existed with "New Moon."A lot more work would need to be done to give the Twilight Saga a film it could hang its hat on critically speaking, but money talks louder in this case, so what does Summit care? I still think there's a good movie in this franchise somewhere, but guessing about the books and knowing what Rosenberg has done adapting them, anything more than tolerable would be a surprise.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
There's very little gutsier film-making than creating an animated war documentary. Israeli filmmaker Ari Folman's genre blend is exactly what makes "Waltz with Bashir" a stand-out film, one made with every intention of frightening producers in concept and spitting in Hollywood's face with its quality. The challenge of every war film is to illuminate a repetitive genre and "Bashir" does exactly that almost by approach alone.The film is best described as a narrative documentary told in the first person. Folman, who served in the Israel army during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, interviews friends and others who shared his same experience in hopes to jog his memory, images from his experience that he's subconsciously erased from his mind. It begins by addressing the fine line between memories and dreams, fiction and reality and evolves into a story of war's horrorsThe animation is a technique called animatics, where live action footage is shot in a studio to provide sound and an image for the artists to work with, then the artists animate these scenes and use computers to add in Flash techniques. It's a rough animation style but its infused with beauty from the computer, namely light and smoke techniques that go beyond traditional animation. "Bashir" has an allure all its own despite the tough story it tells.So why this technique? Folman's answer might just have been to be different, but the reality is it forces you to observe with a different perspective. Animating tragic events jades us to the horrors, allows us to ignore them. Contrast that to the perspectives of the people telling their war stories and suddenly we can sympathize with their own fragile memories, the reason so many soldiers stood idly as Christian Phalangists brutally massacred Palestinians in their own refugee camps no less.The use of Flash allows for some really interesting sequences in the film that depict these memories. Its supposed to be about the young soldier's perspective of war and so rock music and this '80s music video style at times contrasts other scenes showing what war was really like with the idealistic painting of 'cool' that some soldiers thought they were walking into. With every Israeli having to serve in the army, this is about coping regardless of one's opinion of war.Other than its insights into the war-torn memory, "Bashir" is a pretty standard exposure of war. What makes it special is there's no glorifying of war -- not even a single character who believes it to be that way -- and its one-of-a-kind medium. It's important to blur the boundaries of films when its appropriate and this revisiting of war proved to be one such setting.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
The mere title "The Game" suggests a sort of fabrication for our entertainment, and that is precisely what this film does. From the first cue to the final fade out, "The Game" is created for the sole purpose of giving its plot-sniffing audience something to mull over and over again amidst a series of 180-degree twists and turns. It is the very pinpoint definition of the thriller genre. Other films mix thriller with drama or action/adventure, but "The Game" provides neither of these to any real extent and instead opts to be the finest example of exploiting an audience's love for the guessing game."The Game" is entertaining. Michael Douglas gets all dressed up for us Gordon Gekko style again and tries to unravel a dangerous real life mystery that envelops him after agreeing to an unusual birthday present from his brother (Sean Penn). From the moment we hear about the game we're completely hooked on trying to figure out what it is. It's a film that knows it has us right in its grasp the entire time and it fully exploits this fact -- we will not stop watching until we have the answers.The irony here is that this game is created for the person, in this case Douglas' character, and for the audience, this movie is tailored much the same way. That might seem clever, but unless the biggest "try to figure it out" puzzle is all you hope for in film -- no serious character development, resolved subplots, flawless logic -- then truth is "The Game" is a bit insulting.Writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris show a serious lack of respect for their audience. Sure, some people who watch this movie will forgive their sins because excessive plot twists excite them more than anything in cinema, but many watchers will feel insulted. Without getting into spoiler detail, "The Game" is riddled with plot holes and begs of you to suspend your disbelief out of sheer desire to figure out what's going on. Brancato and Ferris expect us to neglect our interest in the film's characters and in meaningful storytelling for some fancy plot writing. They underestimate us. They only haphazardly answer all the questions raised in the film, thinking we'll be happy if we just learn the truth behind it all.Few films will hold your attention and curiosity from start to finish like "The Game," but any hope that there's more in it for you than amusement would be best discarded before viewing. This is a thriller movie and everyone making it, even the excellent director David Fincher ("Se7en"), knows it.
The quality of a corruption-themed political thriller with a star-studded cast always comes down to one thing  the script. Mark Wahlberg, Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Barry Pepper, Kyle Chandler and Jeffrey Wright definitely qualify "Broken City" for that category of film, and so all eyes are on rookie screenwriter Brian Tucker.Billy Taggart (Wahlberg) is a New York City police detective acquitted of killing a man who got off on a rape and murder charge. The mayor (Crowe) and commissioner (Wright) know a bit more, however, and require Taggart to step down. Seven years later, Taggart is a private investigator owed a lot of money that he hasn't seen, so when the mayor comes calling weeks before election day and asks him to find out who his wife is sleeping with, he quickly agrees. But when he completes the job he finds he's been double-crossed and set up as an accomplice to murder.The plot is most definitely neo-noir, but the direction of Allen Hughes (one half of the Hughes brothers, the duo behind "The Book of Eli" and "From Hell") provides it with none of that style or class. But visual flare becomes irrelevant when your audience is too preoccupied with making sense of a convoluted plot. Tucker weaves an intriguing network of deception that keeps you from trusting any character in the movie, including even Taggart, but there are too many pieces, including barely introduced characters, that comprise the hidden truth in the story. Consequently, the film relies on heavy- handed dialogue and formula way more often that it should. Tucker tries to make it so every component of the film connects in some way, yet to do so he falls back on clichés. A lot of the dialogue is also steered toward set-ups for sharp one-liners. These veteran actors know how to work lines of this contrived nature, but because the rest of this film doesn't do its job, these quotes elicit chuckles more than satisfied smirks.Of all the talents, Crowe gives the film's best performance as the shadowy Nick Hostetler, who despite preferring to keep his own hands clean, comes off as though at any moment he might roll his sleeves up and punish someone. Considering the trailer casts him as the bad guy, it's impressive that you'll like him for as much of the run time as you do. The script attempts to paint Taggart as a complex main character of moral ambiguity, but he just sort of drifts in and out of likability instead. Few actors do the "man on a mission" better than Wahlberg does, but Taggart is saddled with a penchant for violence that crops up sporadically and he's also a recovering alcoholic. And that's in addition to his past transgressions.The conflict plays over a mayoral race between Hostetler and Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), which gets a lot of play despite factoring minimally into the main narrative. It's part of the many cogs necessary to make the plot function, but it mostly results in the spouting of political rhetoric that just makes the story all the murkier. "Broken City" works reasonably well in individual pieces and scenes, but as part of the master plan, they're drawn together almost haphazardly, with some crucial details cutting across the screen in the blink of an eye. Even so, the resolution all comes down to some really simple and even cliché plot devices. There are no late twists or revelations that really turn the tide; the biggest one gets nullified almost instantly.Any film can flash some big names and load up on reputable faces, but in this genre, script is king. Hughes is practically invisible as a director, so Tucker's work is exposed all the more. Some strong acting really bolsters the film's strengths, but it only goes as high as the structure it's built upon, and that structure has enough kinks that "Broken City" only delivers marginal satisfaction.~Steven CThanks for reading!

What is the distance between fame and obscurity? "20 Feet from Stardom" filmmaker Morgan Neville not only shines a spotlight on the world of backup singers, but in doing so, also uncovers the mysterious set of laws that seem to dictate fame in our world.Darlene Love, Merry Clayton and countless others whose famous voices have received little to no recognition until now, share their stories of working in the music industry and the hard work and talent that it takes to harmonize and blend one's voice beautifully and seamlessly in the background to complement a soloist. Although the backup singer has become a rarity in today's digital music world, backup vocals were a staple in countless songs that changed music and rock 'n roll forever.First of all, "20 Feet" gives you an incredible appreciation for this work, and the talent of these (mostly black, female) voices. Their body of work is astounding, and the appreciation of the big-name performing artists who provide testimonials in the film is clear. They understand how backup vocals fill out a track and take it to the next level. In fact, the more you see and the more enamored you become with the film's subjects, the more you begin to wonder why they never became stars themselves? We they too complacent? Were they too willing to check their egos? Do they even have egos? Does the music industry completely control who becomes a star, regardless of talent? The film peels back the curtain a bit on fame and allows you to examine it through a different lens.As you'd hope in a film about music, "20 Feet" uses editing to its advantage, creating a lot of moods and emotional moments. The storytelling structure also sets up these big questions, exposing us to the history of backup singers and these women's talent and then slipping in kernels of new and in some cases revelatory information or moments with the subjects that further complicate the ideas of fame, etc."20 Feet" has an easy, entertaining subject matter, but it does more than bring you inside the world of backup singers and impress you with the "untold" side of rock 'n roll music. There's something intellectual underlying this film, something that reveals some fundamental truths about our world and our society that elevates from the pack of soft-hitting entertainment industry documentaries.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Looking at the whole of the Marvel universe, Thor would have to be the black sheep. For one thing, he's the Norse god of thunder. His world  the realm of Asgard  is completely foreign to us, as is most Norse mythology. Greek mythology, maybe, but definitely not Norse. As for the hero himself, similar to Superman, he possesses inherent power and immortality and wields as brute an arrogance as his mighty hammer. In other words: hard to identify with and hard to like. Yet under Kenneth Branagh's direction, the worlds of magical legend and that of the contemporary superhero manage to find a common ground through humor and relatable themes of familial conflict. Channeled through Chris Hemsworth's bravado and highly aware performance, "Thor" manages to stand tall as a hero's journey among all else, a trait that serves as its saving grace.Bouncing back and forth between Asgard and modern day New Mexico, "Thor" tells the story of how the young arrogant king-to-be of Asgard reignited a long-ended war between his people and the evil Frost Giants and was therefore banished to Earth by his father Odin (Hopkins). Now a mortal on Earth, Thor seeks to reclaim his power and the throne with the help of an astro-physicist (Portman), while his younger brother Loki (Hiddleston) plans to secure his own place as ruler.Thor's personal quest as well as the conflict between him, his father and Loki provide the film's true lifeblood. The three give the film's best performances, and though familial treachery rates far from original storytelling, there's a reason these Shakespearean plots have been around forever. Hiddleston thrives here as the story's most complex character, which is a title more often given to someone other than the villain in a superhero film. His transformation from untrustworthy worm to full-on bad guy feels complete thanks to the way Hiddleston seizes every moment of screen time.But that doesn't mean he overshadows our golden-maned hero. Hemsworth shows a definitive comfort as a leading man, happily commanding the attention that ought to be demanded of an actor playing a god. It helps that he's 20 different kinds of jacked and therefore physically appropriate for the role, but he shows surprising depth. In the Jotunheim (Frost Giants' planet) sequence, the one that gets Thor in trouble with Dad, he infuses a childish innocence into his untempered pride, and we become more apt to root for his predestined change of character rather than despise his arrogance. Although the writers give him one too many shouts of "Noooo!" during the film, he makes it convincing, especially when he comes to the realization that he simply cannot take back his hammer, Mjolnir, or his powers through simple use of force.Speaking of force, Hemsworth makes the grade as an ass-kicker without a doubt, yet the action sequences leave a bit of something to be desired in terms of excitement and creativity. But while Branagh might not be a student of action filmmaking, he never loses sight of what's at stake. The writers have ensured that the action sequences feel necessary rather than like needless fluff; the tension of the story keeps the fights engaging and Branagh retains focus on the characters involved.The element of the script that will divide opinion the most will likely be its humor. Kat Dennings' character carries the brunt of the comic relief as Darcy, an intern for Portman's Jane Foster and Stellan Skarsgård's Erik Selvig. Sometimes it goes a bit too far, but I would almost label her as crucial: she helps keep "Thor" from getting too serious to be taken seriously. "Thor" contains a lot of talk about magic, science and rainbow bridges; it helps to have a character that takes all of it lightly and also breaks the rhythm of what would be an all-too-typical "girl meets boy fallen from the sky" love story between Jane and Thor.At the same time, Hemsworth ends up being the funniest of anyone. He doesn't even flinch as he proclaims his enjoyment of a cup of coffee and smashes the mug on the floor demanding another. He doesn't play it up for laughs or try and act confused by why it's not acceptable behavior: he lets it be part of who he is. Branagh and the script also do a nice job using humor to break the awkwardness that occurs when the Warriors Three and Sif (Asgard's best fighters) come to Earth looking for Thor. Their extravagant costumes look simply awful out of the context and set design of Asgard that one of the film's pivotal action sequences that follows would've lost all sense of credibility without some self-aware humor. Considering the potential for "Thor" to be a laughingstock in this manner, it's actually impressive how well Branagh, cast and crew handled the clash of fantasy and reality. The only significant chunk of the film that didn't quite hit was the love story. Despite being excellent in the role, Portman had no reason to take the part of Jane Foster. She's criminally underused in the film and rather one-dimensional. She cares about her life's work and is smitten with Thor. Their scenes together are nice, but hardly serve to up the stakes when Thor returns to Asgard for the final showdown. My curiosity for a "Thor" sequel definitely hinges more so on wanting to see Asgard and its realms more fully realized than wanting to know whether Thor and Jane can keep their flame alive despite being worlds apart.But no matter how many misfires you can find in certain aspects of the film, its devotion to its core conflict and character arcs helps make everything more entertaining. The plot of "Thor" remains simple and pure; a lesson in humility that few summer blockbusters are ever willing to learn.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The second of a handful of planned city-themed vignette films about love, "New York, I Love You" aims to capture a city, its diverse population and theoretically how its people love. In 10 segments with some small transitional scenes, 10 directors attempt to capture a piece of the Big Apple -- but the operative word here is "attempt." Some do, some don't and all the stuff that tries to blend them together is confusing. It's very good for the most part individually, but "New York, I Love You" comes up flat on the whole.Unlike its predecessor, the slightly more well-received "Paris, Je t'aime," "New York" attempts to blur the divisions between its vignettes. "Paris" was made mostly of scenes set up with title cards telling you the name of the segment and the director and it just moved through them. "New York" puts in these wasted transition scenes that borrow characters from different scenes and mix and match them together in attempt to show some sort of interconnectedness when you don't feel that way watching the film.The notable thing about a majority of the segments was a lack of intimacy. For being a film that's supposed to capture love and love of a city, there were too many vignettes about casual encounters, flirtation, forced relations, things of that nature. They were focused on clever twist endings, not creating portraits. Those that did were the standouts.Shekhar Kapur's "Hotel Suite" is the high point in terms of artistry in the film. Although mysterious and a bit unsatisfying at the end, it provokes the most from the viewer with some gorgeous imagery and an insight into what the city means to people from one interesting perspective. Julie Christie plays who appears to be a former New York singer staying in an old hotel she used to visit realizing her dreams are long since past and Shia LaBeouf is the young attendant working there. This segment captures a bit of what New York City used to be, remembers that it has a history, which most of these segments don't.Yvan Attal's segment is also worth mentioning as the film's funniest scene. In it, Ethan Hawke comically tries to hit on a woman smoking outside who he lights up, explaining how he could sexually please her in ways she probably never imagined. It's worth stopping to mention that smoke breaks are a big part of this film too, which is odd, in my opinion. Anyway, he clearly makes a heck of an effort to land this girl only it ends with a twist. Hilarious scene, but no sense of the city and of love other than a man's vain attempts to bed a woman. It would also work better if it were not the only segment focusing on the casual side of romance.You would also figure New York would play a big part in this film, but it feels more like backdrop. You just don't get a sense of New York other than its diversity and penchant for promiscuity. Diversity is a crucial element that I'm glad was accented, but missing is the glitz, the glam the feel of NYC that anything's possible. Buying the rights to use "New York, New York" might have helped even. Other than one little bit I liked in Brett Ratner's segment where his protagonist, played by Anton Yelchin, says of all the square feet of Central Park and the thousands of method actresses, that his profound moment occurred at a convergence of the two, there's no sense that a great number of these stories could only happen in New York.There's something to like about every little scene of "New York, I Love You," but it just doesn't add up to the effect your looking for, or merely celebrate the individual shorts as they are like "Paris, Je t'aime." I still like the overall concept of these films, only the pieces didn't fit together all that well for the New York stop on the journey, a shame considering the power of that city.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
For a movie called "Bullitt," this Steve McQueen vehicle is awfully slower than you'd expect. Peter Yates has crafted something that feels more like an espionage thriller than the story of a cop playing by his own rules. I tend most often to rue having expectations when they deal with pacing; when you're in the mood for something to be fast or you want it to be fast, it can be a drain. Same thing for vice-versa, though not nearly as much. "Bullitt" grinds, and any grinder needs to be tense, which "Bullitt" manages inconsistently.At the same time, Yates gives us plenty to champion, as does McQueen. The on-location shooting, a trend that grew in the '60s, makes the imagery memorable for certain. The film takes place exclusively in San Francisco (outside of an opening credit scene in Chicago (though filmed in San Francisco)) and it makes a world of difference. The best scene is a car chase through the city's famously steep streets, which you have to believe was a blast for McQueen to film.McQueen stars as Lt. Frank Bullitt, a man highly regarded for his work, and as such he's tasked by a wealthy politician named Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) to safeguard a man named Ross. Ross will be testifying against the mob, and as such he's a hot target. When the protection gets compromised and things go awry, Bullitt must clean up the mess, but not at the discretion of Chalmers or his superiors. As another great Frank said, he'll do it his way.All the action sequences in "Bullitt" are chases. Chases in the hospital, chases in cars, chases in an airport. Some striking violence pops up throughout, which proves effective enough given the scarcity and the lack of hesitancy toward showing blood. I can't recall a film older than this that had more graphic violence.The absence of effective scoring is the most glaring weakness of Yates' decision-making. Despite having Lalo Schifrin at his disposal, the man whose eight-note riff for "Mission: Impossible" will live in infamy, the biggest scenes play to background noise, such as the roar of a car engine for nearly 10 minutes. It subdues the tone and suggests the desire to be taken more seriously. It's counter to everything that went on in the '60s, but it shows a great deal of artistic integrity.McQueen certainly feels that way based on his performance. Bullitt is a colorless fellow, which would make fellow San Franciscan Dirty Harry Callahan, who would emerge just three years later, the Fourth of July. Although cast in a similar mold, these two couldn't be further apart. McQueen opts for a certain grit, leaving any sense of showmanship behind. Like the rest of the film, you have to respect the choice."Bullitt" feels like a film out of its time. Its lone Oscar win for Best Film Editing demonstrates a recognition of the technical prowess on display, but considering this was the James Bond decade  the era of fast cars, fast women and fast jazz flute solos  the excitement and entertainment factor is missing. In a post-"French Connection" (1971) world, it would probably fair better, but the expectation for a little excitement, some expert pacing, holds it back.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Doubt is the antithesis of faith, which is the foremost idea upon which the Catholic Church stands. A fitting title, then, for a drama surrounding scandal in a Catholic school. But it's also fitting because doubt is also a concept, a feeling and the story of "Doubt" plays on these feelings, it's richness lying in depth of character and morally ambiguous themes. It's tendency to annoy the audience is more fitting for the patience of theatre-goers, hence why it was a Tony award-winning play previously, but as a film it shines through its top-notch cast and takes on a relatively new spirit.John Patrick Shanley, author of the four-person play, took on the task of adapting his work for the screen and even going so far as to direct it. Shanley's experience writing for film, namely his Academy Award-winning script for 1987's "Moonstruck," proves essential to the success of this endeavor. Unlike many playwrights adapting their own work, Shanley opens his mind and is able to expand "Doubt" for a cast including children and many more nuns. Although he could have found ways to use this bigger portrait of Catholic school life to expound deeper meaning unto his story, it's enough to stimulate the shorter attention span of movie audiences and serves this award-winning dialogue quite well.Set in a Catholic school in the Bronx is 1964, "Doubt" begins with a portrait of three characters: Father Flynn (Hoffman), a loving friend and father figure as the only male in the school; Sister Aloysius (Streep) the strict and deeply convicted principal of the school and Sister James (Adams) the quiet and naive 8th grade teacher. When Sister James notices something strange with one boy, the only black child in the school who's been particularly close with Father Flynn, she tells Sister Aloysius, who believes despite no proof that something inappropriate is happening and vows to unearth the truth.Without much else happening, these characters are essential to the welfare of the film. Therefore, what better hands than Hoffman, Adams and especially Ms. Oscar herself, Streep? Whether playing characters of moral certainty or emotional doubt, they are all excellent. Viola Davis as the boy's mother also brings incredible emotion to a very critical turn in the film, so much so that she actually manages to upstage Streep -- not an easy feat. Streep gives Sister Aloysius the unflinching character yet also a brittle layer below the surface. Hoffman makes Father Flynn a naturally compassionate figure who despite his newfound beliefs starts to buckle under the microscope of Aloysius. Adams too channels what made her so lovable in "Enchanted" into a character of such impeccable innocence. Most cast lists blow you away because they have six or seven major names attached, but "Doubt" fills flawlessly the only four it has to give."Doubt" is a tough film because it demands of its audience, it wants a multitude of interpretations and cares much less about the insights it provides the audiences than it does the insights the audience discovers on its own. This makes it tough for film, but this cast does it as best as anyone could, probably better. Only Shanley struggles in slight ways. It's not enough to just adapt the play successfully, you have to use the medium to bring more to the story. Shanley helps the story come across beautifully, but he doesn't add -- the metaphors, for example, don't carry the same weight. Still, if you can step away from your own biases and that craving for concrete resolution, it won't be hard to see why "Doubt" is a great title and a great story.
"The Constant Gardener" is a rare romantic thriller, where a love story is actually the driving force behind the plot, which in this case is trying to crack open a giant corporate cover-up. It's not the most sure-handed vehicle for a genre generally riddled with twists and turns and a mystery to be solved, but it definitely offers something different for film-lovers' tastes.Directed by Fernando Meirelles, the man behind the stunning visual drama "City of God," "Gardener" is a mixture of passion and mystery that is brought to life in only a way Meirelles can. His use of light and the way he weaves the film's critical flashbacks in with the present are a golden example of incorporating flashbacks. In the film, British diplomat Justin Quayle (Fiennes) learns that his wife, Tessa (Weisz) was murdered in Kenya. As he seeks answers, we are bombarded with memories of how he and Tessa met and are even let in to some flashbacks that are not part of Justin's memory so that we can begin to understand why this happened to her. As the film progresses, we see that Tessa was on to a giant cover-up by a major pharmaceutical corporation testing a TB drug on Africans.Fiennes and Weisz give equally strong performances. Perhaps mature is the best way to describe both of their careers and their acting styles and it certainly rings true in "Gardener." Weisz in particular continues to remain one of the most underrated in actresses working today. She excellently pulls off the challenge of Tessa, a woman madly in love with her husband but aggressively passionate about certain things enough to the point that she must hide them from him.Unfortunately, Justin's pursuit of the truth and finishing the job Tessa started doesn't always stay the film's focal point. A large amount of time is dedicated to poverty and Kenya and their medical issues. The film is educational from this standpoint, but it doesn't exactly motivate or intrigue. If the film could focus more on eliciting sympathy for Africans, the emotional impact of Tessa's work would be felt, but because the film has to develop the love story, there just isn't time to feel like the serious issue-side of the plot matters equally. In ways, "Gardener" tries to do too much, but it still comes across as beautifully made."Gardener" is a film with a visionary at the helm and two great actors who challenge the genre and make a film that is visually bold and eye-opening. As far as sheer entertainment is concerned, it's not something for mainstream tastes, and its many facets prevent it from leaving a lasting affect.
The rules of time travel in fiction can make your head spin. As a writer, you have to be so meticulous in your vision that all the rules of your universe don't collapse upon each other and bring your entire concept crumbling to the ground. Or, like Rian Johnson does in "Looper," you can be so confident in your story and tell it in such compelling fashion that it doesn't matter if the concept is bulletproof or not."Looper" envisions a future in which time travel has not been invented, but in 30 years it will be, only it's used exclusively by the mob to erase any trace of a hit. Young, impressionable guys in need of work like Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) have been recruited as Loopers to do this dirty work, but even the Loopers must be kept silent in the future, and so they're sent back in time to be killed by their younger selves, which is called "closing your loop." You earn a ton of gold and your freedom for closing your loop, but eventually you'll be sent back in time to be killed by your younger self, hence the loop analogy.Joe keeps his life pretty straight for a Looper. He's stashed part of his earnings so that when he closes his loop he can head to France. At night he goes to the club, drops some eye-drop drug and rendezvouses with a high-end prostitute (Piper Perabo).Suddenly, a lot of the guys are closing their loops, and Joe's confidence is a bit shaken. When he does ultimately see his older self arrive from the future (Bruce Willis), he flinches and lets him get away. He must quickly rectify the situation, or else he'll be killed in order to erase the problem altogether.Time travel, however, is just the tip of the sci-fi iceberg as far as the future world Johnson has built in this film. Genre fans will find themselves highly stimulated by what they see, but at the same time, Johnson elects to slightly upgrade our world instead of give it some futuristic makeover.But more than all that, looking beyond just the vivid context, "Looper" runs on strong characters and an organic sense of urgency. It doesn't get lost in sci-fi dialogue explaining how things work or become so driven by its concept that it detracts from creating believable people.The scene in which both Joes confront each other in a diner captures what Johnson does so well, wrapping what would otherwise be heavy-handed sci-fi exposition into a scene with incredible tension. Although Old Joe gives us a lot of important information, the dominant feeling in the scene has more to do with wondering what it would be like to see yourself either older or younger (depending) staring back at you and knowing that you either need to kill yourself or yourself wants to kill you.In that scene, Old Joe makes clear that he has a specific objective while back in time, so young Joe has to figure out how to stop him with his boss (Jeff Daniels) already on his tail. From there, "Looper" doesn't let up, and not from an action perspective, but in terms of a compelling narrative. Sci fi doesn't get any better when the characters and the story capture as much of your attention as the shiny environment they're placed, especially when you don't even realize it.What's so unique about the way "Looper" uses the time travel device is in two portrayals of the same character. Both versions of Joe feel like completely different people, almost to the point where you have trouble believing they're the same guy, but it just goes to show how much of a difference life experience (years upon years) can make in a person's beliefs and motivations.With proper material, Gordon-Levitt and Willis excel in their roles. JGL nails Willis' speech patterns, but more impressively he gets at the essence of the veteran's famed talent: bringing a sense of vulnerability to a hardened exterior  the sensitive tough guy. Willis too, thanks to the way his character is written, performs better here than in most of his recent films.The outstanding Emily Blunt also deserves credit for her performance, though to explain her would spoil too much of the story's novelty. Gone is the elegant, hilarious Blunt we've mostly seen to this point; Sara is a bold, resilient and headstrong woman who also happens to be extremely lonely, which adds needed complexity. The only weaker point of the script that can't be contributed to either nitpicking the details of the sci-fi framework or how people get conveniently gun-shy, is how Joe completely changes as a person over the course of just a couple short days. At first jaded and completely self- interested, he develops incredible empathy for someone enduring the chaotic life trauma of being both wanted dead and needing to kill your older self.Even though the film's pacing is terrific and Johnson makes the most of every scene, something's missing in the second half that prevents us from staying on the same page with Joe beat for beat. Perhaps, however, it's not what the film doesn't provide, but rather that we're too overstimulated by all the excitement going on to follow along with the film at the more personal, emotional level  until the end, that is.So much of the original science fiction we get today relies so heavily on its gimmick, but "Looper" feels like an action crime thriller that instead uses time travel as a device to add complexity. Johnson has crafted a story in which humans would respond to things as humans do, and he uses the sci-fi elements to enhance this, not drive it. It's why "Looper" will be looked at as a sci-fi gem for a long time to come.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
Fast cars and comedy have never really gone hand in hand. Movies such as the "Fast and Furious" franchise have always been about the cars, with the jokes mostly sticking to characters digging at each other and one-liners. "Hit and Run," on the other hand, is all about the humor  with a side of car porn."Hit and Run" serves predominantly as a showcase for the comedic style of its creator, actor Dax Shepard. Shepard's filmmaking debut, "Brother's Justice," which he also co-directed with partner David Palmer in 2010, went silently, but here he's convinced his fiancée, Kristen Bell, to co-star and snagged another A-lister in Bradley Cooper to elevate the film's profile.The humor in "Hit and Run" can best be described as awkward. It's a lot like "Seinfeld" and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" in the way it constantly steps back to let the characters verbally break down the event, action or tension that just happened or is happening on screen, only Shepard is less concerned with social taboos and all the characters of "Hit and Run" are a little mentally off in one way or another outside of the central couple.Shepard plays Charlie Bronson, only that's not his real name. He lives somewhere in hard-to- find California because he's in Witness Protection after testifying against some bank robbers a few years back. Since then he's started a new life and a serious romance with Annie (Bell), who doesn't know much about his past. When Annie gets an incredible and nearly shoo-in dream job opportunity in Los Angeles  the city Charlie must specifically stay away from  he decides to risk taking her there.Setting it all in motion is a small contrivance: Annie needs to bring her teaching certificate, which she left in a photo album at her ex-boyfriend, Gil's (Michael Rosenbaum), house. Gil is still obsessed with Annie and convinced Charlie's a rapist of some kind because of his shrouded past. Ultimately, he discovers Charlie's real identity and in hopes of getting Annie back, contacts the very people Charlie must hide from, including Alexander Dmitri, a dreadlocked Cooper with an attitude problem.It takes some time for all this to build, during which we're treated to a lot of weirdness. Tom Arnold plays Randy, the incompetent U.S. marshal assigned to protect Charlie who must then take off after him when he leaves town, and to call him a klutz would be a gross understatement. He's a running punch line in the film, which is fitting because Arnold is sort of a running punch line, but as you're waiting for the tension to ratchet up in the movie, he's frustratingly flattening it.The slow first half of the film will immediately disappoint anyone looking for something high octane with lots of speeding cars and action. There's plenty of spinning out, chasing and wrecks, plus peeks under the hood for bona fide car nerds, but this isn't an action movie.Eventually, Shepard's style finds its groove in the chaos of Randy, Gil and Charlie's old gang chasing after him. The characters arguing over trivialities, namely calling each other out on the dumb (and typically violent) stuff they do, works better in contrast with tension and suspense because it becomes less predictable. Before the story really gets going, the humor feels forced and anecdotal because we're just waiting for Alexander to find out about Charlie and go after him. The script in this sense could've used a veteran writer's assistance to help the plot hit the ground running. Admirably, the core of the story is way these events test the romance between Charlie and Annie. Shepard and Bell's real-life chemistry is apparent on screen and the slow beginning includes plenty of legwork to make them people you want to root for. When Annie finally learns exactly who Charlie was and freaks out over it, the two have a very legitimate and believable argument and we yearn for that problem to be resolved, even if the other characters and elements of the film are too borderline psychotic for things to end up any way but happy or in complete ruin.With the number of oddball supporting characters, random violence, car porn and plenty of meta-talk about relationships, the overall tone of "Hit and Run" is ironic. The soundtrack is probably the best example, as it includes Lou Rawls' recording of "Pure Imagination" from "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" during a car chase sequence, and the film ends with "Let My Love Open the Door," which has no place in a film unless you're trying to be cheesy on purpose."Hit and Run" could be a stepping stone to something bigger and better from Shepard, who might find more success if he took his brand to television or simply found a way to keep the energy up in future films so that the jokes will hit harder. In the meantime, "Hit and Run" avoids being total late-August junk, even if most will discover it down the road as a surprisingly decent rental.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
Martin Scorsese's second collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio is "The Aviator," a nearly three-hour biopic examining about a thirty-year window in the life of airline and movie mogul Howard Hughes, whose successes in aviation and Hollywood romances made him shine in the public eye despite the bankrupting methods and slowly growing obsessive compulsions that tore at his private life.Despite the length, Scorsese uses his brilliant talents to show how compulsion began to eat away at Hughes. To be honest, Hughes' story is nothing unbelievable or inspirational. When one decides to do a biopic, it's normally because the figure is compelling in a way audiences have never seen -- but that's not Hughes. His story is not so much what he did but the manner in which he did it, so Scorsese deserves a lot of the credit for keeping "Aviator" a compelling biography.Scorsese brings what could constitute as horror movie technique to illustrate Hughes' OCD. For one thing, OCD is not a vocal part of this film. It's never mentioned aloud except when a few characters describe Hughes as "eccentric." Scorsese is solely responsible for our understanding of Hughes' condition. The way hands are shown moving slowly and elegantly in the film, the way Scorsese holds on a close-up of red meat -- we get what's going on in Hughes' head.The blast of light from old-time flashbulbs and the crunching of glass, the way different characters' start to speak over each other -- we easily identify with Hughes' discomfort. Some help from Robert Richardson's stunning color palettes and unusual but striking lighting effects certainly helped.On the other side of the coin, the "continue to spend money to be ahead of the curve" slogan motivating Hughes' inventing beginning with making "Hell's Angels" the most expensive movie ever made (at the time) highlights the difference between him and ourselves. Nobody logically would have dared to do the things Hughes did, but he had the money and the drive to do it, constantly forcing his business manager (John C. Reilly, in the movie's first scene) to take care of the technicalities and to make it work regardless of what it took. The fact that Hughes kept going despite OCD and making debilitating choices is what makes him a great biographical figure.Parts of "Aviator," while a big part of his life, don't seem to add to this core vision Scorsese and writer John Logan ("Gladiator," "The Last Samurai") paints of who Hughes was. His playboy persona adds another mysterious dimension to his character, but as great as Cate Blanchett (Katherine Hepburn) and Kate Beckinsale (Ava Gardner) are in this film, their subplots don't fit as well considering how much else is going on. In summary, Hughes needed them as maternal figures in a way, but couldn't offer them anything substantial as far as love and affection. As interesting as that is to note, notice that it doesn't exactly influence Hughes' ceaseless drive to make the best planes in the world.As Alan Alda's character Sen. Brewster enters the picture and attacks the image of Hughes that we grew accustomed to in the first chunk of the film, calling him a criminal for using military tax dollars and never having anything to show for it, we start to see Hughes' legacy. One could call Hughes a number of things, but not a liar or a crook. His flaws were in his ambition, not his core self. In 170 minutes he never once smokes a cigarette or drinks liquor -- you won't find that from a protagonist in a 1920-1947 period biopic in any other film. Coincidentally, the ambition of this film to fire off that message for its entire duration is its only real fault. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
How is John Carney the only filmmaker who knows how to make a contemporary musical? The "Once" filmmaker recaptures some of that film's magic in "Begin Again," a more mainstream approach for a wider American audience. With a team of terrific songwriters and a top-notch cast, "Begin Again" is a welcome reminder of why and how much we love music. Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo star as a singer/songwriter and indie music producer, respectively, who both meet one night after the worst day of their lives. Ruffalo's Dan is an alcoholic separated from his wife who gets fired from the music label he built and Knightley's Gretta was just dumped by her rising music star boyfriend, Dave (Adam Levine). Dan is convinced Gretta's the one who can turn his fortunes around, and the two take a chance on each other and endeavor on a recording project that defies traditional music industry practice.So much of "Begin Again" rides on the music. The primary trio of writers, Gregg Alexander (lead singer of The New Radicals), Danielle Brisebois (writer of Natasha Bedingfield hits "Unwritten" and "Pocketful of Sunshine") and Nick Lashley craft accessible but definitively indie acoustic pop tracks that create both moments of emotional introspection and total feel-good vibes throughout the film. It's the soundtrack that really allows the film to soak in and become so easy to enjoy.That's why Carney's story works a little better than expected. The relationship that evolves between Dan and Gretta is a little strange and awkward, but both characters start at the bottom of the barrel and undergo personal redemption as they continue to collaborate; the music proves to have a transformative effect on their lives. Carney is fascinated with the way music impacts those who make it, and how it can literally change people's feelings and influence their actions. It's this reason that he also understands the role music plays in a film, that a film and a story can become something more in a symbiotic relationship with the music rather than a relationship in which one is clearly second to the other and merely complements it.Ruffalo and Knightley are also the right kind of performers to help achieve the synthesis of story and song. They bring such soul to their roles. Ruffalo's strength has always been hard to pinpoint, but in "Begin Again," authenticity emerges as his strong suit. Dan is deeply troubled, but also hopeful and intensely passionate. Ruffalo helps ground the movie with his performance, bringing something raw and dramatic to a film that could've been a breezy musical romance in the wrong hands. Knightley too is terrifically cast. Gretta is a true artist repulsed by fame, who loves music in just the purest way a person can. If she were too much of a flashy Hollywood actress, her character wouldn't have been as credible.That's a stark contrast to Levine, who in his film debut plays the antithesis to Gretta, a man too swept up in the fame and spectacle of performing that he loses sight of (what Carney believes to be) the truth of music. As a the writer of radio hit pop songs with little substance and a TV personality, Levine's superficial persona (as soulful of a guy as he might truly be) helps create the dichotomy of the music industry as Carney sees it. A Cee Lo Green cameo also has a similar effect, though in his character's case, he helps to fill out Dan's back story. So these music stars do more than simply pad the cast in order to drum up interest in the movie."Begin Again" has a lot to say about music and the industry; Carney does not separate his beliefs from the story. The music is truly the main character and the antagonist is anyone who tries to manipulate it from it's most authentic form: the raw, earnest expression of human emotion. This belief dictates a quite a bit of the story and ultimately what happens in the film. Carney's not the kind of filmmaker who will simply wrap things up in that cheesy escapist romantic comedy way. So those looking for total musical Hollywood bliss might not totally understand "Begin Again," but for the artists, music-lovers and creative types, it's a thoughtful film that's almost impossible not lap up.~Steven CThanks for reading!

James Cameron is a storied director whose films have been landmarks of their time. Like he did in the '80s and '90s with both Terminator films, he returns from his 10-year hiatus without missing a beat, shepherding audiences into the future of cinema with progressive film-making done with the most advanced technology. "Avatar" is a miraculous visual feat, the greatest epic since "The Lord of the Rings" and a film-making milestone unlike any other. At the conclusion of a decade, it's a window into what audiences of the future can expect at the movies.There really is no film "Avatar" can be compared to other than "Star Wars" because of the science-fiction originality. The world of Pandora and Na'vi all come from Cameron's head as did the Star Wars universe from that of George Lucas. Although "Star Wars" is a much wider and complex universe, "Avatar's" world is still incredibly imaginative and awesome. Spectacle is "Avatar's" greatest asset and Cameron utilizes it completely, bringing our attention to all the tightest details. The multitude of creatures inhabiting Pandora and the remarkably life- like Na'vi captivate almost entirely on looks alone.The story of "Avatar" uses classic archetypes that while not entirely original best serve the purposes of the film. Jake Sully (up-and-coming Aussie Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic ex-marine given a second chance by filling in for his brother on an operation on the planet Pandora. He becomes part of the Avatar program, which allows humans to enter artificially created Na'vi (the humanoid blue cat-like natives) versions of themselves. Sully's mission is to get to better know the Na'vi and their culture from the inside, but Col. Quatrich (Stephen Lang) convinces him to divulge intel should the Na'vi not be willing to abandon their home so the humans can force their way to a rare and valuable resource called unobtainium located there.Naturally, Jake gets very close to the Na'vi tribe, who teaches him the Na'vi way of life. He becomes attached to their "princess" Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) who takes him through rites of passage, explaining how the Na'vi are connected with the planet and all living things on it in the figurative and literal sense. We're introduced to a world unlike anything we've seen before. Predictably, the Na'vi and humans are destined for a fatal showdown and Jake's change of heart will make him the controversial key to its end.Cameron's script is very socially driven. Using terms like "fighting terror with terror" and "shock and awe," it's blatantly critical of America and completely unforgiving of the human race. You'll come out of "Avatar" thinking how awful we are and how Cameron assigns us no redeeming qualities other than the few characters that decide the oppression of the Na'vi is wrong. It does, however, effectively sway our emotions. The most riveting concept in the film is that although Jake becomes "one of them," his actual self is in a machine and any tampering with it brings him back to his handicapped human self. In this way "Avatar" is one- of-a-kind in terms of story.In classic Cameron fashion, "Avatar" is incredibly long, but with the motion-capture CGI and 3D (and you must see it 3D to experience the scope), it's completely justified. Parts do drag and feel unrealistic or excessive at times, but the sheer magnitude of the movie and its visual prowess are plenty of an excuse to go a tad over-the-top.Some other impressive food-for-thought about this movie is how humans are not only the enemy but they're not integral to the film. Never before has a live-action movie not needed to rely on human characters. The motion-capture and the subtle human qualities of Na'vi are good enough to carry the film. Other producers might've sought to counter that with big- name actors, but Cameron (like in his other films) refuses. This insanely expensive project not only benefited from saving that cash, but is testament to Cameron's storytelling ability."Avatar" is simply an experience -- a ground-breaking and truly miraculous endeavor from the mind of cinema's most forward-thinking filmmaker. It's one of those rare achievements where flaws are so easily forgiven because of sheer innovation and imagination. See this film and experience a new dawn in movie history.~Steven CVisit my site at moviemusereviews.com
Unlike any film in history, "The Pink Panther" left its legacy not by its original sense of humor or iconic performance by Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, but by an animated pink panther and instantly recognizable theme music by Henry Mancini. Anyone born after 1980 knew of "The PInk Panther" at a young age, but had no idea about the film that started it all, only the cool pink cat and that groovy jazz. Truth bet told, these trademarks still leave the finest impression, but the film does have its own merits, namely in Sellers and a few iconic scenes."The Pink Panther" does not actually focus on Clouseau's character as the legacy has left myself and the younger generations to believe. Sellers steals the movie (which in fact makes its climax rather awkward), but the plot focuses on a jewel thief named Sir Charles Lytton (David Niven) who is after the Pink Panther diamond from a princess (Claudia Cardinale). His mistress and accomplice is Clouseau's wife (Capucina) and at a ski resort they attempt to get close to the princess and her diamond, with Mrs. Clouseau resorting to her womanly wiles to distract her husband and Sir Charles' young nephew George (Robert Wagner).This story takes quite some time to get going and frankly the film is a laugh-less bore for about 45 minutes. Sellers hasn't quite gotten enough screen time to get into his slapstick groove going and the plot is all setup to this point. Then the farce truly begins, predominantly with the bedroom scene in which Mrs. Clouseau hides Charles and George in her room after her wacky husband comes home.It's a fact that the film was never intended to center on Clouseau, but when he was stealing his scenes, veteran director Blake Edwards should have made some adjustments or taken his liberties as co-writer of the script to favor Sellers a bit more. Our focus as viewers never hones in on any one character. As hard as we try to hone in on Clouseau, it doesn't work because the story does not favor him.As a comedy, the last hour redeems the snore-inducing first act with some terrific scenes like when two thieves find themselves in identical gorilla suits and the "getaway" scene with Clouseau and his men chasing after the thieves and everyone essentially going around in circles. It's classic humor from the last decade of the 20th Century in which this type of humor was still considered in style.But what lingers on after the film ends? Henry Mancini and our animated panther friend. Maybe those elements are not the best part of this film, but they're responsible for the many follow ups and reincarnations of the series over the last 45-plus years.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
There are countless ways to interpret a comic series for the big screen, not including story. "The Losers" could've been done as a straight-up action film about a team of black ops soldiers getting revenge on the man who left them for dead, but director Sylvain White opts to honor the source material with an equally slick production. Although it fattens the film up with action movie clichés, it gels with the tone of the script and the carefree romp that is "The Losers." More importantly, it passes fun action movie rule number one: acknowledge your film is nothing more than a fun action movie.Just like the A-Team or any other group of specially trained individuals featured in TV or the movies, each member of The Losers has his own area of expertise. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays Clay, the leader, Columbus Short as Pooch the large/explosive weapons specialist, Idris Elba as Roque the I honestly can't remember, Chris Evans as Jensen the techie with an awkward sense of humor and Oscar Jaenada as Cougar the sniper. Together, when a mysterious walkie-talkie voice named "Max" messes up their pre-opening credits mission and shoots down the helicopter they were supposed to be on, they go under the radar (aka everyone thinks they're dead).That's when they meet Zoe Saldana as Aisha, the beautiful but deadly woman that offers them a chance to get back in the United States and to find "Max." Hardly trusting her but left with few other choices, they agree. The story jumps from city to city and mission to mission without much set-up time in between. We also get a firsthand look at who Max is and that he's looking to purchase some new-age sonic weapons called "snukes.""The Losers" plays out like a video game. Each scene follows a formula consisting of mission debriefing and/or scene where the characters argue over whether the mission is the right thing to do and then we go straight to the mission to watch the characters in action. There are a few scenes with Clay and Aisha, one being the only time hand-to-hand combat appears in the film (which is too bad, the scene looked and felt cool) and then there are some jumps over to the way Max crosses just about every man he works with. The film approaches him as some heartless classic television villain with an excessive sense of humor.The script keeps its wit about it, which is to say it wants to be funny and hardly is. Evans carries a lot of that weight as Jensen. His portrayal is thorough, but the character has some really bad writing behind him. Max is supremely unfunny, though it does work as a portrayal of a classic fictional villain.The pacing and cleverness of most of the action scenes makes "Losers" a good time. It would've been nice if not every big sequence ended in a poorly done CGI explosion (only a couple explosions appeared to be real stunt work) but the creative intent behind it was generally solid. The film and especially its script cuts a lot of corners, but respected writers Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt know exactly what they can't afford to cut if the film and its main characters are to stay relevant and though White is no master, he adds some respectable machismo and visual prowess to what's left.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
James Wan must feel like he's got something to prove. The filmmaker has had success more than once ("Saw" and "Insidious") in a horror genre that has been obnoxiously stagnant in recent years (everything is either a haunted house or exorcism film). "The Conjuring" is both, so more of the same for Wan.There's almost nothing original about "The Conjuring." We're talking spot-the-cliché drinking game unoriginal. So it begs the question: did Wan want to prove he could make a great horror film from overused genre hallmarks, or does he just have no interest in innovative filmmaking? Probably a little of both.The one unique angle of "The Conjuring" comes in the form of two non-fictional protagonists. Ed and Lorraine Warren are two paranormal investigators/demonologists who claim to have investigated upwards of 10,000 hauntings from the '50s to the '80s. They are most known for investigating the famous "Amityville horror" case that inspired two film versions (and frankly, "The Conjuring" is almost like a third).Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga star as the Warrens, who are brought in to investigate disturbances in the new Rhode Island country home of the Perron family. Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston)and their five girls have experienced a number of phenomena (moving doors, rotting flesh smell, a little ghost boy who's befriended the youngest daughter, etc.), and the Warrens can tell immediately when they enter that something particularly bad is here.Like any effective horror film, the build-up is painfully slow so that your mind moves into darker places than the film is going for the first half hour or so. All the occurrences happen predominantly at 3:07 in the morning, so the film cycles between day and night scenes in a way that'll drive you mad in the way that it teases a reprieve but that goes straight back into someone following a suspicious noise behind a door or under the bed.The scares of the film escalate too, from suspense techniques meant to elicit anxious anticipation of bigger scares to all-out fantastical mayhem, including a gruesome exorcism. It does so with a good measure of tact, but "The Conjuring" could have played the mystery angle longer than it does in order to earn some more points.One of the absolute standouts is Farmiga's performance as Lorraine, who is among the best characters I can ever recall in a genre horror film. A clairvoyant, she easily sees demon spirits and can sense what's going on. Farmiga gives Lorraine so much grace and courage that we clearly sense she is a woman who has seen a lot. At the same time, she gets frightened when we expect her to as well. She has some a subplot involving a traumatic past experience and her relationship to her daughter, but the film leaves us hanging by not finishing those arcs, presumably in a cocky "save it for the sequel" way.A scenario in which some people are completely unimpressed by "The Conjouring" while others consider it great seems a likely outcome. The market is stale for new horror ideas, while studios making horror films understand that familiarity gets people into the theater. So those looking for something novel won't find it, but those who want the tropes of the genre will be more than pleased.Wan in particular knows all the tropes, and better than anyone, he milks them for all of their worth. He does so with incredible technical prowess, but more importantly, the ability to understand the audience's instincts -- what they're thinking and expecting.For fans who know exactly what Wan offers them, consider "The Conjuring" on par with "Insidious," only a little more cliché and with a more intriguing mystery.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

Try as it might, "Die Hard 2" is not quite what "Die Hard" was. The original casted an enormous shadow as a consummate action situation film and while "Die Hard 2" seems to fit that mold on premise, some key elements that made the first film so good manage to slip out of this one.Like the first film, "Die Hard 2" takes place in one night as a group of terrorists take over Dulles airport's communications system in order to help a drug lord flee the country. As a result, it keeps inbound planes in a holding pattern that if held too long, will result in disaster. What the terrorists don't know, is that Holly McClane is on one of the planes, the wife of Lieutennant John "I'll take matters into my own hands thank you" McClane (Bruce Willis).McClane is in the wrong place at the wrong time yet again, but he handles it remarkably better this time, seeing as he's done this kind of thing before. While he still talks to himself in the movie, one of his character's signatures, and he's motivated by love for his wife once again, there's something different about this mishap. Last time, McClane was trapped; his fear was fully realized by the audience. He had no one to communicate with and had to rely entirely on himself. He spends way too much time in this film bickering with D.C. airport police (led by Dennis Franz) and befriending odd airport employees. There's a lot more negotiating and planning--not doing. Even when things are blowing up and guns are being fired, director Renny Harlin, who takes the reigns from a hard to replace John McTiernan, doesn't do much with it. The action is not particularly exciting."Die Hard 2" also fails in its antagonist. The group of terrorists have no strong leader, no Alan Rickman from the first film to pose any formidable threat. They give you very little reason to believe that McClane won't succeed. While we know the good guys will win out in these kinds of films, the better movies will always test your assurance to some extent and this movie doesn't. The suspense is just not the same. Lastly, the concept is just not as impressive. While airports and terrorists generally work well together, in this movie the plot has no real magnitude. Considering the film was put right into production after the success of the first film, it would seem that they weren't too picky or worried about the concept behind the sequel: they just wanted to churn it out. Sure, fans of the original will enjoy watching John McClane's latest exercise in terrorist-shooting, curse-shouting fun, but connoisseurs of great action movies will be largely unstirred by it.
"Crank" is a high-octane concept movie that busts out of the gate and never stops. Unlike most adrenaline-junkie action films, however, "Crank" justifies its juiced-up rip-roaring wackiness because the movie is actually about someone who needs to keep his adrenaline up in order to live. Not many other "action porn" movies can say they have such a luxury -- or excuse. "Crank" does fly off the handle a bit under Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor's surreal and frenzied direction, but it's a pretty entertaining 90-minute joy ride.Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is a hit-man who wakes up to find an angry rival has injected him with "synthetic Chinese ****" that will kill him over the course of time. In his mad pursuit of vengeance, he discovers that keeping his adrenaline up is the only way to stay alive. Good thing, because otherwise there'd be no reason for the drug use, excessive violence or public fornication in this movie. Without that, you're looking at maybe the opening five minutes and that's it.Safe to say, this is a guy's movie. If you're a woman, you should probably avoid it. All the women are objects in this movie save Amy Smart as Chev's girlfriend and even she's supposed to be comically ignorant. The only idea/thought she contributes to this movie is to perform vehicular fellatio on her boyfriend during a high-speed chase. Neveldine and Taylor do a great job creating the sense of an adrenaline rush in their film. It's not merely all the violent content and chases that make it exciting, but the speed of the takes and the variety of angles and techniques. The editing is fantastic. Early on in "Crank," when the film is at its best and really milking its breakneck premise, there's a scene where Chev busts into a gas station mini-mart and stocks up on energy powder and drinks. There's footage that follows him around handy-cam style and then there's mock security cam footage of it too. Cut together it not only looks good but gets across that frenetic style they're going for. There's a lot of interesting divided screen work here too.All is great in "Crank" until the second act overdose. After one notable scene in Chinatown between Chev and his girlfriend, everything is pretty much out of control. Everyone wants to kill everyone and Chev has run all over the place by this point. The audience is pretty much out of breath and the Chinatown scene is the film's not-too-literal climax of Neveldine and Taylor's attempt to blend action and hilarity.The mark of a testosterone and adrenaline-driven film is always the amount of unnecessary nipples and exposed breasts. None of them are necessary in this film and there's a decent number. But that's entertainment, just in liquid form inside a tall aluminum can that says "Friggin' Awesome" on the label. The lengths this film will go to make you think "awesome" or laugh at the outrageousness are great. "Crank" is a big bucket of greasy man-ness and you indulge until you've hit the breaking point.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Anyone could make a film about a botched heist job, even tell it out of chronological order, but Quentin Tarantino provides his film "Reservoir Dogs" with certain intangibles that not just anyone can offer. His trademark anecdotal dialogue aside, Tarantino infuses "Reservoir Dogs" with a certain iconicity, a power that creates lasting film memories and inspires stylistically. Even the opening credits sequence, which simply features all the main characters in their black suits and skinny ties walking in slow motion through a parking lot, exudes a kind of swagger that has few rivals.For "Reservoir Dogs," the iconology starts with the characters. All dressed the same but most definitely different, they're initially introduced to us by color code name: Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and Mr. Brown (Tarantino). They've been hired by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son "Nice Guy Eddie" (Chris Penn) to steal a shipment of expensive diamonds, a quick job, but one that requires a large team such as this one.The other key is that we don't see this story from the beginning. We get to see one completely anecdotal lunch scene in which all the guys give Mr. Pink crap because he doesn't tip at restaurants and then after the credit sequence we see part of the aftermath of the heist, which has gone most horribly wrong. Rather than concern ourselves with story, Tarantino creates character portraits through thick amounts of dialogue and lengthy scenes dripping with tension. He takes his time filling us in on the details, but we get them all eventually. This disguises a rather generic plot with a subplot (although it's a bit more than that) that the audience infers from the subtext of the characters. The source of the conflict comes mainly from misters White, Pink and Blonde. As a shot and bleeding-to-death Mr. Orange writhes in pain at a warehouse rendezvous point, White and Pink recall the events of the crime and begin to realize that someone must've informed the police. Enter the calm but ruthless Mr. Blonde, who makes tempers flare even more.If excessive dialogue or drawn-out scenes aren't bookended by major turning points, they're usually blanketed by some kind of tension, such as Mr. Orange lying there freaking out from his wound as Pink and White discuss what to do next. A few flashbacks pull the snowballing momentum out from under the film at times, but they add the necessary depth to actually make us care about these characters.To be clear, Tarantino hasn't executed a great crime thriller or heist film. Instead, he's made these genres into an experimental and violent ball of energy. He's written in scenes that burn images into your head and the swagger  his actors all get it. It's incredible what an "it" factor can do to a film and Tarantino and "Reservoir Dogs" have "it" in no small portions.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
So often the most powerful card in a brooding character study ends up the one never played. The mystery lying behind the on-screen display of social perversion, which in the case of "Martha Marcy May Marlene" comes as a manipulative cult, can drive intense interest just through sheer curiosity as to what possible force in this universe could drive such queer behavior.Our only window to that answer is lead actress Elizabeth Olsen. The younger sister of two twin child stars quickly distances herself as a talent to be reckoned with. She plays a young woman who has successfully run away from a cult in upstate New York and attempts to re- assimilate with her sister (Sarah Paulson) and her husband (Hugh Dancy) in their wealthy Connecticut summer home.Writer/director Sean Durkin constructs some pristine transitions between Martha's present rehabilitation and the key revealing moments of her troubled two years as Marcy May. In doing so he flawlessly conveys her psychological trauma and injects suspense (however temporary) into the narrative.Durkin opts for long takes and minimal camera movement, which provides a sense of authenticity. This might seem counterintuitive, as a "documentary feel" can most often be attributed to shaky-cam, but it allows us to really observe and study Olsen's character (as well as her acting).True to the schizophrenic nature of the title, we get a number of different shades from Olsen's performance. We see her as a sweet young woman, a rebel, afraid, in control, angry, sad all of the above. Then of course there's the stoic, emotionless side that we see plenty of throughout the film. Olsen owns all of these, despite that Martha never undergoes an arc or journey as a character due to the constant flashbacks. Rather it's we the viewer who goes on that journey from uninformed to informed.It's not nearly as transformative a process as Durkin would have us believe, as all along we assume the traumatic nature of Martha's time with Patrick (John Hawkes) and the many young men and women on the farm. The real rub comes from an understanding that their way of life has some convincing sell points, but in methodology it is no less devoid of evil.The intrigue posed by this psychology study drives the tempo, as Durkin stylistically (outside of the transitions) does us no favors in changing the film's pace through dramatic incident until the last 20 minutes or so, and even that has a certain subtlety to it. Still, he demonstrates visual adeptness with a camera and keeps our curiosity active throughout.Although missing the kind of revelation that makes these kinds of dramatic thrillers unforgettable, "Martha Marcy May Marlene" showcases top-notch craftsmanship and a leading performance that rarely fails to captivate. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

The challenge of making a "Green Lantern" film was always going to be bringing it down to Earth. Not necessarily in a planetary sense, but sifting through and boiling down all the intergalactic mythology. Everything from the planet Oa to bird-fish aliens named Tomar-Re to a far-fetched concept of harnessing "will" to defend the universe had to be accounted for. Blending all that into something your typical non-geek audience could stomach had to prove no simple task. The resulting puree is surprisingly digestible but ultimately too bland for most tastes."Green Lantern" is hardly the disaster some have made it out to be, but it does rely heavily on its viewer having an innate interest in the subject and lore at hand. Not unlike Green Lantern's power  the ability to convert what's in the mind into matter  the audience's imagination becomes critical to unlocking the potential of the story. Director Martin Campbell ("Casino Royale") and the creative team have put serious effort into envisioning the sci-fi elements of the film, but they aren't likely to spark anyone but a child's imagination.The approach taken to the film could be described as "paint by numbers" in the sense that the film says and does what it needs to in order to make sense, move along and express the themes of overcoming fear, but the result feels uninspired. "Green Lantern" lacks an "it" factor, something to make the story and characters take root and bring the audience on an emotional journey alongside the intergalactic one."Green Lantern" tells the story of how human Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds), a cocky fighter pilot, gets chosen to become part of the Green Lantern Corps, a group of several thousand peacekeepers and defenders of the universe who harness the power of will to conquer evil. This happens when Abin Sur, a "dying purple alien" as Hal calls him, crash lands on Earth after escaping the clutches of Parallax, a fear-feeding destroyer of worlds in the form of a billowing spirit. Abin Sur's ring chooses Hal, who must learn to embrace his destiny as a Green Lantern despite concerns that he might not be as fearless as he leads on.All that doesn't include Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), an old flame of Hal's who is emerging as the heir to her father's fighter jet industry and Dr. Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard), a scientist living in his father's (Tim Robbins) shadow who becomes infected with part of Parallax while examining the body of Abin Sur.One might say that's sub-plot overload and they would be right, but the film actually paces itself effectively, stays interesting and doesn't fail any of its characters entirely with bad writing or dialogue. The consequences instead show in the film's inability to hook its audience emotionally. We care about Hal, but Reynolds hardly gets any time to truly develop the dimensions of his character because the plot keeps chugging along and bouncing around. His hero's journey never becomes fully realized. It's as if the characters never have time to just be themselves. Although the 105-minute run time seems impressively short at first glance, an extra 15 minutes of character development wouldn't have offended anyone and possibly done wonders. It's not as if the cast is unimpressive  they do well with what they have to work with.Humor also lacks in the film; unexpected for anything starring Reynolds. There are moments when he gets to do his thing, but they come more in ad-lib form than being creatively written into the story. A chief difference between "Green Lantern" and this summer's "Thor," two other-worldly superhero stories, would have to be the degree of self-seriousness. "Thor" had a surprising amount of levity to counter its overbearing mythology, which "Lantern" doesn't have. Yet another difference between what Marvel has done with its properties compared DC.Much like Hal's downfall during his training on Oa with Kilowog and Sinestro (the criminally underused character played by Mark Strong), the film's limit in imagination caps off its potential. All the entertainment value in the world, which "Green Lantern" has in spades, simply can't counter its inability to inspire. You can follow the film with ease, enjoy the unique action sequences without rolling your eyes and genuinely like the characters, but there's no denying something's missing from the finished product to elevate it to level of many of its superhero film contemporaries.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"Wrath of the Titans" really captures the spirit of its 2010 predecessor  that spirit being uninspired and underdeveloped. If the goal was not to work on improving the quality of the sequel, Warner Bros. succeeded.While the action improves in the hands of director Jonathan Liebesman ("Battle: Los Angeles"), the sequences are still equally as contrived and shallow. New writers Dan Mazeau and David Johnson also appear to use the script of "Clash of the Titans" as a bible of some sort for constructing their film, using overly grandiose dialogue much like the first did to convey horribly obvious foreshadowing and to bash us over the head with themes relating to our hero's journey.Even those who did enjoy the first film will find "Wrath's" story to blatantly disregard the events that preceded it. The film takes place several years after "Clash" and we find Perseus (Sam Worthington) has been raising a son he had with Io, who definitely died before giving birth to anything in the first movie. Anyway, Perseus, who the series continues to play as this annoyingly reluctant hero, has determined to live life as a fisherman and ignore his demi-god power. When Zeus (Liam Neeson) comes to Perseus and warns him the gods are losing their immortal power due to humans not praying to them anymore, Perseus tries to push it out of his mind. Then all hell breaks loose, rather literally.Zeus is crossed and captured by his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and son Ares (Edgar Ramirez). The plan is to offer him to their father, the imprisoned titan, Cronos, in exchange for assured immortality. This starts a chain reaction of monsters being unleashed from the Underworld and upon the Earth. The god Poseidon (Danny Huston) charges Perseus with traveling to the Underworld and saving Zeus, though he must arbitrarily seek out some people and things to get there."Wrath" essentially makes up the rules of its Greek mythological world, creating a situation in which gods are mortal yet can't seem to just obliterate each other. It's a grittier portrayal than "Clash," in which the gods wore shiny armor and came off as theatrical, but with the PG-13 rating, they comically slug each other (and humans) with their transforming weapons.Most video games are more exciting and entertaining than "Wrath of the Titans"  and their story lines make more sense too. Although even the dialogue clearly states Perseus must go from Point A to Point B, the story creates all these intentional roadblocks that feel like obligatory stops on the way to the grand finale vs. Cronos rather than points along the journey that develop the story and especially the characters. We meet up with Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) and Agenor (Toby Kebbell) to make things more colorful, not out of necessity. Pike is clearly above this material yet is polite enough to do everything she can to make the dialogue convincing. At one point she passionately pleas that Hephaestus (Bill Nighy) help them enter the prison Tartarus to find Zeus. It would be a nice speech in a film in which anyone cared about what was going on, or was actually convinced Hephaestus might not eventually have a change of heart.Kebbell is meant to provide comic relief as Agenor, son of Poseidon, who is painted as a lazy liar  a Jack Sparrow-type character  yet despite plenty of warnings in the script, never turns on our hero and never appears to pursue his own interests. In terms of the humor, it works in touches here and there, but almost all the jokes in the film completely backfire, especially an awkwardly self-aware reference to Neeson's famed "Clash" line "release the kraken!"Liebesman's on-the-ground, guerilla style works in the first major action scene in which Perseus fights a three-headed, winged take on a chimera, but it doesn't work as well in the more fantastical set pieces that follow. The CGI works well and there's interesting stuff to look at, but it's all meat and no bones. The cyclops fight scene has some great in-your-face qualities, but for some reason Liebesman is fond of really hammering that quality home by having all the monsters drooling on each other or the human characters. Most of the battles are random, especially a scene in the labyrinth of Tartarus in which its unclear whether or not Perseus fights the Minotaur, a beast that resembles Lou Ferrigno with horns. He's dispatched quickly and the quest to find Zeus continues as if nothing happened. Again, like a video game, the fights come off like mini boss battles at best."Wrath of the Titans" mostly comes off as apathetic. Scenes, characters and sequences are rolled in and out without any concern for being convincing, yet the dialogue is written as if all of it has in fact been convincing. In its defense, "Wrath" is a quick and painless exercise, but even its most basic entertainment value can't overcome its absolute purposelessness.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The long overdue final installment of Edgar Wright's "Cornetto Trilogy" that began with "Shaun of the Dead" in 2004 and continued with 2007's "Hot Fuzz" has arrived. "The World's End" is the most ambitious film in the trilogy featuring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and the most creative.Pegg stars as Gary King, who was the coolest cat in all of Newton Haven back in 1991, when he and his four closest friends, Andy (Frost), Steven (Paddy Considine), Oliver (Martin Freeman) and Peter (Eddie Marsan) attempted The Golden Mile, a legendary crawl of 12 pubs culminating in a pint at The World's End. Unable to complete it as young men, 20 years later King is desperate to relive his glory days, so he rounds up the old gang to give the crawl another shot. They soon realize, however, that something is amiss in their old stomping grounds."The World's End" follows the outline of the "Cornetto Trilogy" in that a group of survivors find themselves pitted against hordes of zombies, odd townspeople or  in this case  "blanks." Violence then abounds in comical yet impeccably stylish fashion. What makes "World's End" unique from the previous films is that it doesn't play off a genre as "Shaun" and "Fuzz" and creates its own rules.Another key difference is the relationship between Pegg and Frost's characters. The two play vastly different roles than in the previous films. Pegg turns sharply away from playing the straight-laced character  he's a manipulative, self-obsessed alcoholic living in the past. Frost, on the other hand, is a lawyer and a recovered alcoholic with no tolerance for immaturity. Even though these roles differ from their norm, the dynamic between the actors is still spot on, and their bromance gives the film a pulse.Pegg and Wright have created a brilliant concept. A comedy about friends recreating an epic pub crawl alone wouldn't be enough to sustain an entire film on its own, but the way everything changes when an alien robot conspiracy unfolds is the kicker. Suddenly the dynamic between the five friends, which they build a solid foundation for, shifts into new territory, yet the reveal of said robot alien conspiracy doesn't completely detach the movie from a sense of meaning. "World's End" also sacrifices no style for substance too. Wright's patented quick-cutting closeups add as much suspense to the film as they did in "Shaun" and "Fuzz," and the action scenes utilize more brilliant fight choreography that's just over-the-top enough to avoid being taken too seriously. Clearly, these middle-aged nobodies aren't capable of shattering robot heads with their fists, let alone holding their own in any sort of fight, so this is all for pure entertainment purposes.The only challenge of the film is that the story doesn't lend itself well to good script pacing. A crawl consisting of 12 pubs makes sense in the real world, but that's a lot for a one movie. The lore of this pub crawl that the film really builds up turns out to be a slight letdown. Going into the film, you'd expect reaching The World's End to be a glorious moment, but it's just another stop on the railroad of ridiculous sci-fi carnage that the movie turns into in its final act. As the final chapter in a cult trilogy, "World's End" delivers a good number of easter eggs for "Cornetto" fans, with the more memorable ones being plays on the trilogy's penchant for hedge and fence jumping. The way the film combines the action of a band of friends on the run from masses of mindless creatures and a small-town conspiracy, it's the perfect fusion of "Shaun" and "Fuzz" into the ultimate conclusion.Its ambition gets the better of it at times, but "World's End" is wildly entertaining, a comedy that both honors and borrows from its predecessors yet does plenty to show that Wright, Pegg and Frost didn't just want to follow their proved blueprint for success  they wanted to explore new territory while being faithful to the tone of their prior films. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

Any part-time binge drinker knows that when you end up with a hangover the next day, no matter how much fun you had the night before, you're not going to be dumb enough to mix the same lethal cocktails ever again. "The Hangover Part II" would not be one of those hangovers you brag about the next day. Using the same ingredients with limited "X" factors, "The Hangover Part II" stirs up a familiar and predictable drink. Despite the familiar and comfy cast of characters, what once got America punch-drunk in 2009 will leave very few buzzed the second time around.One can sense a tangible fear of deviating from the formula that brought moviegoers out in droves two summers ago in Todd Phillips follow-up effort. The events that unfold in Bangkok do so with minimal procession and perfunctory malaise, just as you expect them to, building to nothing but the next clue as to what happened the night before.If only the night before were worth uncovering clues about. Visits to a monastery, tattoo parlor and a Thai strip club lay in store as the Wolfpack of Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms) and Alan (Galifianakis) try and find out how they got drugged and lost Teddy, a 16-year-old who happens to be the brother of Stu's bride-to-be and child prodigy of his disapproving father- in-law. Despite antics from a drug-trafficking monkey, the return of Ken Jeong's crass and effeminate Mr. Chow and a barrage of inappropriate inserts from Alan, the laughs are few and far between, with some of the best already having been revealed by the trailers.Normally, comedy sequels' undoing comes from such painstaking desperation to top the antics of the original that the follow-ups come across as blunt and hollow despite the laughs. "The Hangover Part II" plays it the opposite, hoping that by virtue of playing it safe that the lovable characters of the original will win out. In a story following such a rigid formula, however, new elements need to come from left field or the act gets stale quickly. It will not take long into the run time for "Part II" to feel uninspired. Even the character interaction and subplots remain identical to the first: Alan still seeks approval from the others, Stu still freaks out at every new bit of info learned and Phil tries to play it cool. Everything about the sequel feels like retreaded material with an Eastern flair. Redressing a formula can work, but not in a comedy whose predecessor relied so heavily on the element of surprise.The lack of laughs provided for in the writing pins a lot of that responsibility on Galifianakis. Although Alan remains the best of the several characters he's played in the two years since being shot to fame by the original, he takes on the role of comic relief (along with a bit of help from Jeong). He has a 50-50 success rate, but he's kind of left out to dry because Phil and Stu simply aren't funny in this movie.Laughs aside, however, the real killer proves to be the predictability. Phillips gives you at least a 10 second window to figure out what's coming next in almost every key scene. He's almost lazy in trying to conceal the script's few good cards and it weakens the laughs. Also, considering no characters except one have motive, figuring out how they got drugged again a second time takes little to no detective work. That reveal adds no emotional turmoil to the process. Devoid of any substance or creative thinking, the film come across as what it appears on the surface: an attempt to capitalize on the financial success of the original.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Minus the gratuitous male genitalia jokes, "Funny People" is about as far from anything Judd Apatow has directed or produced since he hit it big with "The 40-Year-Old Virgin." Finally collaborating with longtime friend Adam Sandler, Apatow takes the creative license that his reputation as comedic master of the decade has afforded him and makes a more serious film about funny people. But with more seriousness, the funniness must be more effective and that's hard in an unprecedented 146-minute-long comedy just sort of about a comedian's life.Sandler plays himself in the form of a fictional character named George Simmons, a comedian who hit it big, made some ridiculous movies and now is re-evaluating himself in the face of news that he has a rare form of leukemia. Returning to his stand-up roots, he discovers a promising but penniless comedian named Ira (Seth Rogen) living in his friend's (Jason Schwartzman) apartment with his buddy, fellow comedian Leo (Jonah Hill). George pays Ira to write him some jokes and be his assistant, but he's really paying him to keep him company as he tries to right some of the mistakes he made in life.Anyone expecting the laugh fest with a surprising sentimental touch that Apatow delivered in "Virgin" and "Knocked Up" will find that it's more of a full-on sentimental groping. The comedy that we are so accustomed to from the likes of Sandler, Rogen and Hill is either peppered in or concentrated into segments as opposed to the dominating force throughout the film. There's no question this was a personal endeavor for Apatow and Sandler. Considering Apatow's roots in comedy clubs and his best friend and wife (Leslie Mann, who plays "the girl that got away" love interest) playing opposite each other -- not to mention casting his kids, this was sort of a way for Apatow to reflect on what he does for a living. In that sense, "Funny People" holds some promise. No one has really made a film looking at comedy instead of just being one. This film does it and in a very realistic context too, appearing as if it could very well be taking place today in Hollywood.But as its own comedy, "Funny People" just isn't as funny as we'd like. There are a lot of great funny moments, but the humor loses effectiveness because the movie is just strung- together subplots too numerous to name. Simmons finding out he's dying doesn't focus the film, it just sort of plays a role in everything he does and all his relationships and the other sub-relationships of the people around him such as Ira. There's no tension -- even if the early trailers hadn't indeed revealed that he doesn't die. There's no real sense that he's going on any sort of emotional journey with this shocking news or that he's really going to learn something from it."Funny People" has plenty of funny people and they say funny things, but it's a film that's too unfocused to keep anyone's attention for nearly two and a half hours. It almost feels like two films: one about stand-up and the other about a comedian trying to make things right with an old flame. Describing it as one film is much harder. It's a reflection on what it's like to be a comedian fading away and coming to terms with life decisions that doesn't really arrive at any clear answers. Apatow's writing here is just too loose, though his directing is excellent. I definitely believe "Funny People" could have been something special, but we'll never know. ~MMRVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/
"Bad Boys" is a 1990s cop movie. The music, the slow motion, the excessive amount of explosions and the reference to a retired Michael Jordan in 1995 give that away easily. Good films transcend time and a majority of the people that watch "Bad Boys" in the future will not be too impressed with what they see.The movie is in the action genre, but the plot seems focused around the lives of Mike and Marcus (Smith and Lawrence), cop partners with different lives who constantly argue with each other. Basically, what you get is Smith and Lawrence arguing or doing something stupid, action scene, Smith and Lawrence arguing or doing something stupid again, another action scene. It gets redundant and old very fast, especially because the plot is simple (someone stole heroin from the police) and the 'bad boys' or the antagonists are so distant from the film that they seem stupid.Michael Bay deserves credit for establishing himself as the best director when it comes to blowing stuff up. He will forever have that mark on Hollywood and this is where it started, but his interesting action sequences are empty and aimless thanks to a bad cop movie plot.The only thing keeping the entertainment value of "Bad Boys" up is the duo of Smith and Lawrence. While they argue way too much, there are some funny scenes and other scenes in which they come across as very bad ass. Without them, the film would basically be like someone trying to turn Walt Disney World's Indiana Jones stunt spectacular into a movie: there would be nothing interesting worth following and just stuff blowing up to keep people intrigued.
Vampirism seems like a disease in Hollywood these days, so "Daybreakers" will fall immediately go under the lens of skepticism. Believe it or not, however, Michael and Peter Spierig's film separates itself through high concept futuristic science fiction. Although it ultimately spirals into an emotionless bloodbath, kudos to the film-making duo for taking the out-of-control vampire sub-genre somewhere it actually hasn't indeed been before."Daybreakers" hardly falls into the realm of hard science, but it blends the concept of the apocalyptic epidemic with vampire culture well enough for the sake of entertaining science fiction. The film hypothesizes that if in 2019 humanity were to all become vampires (the inevitable outcome of any kind of vampirism epidemic), then humans would become a precious commodity until a human blood substitute could be found, which would cause a myriad of social issues.Like any respectable sci-fi flick ought to, the Spierig brothers carefully establish their vampire-dominated society and some compelling characters within it. Ethan Hawke stars as Edward Dalton, (seriously, what's with naming vampires Edward?) the chief hematologist responsible for finding a long-term blood substitute for Charles Bromley's (Sam Neill) human blood-harvesting company. In fact, "Daybreakers" might have the most intelligently crafted societal context for a film that's ultimate goal is entertainment through blood and mayhem.Edward sympathizes with humans and in a chance meeting, comes across some (led by Claudia Karvan and Willem Defoe) who might hold a key to a solution to the vampire problem.A few subplots try and add some depth to the story and characters, such as Edward's relationship to his brother, a human hunter with a radically different perspective on being a vampire than Edward as well as Bromley's relationship with his daughter, who ran away and insisted on remaining human. Bold these attempts are, but they're counter-productive to the film's main science-fiction thread.Eventually as "Daybreakers" continues (especially in the third act) and its primary objective of entertainment becomes gorily evident, it becomes less compelling and more generally amusing. That's when the Willem Dafoe one-liners such as "we're the guys with the crossbows" remind you that no matter how creative the set-up, the punchline of every vampire gore flick is still the same.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The success of "Sherlock Holmes" in 2009 certainly opened up Warner Bros.' pockets wide enough to give director Guy Ritchie a bit of free reign over the sequel. His choice of what do with that cash, however, didn't have to be as straightforward as it is in "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows." In other words, there are explosions. Lots of slow motion and lots of explosions.Just as the first film was about witty banter and bare-knuckle action, "Game of Shadows" follows suit to an even greater degree. Perhaps it's the inclusion of Holmes' arch nemesis in Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) that would lead one to believe a greater degree of intellectual thought and mystery would be infused into this second outing, but he serves merely to up the stakes as far as what Holmes must overcome to outsmart someone as clever as he."Game of Shadows" is a chaotic action ride that jumps willy-nilly from locale to locale (London, Paris, Germany, Switzerland). It moves so quickly that if you blink you'll miss the reasoning for going from Point A to Point B, even though it hardly matters in the long run. All parts of the mystery are explained/introduced before you can even begin to process them and suddenly we're in the throws of a new action sequence.As far as non-stop entertainment goes, here's a blockbuster that doesn't dawdle, though every so often that wouldn't be such a bad thing. Fans of the traditional Arthur Conan Doyle character who figured for some reason this would be a return to form compared to the 2009 film will be sadly mistaken yet again. There's not much mystery to savor, just the endless pursuit of Moriarty and an attempt to uncover and foil his plans.Stars Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as Holmes and Dr. Watson are as sharp as ever in this new adventure, with Watson getting a bit bigger of a spotlight this time around. His impending marriage helps to further the emotional divide between him and his partner and makes their banter all the more effective.The story, for what little of it matters, involves Holmes' pursuit of his soon-to-be rival, a man he believes responsible for a series of highly political bombings. After Holmes saves a gypsy named Sim (Noomi Rapace) from being one of Moriarty's expenditures and Watson's honeymoon is interrupted by machine-gun fire, they head to Paris to pursue Moriarty, though Holmes knows that his rival has threatened Watson if he does not relent.The new faces in the series, which in addition to Sim and Moriarty includes Stephen Fry as Sherlock's infinitely more logical yet no less quirky brother Mycroft, don't do too much for the film, Sim in particular. Moriarty is the necessary foil for Holmes, the Joker to his Batman to say the least, and Mycroft always ends up being one of those nice change-of-pace characters in the Holmes universe, but Rapace is rather wasted as Sim. She's not a love interest and she just goes along for the ride. Her motivation is typical and uncomplicated, though the same can be said with all the characters, even Moriarty, who though formidable should come across even more menacing than he does.Ritchie turns all the action scenes in "Shadows" into his slow-motion playground. One particular scene involves Holmes, Watson and Sim running through the woods as Germans launch all matter of artillery at them. We get various isolation shots on the characters as they run and inside looks at how the artillery fires, not to mention trees exploding at a snail's pace. Any thought that something other than purely stylish entertainment lies in store dies in this scene.To be fair, however, the final act in Switzerland proves to be the film's best. Here, deduction plays its biggest role as Watson and Sim try to identify a man surgically altered to look like another and Holmes and Moriarty engage in a game of chess in which chess is completely secondary. It's a gripping and fun final scene that captures everything Ritchie's vision of Holmes is about. Although Sherlock's internal thought process breaking down how to attack his adversary flirts with being too much in terms of using that same technique over and over again, the end results of the scene proves to be most intriguing."A Game of Shadows" is infinitely more engaging than stimulating, though certainly to some those qualities are interchangeable, and this second outing for the reinvented Holmes will be a mild affair. With as many sharp and wild turns as the film takes, however, not to mention the exploding that happens around each corner, boring will not likely cross many minds.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Trains, brains and alternate realities comprise "Source Code," the sophomore feature from Duncan Jones, director of 2009′s intellectual sci-fi dish "Moon" starring Sam Rockwell. Jones coaches a similarly terrific actor in Jake Gyllenhaal to another commanding yet heart-filled leading performance. The difference is that "Moon" was contemplative and brooding; "Source Code" moves at thrill-a-minute pace. Both, however, possess that same cerebral quality that wins audiences over.A less elaborate "Inception" might be one way to classify "Source Code," as both share this newly founded sub-sub-genre of carrying out missions in a lifelike non-reality. "Source Code" focuses on Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal), a helicopter pilot in the air force who finds himself inside the titular program, which zaps him into the body of a random passenger aboard a Chicago-bound commuter train that will explode in exactly eight minutes. The passenger has already died in this incident and so has everyone on the train, but as program creator Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) explains, part of the human brain's short-term memory still functions in a window of time after death. The source code recreates that eight-minute long experience. The idea is that Stevens can use those eight minutes to learn information about the crime and prevent future acts of terror; all other objectives are secondary.Rookie writer Ben Ripley's script moves along well enough with Jones' pacing to keep our attention away from holes in the plot and the science and everything you'd expect in a film this preposterous to make "Source Code" a fun and stimulating ride. And although it's seemingly all about brain science, the film displays a surprising amount of heart and a unique perspective on human nature. Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan ooze a certain likability that ups the ante and lets us step back from putting the plot's puzzle pieces together so that we may adore the chemistry and other gooier moments free of guilt.Even Vera Farmiga, who plays the face on the monitor guiding Stevens through the process, becomes a more involved character throughout the film, which offers a nice change of pace compared to similar military characters in these kinds of offerings.The story withholds a frustrating amount of information at the beginning, made all the worse by Stevens begging Farmiga's Goodwin for answers and her continued reluctant denial of them. From the trailers, you also have an idea of what the source code is all about, but not having that confirmation is tantalizing for the first portion of the film. Frustrating, but darn effective. The answers, while not presented in a miraculous twist format are unique and certainly not predictable. Without spoiling anything, I can assure you that there's no source code within a source code.As a Chicago resident, "Source Code" was both cooler and more ridiculous. From what I could piece together, I'm pretty sure this was I usually took when I was a resident of the suburbs. I can't fathom anyone trying to blow it up  it's kind of boring. The whole "who's the terrorist?" element of the plot, however, ranks way behind the film's character-driven objectives. We're supposed to care much more about Stevens' and his experience with the source code, not about the ultimately irrelevant context Ripley concocted to get him there.As such, the film could've taken place anywhere, although Jones takes great joy in turning Chicago's infamous "bean" in Millennium Park into a metaphor for the film. Henceforth, I won't be looking at the bean the same way again. I will also be sure to crawl underneath it on my next visit and decree: "I am in the source code."Even if only coincidence, great pride comes from this thrilling movie being set in my fair city. A gripping original story  no matter the size of the gaping holes in its logic or the terrible CGI used to create its explosion sequences  clearly overrules everything, and this film has the proof. "Source Code" offers a thinker's thriller without the headache, a story geared to sci-fi nerds with a universally appealing message at its core. I suspect some will scoff at its relatively mid-range intellectual level, but from a pure storytelling perspective, "Source Code" does everything right, very much in the same way (but on a smaller scale) that James Cameron's films do. Duncan Jones should now be on everyone's list a director worth keeping tabs on if he can continue to bring high-concept films down to earth.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The challenges awaiting Joe Penhall and John Hillcoat in adapting and directing (respectively) Cormac McCarthy's "The Road" had to be numerous. This post-apocalyptic father-and-son story about whether struggling to survive as long as possible is worth the pain is a bleak tale and one that grinds along much of the time. It doesn't have more than a handful of eventful or visually stimulating scenes. They manage, however, to not only be faithful to McCarthy's elegy, but also add great details to make it into a solid film.For starters, Penhall gives us more context than the novel provides in terms of what's happened to turn the world into a barren place. Fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters have devastated the landscape and although we don't experience what it was exactly that was horrible enough to drive people to kill themselves instead of endure it and drove many to looting and cannibalism, we still understand the gravity of the situation. In this way, "The Road" is more inviting to those who've never read the book and need help suspending disbelief.The script also stays true to the book's structure. The book is a series of brief paintings with candid dialogue between father (Viggo Mortensen) and son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) as they try to survive and reach the southern coast where they won't have to try and last through another brutal winter. The scenes are strung together without any traditional "acts" dividing up the story. The film delivers in this way, but it expands and breaks up this grinding structure with flashbacks/dreams which is helpful for the lesser attention spans of movie watchers.Most additions to the original story are to clarify context and also add emotional impact. The mother (Charlize Theron) is not part of the main story, but she's woven in through dreams and flashbacks. We see her give birth to the son in the midst of this apocalypse and how her regret bringing him into the world clashes with the father's steadfast belief in survival at all costs. We see brief moments of her and the father in love, too, and his character becomes much more emotionally complex. Instead of being just the brave, cunning hero, Mortensen also plays the widower and the emotional mentor to his son. He works all these facets to his character into a truly excellent performance that's believable in every way.Hillcoat tries to add where he can as well, focusing a lot on hands and finding really touching or moving shots that effectively echo McCarthy's narrative snapshots in the book. He also spares no detail. Great credit to the thorough realism in the make-up, props and costumes department; images of dirt caked in all the characters' fingernails linger as does the greasiness of their hair and beards and the dirt on their faces. When father and son find an empty home where they can shower, watching the dirt come off them has far more of an impact than it does in any other film. Wounds are also focused on for shock value -- there's a concerted effort to shake any viewer that might be too complacent and not realize the gravity of the characters' situation.Much of what made McCarthy's story award-winning is captured by this film. There isn't much of an effort to go beyond some of those basic concepts or really hammer them in deep, but on the flip-side it aims for emotional impact, something far more universally appreciated at the movie theater than a deep meditation on human nature or how much it's worth fighting to stay alive with grim chances of dying anything but a painful or reluctant death. Instead of leaving the film with deeper philosophical/ethical questions, we get a touching story of father and son doing anything to stay with each other as long as they can, which is a fair trade off. Ideally we get both, but a job well done considering the challenging nature of the source material.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Many of us can't truly say we know what World War II looked like, but I would venture to say that Steven Spielberg gives us a pretty good idea with "Saving Private Ryan." Spielberg, in his second attempt to capture the WWII era on the big screen, has made a movie that plays out like the telling of a war story and in the combat scenes latching back on to a sense of harsh reality with violence and the death of many soldiers.Worthy of the most praise is the incredibly well-deserved second Oscar win for the team of Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski. The two have done everything together and this is certainly a high point of their partnership. The cinematography really captures a war that is both dark and in the case of D-Day, legendary. Rarely do most films capture a spirit of war that is scary and also beautiful without glorifying the war or its soldiers.Here is wear "Ryan" succeeds as a truly strong war film and probably the best depiction of World War II battle in history. The characters are strong and while they seem to be more like characters when they don't fight, they react like people when they are forced to do their jobs, not like super soldiers with the exception of Barry Pepper's character, but that only makes the film better by rounding out the way different soldiers viewed the war.The themes are incredibly strong thanks to this depiction of violence. The universal idea of fighting for something or obeying orders when you don't understand why is perfectly interpolated by the band of soldiers sent to find Private Ryan and in that way it requires every viewer to forcibly reconcile that which a soldier in any war must do. Those of us who aren't veterans should consider ourselves fortunate to only have to ponder it and not actually come to terms with it.
"The Bank Job" is fun, so much fun that you kinda have to stare awkwardly at its "based on a true story" tagline. Did a bank robbery where the press was blacked out really happen? Was it really set up as a government operation to retrieve critical blackmail photos of Princess Margaret? Speculation aside, "The Bank Job" hardly needs its truth disclaimer. It's a good story taking a different angle on the overdone British heist thriller. Its place in history only makes it the more unique.First of all, don't be worried of about this being just another Jason Statham movie. The Transporter and Crank series star has finally piloted something genuinely creative here. For one thing, the film takes place in the '70s. With that comes a whole different look to the heist movie and no fancy technology either.The story has Statham's character Terry and his band of amateur criminals being offered a unique bank robbery opportunity by an old friend, Martine (Saffron Burrows). What they don't know, is that Martine is doing this to clear her own record and has set them up to a do a job for the government: retrieve incriminating photos of Princess Margaret in the possession of Black Panther Michael X, who's using them to keep himself out of jail. The photos are in a safety deposit box in the bank in question.Half the film is the heist itself, then the second half its aftermath as the thieves find themselves being hunted by law enforcement, the government who put them there in the first place and the immoral men in power who want the photos back. We actually end up pitying Statham and his men because they had no idea what they were getting into."Bank Job" works very quickly to get the heist going and it's sort of choppy film-making for a good thirty minutes. After the characters and what's really going on with the government and all settles in, the movie takes off. Its non-traditional heist premise simply requires a good deal of set-up time. The characters are a little shallow, but they have clear goals and clear things at stake. Their amateur technique comes through and wins our sympathies despite their ignorance of radio technology and how they pop champagne bottles found in the deposit boxes before they've even left the bank.It's safe to say "Bank Job" is one of the better heist flicks made in awhile, with so many tired and repetitive stories being told. British TV writers Dick Clement and Ian La Franais deserve a lot of credit for finding this story, sealing the rights and bringing it to life in an entertaining and creative way, regardless how much is actually true.~Steven C.

Third installments have a history of letting us down  in the superhero world especially. You won't find a lot of folks who list a movie with a "3" at the end as their favorite of a movie series, and frankly, they don't have a lot to choose from either.It's extremely tough to find the perfect third, even with all the ground-breaking Christopher Nolan's adored and beloved Batman films have accomplished. "Batman Begins" changed the way Hollywood looked at the characters and properties sitting on its shelves, and "The Dark Knight" changed the way blockbusters are made, period. Both set high bars for filmmaking, and in the process, saddled "The Dark Knight Rises" with astronomical expectations.Many would argue it's an impossible order, and watching "The Dark Knight Rises," you get a sense Nolan didn't care to meet it. No, it's not about apathy or laziness  he was just more concerned with creating a sense of completeness, with finishing the story arc he dreamed up years ago. In doing so he gives us the first connected and complete original movie trilogy in movie history that doesn't have the name "Star Wars" attached to it.Conclusiveness: "The Dark Knight Rises" greatest strength and greatest weakness. Nolan's drive to achieve finality gives the film a greater sense of purpose and ultimately a feeling of satisfaction, yet at the same time, the film is slave to it; "Rises" doesn't have its own identity so much as it completes a whole.The powerful escalation of events in "The Dark Knight" necessitates this, as it should. Batman (Christian Bale) has taken the fall for the corrupted Harvey Dent so that Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) could use Dent's image to continue to clean Gotham of crime  and it worked. The city is at peace eight years later, only our hero Bruce Wayne stays cooped in his rebuilt mansion, nursing his psyche, unconfident that he can affect the same change as Bruce Wayne that he did as Batman.Yet Bruce's sense of purpose is quickly renewed when he crosses paths with a jewel thief named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) and learns of a new masked rogue named Bane (Tom Hardy) amassing a force deep within Gotham. With some urging from Gordon, Bruce takes up the cowl, unaware that his most grueling mental and physical trials lie before him.Also new to the mix are other Nolan "Inception" alumni Joseph Gordon-Levitt as bold rookie cop John Blake and Marion Cotillard as Wayne Enterprises board member Miranda Tate. Coupled with Hathaway and Hardy, the talent on screen is palpable, and it eases the juggling of the film's subplots necessitated by their characters' existence.The new faces are just one of many factors increasing the scale, stage and stakes of "The Dark Knight Rises." Like the previous films, the story is immersive and the action engrossing. What the major sequences lack in ingenuity (except for the excellent opening plane hijacking), the film replaces with more visceral combat, which is in a way much more fitting of the nature of the film (and Bane's scheme). The film is both intensely personal and wildly large, something that becomes easier to appreciate when the chaos has died down and the credits roll.The personal comes mostly with Bruce's journey, plus the sense of intimacy we have built over the years with characters such as Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). The film hearkens a lot to "Batman Begins," which is no surprise considering the objective is so clearly to unite the three films. What happens in that first film is firmly entrenched in "Rises," so anyone rusty on it would benefit from a refresher course.To bring the entire trilogy full circle, a lot needs to happen. Critics of "The Dark Knight" and its plot contrivances will find more cause to nitpick the many pieces that seem to fall into place here. The destination of the film  it's final five minutes  is so powerful and satisfying that Nolan must have imagined it from the beginning and determined to construct the film around arriving there. Doing so meant making certain sacrifices to "The Dark Knight Rises" as a singular entity for the benefit of the three-film story.Yet without "The Dark Knight Rises," the trilogy would be incomplete and unsatisfying. While it is the least perfect piece of Nolan's incredible enterprise, is is unquestionably the most essential. Viewed independently, its faults can seem to pile on top of one another, but viewed within the context of the trilogy, suddenly the themes and ideas begin to expand and grow, and the film's many subplots and characters begin to feel essential.Why? Because it had to end the way it does. Nolan's Batman is so rich, his vision and purpose for Batman and what he represents is so clear, that all who love it actually understand it as intuitively as Nolan himself. "The Dark Knight Rises" is predictable in this way, though not because Nolan has regressed, rather because we are on the same wavelength. We know, for example, that in any classic story the good guy is going to win, but just because that outcome is foreseeable doesn't mean it's unsatisfying to see it all play out.In that way, "The Dark Knight Rises" gives us a thrilling swan song for Nolan's Batman. By daring to be a final chapter rather than succumb to the era of four-quels and five-quels in which money necessitates that filmmakers leave the door open for future chapters, "The Dark Knight Rises" accomplishes the seemingly simple yet incredibly obstacle-ridden task of making a great third installment. Like "Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight," it's an achievement with no equal.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out moviemusereviews.com
Conceptually it would seem that a film taking place in a sort of purgatory for suicide victims would provide rich possibilities for perspective on life and--in the case of the "A Love Story" half of this film's title--love. While this Sundance entry film suggests that there is some greater understanding of life that we can take from it, at 77 minutes long there's simply no way we can be expected to get it. We can enjoy the romantic drama, but everything else is muddied and meaningless.In, "Wristcutters," Zia (Patrick Fugit of "Almost Famous") cuts his wrists (obviously) and subsequently kills himself because he is distraught from his break-up with Desiree (Leslie Bibb), only to find that his suicide only results in him entering a desolate world full only of people who have also taken their "first" lives. The ironic twist is when Zia learns that not long after he died, Desiree also killed herself, and in search of some sort of reconciliation Zia sets off to find her.The concept seems ripe with comedic opportunity and the chance to really create a unique world never before imagined in film, but the script never settles us in. Director and writer Goran Dukic shows some promise, at least as a director, showing the world as sort of a bleak version of our own by filming in a desert mostly and creating an overexposed look to the film that makes it look faded and washy. As a writer, however, there is nothing in the script to ground us into this world. The story is always moving and so we have to become accustomed to this purgatory idea through the characters. That's not a bad thing in itself, however, because there is some talent in this cast. Fugit is his usual self, being a likable, solid protagonist but nothing more. The standout is Shannyn Sossamon as a hitchhiker that joins up with Zia and his friend Eugene (Shea Whigham). Despite our lack of background and insight into her character, she draws us in and we really get to know what her character is like, which helps make up for the shortcomings of the character development. The issue with understanding the film concept through the character interactions is that it takes away from our ability to understand the plot and the characters separately. We're too busy trying to understand how this purgatory works and wondering what might become of the characters that we can't possibly start to truly get to know them. This is just made worse when little abstract, bizarre events occur, like the black hole under the passenger front seat and the 'miracles' that happen. Weird stuff like that, though we know it must have some relevancy, are frustrating when everything else isn't fully developed yet.This is the kind of movie that might convince some people to love it because one or two of the strange, metaphysical events or ideas will connect to them and that alone will excite them, but those one or two don't connect to the other ones in the film. There are so many characters (toward the end especially) and things going on that there's no possible way you can link all the film's scenes, events and moments that have red flags sticking out of them so that they should be known as part of the film's greater meaning.It would, however, be unfair to not recognize that the movie is marketed, by its title, as a love story and to a degree it should be judged as such. As Zia and Mikal (Sossamon's character) inch toward a relationship, there is a unique feel to it amid the chaotic ideas of them both being dead but not really. It helps that they give the film's best performances-- you can somewhat connect their characters' experiences in the film to their past to make some effort into understanding why they are drawn to each other, but as much as this film would like to say it's supposed to be a love story at core, everything around the core makes it so difficult to access appropriately that you almost have to wonder if there's a core at all. Without the title, that's not so apparent--you would think the point was to say something profound about life and death, which this film does not do to a degree that most would get it. That's not to say it couldn't, but certainly not the way it is written and over the course of an hour and twenty minutes.
With all the cop drama TV shows and films that have come out over the years and the corruption thrillers, revisiting an old noir thriller such as "Touch of Evil" about cops taking justice into their own hands can be unexciting. There's very little that those of a younger generation haven't seen before, so what separates "Touch of Evil" from the pack? Good film-making. In the long tracking shot that consumes the opening scene, you understand right away that Orson Welles is serious about his finest directorial effort, and that no matter how un-thrilling the story might be, that this what good movies look like.I watched the 1998 re-release featuring scenes that the studio cut that Welles wanted to keep in, always the best way to watch a classic in a time where this was even more common practice than it is today. Welles' style is reminiscent of Hitchcock, only choosing close-ups in critical scenes so that they have a big dramatic impact. I can only speculate, but I wouldn't be surprised if "Touch of Evil" got actress Janet Leigh her unforgettable role in "Psycho" two years later."Touch of Evil" stars Charlton Heston fresh off the heels of "The Ten Commandments" as Mike Vargas, a (unconvincing) Mexican narcotics official that's wanted dead by a Mexican narcotics dealer gets caught playing a role in a murder investigation when a car explodes when he and his wife Susie (Leigh) are on Honeymoon in a Mexican border town. The infamous local police captain Hank Quinlan (an almost unrecognizably overweight Welles) suspects a Mexican national and soon Vargas is on to Quinlan, accusing him of planting evidence. Meanwhile, Susie is kidnapped by the dealer's nephews to be used as a bargaining chip.Not just directing and writing, but from an acting standpoint, this is Welles' film too. Not only does Quinlan take up much of the screen, but his old crooked persona makes him easily the most interesting character. He's a cop struggling between right and wrong, operating on a false sense of justice. It's not highly original, but Quinlan is our main draw to the story. It's certainly not Heston pretending to be Mexican.Quick pacing and suspenseful, shadowy direction is the real signature Welles leaves on the film. There's no particular emotional investment in the story or characters, just intrigue in knowing when everything is going to finally get nasty and dangerous instead of the continuous verbal accusations. Welles does deliver and brings the film to a thrilling climax that confirms our suspicions of what was really the most important part of his film. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Words don't describe Paul Thomas Anderson's latest epic film project, and he doesn't let them dominate the story either. A significant chunk of "There Will Be Blood" has no dialogue and the ability for it to stay so captivating is only a testament to Anderson's incredible ability to tell stories about people through images that says more than about what's happening.Anderson's weapon in this film is no secret. It isn't often Daniel Day-Lewis's name shows up on a marquee these days, especially when it's not tied to something that is sure to be good. This latest choice of his, however, is better than good and so is he. His character, Daniel Plainview, a self-proclaimed "oilman," is deeply complex and troubled. The way that Day- Lewis plays the lighter parts and seamlessly transitions to the darker parts is chillingly believable. Plainview is not only interesting, but he's embraceable, despicable, amusing and frightening all throughout the film.The only truly supporting cast is his son and a self-proclaimed prophet that he comes into complications with played by Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine). Dano's performance is unfortunately shadowed by Day-Lewis and it does feel like he was too young to be cast, but the 23-year-old is highly impressive and will perhaps be a marquee name in the near future."Blood" is otherwise the strength of Anderson and his crew. The original score by Jonny Greenwood, who is mostly known for his guitar skills in Hollywood, brings something abstract that simultaneously fits the film's generally quiet demeanor using a variety of percussion sounds and few musical notes. While some films prefer soaring John Williams themes, Greenwood's theme for "Blood" is one dissonant chord and a sound effect that can be best described as a more painful version of the THX sound system effect. It's harsh, but so is the film. Anderson makes every moment count whether it's when there's music or where he puts the camera.To best describe the film in terms of people familiar with Anderson's work, it's his first film that truly translates to the interests of all dramatic film-lovers. It is distinctly his film, yet viewers will be able to grasp it much more easily than the abstract and obscure multiple storyline nature of "Boogie Nights" and "Magnolia." For people new to his work, be prepared to feel some discomfort, but if you pay attention to the way the story is told, then you'll find the mastery of "Blood."
As abundant in number as the tell-tale signs of a fantasy epic are, they're not qualities that (ironically) can be brought about with the wave of a wand. Few films will offer better evidence to this than "Snow White and the Huntsman," a film so aesthetically confident and captivating yet shockingly hollow.Some filmmakers are gifted with incredible vision, and though it's just his first film, Universal expertly identified Rupert Sanders as someone capable of building something of this scale. He hasn't hit on his own distinctive style yet, but he brings the visual authenticity that distinguishes good medieval fantasy from the posers. If the script could operate at the same level, "Snow White" would have easily won over legions of adoring fans. The fault doesn't lie in the concept, which essentially recasts the classic fairy tale as a straightforward fantasy-adventure, but in the paint-by-numbers execution of the story, which leans a bit heavily on genre tropes and fails to get an emotional foothold.Beginning with a 10-minute prologue that sets up writer Evan Daugherty's take on the legend, "Snow White" creates a dark, more adult foundation for the familiar story. After losing her mother at a young age, Snow White sees her father ride off into battle and come back with a new bride in the beautiful Ravenna (Charlize Theron). Before he knows it, Ravenna reveals her true colors and seizes the kingdom, plunging it into years of darkness and locking Snow White away until there came a day when she might be of use.That day comes when the evil queen's magic mirror tells her that consuming Snow White's heart will grant her last immortality, but teenage Snow White (Kristen Stewart) escapes and flees into the Dark Forest. She hires a sorrowful, drunken Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to find her and bring her back, but realizing the queen's true evil, he decides to help Snow White flee to the castle where a duke and his son (Sam Claflin) once loyal to her family can protect her.For a film over two hours, it all happens so fast. Whether it's the trip (two senses of the word) through the Dark Forest, a stay with women who've scarred themselves to avoid the queen's wrath, or the encounter with the dwarfs, these moments that make a fantasy-adventure feel rushed and empty. The great epics use them for genuine character development, but this script utilizes them for explanation and expository boredom.The actors on display don't lack for talent and offer flashes of emotional performances, but so much of what they do comes off as either flat or way over the top. Theron, for example, can't make up her mind to play the queen troubled and subdued or certifiably crazy. At the beginning she's so subtle and devious, but then she starts squawking. We know she can play a true psychopath, so the culprit has to be the dialogue.At one point, Snow White must rally the troops. She gets to deliver an inspiring speech, and as strong as Stewart has become as an actress (she shows genuine improvement here), it's almost comical what she's forced to say. If you're going to write the ever-risky "rally the troops" speech, you better damn make sure everything leading up to it worked emotionally or the speech will fall flat on its face. Sure enough, that's what happens, and it speaks directly to the effectiveness of the screenplay up until that point.It trickles down into every element of the film, despite Sanders' best attempts to dress everything up with visuals that will inspire your curiosity. A scene in which Snow White and the Huntsman cross a bridge to discover it's being guarded by an angry troll cleverly camouflaged into the rocks demonstrates an exciting use of visuals, but it turns out to be a completely wasted detour meant to serve as just one of what will become several examples of how the creatures of this world respond differently to Snow White than other people. As if you couldn't figure it out  she has a destiny.Fortunately, the action and sense of danger is quite palpable, and "Snow White" hits on moments of legitimate suspense. Sanders finds some excellent ways to work with the PG-13 to give an appropriate sense of violence and bloodshed, and his sense of fight choreography borrows from the most reliable of techniques. This is a rather dark film for Snow White, which is a refreshing take considering films like Tim Burton's "Alice and Wonderland," which have tried to be but drowned in their own off-the-beaten-path-ness. So it's not that "Snow White and the Huntsman" falls apart because of the writing, but that it cancels out a lot of the good things the film does from a visual standpoint. Hiring Oscar- winning costume designer Colleen Atwood, for example, speaks to what "Huntsman" does to create the feel of a fantastical visual feast. Even the eye candy isn't as sweet when you don't find yourself emotionally enchanted as well. As strong as it is, it doesn't forge a connection with the audience. "Avatar" would be a great comparison of a rich world that accentuated a classic story. Given its history, this story should feel even more classic, but instead it's taken for granted.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
In 2002, one movie proved what no one thought possible: Superhero movies were a genre almost untapped in potential and capable of generating millions of dollars world-wide. "Spider-Man" showed that costumed crime-fighters have a multi-generational influence and a mass appeal if kept under one condition: they are about the people behind the mask. What makes "Spider-Man" a film that transformed a genre and a whole decade (so far) is that at its heart it is a story about Peter Parker, a normal, geeky kid who comes across great power (that he learns comes with great responsibility). It is an origin story, not obsessed with the action and what the hero does as much as why he does it. Director Sam Raimi clearly connects with Peter Parker and knows exactly how to portray him. Tobey Maguire is an actor that gets at that. There is nothing hunky or masculine about him, yet he is beloved in the role, because through him the audience connects to Peter Parker more than Spider-Man. That connection being so strong then allows for everything Spider-Man does do to become more interesting, exciting and moving. You are with him and Raimi every step of the way.The very reason "with great power comes great responsibility" has become such a heavily quoted line is because when the script hits you with it, you're totally ready. After some great action and an interesting story with a compelling villain in the Green Goblin (Defoe) and strong character relationships, "Spider-Man" becomes a hit with its final scene. More important than the movie itself, however, is the way this film altered the course of Hollywood for the next decade, a decade that will be remembered that way forever.
"Heaven Can Wait" attempts to turn "It's A Wonderful Life" into a football movie. The trouble is that the film doesn't feel like a sports comedy; the sports element and the coming back from heaven and taking someone else's body element are two distinctly different entities that Warren Beatty's film tries to squeeze together. One does not necessitate the other and as such the film takes forever to follow a common thread and by the time the humor works and the film somewhat gets itself together, it's too late.How this film was nominated for nine Academy Awards absolutely baffles me. Rarely do I hold contrarian opinions to the Academy, but "Heaven Can Wait" is simply not worthy, especially the writing team of Beatty and Elaine May, who while clever and funny fail structurally speaking.Quickly into the film, Los Angeles Rams' quarterback Joe Pendleton (Beatty) finds out he's going to be the starter for his Super-Bowl bound team, but dies in a nasty accident -- or does he? Turns out one of heaven's "escorts," (not the definition you're thinking of) who was responsible for pulling Joe out of his body when he died, did so too early when it turns out Joe would've survived the accident. Remorsefully, the escort and Mr. Jordan (some heavenly guy in charge played by James Mason) agree to give Joe another body to make up for it, a body Joe hopes to get into football shape and use to play quarterback again.But it's not that simple. The body Joe chooses (he can only select a recently deceased and undiscovered body) belongs to corporate billionaire and supposed scumbag Leo Farnsworth whose wife and personal assistant are having an affair and tried to kill him. The film dawdles in the corporate affairs of Farnsworth for far too long, thinking the situation funny when the character's goal is to play football and our desire is to see him pull it off, not try and improve on Farnsworth's life. We are given no reason to think Joe would actually care to use Farnsworth's body to mess with Farnsworth's affairs, but he does and football disappears from the story for a chunk of time.That's when Julie Christie is introduced as Betty the love interest, which is poor because she's not attached to the football element, which is supposed to be the main part of the story, hence how disjointed and poorly composed the script is. Some of the writing is indeed humorous and well-done, especially with Farnsworth's butlers as well as Charles Grodin and Dyan Cannon playing the two people that just plotted to kill him trying to rectify the situation now that he's alive. However, those scenes are such a far turn from the initial football set up that the humor is limited because the script is going off in a dissatisfying direction. Perhaps I had the wrong set of expectations, but I think most people will feel oddly deceived at the direction the story goes in."Heaven Can Wait" tries to do too much and the talents aren't strong enough to make up for the elaborate script. Beatty's a likable actor, but the story draws Joe up as unconvincing because his motivation is so distorted. Creativity and originality, which "Heaven Can Wait" certainly doesn't lack, are terrific qualities in films, especially in a genre as cliché-ridden as sports comedy, but the execution is everything and "Heaven Can Wait" from a writing standpoint was a botched attempt.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Producer Chris Columbus, who directed the first two films made of the Harry Potter series of fantasy books by J.K. Rowling, couldn't have made a better choice than stepping away from the camera and giving the reigns to a seasoned director with a fresh perspective. It's what makes "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" go from merely good to great.Director Alfonso Cuaron, who brings his fantasy experience from the mid-'90s film "A Little Princess," adds a layer of complexity, maturity and beauty to the Harry Potter universe that had been just a bit too fantastical and gimmicky under Columbus' direction. Though the second does this better than the first, the third completely outdoes both.In this chapter, Harry (Radcliffe) heads for Hogwarts with the knowledge that an infamous Dark wizard named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizard prison of Azkaban and is out to find Harry and kill him. Along the way Harry must learn to overcome his fear of the Azkaban prison guards out searching Hogwarts for Black -- ghastly creatures called Dementors -- during which he learns a bit about his parents. New to the cast include David Thewlis as new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and ally of Harry's, Remus Lupin, a nearly unrecognizable Emma Thompson as Divination teacher Professor Trelawney and Michael Gambon as the new Albus Dumbledore after the sad passing of Richard Harris. All are great, even Gambon, who adds a youthful vigor to Dumbledore despite the true magic that Harris brought to the role.A lot has also changed visually in "Azkaban." There seems to be more of a sense of realism to the characters despite the fantasy world around them. Cuaron has the main trio of Harry, Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) in modern dress most of the film (whenever they're not in classes) and this really helps make them seem more like the teenagers they are. It makes us identify with them more. Even when they are in robes/proper dress, they do what Catholic school kids with uniforms would: loosen the ties, unbutton a couple buttons -- Cuaron's image is not as neat and tidy of a fantasy world. This is more of a young adults adventure story, not a children's fantasy. Then again, the books are heading in this direction and it's only appropriate.The sets are even more beautiful and Cuaron's attention to the seasons changing helps emphasize his themes of time while grounding the narrative of the film. Steve Kloves, adapter of the first two books, has clearly by now honed his craft. He has much better ways of working in the information of the book visually than through dialogue. Cuaron's vision makes that seem all the more apparent. What you see in "Azkaban" just has so much more weight to it. There aren't nearly as many visual effects or interesting nature sequences that are just there to be pretty. All of it has a purpose with the exception of Harry flying around on Buckbeak the hippogriff for a few minutes, and even that lets John Williams take his great score to the next level."Azkaban" is easily the best Potter film to date and it's one of the shortest, so that gives you a sense of how much more improved the entire process was this time around. This film really lives up to the book more than any other in entertainment and maturity. It's a shame Cuaron didn't stick around for another go.
I read Philip Pullman's "His Dark Materials" trilogy, the first of which is "The Golden Compass," some time ago and I greatly enjoyed them, but in attempting to make this series into the next "Chronicles of Narnia" or "Harry Potter" as far as young adult fantasy novels- turned-movies go, New Line Cinema brings us an average and uninspired adaptation."The Golden Compass" focuses on yet another orphaned child with a destiny to fulfill in Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), only Lyra is a she. Pullman's world isn't so much a fantasy one but an alternative universe with some fantasy elements: namely flying witches, armored polar bears and magical objects like the golden compass itself, also known as an alethiometer -- a truth-telling device. In it, humans live with external souls that take the form of animals called daemons. They are governed by a body called the Magisterium and Lyra, the recent recipient of this alethiometer is about to go on a journey to the arctic circle to figure out what this evil entity is up to.It is a complex universe and that's the first problem with the film. The script is nearly all exposition, explaining things to us so that we have some sort of understanding of how this alternative world works. Immediately it strips the film of character development (there are too many characters to count anyway) and makes themes other than a young child's courage completely null. It was unwise to give full creative control -- script and direction -- to Chris Weitz, whose track record includes "About a Boy" and directing Chris Rock's "Down to Earth." Not exactly proof that he can helm a big-budget family-oriented fantasy film. Weitz doesn't destroy the film by any means, but it's lackluster -- there's no sense of the grand scope of the fantasy world and the direction is mostly story-oriented. The purpose of these kinds of movies is to enchant us. "Compass" drives us merely by a daunting curiosity to understand what it's all about. Maybe this is also the nature of the novel -- it's more philosophical and much less whimsical than "Harry Potter." Definitely more for young adults despite childish characters.A lot of the buzz surrounding the film has to do with Pullman's theme in the books -- one that seems to suggest anti-religious sentiment. Having not made that connection reading the books as a young adult, I definitely didn't puck up on that in this film. There's a sense of abuse of power and authority and adults telling children what's best for them -- and the use of the word "heresy" -- but overall this adaptation comes off more fantasy and less philosophical lecture.It's enjoyable fantasy -- well-paced and extremely nice to look at, specifically the polar bears who look spectacular in CG. Its casting is excellent with hot ticket item Daniel Craig playing Lord Asriel, Lyra's uncle, and an enchanting yet terrifying Nicole Kidman as untrustworthy Mrs. Coulter. Voice actors for the animals include great talents like Ian McKellen, Ian McShane and young British acting sensation Freddie Highmore. However, "Compass" doesn't evoke the feeling that you're watching something special or magical when its plot-oriented script would indicate it's trying to milk out the fantasy elements above all else. Weitz's directing conveys what's going on well enough, but he doesn't make any choices that stand out and bring this world to life in our imaginations.
"Marley & Me" does not prey entirely on our soft side for dogs, nor does it aim for laughs caused by animal hi-jinx. It's a touching film with a warm spirit that manages to shake off any tearjerker stereotypes that most people would be quick to slap it with. That's better than at least 75 percent of current films with the labels "romance" and "comedy" associated with them.It tells the story of a dog, but "Marley & Me" is equally about the start of a family. The film covers a lot of chronological ground and quickly. John and Jenny (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Anniston) start the film married and an hour later have three kids and a dog. That dog would be Marley, a yellow lab the couple got on clearance when they were still wavering over whether to have kids. Marley is a terror of a dog when it comes to behavior, but "Marley & Me" never fully mutates from romance to dog shenanigans comedy. Writers Don Roos and Scott Frank refuse to cave in to making this a film about a crazy dog and "The Devil Wears Prada" director David Frankel supports them fully. When Marley has some kind of episode, it's quick and punchy, leaving only the effect that Marley adds to the struggle of making a family work.What neither Frankel nor the writers can overcome in adapting John Grogan's book, however, is the challenge of putting so much physical time into a two-hour film. They find a way, but the story rarely has a chance to breathe or take root in the mind because so much happens in the course of ten or even five minutes. Films that span a lifetime usually end up in the two plus time category for this reason. Consequently, Wilson and Anniston never seem to age. ("Jenn's held up well" says Eric Dane, the best friend, to Wilson when they encounter each other toward the end of the movie.) Your empathy will grow for Marley, but the characters don't quite have enough time to germinate. Missing are the little moments that really show great character because the film is too busy passing through time.Both stars are at their best in "Marley," with Wilson getting to be a toned-down and mature laid-back joker as opposed to an immature laid-back joker. Anniston gets to combine her romantic comedy quirkiness with the occasional flip-out as well, which she's executed numerous times before.I did have a personal beef with Wilson's character being able to support three kids and his stay-at-home wife on a journalist's salary (which is doubled at one point in the film), but the film is otherwise logical and transitions exceptionally well. Roos and Frank write in a number of clever montage alternatives that are attention grabbing. One such scene is Wilson doing voice over and reading single phrases one after the other about what is happening in his life and another shows how Marley torments the baby sitter as John and Jenn vacation to Ireland and Jenn's voice over is of the instructions they left behind.The family and dog elements blend in nicely, but missing from "Marley & Me" is some resonance. It all makes sense and sure, the dog was family and dogs love unconditionally, but the film leaves itself no time to show instead of tell about what Marley taught them. Another example of this is Jenn yelling at John about how difficult it is to watch their kids and Marley and how she never realized it would be so hard. The trigger is pulled too early with use of dialogue when some effectively drawn out scene writing would've captured that idea easily.Nevertheless, "Marley" remains a sweet-natured and likable if not lovable film that captures true moments of romance, family and pet ownership without ever giving in to a single convention that most "dog comedies" employ with reckless abandon.
Renowned guitarist Slash helps open Sacha Gervasi's documentary on the band Anvil saying they helped inspire the metal movement in '80s rock, but he also ends it by noting that despite Anvil never achieving the fame expected of them, that they've stayed together -- which a lot of bands can't say they have. That's the spirit of Gervasi's film, which goes beyond the trials of a band still after a dream 30 years in the making to show the people that really make the experience worth it.The film begins with footage of Ontario-based metal band Anvil's big break, sharing a stage with the likes of Whitesnake and Bon Jovi in Japan back in the '80s, a show that would end up being their fifteen minutes of fame as opposed to the start of an illustrious music career. Founding members Steve "Lips" Kudlow (vocals, guitar) and Robb Reiner (drums) began playing music together at 14 and now in their 50s, enjoy the occasional penniless side gig in addition to their everyman day jobs.Pity is the chief emotion you feel when watching these men and their bandmates go through what they do. Countless bands become victim to the corporate music machine and never live up to their potential, going unrewarded for their passion and devotion to the craft. But Anvil is different. These men have been in dedication and talent limbo for three decades yet they've never ditched the dream. It's one thing to be young and come up short, but to be 50 with a family and not letting go is another.Lips Kudlow as the doc's main subject creates the emotional connection for the viewer. He wears his emotions on his sleeve and his mood swings abruptly at times. Gervasi captures moments of anger and moments of tears equally and both types of scenes carry the same power. It's easy to dig into the psychology of a passionate man who can't always keep his head on his shoulders. You understand him and understand why he and Robb have been buddies for so long despite their arguments. So many subtle symbols throughout suggest a lot about what these 30 years have been like for these guys."Anvil! The Story of Anvil" is an underdog documentary unlike any other. It's founded on music but it focuses the very things that music forges above all else: connections between people and to a raw, passionate energy. Even if you hate metal, you will remember why it is that music is such an essential part of being human when you watch this documentary.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
High school is vicious, everyone knows that. And although stereotypes have run high school movies ragged, there's still a ring of truth to them even when they're blown out of proportion. "Heathers," however, stands apart. This '80s cult favorite black comedy is the counter-culture version of the high school flick, the very definition of teen angst in the form of a laughable revenge fantasy.Altogether the film is quite ridiculous: Veronica (Winona Ryder) has an in with the Heathers, the three most popular girls in school, but when she ends up betrayed by their contrived social hierarchies and sleazy attitudes, she and her new boyfriend, the rebellious J.D. (Christian Slater), end up on a spree of setting up the murders of popular kids to look like suicides. The reactions of those in the community are comical though sadly, so are the way the two killers deal with their actions. But there's something about the sharpness of its satirical wit that makes "Heathers" so incredibly laudable despite the lackluster drama and muddled character motivation. We all kind of wish those popular jerk-offs from high school would just roll over, but "Heathers" takes it one step further, willing to do whatever it takes -- even throw away its plot credibility -- to make its point. High school is full of these delusions and they extend from the kids all the way up through the administration. Nobody gets that there are actually serious underlying issues and everyone gets caught up in one thing or another, which is usually image. Veronica and J.D. create these false suicides and everyone buys them and turns them into martyrs when they were awful people. It's some wonderful irony. For the feature film debuts of director Michael Lehmann and writer Daniel Waters, "Heathers" is pretty impressive. How two high school kids suddenly become murderers is kind of slopped together, but they manage to illustrate the film's point with ease. Man, I'm glad I'm not in high school anymore. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
If you're Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer, how do you go about finding your next "Pirates of the Caribbean" franchise? Well, you start by keeping the whole cast in long hair and eyeliner only you relocate them to the desert. "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" is a familiar swashbuckling adventure only transplanted to the Middle East and outfitted with turbans, swords with even bigger curves, snakes and lots and lots of sand.Based on the popular video game created by Jordan Mechner, fans will delight to hear that "Prince of Persia" is one of few truly enjoyable adaptations out there. But then again, when Disney is there to throw money at it, this is hardly unexpected. I can't speak to loyalty toward characters or game story lines, but only a few lines of expository dialogue that repeat a bit too often and one or two scenes actually feel mildly like a video game."Persia" lacks the charm of "Pirates," but there's no deficit in the area of thrills or adventure. The plot is sometimes too complex for its own good; at numerous points we turn to Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) as she explains some previously missing piece of information about the sands of time that suddenly shift the direction of the story toward yet another adventure or action sequence, but it's not poorly contrived -- just contrived -- and the thrills that await don't disappoint both in terms of visual effects and creative fun.Prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) was an orphan plucked from the streets and raised as a prince for a heroic act he performed as a child. Fast-forward to now. After leading a crafty siege of Tamina's holy kingdom of Alamut, who allegedly has been aiding Persia's enemies, Dastan is framed for the king's murder and becomes a fugitive from his own people, escaping with the help of Tamina. The reason for all of this is a dagger that controls time, which fortunately, Dastan possesses. But all it means is more trouble awaits them both.Gyllenhaal wears the blockbuster lead hero crown just as well as everyone thought he would and Arterton ("Clash of the Titans") matches his likability in giving the film's only multi- dimensional performance. Their classic loathing-turned-love romance subplot ends up being the only attention the script gives to developing character, but they achieve the goal of winning the audience's favor in spite of some ineffective humor. Alfred Molina's money-grubbing side character is about as funny as "Persia" gets and funny just means he can be a pretty good quirky character actor."Persia" works as a fun summer holiday blockbuster with flaws that are not too difficult to overlook, kind of like last Christmas' "Sherlock Holmes" only without the prowess of a Robert Downey Jr. at the helm. Mike Newell ("Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire") knows how to command a fun film and get the most bite in terms of action for a PG-13 movie. There are one or two more jumping or slow-mo shots of Gyllenhaal than necessary, but never a dull moment, especially with the script's ever-building momentum. There's probably not enough juice here for two or any sequels for that matter, but "Persia" is far from another mediocre video game adaptation.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
When major theater chains decided not to show "The Interview" because of terrorism threats from North Korean hackers, Hollywood saw an unparalleled degree of hype surrounding a film that otherwise would've received a moderate spotlight at best. But while news buzz for this comedy about a TV host and his producer being recruited to assassinate Kim Jong-un can impact marketing and maybe box office numbers, there's one thing it can't change: whether the film's any good.James Franco and Seth Rogen star as Dave Skylark and Aaron Rapaport, host and producer of "Skylark Tonight," a long-running primetime interview program known for covering celebrity gossip rather than hard-hitting journalism. When Dave and Aaron learn that Kim Jong-un is a fan of the show, they realize landing an interview with him could legitimize their work. After Kim agrees, the CIA, represented by Lizzy Caplan, pays the pair a visit and recruits them to kill the North Korean Supreme Leader.Prolific comedy writers (and recently directors, including this film) Rogen and Evan Goldberg  along with longtime TV comedy writer Dan Sterling  have crafted one of their strangest premises yet. In fact, there's an opportunity to do something genius in the realm of satire, but the biting moments are quick and fleeting in a film that's by and large a farce about two guys in way over their heads."The Interview" seems to primarily exist just to give Rogen and Franco an even weirder set of cinematic circumstances in which to dick around and say outrageous things to one another. Those who already take issue with Franco will likely find Dave Skylark his most insufferable comic character to date, while Rogen plays the straighter character lacking in street smarts. The two definitely find golden banter throughout the movie, but considering the large percentage of "The Interview" that can be constituted as banter, there's not as much hit as miss.The Rogen-Goldberg formula still has its merits, but "The Interview" provides evidence that its effectiveness is wearing thin. The predictability of the plot, for example, really works to the film's detriment. The story has a clear structure: Dave and Aaron feel motivated to do something important, they schedule an interview with Kim, the CIA recruits them and prepares them for the mission, they go to North Korea for the interview and to kill Kim. The only unpredictable chunk is the last one  what happens after they get to Kim's "palace." The way they choose to go about it is mostly juvenile and devoid of suspense until the actual interview occurs, but even then, you can always depend on Rogen and Goldberg to up the chaos factor in the third act, usually with comic violence.The humor of "The Interview" hinges a lot on recurring jokes in addition to the usual genitals and bathroom humor. The concept of "honey-potting" and Katy Perry's "Firework" are two jokes/references that the script tries to get a lot of mileage out of. The situational humor is mostly spoiled by obviously plot devices. This isn't to say "The Interview" isn't funny, but when you can see through the jokes and situation humor and their use feels obvious, it takes away from the escapism that comes from good comedy.There's also a lot of Rogen and Franco. The supporting cast is uncharacteristically small in this one, especially compared to Rogen and Goldberg's cameo-loaded "This Is The End." Aside from Caplan, King Jong-un (Randall Park) and Sook (Diana Bang), Kim's head of communications, no one else gets much screen time. That puts a lot on Franco and Rogen's shoulders, which, capable as they are, have six plus years (since "Pineapple Express" at least) of wear and tear on them. So the brazen concept of "The Interview" is really the freshest thing about it.Rogen and Goldberg as writers and Rogen and Franco as actors have done better and will do better again, most likely, than "The Interview." What seems like an outlandish and exciting premise would've probably been best as a 30-minute "South Park" episode. And when you think about all the insulting satire that show has committed over the years, you start to realize what "The Interview" really is once you strip away the national "controversy."~Steven CThanks for reading!

Matt Groening and co. waited and waited for the right time for a Simpsons movie and they deliver with this film. It's not some great Simpsons epic that people seem to expect when a TV show becomes a feature film and it shouldn't be because most of those films tank.The premise of "The Simpsons Movie" is a long episode plot (they even throw in a "to be continued" to make fun of the TV medium.) that entails Homer screwing up against (this time majorly) and forcing Springfield to be contained in a glass dome by the EPA. Longtime writers James L. Brooks and Matt Groening do the right thing by focusing the plot on Homer, the franchise's most successful character. The film's Homer gags are fresh and true to Simspsons style. Many TV writers trying to make the movie based on their show the equivalent of its most amazing episode would try and over-incorporate the large cast of lovable characters, but "The Simpsons Movie" keeps them as mostly cameos, a decent amount of which are funny and it allows the film to stay focused.If you watch "The Simpsons Movie" looking for that big "be-all" for the series, you'll like experience some measure of disappointment, but those people who are fans of or at least admire the series and don't want their minds to be blown away with Simpsons humor and awesomeness, you will get your laughs (some of which you don't even normally get because of strict TV ratings) and you'll have fun.
If Chloe Moretz's Hit Girl from "Kick-Ass" were a slightly more real person, I suppose she'd be Hanna. Saoirse Ronan might not utter the C-word, but her character provides the same level of entertainment plus a bit more, well, depth. Either way, the trend of ass-kicking children continues in Joe Wright's latest film, which succeeds as a great thriller just as "Kick-Ass" succeeded as a great superhero/comic movie spoof. A pure cat-and-mouse thriller with a bit more heart than usual, "Hanna" definitely goes above and more arguably beyond great action material.Saoirse Ronan proves her acting ceiling lies well beyond a fathomable distance as the titular character, a girl raised by her father (Eric Bana) somewhere near the arctic circle and trained to be a deadly assassin. Her father is ex-CIA and reads Hanna encyclopedia bed-time stories all while training her to eventually take out a woman named Marissa Viegler (Cate Blanchett), who works for the CIA and will apparently want to kill Hanna as soon as she knows where she is. In the first 15 minutes, Hanna proves she's old and skilled enough for her mission and it begins. After being contained and thinking she's killed Viegler, Hanna escapes and goes on the run from Viegler and the cronies she hires to track her down in Morocco, Spain and other parts of Europe. If any doubts existed as to whether the director of "Pride and Prejudice" and "Atonement" could pull off stylized action, they are quickly put to rest in "Hanna." Although Wright does continue his trademark of slowing down the pace on occasion to ogle the scenery including pans around characters, he psychs you up for the action sequences. Due credit to the phenomenal Chemical Brothers score for doing the same. The music simply electrifies the action sequences in a way few electronic film scores do in this genre.Other than music, the depth of character sets "Hanna" apart from similar chase flicks. Like Jason Bourne, Hanna struggles with identity, but she also has the lack of life experience. She hasn't had the experience of growing up as most girls do and she has no concept of society or other people for that matter. Wright plays this up in the excellent scene in a Moroccan hotel room when various elements of electric-powered items (which Hanna has minimal experience with) begin to go off at once.Ronan fits her role perfectly from the outside in. She possesses the pale-faced naïveté of a young girl with piercing blue eyes that switch almost instantly to unsympathetic killer. Inside she gives Hanna everything from calculated emotion to raw longing: a very complete profile of a girl who has been raised the way she has. Seth Lochhead and David Farr's script gives her the opportunity to deliver such full dimension, which gains more robustness as they play her off other characters such as Sophie (Jessica Barden), a British teenager on vacation with her family in Morocco who's a bit of a shallow brat but still desiring a real connection to someone her age. This might sound convenient, but Ronan looks to be developing the chops of co-star Blanchett. Blanchett is renowned for her versatility and adding tremendous characterization to her roles. Viegler, with her cold-blooded attitude and Country accent, could have easily been blown over-the-top by anyone with lesser ability. As with Ronan's performance, Blanchett's prowess starts with her distinct looks and travels down to the core of her characters. We have seen Ronan pull off nosy and mischievous ("Atonement"), innocent ("The Lovely Bones") and now deadly. She has also never used her native Irish accent in a film, much like Blanchett almost never gets to be a natural Aussie."Hanna" only falters in scripting from a logistical sense, which Wright mostly covers up. The backstory and motivations of Hanna's father and Marissa Viegler are wishy-washy and the events that help the chase go from point "A" to point "B" seem illogical at times or uninspired. No example better captures this than when Bana takes an escalator into a subway when it's insanely obvious a character with his instincts would know he's being followed. However, the action sequence that occurs as a result hits the spot and effectively counters the fact that the scene is a total ploy.Wholly satisfying as an action film and thriller, "Hanna" showcases some positive trends in Hollywood from established musicians scoring films to formulaic stories that aim for depth ahead of action ingenuity. Thematic depth does lack a bit as the film tries to use symbolism and metaphor as adequate theme replacements, but they are intriguing and visually pleasing symbols and metaphors if it's any consolation. Regardless, from an entertainment perspective, "Hanna" offers great thrills.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
It might not be an election year, but politics never take a break from being cutthroat. "The Ides of March" peels back the curtain on election campaigns, in this case those of two Democrats vying for their party's nomination. Based on the play "Farragut North" by Beau Willimon, who had a hand in the screenplay, "Ides" tells you everything you've always assumed but chosen to remain ignorant of regarding the political machine. Frank and whip- smart if not a bit esoteric, George Clooney's latest directorial effort provides ample intellectual fodder bolstered by a terrific ensemble.Clooney plays Michael Morris, a North Carolina governor and political idealism incarnate, essentially a caricature of Obama rhetoric (though the 2008 play was based loosely on the Howard Dean campaign). But he's not the focus: Rather it's his main staffer, Stephen, (Ryan Gosling) who gets the spotlight ,as well as campaign manager Paul (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Morris simply serves as that point of reference reminding us what the polished exterior of a political campaign looks feels like.The seemingly omnipresent Gosling utilizes his fittingly Clooney-like charisma as Stephen, but without milking it. His character's "loss of political innocence" and consequent sharp left turn end up much more believable. Stephen is a hotshot who's far from a rookie in attitude and behavior, but hasn't been through the grinder like campaign manager Paul and their rival, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti).Stephen still has his convictions, for example, believing completely in his candidate and the Kool-aid he's serving. So he finds himself in a bit of trouble when he agrees to a meeting with Duffy and learns some valuable information that could completely tilt a pivotal Ohio primary that's just one week away. With his loyalty in question after his meeting leeks to their chummy reporter at the New York Times (Marisa Tomei), Stephen also starts an affair with a campaign intern named Molly (Evan Rachel Wood) and later learns a secret that will make him question all of it."Ides" takes the viewer behind the scenes into an ugly and somewhat superficial world. There's a bit of a soap-opera glamorization to various elements of the plot (affairs, back- stabbing, deception, etc.), but the actors hold it down with integrity. Vets Hoffman and Giamatti in particular give the film its backbone as two hard-nosed guys as blunt as the film's feelings on politics. Gosling and Wood demonstrate as much talent as any young actors working today, though Gosling's stardom should be a foregone conclusion at this point.Clooney excels at taking us on Stephen's journey and creating accessibility where the script lays on thick jargon. Various scenes that simply show Morris out on the campaign delivering a speech seem to meander, but Clooney understands that we must be exposed enough to Morris' public image to identify with that glitzy side of politics we get every couple years. Therefore, when all the new "info" comes to light, our perspective of Morris transforms so drastically it's fascinating to track."The Ides of March" asks that we accept certain truths about human nature and shows how the nature of politics feeds on some of our darker and more self-serving inclinations. Even as we take up arms along with Stephen's crusade to correct the (arguable) injustices thrust upon him, we can't help but to admit he has far from the clean record that a typical protagonist carries. Some might see the film's end as the beginning of a new chapter cut short, but it holds out hope that cycles of corruption feeding corruption do have the power to end.~Steven CCheck out my site, moviemusereviews.com
The man made famous for glorifying the mob moves over to Wall Street  Martin Scorsese's latest, "The Wolf of Wall Street," based on the memoir of crooked stockbroker millionaire Jordan Belfort, is a tale of excess: money, drugs, profanity, nudity, sex  even (pardon the cliché) rock 'n roll, given the soundtrack. So how does Scorsese approach it? With excess. Measure for measure.Encapsulated by the three-hour runtime, "Wolf" is an endless train of drugs, nudity, infidelity, flaunted wealth, cursing and political incorrectness. Scorsese wants to drill home just how outrageously this man lived his life. And just when you think you get the point, another outlandish scene will come along and remind you that you haven't fully grasped just how absurd, inane and pathetic it all is.Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) broke into the trading scene in the late '80s and became quickly captivated by just how much he could fill his pockets. Adopting the doctrine of go get 'em entitlement and tribal chant taught to him by his first employer, Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), Belfort discovers the human instinct of going out and getting what we think we deserve, and it trickles effortlessly into his sales tactics. Before long, he's started Stratton Oakmont, Inc. with his new pal, Donnie (Jonah Hill), training a bunch of sleazy nobody salesmen to become experts at convincing wealthy people to give away their cash.Of course his success blinds him (if not, in his mind, justifies him) to amoral behavior. He's never a bachelor at any point in the film yet he has sex with hookers, does more cocaine and quaaludes than you could ever imagine and not before long, he's laundering money left and right. Naturally, he ends up on on the watch list of FBI agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler). An extremely troubled man who acts first and thinks about the ramifications second, Belfort's prudence with regards to his illegal activities never catches up to his ambition, so it's clear he's not a man who is going to successfully evade the law for long.Scorsese's approach to this story glorifies Belfort's lifestyle, but at the same time he recognizes that Terence Winter's ("Boardwalk Empire) script speaks for itself in terms of what Belfort's problems are; the audience will come to its own realization about whether this carefree, money-driven life of debauchery is all its cracked up to be. Scorsese also understands his role is as storyteller, not moral arbiter. He doesn't go over the top to prove how bad or despicable Belfort and his associates behaved, but to show the ups as well as the downs. In fact, Scorsese and his 21st century muse, DiCaprio, actually manage to make Belfort a likable guy. He's fun and he doesn't treat anyone badly for so much of the film, nor does he engage in illegal activity in a deceitful way. He even truly and believably loves his two wives in the film, Teresa (Cristin Milioti), his first wife, and Naomi (Margot Robbie), the bombshell who utterly captivates him. The film avoids the details or moments behind his decision to launder money, painting him as not a guy who chooses to do wrong, but who did bad things because his passion and gusto for making money and living life the way he wanted blinded him to his own wrongdoing. The fact that a moment in the film in which Belfort gets caught elicited gasps from the audience means the film has done its job creating a complicated character portrait."Wolf" takes this approach to not just Belfort, but all aspects of the story, both in script and direction. Winter and Scorsese are both very interested in the notion of the drive for wealth and success being a matter of biology as opposed to money being something we are conditioned to desire. This is not a film content to just show the rise and fall of a ridiculous man and pretend it's something new.Hill, who took minimum salary to be in the film, proves to be a real bargain. Somehow, he has managed to fit his comedic style into a role in a dramatic film (can't quite call it a dramatic role) and create a totally different character that stands on its own. What he does with Donnie is the very definition of making a part your own. Are he and DiCaprio the new Pesci and DeNiro? It's a legitimate comparison.For a film that amounts to an overly long bacchanal, "The Wolf of Wall Street" manages to be thought-provoking and artistic thanks to one of the masters. It might not walk away with many awards, but it will deservedly win some people's votes for best of the year and deserves to be grouped in that category overall.~Steven CThanks for reading!

It's go big or go home for Ian Fleming's James Bond in "Thunderball," his fourth film adventure in as many years. Producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli (though uncredited in this film due to a lawsuit) threw incredible money into this "Bond" film, more than the first three combined. That doesn't make "Thunderball" better, but it does make it the first most lavish "Bond" entry and an exciting one in ways new to the franchise.The "Thunderball" story leaves a little to be desired, but essentially, SPECTRE is back in action with No. 2, Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), leading the charge. His plan is to hijack a NATO plane armed with nuclear weapons and essentially hold the world at ransom. Bond must travel to Nassau, Bahamas in order to find the carefully hidden nukes."Thunderball" ups the sum of gadgets and ladies, as you might expect from a massive budget. There are three women you might count as Bond girls: his assistant Paula (Martine Beswick), the femme fatale Fiona (Luciana Paluzzi) and the endangered love interest, Domino (Claudine Auger) among others. Bond also sexually harasses them and arguably rapes one of them by today's definitions, but that's the '60s for you.Q (Desmond Llewelyn) stocks Bond up with underwater breathing devices, a jetpack an underwater jetpack and more. The script does a good job of sneaking in the times when Bond must use them, which makes the movie that much more exciting. These toys add to the entertainment value, even if at times it feels as though "Bond" is slipping out of the thriller genre and completely into this action-spy territory.Everything culminates in a lengthy underwater harpoon and knife battle royale between Largo's SPECTRE cronies and U.S. forces. For 1965, this must've been exhaustive to film. Truthfully, no matter how you feel about "Thunderball" in the grand scheme of "Bond" films, you have to count this scene among the most impressive sequences in franchise history.Many of the film's other parts move slowly or don't seem to add much; there are lots of characters to account for in this story. CIA agent Felix Leiter, played by yet another actor in Rik Van Nutter, serves only to get Bond out of jams. Bond jumps from woman to woman as well, which makes it hard to fall for Auger, the central Bond girl. She has her own motives in the story at least, but she's really just someone for Bond to make out with on a life raft in the end."Thunderball" really ups the entertainment factor for the "Bond" franchise, moving these films toward the next echelon of spy movie. Terence Young, who returns after directing the first two films but skipping "Goldfinger" (how do you blame him for not wanting to make four films in four consecutive years?) shows he can handle the bigger budget and still make Bond gritty and real in spite of the story thrusting him into larger-than-life heroics.The middle portion of the film might be an unmemorable blur, but as an action film, "Thunderball" is shoulders above the previous entries.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Terrence Malick can't count himself among the most popular directors working today, but he can certainly count himself among the most respected. His work tends to follow suit, and "The Tree of Life" is no exception. This meditation on life, death, God and the origin of the universe can be described as nothing short of visually masterful, but as well as Malick commands everything within his frame, he has a lot of trouble commanding his audience's attention span.Not that he cares  or should. Malick is cinema's finest poet, and poetry has always been an art form belonging to the artist. We are not meant to understand "The Tree of Life," but to be affected by it, struck by it in some way. The general public won't take kindly to this, but anyone with an eye for expert filmmaking had to tip the hat to Malick's latest."The Tree of Life" tells a non-linear story using non-linear visual sequences. Jack (Hunter McCracken as a boy, Sean Penn as a man) grew up in Texas in the '50s to a kind and spirited mother (Jessica Chastain) and a tough-love father (Brad Pitt). Although we know Jack loses his brother at the age of 19, this has little bearing on the rest of the story, though it complicates older Jack's perspective. We then see the universe in action, followed by Jack's life growing up.The film ultimately becomes about Jack forgiving his father for making him "choose" between his parents, for the psychological damage done to him because of his father's strict rules and rough life lessons. We see this in scenes best described as fleeting memories accompanied by voice overs of the characters' conversations with God.As we all do in less cinematic ways, Malick wrestles here with faith and with our place in the world as individuals. Rarely, however, does he manage to make a concise point about any of this. Also, the film's emotional impact comes only from the way we see Pitt's character treat his children and how it damages Jack. There's a disconnect then between what the film is about and how it leaves its deepest impression.Pitt and Chastain give excellent performances despite the fact that "Tree of Life" is not a film about performances, at least not in the traditional sense. As much as they must be able to act, they must also be able to soak up the camera and bask in the expert lighting. That's what it takes to be in a Malick film. McCracken also impresses considering how little he's given to say.Not enough can be said about the beauty of this film. Malick's camera takes on a life of its own, moving fluidly throughout scenes and only pausing to capture something remarkable, usually with regards to light. Surely if he devoted these skills to more traditional storytelling he'd be among the most celebrated filmmakers alive.It's easy to dismiss "The Tree of Life" as pretentious. Unquestionably we expect certain things from film that we don't expect from poetry; we value accessibility in our movie-going experiences and "The Tree of Life" offers little of that. At the same time, it has valuable things to say and does so with a visual power rivaled by little else.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site, moviemusereviews.com
I think "Raising Arizona" is more a comedy in that you are in awe of the complete stupidity of every one of the Coen brothers' characters. There aren't that many "jokes," it's just all sort of ridiculous. The Coen brothers first successful comedic film is pretty much a stranger version of their later comedies, taking a small time crook story and expanding it in terms of weird. Most criminals aren't smart or clever and the Coen brothers let you know that for sure.In the film, Nicholas Cage plays a repeat convict named H.I. McDunnough who convinces a cop named Ed (Holly Hunter) to marry him somehow. The couple then decides the American dream for them is having a baby, so their plan is to steal a quintuplet of a wealthy business owner. Though they are successful, it's not that simple, especially with a $25,000 reward for the baby.The Coen brothers create the dumbest criminals and most irresponsible human begins to grace to the silver screen (that are actually believable and not just dumb for laughs). We don't quite get to know any of the characters that much, we just know all of their motivations: money or children. Cage, early in his career, shows success in a role that would seem out of character for him in this decade. John Goodman as H.I's escaped convict friend and Frances McDormand and Sam McMurray as family friends with crazy kids round out a pretty great cast.I can't really overstate the weirdness of this movie. There are some strange fight scenes, lots of unnecessary screaming, a guy riding a motorcycle with two shotguns on his back--there is a clear intention to be outside of normal here. Though as the Coen brothers later prove they're unbeatable at, it's not without some poignancy.Oddly enough, the way these characters come into conflict with ideas of the real world, like the reality of taking care of a child and its demands, is quite effective. The viewer is so wrapped up in the characters' blind motivations that those things that are obvious to people about responsibility in the real world sneak up to you in the film. There is also the whole "crime doesn't pay" mentality in terms of immediately satisfying your wants, but what makes "Raising Arizona" stand out for the Coen brothers is the sense of the American dream, even if it comes across as strange the whole film, it's definitely genuine. How the Coen brothers get you to see that amid absurdity is a secret they should tell no one, but it's incredible.
A child's point of view can change your entire perspective. Steven Spielberg has always demonstrated a gift for bringing that child-like sense of wonder and working with young actors, most notably in writing "The Goonies" and directing "E.T." In "Empire of the Sun," he shows us war-torn China and Japan through the eyes of a 12-year-old Christian Bale. The 1987 war epic marks the director's first of what would become several powerful war stories and only his second dramatic feature after "The Color Purple." There's maybe a split-second shot of some people on the street wearing swastikas, but otherwise, "Empire of the Sun" is not a "same old" World War II film. Considering the war films he's know for, kudos to Spielberg for focusing this story on one fraction of WWII and the survival of a young boy separated from his parents who is forced to lose his innocence in the throws of war.Jamie (Bale), lives in a lovely home with servants and his parents in Shanghai. He's lived there his whole life as the British have had a presence there for a long time. He has a wild imagination, loves airplanes and sees the world with rose-colored glasses as he ought to at his age. When the Japanese invade in December of '41, Jamie gets separated in the streets from his parents and begins a brutal journey that ultimately brings him to Soo Chow internment camp where he's known as Jim. He carves a new life for himself as a crafty and inspiring young man.Tom Stoppard, who had just received an Oscar nomination for Terry Gilliam's "Brazil," doesn't provide an eventful script, but does create a compelling portrait of Jamie/Jim. His journey could rank as one of the most complete and intriguing child story lines in film history. Although the film is based on the semi-autobiographical novel by J.G. Ballard, Stoppard finds the key moments and visual symbols and metaphors to guide us through Jim's journey. At first Jim's painfully naive, running up to Japanese soldiers and shouting that he surrenders. Spielberg nearly convinces us he's going to get beat to death by one of them at any moment, but he's more so lost and clueless in these early stages. We watch Jim grow wiser throughout the film, or at least craftier and more tenacious, but Spielberg makes sure that he never looks or acts like a miniature adult. At a key, tender moment sometime in the bulk of the 150-minute film, Jim confesses through tears that he can't remember what his parents look like anymore. Neither can we -- it's been that kind of journey and we've been in Jim' shoes (a pair of golf shoes for much of the film) that whole time.Jim's outlook makes him an inspiring character, certainly one that adds refreshment to a war story that could have been and has been told in many ways using many different wars. This character arch is the winning feature of "Empire of the Sun." Little else nominates it for discussion among all-time great war films, but the perspective of a boy changes everything for the better.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Forty years later, it's much harder to call John Schlesinger's film "Midnight Cowboy" avant- garde, but the greatest X-rated film of all time is as much a reflection of the '60s as it is a study of unusual and pitiable characters.Joe Buck (Jon Voight) is a cowboy by attitude, hustler by trade who travels to New York City in hopes of making a killing on the massive numbers of sexually frustrated urban married women. Unfortunately, Joe is not only naive, but all kinds of stupid and he's haunted by a difficult past that comes to us in trippy flashbacks edited like a classic horror film. In the city he meets Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a scummy pickpocket with a bum leg who offers to be his "manager."The sexuality of the film is nothing surprising to the modern viewer, but for 1969 it's conceivable that it was. The original tagline was "Whatever you hear about "Midnight Cowboy" is true." That gives you a sense of what it was perceived as upon its release. Prostitution is a constant (although nudity not as gratuitous as one might expect), homosexuality is suggested on more than a couple occasions and the sexual liberation of women is acknowledged. That's a lot for that era, which combined with Woodstock makes '69 the beginning of a new one.Look behind the shocking social issues in "Midnight Cowboy," however, and there's a much simpler quality story that most film-lovers watching today will tap into. Religious fanatic Mr. O'Daniel (John McGiver) gets it out early when he questions Joe about his loneliness. From then on, despite the conscious objectives of the film and its characters to try and make a living and survive in a downtrodden NYC, "Midnight Cowboy" is about all the characters having the satisfaction of companionship in every sense and on every level.Very little positive happens to Joe because of his lack of street smarts. He keeps getting screwed over or taken advantage of by everyone in the city until Rizzo changes his mind and the two look out for each other. The way these two handle their adversity is the most interesting part and what really allowed Voight and Hoffman to earn their Oscar nominations.Another way the film stands out as groundbreaking is through Schlesinger's direction. Although we're left wanting more definitive answers and insights regarding Joe's bad dreams and flashbacks about his past, they're still edited in a way that makes them critical to the story. We're able to draw our own understanding from how the past and present are stitched together, able to like or be interested in Joe because this abrupt style communicates the psychological impact it has on him."Midnight Cowboy" isn't a cathartic story, but more a simple one shrouded in social issues and more radical film-making decades ahead of its time. The way it's best appreciated now is in that light, not in the way it pushed our boundaries and took a bite out of censorship back in its day, but in the fundamental and universal message it comes to and instills in its audience about loneliness by way of unique characters that many of us might find morally questionable. ~Steven CFind more of my reviews at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
It was about a year ago that "The Soloist" was an early Oscar prediction. With a proved commodity like Jamie Foxx in a role eerily similar to his Oscar-winning turn as Ray Charles and 2008 star reborn in Robert Downey Jr. as the co-pilot, this based on a true story about a journalist and a homeless musician forging a difficult relationship seemed primed for gold. Then, much like Foxx's character Nathaniel Ayers Jr. did, "The Soloist" fell from grace. Eyeing what would be a competitive awards season, Dreamworks/Universal decided to wave the white flag and push the film to April and litter Oscar season with early TV promos. A wise move? Perhaps. The hype might no longer be there, but if it had stayed, it would have been worthy.The stars certainly carry this film. Foxx might seem like he's re-channeling "Ray" in the previews, but this character is and feels so different for him. Yet again he is transformative as a schizophrenic with a passion for music. Anyone has spent time talking with or who works with people with mental illness can attest that this is what it's like. There is a humble realism in his performance and in the choice to use actual homeless in the film. Downey Jr. also impresses with his ability to make Steve Lopez his without injecting too much of his own style: It helps keep this character separate from his others and is important in a film based on truth.Most underrated in this film is the work of director Joe Wright ("Atonement"). Always a fan of lengthy shots and sweeping camera movement, Wright makes sure "The Soloist" reflect the appreciation for art that lies at the heart of his film and the book and news columns it was based off. He has a talent for setting a mood with his camera-work and can so easily heighten the drama or tone things back when the film becomes more about the music. The scene where we see splashes of colored lights to the music with the intent of putting us in Ayers' perspective might seem boring but it's brilliant. Wright makes the most of this script and does some beautiful editing to make it feel seamless. He's sure to direct a masterpiece in the future: "The Soloist" is a bit too gritty and real to completely take off under his direction despite his fantastic work with it.The one weakness that would have kept "The Soloist" from Academy recognition had it stayed in the running was the fact that the script often suffered from the same condition as its focal character: schizophrenia. It takes quite a bit of time for "The Soloist" to decide what it's about, but it comes together very nicely. It's a film about their relationship, but then there are moments of Lopez's personal life and flashbacks of Ayers' life before he became ill. Susannah Grant ("Erin Brockovich") does a nice job making all these important elements work, at least in certain portions of the film. Others parts, namely toward the middle, lag a bit, but considering what Wright and the talented actors, including the always lovable Catherine Keener as Lopez's ex, manage to do with it, it was quite well done.~Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com
Ever since "The Nightmare Before Christmas" there has been an inexplicable connection between stop-motion animation and horror motifs. Tim Burton has been responsible for most entries in this small but noticeable canon, but Laika has found an equally quirky yet more mainstreamed alternative in Chris Butler's "ParaNorman."Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) can see dead people, namely the ghosts of his town, a Salem-inspired village named Blithe Hollow. His "gift" has made him the victim of bullying at school and because he can see his dead grandmother at home, his parents (Leslie Mann and Jeff Garlin) think he's just acting out and can't move on.The story of the gifted and misunderstood outsider perfectly overlaps both horror and family film tropes, but in spite of the ghosts, witches and undead, "ParaNorman" is significantly less scary than Laika's previous feature, "Coraline." The creature-feature vibe adds character and a distinctive vibe to what's otherwise a story geared toward kids.As you might imagine, Norman's ability to see and talk to the dead turns into everyone's last hope. Norman's estranged relative Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman), who shares Norman's gift, passes a critical responsibility onto Norman: keep the witch, who cursed the people of Blithe Hollow years ago after being condemned to die, from raising the dead.With the unrequested help of his new friend, Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), a pretty dumb kid but one who's thick-skinned and ever cheerful, Norman sets out to uncover the truth to what happened in Blithe Hollow years ago and fulfill his responsibility. His bratty sister (Anna Kendrick) and Neil's brother, Mitch (Casey Affleck), also get wrapped up in the adventure."ParaNorman's" top highlight is without a doubt the visual artistry. With the assistance of computers, stop-motion animation can look absolutely incredible, and when you consider the multitude of supernatural occurrences in the film, it could not have been easy to execute. The general design of the production has this excellent abstract and asymmetrical style that works really well, especially in the character design. Stop-motion has always opted for caricature as opposed to realism, but the Cubist slant of "ParaNorman" stands out among Burton-inspired claymation.Of all these aforementioned qualities, however, none suggests a unique family film experience or gives reason to elevate "ParaNorman" ahead of other horror-themed movies for kids. Helping "ParaNorman" entertain all-ages audiences is its clever incorporation of actual horror movie techniques and homages to everything from B-movie horror to '80s slashers. These nuggets are tastefully and sharply included rather than stuffed in, which isn't hard considering the film is a breeze to watch.And you can't discredit the heart needed to make a family film resonate. "ParaNorman" uses a simplistic delivery method for its themes of what it means to be different and how that should or shouldn't impact how you treat others, but while it's overt in that sense and arguably even tailors its plot to send that message, the message itself is a fundamental question of human nature. In today's movies, revenge is so often a substitute for a more complicated character motivation, but Butler breaks it down and addresses it in a way that's appropriate and easy to understand/consider.Much of "ParaNorman" at a surface level lacks originality, but Butler and co-direct Sam Fell make up for it with rich visual detail, clever references and a sincere, amusing wit. It offers something for kids, parents and horror fans of all ages, all while going down pretty smooth. The effort behind this film offers all the more evidence why animated filmmakers are by far the smartest and most creative among other genres.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
This is one Spike Lee joint that I'm definitely smoking. A film that received a weak release from Disney's Buena Vista/Touchstone Pictures and consequently made barely $13 million, "25th Hour" is a gem that many will stumble upon (such as myself) and pat themselves on the back for a good find. David Benioff pulls off one of the better self-written-book-to-screenplay adaptations possibly ever, especially for a guy with no prior screen writing experience at the time. The scenes are elegant (with some help from director Lee) and the messages both real and potent. The story centers around Montgomery Brogan (Edward Norton), who has just been busted by the DEA for dealing and wants to make the most of his final 24 hours before getting locked up.But "25th Hour" is no "drugs 'n thugs" drama. Monty's drug-dealing life stays in the periphery of the film with hardly so much as a reference. Benioff and Lee are much more concerned with the concept of a man about to pay a tough price for a past mistake and how he might view the world and handle the relationships with those closest to him.Monty chooses first to visit his father (Brian Cox) that evening. Meeting at the bar his father owns where he primarily serves cops and fire fighters (keep in mind the film was made in a barely post-9/11 NYC setting), he takes a bathroom break where a simple "f*** you" message written on the mirror sends him on a voice-over monologue tirade, uttering aforementioned curse about every single sect of the Big Apple's population before laying it on himself. Lee, whose love for the city of New York is anything but a secret, continues his tradition of the city as a character in this way. Monty is mostly angry at himself, but he has something to get off his chest, which is that no one, not even the millions of New Yorkers not going to jail, are free of flaws. Dealing and letting it get too far was Monty's flaw and simply he must pay for it.The rest of the night takes place predominantly at a night club run by the man Monty works for, Uncle Nikolai. He brings along his two closest friends, Frank (Barry Pepper) and Jake (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as well as his girlfriend, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), who he believes might have ratted on him about the money stored up in his apartment that the feds found. The film favors its ensemble heavily, providing each actor a terrific opportunity to show multiple facets to his or her character. Pepper usually fills in screen space in most films, but he complicates his investment broker character by making him flip from self-assured to emotionally confused. Hoffman works his subtlety as a high school teacher clearly not in control of his life when his student (Anna Paquin) flirts with him. Dawson plays nicely off the script's implication that she might have secrets to hide.Aside from the poor casting of NFL player Tony Siragusa as a key character and some odd epic fantasy battle scoring from longtime Lee collaborator Terence Blanchard, "25th Hour" is near-perfect execution of a story taking place in a short time window: no overly dramatic plot twists, but character-building and message-fueled dialog with a strong application of epiphany. All the more beautiful is how it echoes the post-9/11 message of enduring despite yourself or someone else pummeling you to the point where it appears there is nothing left.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Very few films have been made with seniors as the main characters. It seems that Hollywood producers are convinced we prefer to see younger people on the screen -- and they're probably right. "Cocoon" is a rare elderly-focused take on the fountain of youth concept, an ancient motif that's enough proof in itself that humans desire young age, whether in general or at the movies. Although science fiction, "Cocoon" is simple and mild-mannered like its lovable old protagonists. It might be light on drama but it's big on heart.Loaded with stars from yesteryear, among them Don Ameche, Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy and Gwen Verdon, one could say "Cocoon" was an '80s alien movie made specifically for an older crowd. And that's fair -- they deserve it. It's as if director Ron Howard was hoping to give his cast some of their youth back in letting them take prominence in the film, based on a story by David Saperstein and screenplay by Tom Benedek. It's not riveting sci-fi material but it prompts an honest conversation about aging, one that in reality someone of any age could understand and appreciate.The film takes place in a senior living center in St. Petersburg, Florida. As part of their recreation time, three of the senior men enjoy swimming in the abandoned pool just through the woods around the center. When a strange group of people come in and buy the old house and rent a boat at the dock, the stubborn old guys still come to swim in the pool, only it appears the people are storing rocks in the water. They swim anyway and find that with the rocks in the pool (actually alien cocoons) that they feel energetic, rejuvenated -- and younger.Howard's film is easygoing. There is not a lot of suspense or gripping conflict. Instead, you watch and get a kick out of the way these seniors and their wives behave having been affected by the water. Their sex drive, for example, reappears to comic effect and there's general misbehavior. They all come off as bigger children and each have a different reaction to this "cheating" of age. Thus the film's core conflict of whether it's right to defy nature appears and guides the rest of the film. It's a replacement for any major form of antagonism."Cocoon" is touching because the story is very frank in portraying these seniors as having nothing to live for but each other and whatever remaining family they have. When you're that old, a chance at prolonged life is like being granted a whole new world of opportunity whereas you're just biding time when you're old and physically and mentally unable to do the things you used to.There have been better stories, better special effects (although this one an Oscar in 1985) and better science-fiction films, so "Cocoon" is best appreciated as a unique film about old age, something movies rarely focus entirely upon.~Steven CVisit my site! http://moviemusereviews.com
Filmmaker James Cameron's constant yen to explore the unknown has taken us to the future, the depths of space and now the deepest caverns of the ocean. "The Abyss" is an underwater survival story with a science-fiction bend. It is a trip into the depths of what we know exists on this planet but can't truly fathom. (I think that's two unintended puns already, sorry.) Then it throws in an extra-terrestrial element, which to be honest, probably doesn't need to be there. "The Abyss" is about a team of oil drillers hired by the military to investigate a sunken nuclear submarine. When a hurricane strikes their surface crew, their underwater station is nearly destroyed, tension between the drillers led by Virgil (Ed Harris) and the military men led by Lt. Coffey ("Terminator" star Michael Biehn) grows. This is then escalated by Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), Virgil's wife, who discovers an iridescent sea creature is among them.What makes "Abyss" pale in comparison to Cameron's prior achievements of the 1980s is simply its non-chalant approach to character. Cameron simply tries to compensate for his idea-driven script by dialing up the romantic tension between Virgil and Lindsey whose marriage is days away from ending when they embark on the mission. We would see '90s films such as "Armageddon" try and emulate this model for romance in a survival film and Cameron himself would get it right in his 1997 blockbuster, "Titanic." This time around, however, it's painfully forced and essentially ineffective.As a concept survival thriller a la a Michael Crichton novel, "Abyss" is solid and entertaining. Maybe not the full two and a half hours, but most of the way through. The situations are well thought out, logical and suspenseful. A couple scenes later on take hacks at the credibility of the story and some character motivation overall is questionable, particularly Biehn's character, but as a "how do we logic our way out of drowning" movie, it's spot-on. Harris commands Cameron's team leader role and with some exception Mastroantonio does her part as the strong female character he strives to have in his films.The reason I don't think the science-fiction element had to be part of this film was that it didn't really exist other than jumpstart the conflict, escalate the conflict and bail the characters out in the grand finale. In other words, it was a cop-out for the script and an excuse for Cameron to pioneer some visual effects. Maybe you can't blame him in the E.T- obsessed '80s for including it, but looking at "Abyss" among the sci-fi greats, which includes some of Cameron's other films, it doesn't compare favorably. Yet, Cameron manages to do what he does best, use great visuals and write stories that compel and resonate so easily with his audience.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
There's always been an inexplicable connection between music, love and the movies. Certain songs always seem to set the tone for various kinds of love and romance in film, whether the light-hearted or the dramatic. What "High Fidelity" does is make a film that not only uses the power of that emotional mixture, but focuses on it and attempts to understand it. "High Fidelity" is the story of Rob (Cusack), a vinyl store owner and his understanding of his most recent break up with Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle) through analyzing his Top 5 worst break-ups. Rob's affinity for music and being a self-proclaimed "professional appreciator" of music clearly influences his understanding of love and his quest for some kind of greater fulfillment.Written by a team of writers including Cusack himself and based on a novel by Nick Hornby, "Fidelity" takes on a first-person narrative structure, with most of the story being Rob talking directly into the camera. Normally narration is voiced over or kept distant from the action of a film, but this choice for "Fidelity" creates an intimate relationship between Rob and the audience. Part of this success is how natural Cusack takes to the part. You believe he's treated you as a close friend the entire time--there's no lack of sincerity whatsoever. In general, it's a technique that works phenomenally for this movie because it's all about trying to make sense of love and seeing how music influences that. There are many people out there who strongly identify their emotions with music and those people will absolutely love this film. It is candid, witty, mature and it's dead on when it comes to identifying with music appreciators. Not a lot of films really connect to audiences on this level. There's no glorifying of romance when all is said and done--it's not overdone Hollywood style--it's just honest and doesn't claim to know any more about love than any of its viewers. An admirable and heart-warming depiction of how music and love simultaneously weave through our lives.
How I've never seen a stage version of Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods" is still a head-scratcher. My high school theatre department put on the twisted fairy tale the year after I graduated (much to my disappointment) and it has eluded me ever since. The point, excuse my digression, is it's very rare for me to go into a movie musical knowing very little of the show, but after seeing the film and chatting with those who have seen the show, it's clear director Rob Marshall and Disney's take delivers the very qualities that made the stage musical a hit.It helps to know that James Lapine, who wrote the book of the musical, wrote this screenplay. Even though he doesn't have final say in the film, there's no criticizing the movie's loyalty to the source material. This is not a Disney-fied version despite the marketing-savvy casting moves of Meryl Streep as the Witch and Johnny Depp as the Wolf. This is every bit as dark, fantastical, quirky and unusual as fans of the show have led me to expect."Into the Woods" is an amalgamation of Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk and Rapunzel all centered around the story of a Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) who discover they cannot have a child because a witch (Streep) put a curse on the Baker's father many years ago. The only way to reverse it, she says, is to go into the woods and retrieve her a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn and a slipper as pure as gold. So off they go into the woods, as do the fairy tale characters whom they seek.This is not some what it looks like: a fun super mash-up of classic stories. Rather, it's a way to explore the human truths of the fairy tale genre as Sondheim does so beautifully in his lyrics. Everything about "Into the Woods" is just a bit off from what you'd expect: not too whimsical, not too intellectual, not too dark and scary, not too childish, etc. It lives in this gray area, which makes it totally unique as a work of art, albeit a bit frustrating for the movies, where audiences like to see exactly what they expect to see. Yet there seems to be "just enough" of each of these elements to make "Into the Woods" a likable film for all.Although few are as skilled as Marshall at effectively filming a musical performance for the big screen, so much of the credit for what makes "Into the Woods" enjoyable is the cast. Streep, for example, has precisely the gravitas needed for the Witch, and it's exciting to watch such a venerated actress taking on a peculiar character. She's really the tip of the iceberg though. Blunt and Anna Kendrick (who plays Cinderella) are two of the best and most versatile actresses of their generation, and they have pipes to boot; Corden, little-known but rising quickly, strikes a terrific balance of humor, pity and heart; Youngsters Daniel Huttlestone (Jack) and Lilla Crawford (Little Red Riding Hood) are terrific finds; and although with less significant roles, Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen as the princes get the film's most entertaining musical number in "Agony." Each of these actors connects with and owns the lyrics, which are the heart of the story and the true magic of "Into the Woods," but in the wrong hands (on the wrong tongues?) can feel inaccessible or superfluous. Cinderella's song "On the Steps of the Palace," for example, is her over-analyzing and being indecisive about whether (for the third time) she should run away from her Prince. It's lyrical word vomit, and while Kendrick doesn't turn it into pure gold, she effortlessly communicates her character's inner albeit excessive dilemma and makes Sondheim's point that just because in fairy tales girls are supposed to fall in love with charming princes, doesn't mean they should run off with them without a second thought.In this example it's also easy to see that "Into the Woods" can get a bit wordy and boring. It's a fairy tale story, so we expect something breezy and entertaining, not something existential and overbearing. As much as you can appreciate how Lapine and Sondheim have challenged the notion of fairy tales by turning them around on the audience, at some points it just gets boring. The film's third act, when "happily ever after" gets turned on its head, for example, is a test of patience, even though without it, the story would have no meaning and the film would therefore become artistically pointless.This problem doesn't seem to be unique to the film, but rather, has followed the show to the big screen. All the cinematic elements work nicely here from visual effects to Colleen Atwood's costumes; this is certainly the type of story that truly stands to benefit from escaping the confines of a stage. Even so, Marshall doesn't use that as license to overdo it; he gives us tastes of visual effects here and there. In a sense, this is staying true to the musical, because it's not supposed to be a pure entertainment piece."Into the Woods" doesn't get better on the silver screen, but it clearly doesn't get worse, as most fans of stage musicals fear when their favorites get adapted. I might not be able to speak from experience, but what was a likable albeit slow musical according to my "sources" has become a likable albeit slow film. Considering "Into the Woods" has a very specific message and style, the fact that Marshall and Disney honor that is something deserving of some praise.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

If "Annie Hall" had been a later Woody Allen film, you'd be ready to slap him by the end of the film's opening monologue. But in 1977, the world was not full of Allen films filled with Allen humor and "Allenisms." Thank goodness for that, because the film is truly one where his character can't be the sole focus. This is a film about Annie, as the title suggests, which really makes this movie great and still shine among the Allen repertoire.The film stars Woody Allen as his usual neurotic, pessimistic self, in the form of comedian Alvy Singer and follows the story of his life with a focus on his relationships with women and his family. The chronology of the film is off-whack with the beginning being his childhood, followed by a time where he and Annie (Diane Keaton) are not getting along followed by the story of how they met with several tangents of Alvy's past wives, etc. thrown in the mix. Allen tests your patience with his character most of the time, but Keaton as Annie is absolutely intriguing. You are drawn to her inexplicably just as Alvy is. She's a complete mess of a character, but she is so convincing and so interesting. The two of them, along with the film, are so off-beat, but that's what makes it good. The characters walking through memories like "A Christmas Carol" and talking to the camera and the scene when they're in line at the theater and the guy behind Alvy completely irritates him are very fun and don't detract from the story.Perhaps the best part of the film is that it's not so serious. It's kind of ironic that Alvy is the biggest pessimist in the world, when his film sort of treats life in a casual and humorous way that's very much how things are sometimes. "Annie Hall" shows that film doesn't have to be about an intense subject that is more interesting than anyone's normal life. Normal life with strange, weird, but normal people can make for just as good of a film. A story about a relationship between two people doesn't have to be filled with sweeping moments of love and emotion. Would all this be nearly as effective if Allen and Keaton weren't really strong, believable characters? No, probably not, but that shows that there is more to good film than a unique plot that falls into a category beyond the average person's experience.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
A two-headed thriller, "Prisoners" is one part conventional kidnapping mystery and one part psychological drama. While the mystery of who abducted two little girls haunts the entirety of the 153-minute runtime and will keep audiences glued for every minute, the film also serves as a portrait of a desperate parent willing to cross any line to get his daughter back.Those who crave the classic dark and gritty "whodunit" and also enjoy some dramatic heft and effective gravitas will find "Prisoners" an enormous gift. Exhibiting consummate filmmaking and storytelling from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, this is a true thriller that doesn't try and pull too many tricks.Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Grace (Maria Bello) and their two kids are celebrating the Thanksgiving holiday at their neighbors'  the Birches (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis)  house. At the end of the evening, the families realizes their two little girls are missing and the lonely Police Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) gets on the case. Police apprehend the practically mute Alex Jones (Paul Dano) but let him go when they can't get him to talk and don't have any evidence to bring charges. Unsatisfied, Keller, certain Jones is hiding something, abducts him and tries to get him to talk before it's too late.Writer Aaron Guzikowski, who previously adapted "Contraband" from its Icelandic predecessor, delivers a straightforward script with numerous complications. The story will get under your skin while leaving enough nuggets in the mystery to keep you captivated. Unfortunately, all the twists and discoveries might generate some difference in opinion. Nothing is done, spelled out or tied up neatly and clearly  Guzikowski cares more about symbolism and themes than satisfying answers.Villeneuve appears to be a perfect pairing with this script, as he enjoys the symbolism and setting the tone early and often. "Prisoners" has a downright creepy vibe that will keep viewers constantly paranoid. Every shot is a portrait, with due credit to veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins. The film's stunning imagery automatically sets it apart from run-of-the-mill thrillers.Jackman's performance is the only one of note in "Prisoners" despite the excellent ensemble. The roles filled by Howard, Davis, Dano, Bello and Melissa Leo as Alex's aunt could've been done by anyone. A good case could be made for Gyllenhaal too, but his character is straightforward  a detective whose primary concern is to solve the damn case to shake off his own expectations and those of others.The aspect of "Prisoners" that should garner the most praise is the way it incorporates strong character elements in with the main mystery narrative. Just as crucial to the story is the way Keller, a God-fearing man whose life philosophy is "pray for the best, prepare for the worst," begins to unravel mentally and morally after the disappearance of his child. He proves to be far from the protagonist when all is said and done and the resolution of his individual story becomes of equal importance to the resolution of the greater mystery."Prisoners" only begins to crumble a bit when it comes to sorting out the truth from the distractions and driving home the central themes. Religious imagery and ideas dominate the beginning of the movie and get peppered in throughout, but there's a lack of follow through. The notion of the unsolvable maze, which comes into play at one point, also seems relevant to the story, but is never explained. The movie wants you to think about its ideas rather than its outcomes, which is a fair request, but the outcomes better be straightforward enough to discern and in many cases they aren't.Dark, cold and troubling, "Prisoners" is a brooding thriller with both substantial dramatic and mystery elements. Villeneuve is a talent to keep an eye on in the future as with Guzikowski, despite the flaws in the wrap-up of the film. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
"Changeling" reminds me a lot of 1997 thriller "L.A Confidential" in that it deals with police corruption and P.Ds' frightening level of power. The problem with that is "Changeling" takes place about 25 years earlier -- same police department, same problems, different era. It's unfortunate how incompetent our criminal justice system was and in many ways still is and that's what makes "Changeling" such a difficult film to stomach. It invokes rage, sadness, disgust and sympathy -- and when you've had enough it keeps going. But it's a beautifully realized period piece and a quality film from all aspects.Although "Changeling" earned Oscar nominations in deserved categories such as cinematography and art direction, it's hard to understand why there wasn't any love for J. Michael Straczynski's thoroughly reported original screenplay. This is one of those stories that's so unbelievable and so unsettling that you can't make it up and despite its length, Straczynski tells it in a compelling and emotional way."Changeling" is about Christine Collins (Jolie), an L.A. single mother whose son Walter disappears for several months. When the police find him, she insists right away that he's not her son and the police department insists that she's wrong. When the case builds in publicity, she's shipped off to a psychiatric hospital, but a politically passionate reverend (John Malkovich) as well as a young boy's story might uncover the truth.There are so many painful and uncomfortable elements to this story that you wish it weren't true. You almost want to be spared the emotional agony of all the lying, corruption, torture and death. It's by no means a horror movie, of course, but each subject matter is heavy. Part of the film, for example, deals with the case of a serial murderer who has killed children. That's weighty stuff, and while it stirs up our emotions and makes the film more powerful, it doesn't change that it's tough to bear.Director Clint Eastwood and star Angelina Jolie are an excellent match in this film. They try and plant us deep down within Christine Collins without overplaying the clichés of a woman who cries wolf but the powers that be declare her insane. Knowing Collins is a self- sustaining single mother, Jolie plays her with much more inner resilience. Eastwood includes her face at nearly every juncture of the main story's aftermath and you get the perfect sense of how she's feeling. That's critical because despite all the corruption and intrigue of the story, this is still her life and livelihood here. No one has more at stake than she does.This troubling true story is top-notch film-making, an exquisite stone lost beneath a pile of rare and more exotic cinematic gems that comprised the great year for film that was 2008. The costumes and period detail is vivid and Eastwood's cinematographer Tom Stern does some of his finest work wrapping characters in the shadows of this harrowing film.~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.com
"Mamma Mia!" is one of those movies that looks like it was more fun for the cast than it was for the audience. The actors look like they're having a blast dancing on the shores and piers of various Greek islands, while in the meantime we sit in a theater trying to hum our way through another poor conversion of a stage musical to the silver screen.The musical, based on music by Swedish pop group ABBA, was written for the stage by Catherine Johnson, who also writes the screenplay. Bringing her vision to life is fellow Brit theatre director Phyllida Lloyd. Between them, the two haven't a lick of real movie-making experience and it shows. Stage minds should never be put in charge of a movie, something proved many a time, most recently Susan Stroman's "The Producers" movie, the Mel Brooks musical she directed on stage. The thinking of theatre minds does not grasp the scope of film and so "Mamma Mia!" looks more like a scrapbook of music montages, cheesy dances and bad MTV videos.The hit Broadway show takes some narrative suggestions in the lyrics of several ABBA songs and dreams up a way to thread them together, really quite genius. A young girl named Sophie (Amanda Seyfried, most notably the ditzy Karen from "Mean Girls") is getting married on a Greek island where her former pop singer mother (Streep) runs a hotel. Unsure of who her father is but curious, she invites the only three possible candidates in hopes she'll find out which one it is. The men are older English hunks Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and not-so- much-hunk Stellan SkarsgardThe musical is diluted on the screen by a feeling that all the songs need to be included, that the show can naturally translate when in fact it's more of a showy feel-good musical and not a very visual story. Numbers are forced and the camera feels lost because it doesn't know what to focus on. When it runs out of ideas, terrible things happen like an image of Meryl Streep's face in a roulette wheel singing about money. Johnson and Lloyd between them have no creative answers and settle with stage direction.Even as talented as Streep is, some of the things she's asked to do in this movie have me convinced she just took the money and said "I'll at least have fun with this." Her talents help most in the drama between mother and daughter and perhaps she rubs off on Seyfried who is really quite nice too. Both have the best singing voices in the movie too, though Streep does have to stylize her singing a bit more to make up for her vocal shortcomings. On the opposite of that spectrum is Brosnan, who must've worked tirelessly with a vocal coach to no avail. Clearly star power was valued more than musical talent in much of the casting.Most of the cast has great chemistry, but I would too if I were out there wining and dining in Greece with all these notable actors when the camera wasn't rolling. Fun is easy to capture on camera -- a stage musical is not. Truthfully, it's worth the higher admission price to see the show again or even just listen to its soundtrack than waste time with this movie version. It's all about the music anyway.
When a zombie film gets a sequel, the assumption is that the producers are looking for ways to make more guts, gore and money. But "28 Weeks Later" is just as sharp as its predecessor in nearly every way, primarily in continuing the sci-fi post-apocalyptic elements that have clearly been thought out and made believable as they were with "28 Days Later." "Days" director Danny Boyle stays on in co-executive producer capacity for "Weeks" and it shows. He finds Juan Carlos Fresnadillo to direct, who demonstrates a thorough understanding of Boyle's vision for the abandoned, infected England all the way down to camera technique. Although Boyle has no credits for the story, it's hard to imagine he wasn't the primary consultant. "28 Weeks" brings us back to London the titular amount of time later, when one area of the city has been quarantined to start the re-population of the country (under the command of the U.S military -- what a scary thought for Brits that must be ... ). Smartly, the story focuses on one family reunited as the children were abroad during the breakout and the father (Robert Carlyle) managed to survive.But despite the rebuilding process, little is sunny about "28 Weeks Later." It's still more zombie flick than anything else. When the kids' mother is found, she turns out to be a carrier of the infection without it taking over her body. However, it manages to spread and all descends into utter chaos when the military calls Code Red. The film's snowball effect of suspense and violence simultaneously acts as both its best and worst attribute. It's highly entertaining yet absolutely crazy.Using the microcosm of the reunited family (which doesn't stay reunited for long) helps ground the film. All post-apocalyptic action films that do well stay focused on the characters and "28 Weeks" gets off to an excellent start in terms of both character development and intensity. Even when the focus goes away from the parents and to Jeremy Renner and Rose Byrne's characters who try and help the kids to escape the area, you grow to like their character easily because they keep things sane in the midst of panic and a restless script.Fresnadillo carries an entire arsenal of techniques with him and deploys them all in the hour and a half runtime. Some of the scenes jump around too much and are too dark to make any sense of what's going on, but some are scarily effective. One scene in the subway is entirely done in nightshot and borrows on "found footage"-style horror techniques while a key infection sequence is a wrenching game-changer.Zombie fans will be pleased with the follow up to the film that re-launched the zombie genre for the 21st Century and won't find any brains (as in intelligence), scale or character sacrificed as a result. "Weeks" carries the promise of a franchise that could rival George A. Romero's zombie empire.~Steven CVisit my site http://movimeusereviews.com
Time and time again people have criticized movies like "The DaVinci Code" with that movie- bashing mantra "it's not as good as the book." To say that this doesn't apply to Ron Howard's adaptation would be wrong, but it does deserve, in a few areas, more credit than it is given. It is a strong adaptation of a best-seller, but does little else to make it a great movie.First of all, a movie is a movie and book is a book, and as such there are things that make good books good books and good movies good movies. With that said, the key to an adaptation of a book to a movie is to take an already good book and translate it so that it can also do what good movies do. With DaVinci, this movie does a few of these good things. A good movie is visually interesting and Howard's greatest strength is bringing images and art to a novel that is strongly art-associated. To understand Brown's books better is to look up and see the images of the art he mentions. Howard also visually creates the historical explanations that are simply dialog in the book. That, and the dark, mysterious nature of the book comes out in Howard's visual choices.Another signature of a good movie is good characters. The trouble is Brown's novel is so plot-driven, that only the book could allow someone telling this story enough time to give insight into the characters. Howard decides accordingly that the plot is most important here, and Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou's talent goes to waste and their "normal people" characters suffer as a result. They become mere pawns of the greater themes, theories and ideas the book has founded its popularity on. The only character who gets time devoted to him is Paul Bettany's devoutly religious and murderous character Silas. Him, and Ian McKellan's quirky Sir Leigh Teabing, another theorist on the sacred feminine subject.With a plot-driven adaptation, 'DaVinci' and especially Ron Howard can only do so much, and though I'm not one of them, anyone who is unfamiliar with the book can enjoy the movie more on plot and theory alone. Especially being released in a time where the book is still incredibly popular, I don't hesitate to believe audiences who read the book expected new light to be shed on the story through film, not something a straight adaptation can provide. So if you're looking for a movie to strengthen your love of the book's ideas, you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours of a book put to the screen, this movie does a more than satisfactory job of it.
"Breach" is one of those thrillers that relies on its cast rather than plot intricacies in order to stay exciting. Chris Cooper, Ryan Phillippe and Laura Linney give performances that truly give the film its legs.The always phenomenal Chris Cooper excels in the two-faced and mysterious role of Robert Hanssen, the most destructive spy in U.S history, giving a performance so strong that throughout the entire film viewers will formulate various opinions about his character and be intrigued by his every reaction. Ryan Phillippe, who plays an aspiring FBI agent assigned to track Hanssen's every move, does a superb job portraying the uneasiness of his character at having to deal with this situation, but also hits high notes when his character is lying to Hanssen that are incredibly convincing. His character is very well-developed in the script and he does it justice on the screen as it becomes apparent how interconnected and conflicted his work and personal life become.Credit is also due to Billy Ray, writer and director of this film and also "Shattered Glass," another film that focuses on truth and deception while masterfully showing the conflicted mind of a young man. Ray gives his actors the attention they deserve--there is nothing glitzy with the way this film is shot, he simply allows his actors to thrive and make a straightforward plot have life as it is seen in his characters."Breach" is not a highly intelligent thriller. It is meant to be more of an emotional one, one that clearly shows the dangers and hardships that falsity and deception bring while posing a few questions mostly toward the end about loyalty and trust. Had these points been more balanced throughout with some more insight into the enigma of Robert Hanssen, this would be an Oscar-caliber film. Instead it is a notch below but not any less worthy of watching.
Robert Kenner's documentary "Food, Inc." sounds like something you've heard of before. When Eric Schlosser's book "Fast Food Nation" first woke America up to the horrific way that fast food meat is processed and Morgan Spurlock's documentary "Super Size Me" exposed the deadly health concerns of too much fast food, most Americans began to associate fast food with unhealthy food. The organic food movement began to take off and most well- educated Americans began to take what's in their food more seriously. But it hasn't been enough -- "Food, Inc." breaks down why in this highly educational investigative film.The documentary highlights the problem on a corporate scale. Although we appear to have a wealth of options at the supermarket, just because we're not buying from the big companies or going to the fast food restaurants as much doesn't mean we're not buying from the same process. The food industry has changed so much over the last 50 years because of the big companies that the way cattle, chicken and pigs are raised have completely changed. The battle for healthier and safer food goes beyond choosing fast food.Kenner visits chicken farmers who are basically controlled by the big industry names. Not moving toward more engineering and efficiency is cause for loss of contract. These farmers are constantly in debt to meet these standards imposed by the major brands and thus have to meet them in order to work out of debt. He talks to a soybean cleaner being run out of business by Monsanto, the company that engineered a pesticide-resistant soybean and won the right to enforce that patent so that no farmer could save an unused engineered bean.The strength of the food lobby and the business people making the policy decisions in government is incredible. Kenner shows us how protected they are, reminding us of when Oprah was sued for saying she wouldn't eat another burger on her show and had to fight forever before winning the case. The disconnect between the decision-makers and the farmers is vast."Food, Inc." also tries to inform us as much as possible for ways to instigate change, rather than let us be completely overwhelmed by the apparent lack of control both the public and farmers have over food production. There are people out there fighting (such as the mother- turned-advocate of a boy who died of e.coli infection) and there's proof that consumer choice can drive even the giants like Wal-Mart to do things like only provide milk from cows without growth hormone. It also doesn't lean on the many possible gross-out factors. If you've been eating processed meat all your life, you won't come out of this film saying "I'm going to be a vegetarian," but you'll be wiser when it comes to your food purchases and who you support (namely organic and local brands) when you are at the grocery store.Food production has changed so much that it feels like "Food, Inc." is opening up a huge can of worms in terms of just how much is wrong with the process, but the awareness that it will create in each of its viewers is enough to justify the documentary's broad scope.~Steven C Visit my site at http://movimusereviews.com
The Pixar library stands as modern animation's most impressive by far, partly due to both the studio and Disney's belief that sequels should only be made with the right artistic reasons in mind, namely a good story. That's why, to date, we have just "Toy Story 2," "Toy Story 3" and ... "Cars 2" ... ? The original "Cars" has largely been considered the worst of the Pixar movies, in the same way that Pluto might be considered the worst of the nine planets. So why create a sequel? The answer that's hard to hear is that "Cars" has done incredible merchandising business compared to the other Pixar films. The less cynical answer would be that its director, Pixar head honcho and young boy at heart John Lasseter, loves the "Cars" universe  a lot. "Cars 2" plays out as a fantasy for a 6 to 10-year-old boy, one that cares much more about sheen than story, despite Pixar consistently championing that phrase the other way around.In fairness, "Cars 2" does everything a sequel should in terms of widening the scope, upping the action and improving the overall visuals. Pixar set the bar for technical mastery in digital animation and every animator and member of the production team meets that standard if not exceeds it. It's the story under the hood that struggles, choosing fun as its main objective as opposed to heart.And "Cars 2" has fun by the tankful. Lasseter, Brad Lewis and Dan Fogelman's story takes the "Cars" universe and throws "James Bond" into it, a cocktail most definitely shaken and not stirred. The film introduces British secret agent cars Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) who are trying to find out what the dastardly Professor Z (Thomas Kretschmann) is up to at the World Grand Prix, a new race sponsored by Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), an adventurer who is now promoting his new alternative fuel source.Meanwhile, Lightning McQueen has been busy racing and winning championships when he finally returns to his old pal Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) in Radiator Springs. It's a short vacation, however, as Formula 1 race car Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) has challenged McQueen to the World Grand Prix. He accepts and brings Mater to Tokyo with him, where our secret agents believe Mater to be an American spy helping them out.Most surprisingly, Lightning McQueen takes a back seat in to Mater in this film. Agreed that Mater is one of the funnier supporting characters that Pixar has written and in this film he's equally if not more hilarious, but McQueen's quest to be the best is completely inconsequential. There's a moment, as is in just about every film where the message is about friendship, when he spurns Mater and then later tries to make amends, but it happens so early on. Any emotional impact the film could have had is zapped thanks to this and the fact that McQueen has no bearing on the spy plot.The real problem with the story of "Cars 2" can ultimately be attributed to the fact that it does not necessitate being told in a world where the characters are all cars and other vehicles. The same story could have been told with human characters and nothing would have changed. The car aspect serves only as the chance to be clever with a number of car-related jokes and gadgetry. Disappointment will resonate with a lot of Pixar fans, yet the truth is "Cars 2" is such a well- oiled machine that it's much easier to discuss what the film lacked than its strengths. The action, the wit, the cleverness and the impeccable visuals we've come to expect from Pixar make it a first-rate animated film. However, we've also come to expect an emotional pull, the feeling of being on the verge of tears for even just a bit. "Cars 2" doesn't deliver that at all, nor the feeling of artistic purpose. It feels like a studio making the best movie it could with the pieces it already had in place from its financial successful 2006 film.At the same time, if "Cars 2" brings in enough money that it funds another three years of powerful, intelligent and emotional original films like "Up," "Toy Story 3" and "WALL*E," I can deal with that.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com
John C. Reilly and Jonah Hill starring in a subdued comedic effort will likely surprise most people. How refreshing to see those names billed in a film that prefers poignancy over slapstick, that's more interested in dissecting family dynamics than forging needless laughs. It would seem the only thing going against "Cyrus" is its audience's expectations.for something more raucous, but Jay and Mark Duplass have created something much more genuine and funny in the "that's how life is sometimes" kind of way.Reilly coincidentally plays John, a middle-aged man who's been divorced for seven years but has stayed close with his ex-wife (Catherine Keener). In that time he's never put himself back out there and has become terribly lonely, that is until his ex drags him to a party where he meets Molly (Marisa Tomei), who's inexplicably drawn to his emotional candidness. All seems perfect, until John discovers Cyrus (Hill), Molly's 21-year-old son.Perhaps that reads like a screwball comedy premise, but as mentioned, other than what appears to be slight ad-lib, "Cyrus" doesn't resemble much of a mainstream comedy. John and Cyrus seem to get along well at first despite a nagging feeling that their honesty is too good to be true, which it is, although it all hits the fan much differently than you'd expect.We come at the story from John's outsider perspective as the script really begs of us to make our own assessment about Molly's parenting and Cyrus' behavior. They're very close for a mother and her 21-year-old and we get hints of how she still treats him as if he were eight. It's funny, but what sets "Cyrus" apart from another film that would use this premise is that there's no scene with him ordering her around about making food the way he likes it or obvious and uninventive scenes. A random photo of Cyrus breastfeeding well beyond his age does the trick, for example, or the fact that when John stays over they have to sleep with the door open.I have personally not seen Reilly or Hill any better than this. Hill in particular dials down his style and plays Cyrus for the emotionally troubled kid he is. He speaks much less and doesn't dominate scenes in the same way we're used to from comedies such as "Superbad." Cyrus is like a 12-year-old boy inside trying to compensate for it by acting much older than his actual age. Reilly does get to retain some of his oblivious goofball routine, but there's a rawness and frailty in his character that surprises throughout this film.Compared to these two, Tomei really looks like her Oscar-winning self. Although her roles always feel the same, she does emotionally conflicted mother rather well  at least she's not cheating on anyone in this film. As a woman torn between a new love and a powerful maternal connection that she's let get out of hand, she surprisingly keeps it all together with credit to the Duplasses for not writing in any scenes where she freaks out on anyone. "Cyrus" always feels civil, dodging clichés in just the simplest and most respectable of ways.Although "Cyrus" threatens to turn into a war of boyfriend vs. son on a couple occasions, it does a terrific job of creating character complexity, which most films that do become boyfriend vs. son almost always never have. We grow to despise Cyrus at a point in this film and with surprising deftness, the story sheds a new light onto him that's not a twist or turn of events, but simply real  a change of perspective. Like most true indies, "Cyrus" never goes off the comedic or dramatic deep end. Maybe that's too wishy-washy for some, but it strikes me as the perfect blend for independent film. Light- hearted, but with an unexpected thoughtfulness and complexity.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
John Carpenter's "Escape From New York" probably set the tone for dark 80s sci-fi actioners, painting that grim and barbaric picture of humanity in the future, in this case when crime has risen so much that Manhattan had to be sealed up and turned into a giant prison. Though action should probably be the least emphasized of all those words. Carpenter seems to avoid action sequences of any kind, particularly explosions, with only occasional fights and gun shootouts. "Escape from NY" is more a dark, deeply-imagined style film that grinds along like a horror film rather than gliding along on adrenaline.Carpenter's film takes place in 1997, when Manhattan has long been a prison. When Airforce One crashes inside the city and the president is missing, the US Police Force calls on a signature Carpenter anti-hero, Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell), a former military pilot with an eye patch and a chip-on-his-shoulder attitude about everything, to get him out. Plissken is one of those enigmatic heroes who you never get to know but like because he's a bad ass and because the man is trying to keep him down (Lee Van Cleef). Snake is not a terrific anti- hero as far as films go, but he carries a uniqueness about him that is easy to like. Russell plays the character pretty stoic which works for the way he's written.This is a rather grim film, with strange, pitiful characters that you never come to know or like. It's more bizarre than anything else, feeling like a horror film that's not scary or suspenseful in the way it's told and shot with all the darkness. I suppose that's not a surprise coming so soon for Carpenter after "Halloween." Maybe I come from too much of a modern action-happy perspective, but this film could have benefited from some serious explosions or intense fight scenes--some excitement. It just mulls along, staying satisfied with just being interesting with no desire to pick up the suspense with slight exception at the end.The creative concept here is rich for a great action flick, but I think even as a dark futuristic film, the concept is mostly unrealized. There's great potential to create compelling characters living in a city that's been left to them as a prison and the organizing principle of chaos that leads their lives, but Carpenter pushes to just get you through the film and have your anti- hero reluctantly give his all to save the day. So it's cool and interesting, but never really takes flight.
"I'm Not There" is in every way an art film. The concept alone of having several actors play characters resembling Bob Dylan at different stages/re-inventions of his career warrants the label "art film." Of course that wasn't enough--theses different stages don't occur in basic chronological order, they are broken into pieces and mixed around with each other, jumping back and forth. Oh, and they're all told differently--one in documentary style, one in more traditional style, one in black and white...it's continuity's worst nightmare.Films that are so structurally rebellious can often be surprisingly good, but if you're largely unfamiliar with Dylan's life it's hard to ever be completely on board with the film. I'm not a Dylan fan, not that I wouldn't want to be, but not yet at least, and I know that I was pretty lost. This movie is anything but what the modern term "biopic" encapsulates. It dared to be different, radically so and maybe creator Todd Haynes was right--the last thing Hollywood needs is another traditional musician biopic.The times that I enjoyed this film were during individual scenes. The variety of talented actors (Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Cate Blanchett) made them all particularly interesting, it was just when I tried to draw some connection between them that my brain got absolutely fried. I also found the film very visually interesting in all its different modes, so credit Haynes in that sense.Overall, "I'm Not There" has to rank in the top most uniquely told biographies. In fact for now, it's probably right up at number one. You simply can't see this film expecting to not do your end of the work. You can't just hit play with this one--bring your A game and brush up on your Dylan beforehand.
William Friedkin is a name you know, but not one you hear much about these days. The "French Connection" and "The Exorcist" director hasn't delivered anything of that quality since those days in the '70s, but he shows he's still a skilled and relevant filmmaker with his film version of the Tracy Letts play "Killer Joe."Slapped with an NC-17 for its theatrical run, "Killer Joe" is needless to say one of the darkest and definitely the most perverted film of 2012. There's no question of Letts' deliberate attempt to get under your skin and make you feel uncomfortable for even thinking about laughing, and Friedkin adds a dark and deeply engrossing ominous tone to the proceedings.The concept is simple almost Coen Brothers-esque stuff in that a small-time Texas family steps into morally blind territory when its members conspire to murder the mother/ex-wife and hire a detective who moonlights as a hit-man named Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to handle the dirty business. Chris (Emile Hirsch) is the son, a drug dealer who has run into debt trouble with his supplier and in need of lots of cash when he learns his mother's life insurance is valued at $50,000 and it would all fall to his younger sister, Dottie (Juno Temple). Dottie's okay with the idea of murder, as is their father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) and his current wife Sharla (Gina Gershon), but when Joe asks for the money up front and they can't deliver, he determines the only way he'll agree to do the job is if he's given Dottie as a retainer.McConaughey, who has had a huge year in independent film, is mesmerizing as Joe, a careful man who is all about common courtesy and keeping things under control, but has deep- seated sexual perversions. He's a perfect character for McConaughey to experiment with in that he requires an actor with distinctive coolness and charisma to spare (McConaughey to a T), but the actor excels in twisting him into a dark creature who in spite of his demeanor is completely unpredictable because we know he's capable of dark things.He doesn't steal "Killer Joe," however, as Temple delivers a complex performance as Dottie, who's innocent but not stupid. She's constantly being manipulated by her brother, father and step-mother, but she's not a pushover either. Despite being a victim of the story early on, she never comes across as helpless and Temple gives her that persistent degree of strength and confidence in what's a very exposed role.Even if you didn't know the film was based on a play, it has that distinct stage drama feel. There are characters central to the plot whom we basically never see and there are some lengthy scenes that put Letts' writing in the spotlight. The dialogue is straightforward, gripping and clever. Whereas many thrillers are driven by mystery or plot complexity, "Killer Joe" is all tension and it culminates in a riveting and unforgettable final scene.Despite the stage origins, "Killer Joe" works as a piece of cinema thanks to Friedkin's hand. There's ample use of symbolism and setting the stage (figuratively) in terms of tone. You have a sixth sense about what kind of a scene you're going to get (really dark, more comedic, or both) before the scene truly even begins. And as the director of "The Exorcist," you bet he knows how to milk the suspense. "Killer Joe" will come off to many as salacious and prurient, or at the very least sick and twisted, and perhaps some of the bolder choices in this regard have no reasonable justification, but the story is actually a study of our darker inclinations. The Smith family sets a foot into that dark pond with its decision to have the mother killed, unaware of the beast they've let into their lives. From then on it becomes about who wields power and influence, be it sexual or not, and when we choose to embrace or permit deviance  and yield to that dark power.Thanks for reading!

Quality comedies -- if they go beyond one sequel -- never come in  threes. In the case of "Little Fockers," three's a Focking mess. But we  asked for it; "Meet the Fockers" ranks as the highest-grossing  live-action comedy in the U.S., so regardless of quality, we were going  to get whatever studios served us. And sure enough, "Little Fockers"  cooks up tired modern gags, basically forgetting that the last decade  of comedy (including its two predecessors) ever existed and that we  could be won over by open mentions of sex (ooh!) and recycled dick drug  gags.  It's several years later and Greg and Pam Focker (Ben Stiller and Teri  Polo) live in Chicago with their twins, Henry and Samantha. Grandpa  Jack Byrnes (De Niro) has grown concerned over the Byrnes family legacy  as he's been having some heart issues lately and his first son-in- law,  Dr. Bob, has failed him after having an affair and getting a divorce.  As such, before he and wife Dina (Blythe Danner) arrive for the twins'  birthday, he tells Greg that he's ready to pass the torch to Greg,  who's eager but still scared about winning Jack's full approval and  becoming "The Godfocker."  The film focuses on Jack and Greg again, as expected, so among other  faults, the title "Little Fockers" is misleading. The kids are hardly  in the picture expect for cheap jokes and they're neither cute nor  talented. In a family dinner scene where Greg (with "Godfather" music  in the background) commands that Henry eat his lasagna, Henry succumbs  but then spews vomit all over his father. Whenever the film seems to  breeze about with a bit more of a sense of humor, a tasteless joke  shoots in that prompts us to do the same.   Contrivances and predictable story lines litter "Fockers" and damper  the occasional moments of humor. The familiarity we have with Greg and  Jack helps create that humor and some clever jokes actually do exist,  but the script leans on typical "misunderstanding" plot devices, most  of which were ironically used most effectively in "Meet the Parents"  and "Meet the Fockers." The whole idea of "if they worked once they'll  work again" does not apply. The "twists" of this film are set up so  conspicuously that as they unfold, it's like you know what happens  because you've seen it before. And you likely have, because there was  probably something similar in it from a previous "Focker" film.  Outside of Jack spying on Greg, who tries to keep it a secret that he's  trying to make extra cash by pushing a new erectile dysfunction drug  for a gorgeous drug rep (Jessica Alba), all the side characters and  plots are garbage. Owen Wilson returns as Kevin and the running joke  other than him being some rich worldly hippie is that he's in love with  Pam, which never amounts to anything. Alba over-ditzifies her part,  which should have been played by a nameless attractive woman, proving  she has no idea how to shake her type.  Even Bernie and Roz Focker (Hoffman and Streisand) are out of place,  squeezed in to appease the audience who expects them to show up. It's  actually unfortunate, because neither of them totally overdo their part  or annoy us with the fact that despite the same thing happening for the  third film in a row now, no one's learned their lesson. Greg actually  catches Jack spying on him on the train and after eight years of  knowing each other, Greg doesn't confront him. Sure this was for the  sake of keeping the tension up, but at some point you can't keep  milking the same goat, or cow, or cat. Yes, Jinxie returns, also with a  convenient line of dialogue from Wilson who says "I had her brought in  town for you when I heard about your heart," just to set up another pet  mischief joke that's completely out of place at the end of the film.  Basically, we're Focking tired. "Little Fockers" is simply another  example of a movie concept that's run its course and should have never  gone beyond two films and only did because of the money. In a sense,  there should be no surprises here. Then again, attempted jokes such as  young Henry randomly asking if girls poop from their vaginas at the  dinner table, could have been replaced with something more thoughtful  -- and tasteful.  ~Steven C
The best way to describe "2001: A Space Odyssey" is to call it beautiful. It portrays space with an unsettling and exciting quiet and the late Stanley Kubrick proves why he is a film-making legend.Everything from each angle, the score, to the amount of time you have to sit and think about what the heck is going on appears to be so carefully thought out and brilliantly executed. The special effects for the 60s are stunning. The symbolism and suspense of this excessively long journey into the contemplation of human existence are simply remarkable.That said, "2001" is something more of a motion picture masterpiece, not a "movie" in the modern sense of the word. With nearly an hour and a half of silent or score-only footage, "2001" is simply not meant to entertain in the modern sense of the word. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke leave much to be desired and answered and it appears they preferred it that way. It is a visual exploration into human existence and requires very open but deep focus, much like that of a poem, to even scratch the surface. It is difficult to access, but a pleasure to watch.
Things haven't exactly been great for Disney animation sans Pixar lately, so while it may be a surprise to you when I say that "Bolt" restores some faith to Disney's silver screen products, it shouldn't be a surprise that it was produced by John Lasseter, the man behind Pixar."Bolt" is not just some bizarre plot concoction like "Chicken Little" or "Meet the Robinsons" were. It's an adventure, action and friendship story that works like any good Disney film used to: with heart-warming and lovable characters as well as some silly ones. It appeals to boys with the action, girls with animals and a female human protagonist, and of course enough jokes to keep adults entertained (although this is its weakest area.)Bolt, voiced by John Travolta in sadly his best role in recent memory, is the star of an action TV show, but he's been groomed to believe the world of his show is reality. When producers demand more from the show, the plot has Penny, Disney teen sensation Miley Cyrus (a smart call on Disney's part), Bolt's co-star and owner, kidnapped. Only Bolt believes it's real and escapes into the real world to find her. To make things tough, Bolt gets shipped to New York, across the country. He befriends some critters of course, a cat and a hamster, while learning tough real world lessons on the way.The concept alone is smart when you think about it. Smart at least in the bankable sense. Superhero action movie, combined with animals, combined with an adventure that seeks to reunite two separated friends. It's like rolling "The Incredibles," "Toy Story" and "Homeward Bound" all together. Genius. The script is really quite genuine and touching, though not as humorous. It's much more geared for families and that's nice to see for once. No serious under-the-radar adult jokes. Perhaps the best line of the movie is one that directly references Pixar's "Finding Nemo."Disney plays it safe with "Bolt." If Pixar does all the riskier, more unique films, perhaps Disney animation can get away with good old formula stuff. That's definitely okay, especially if they have as much heart as "Bolt" does.
"Lucky Number Slevin" comes out firing, but instead of bullets, you get a barrage of witty lines. While the movie is not dismissible, it certainly doesn't measure up with its other smooth-talking crime movie counterparts and would be better served up with some more action and less conversation as Elvis would put it."Slevin" rolls deep with a killer cast. If Hartnett, Willis and Liu weren't enough to bring in viewers and impress them, Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley help add more intrigue where the plot often meanders. Only Kinglsey could make a rabbi-turned-mob boss character seem interesting and not simply laughable. After all, if you're going to make a film that's more about the exchange of words than punches, you'd best have the right people delivering them."Slevin" isn't devoid of appropriate gun-wielding fare, it simply opts for only showing characters pulling guns, people dropping and then cutting to the next scene. There isn't even enough time to think about suspense. There seems to be a "say something witty or die" attitude in the script. McGuigan's fast-paced directing style accommodates this motto nicely. There are a lot of interesting shots and the constant use with varying length flashbacks seem more effective than redundant.Basically, the film takes too much time trying to outsmart you plot-wise or smooth-talk you to death, either that or it simply pulls the trigger so it can smooth-talk again. enough so that it can't really become anything special or more than entertaining.
With the opportunity to show characters that are misfit superheroes that can be whatever the writer wants, it's pretty sad when "Mystery Men" is what made the final cut. It would seem on premise that this would be ripe with great satire, but instead you mostly get mush. The team handling this film should be pretty ashamed."Mystery Men" is based on a Bob Burden Dark Horse comic, which I'll admit I know nothing about, but I assume it's got some artistic integrity and way more than this film has. The characters all seem interesting enough and their backgrounds amusing, but all of that potential is completely disregarded to make room for stupid jokes and quibbling between characters, obviously a decision from the people putting this thing together.Plotwise, Champion City is protected by Captain Amazing (Kinnear), but his success makes it tough for the small-time crime fighters like Mr. Furious (Stiller), The Shoveler (Macy) and the Blue Raja (Azaria) to make a difference. Of course that changes when Casanova Frankenstein (Rush) is released from an asylum and captures Amazing.The problem here is just a lack of depth. While the plot sounds childish, there is some good spoofing going on, like how Cpt. Amazing is Lance Hunt without glasses but nobody has figured it out. Overall, it just never seems to go far enough and gets traded in for characters arguing with the old "no, you tell me," routine and useless taking over the world schemes. While some of the characters are funny, we never get enough of their personalities, just their hit or miss jokes.The color palette for this film was interesting yet scattered-brained as well and the costumes were all over the place. I think in general, lack of sufficient direction is this film's greatest weakness. I'm not surprised director Kinka Usher has never done anything and hasn't since "Mystery Men." There is no exact vision for this film other than "hodge-podge" and slapstick. In the right hands, these interesting characters could have really taken life and the humor would have followed along with it.
There's no reason Disney/Pixar's "WALL-E" shouldn't be able to compete with 2008's best films just because it's animated. Pixar compacts so much great material into this film, including incredible CGI, that I prefer it to live action. Live action could not tell the incredible story of WALL-E, the most admirable and lovable animated character to grace the screen in what feels like ages. This is truly Pixar's masterpiece: a film that takes everything you know about animated movies and rockets above and beyond it.Almost instantaneously, you fall in love with WALL-E, the only intelligent being left on Earth, which has become a wasteland full of trash, to which WALL-E is assigned to crush and organize in piles. It's remarkable how quickly Andrew Stanton's character connects with you. His love of collecting things we know as everyday objects as artifacts, his love of music and movies--the only of which he has is "Hello, Dolly!"--and just the way he goes through his day creates something so deeply and essentially human that it's impossible not to like him. He is diligent, curious, a bit of a klutz and he's infatuated with the notion of finding true love. Almost everyone can relate to that.WALL-E's world gets flipped upside down when a spaceship lands and produces EVE, a robot dispatched to Earth by the humans now living off-planet who is responsible for searching for organic life. WALL-E is instantly love-struck and courageously pursues meeting and getting to know EVE. Eventually, he follows her back to the Axiom, a ship which is full of humans but run by robots. This is where "WALL-E" goes from being a really creative and well-written film to an amazingly creative, clever and even intelligent film. It does this by painting a grim and horrifying picture of humanity that comes across as deplorable but amusing--a non- threatening but nevertheless negative depiction of a universe where humans over- commercialize and consolidate Earth and end up living their lives in space, sitting in mobile chairs and relying on robots for everything. In this sense the film borrows from "2001: A Space Odyssey" (it even borrows Strauss' music at one comical point as an homage)All throughout this plot line is the love story between WALL-E and EVE, an unusual but very basic plot in the film. Unusual in that it's not covered in drama, but simple in that the two help save each other and that dedication fosters a love and a desire to not be lonely emotionless robots unlike the stoic species that humans in the film have become. The fact that the inventive and lively robots in this film who say barely anything capture our attention gain our approval more than the humans in the film says a lot about the job that Andrew Stanton and Pixar have done with "WALL-E"Top that off with CGI that convinces you you're not watching CGI at times along with some great action sequences and this is a truly special movie. I haven't felt so moved by an animated film since I was 5 years old watching "Lady and the Tramp." Name another Pixar film you love and this one makes it look amateurish. If you have any appreciation for good visual storytelling, you will love this film and easily pardon its lack of dialogue and occasional slow parts because of the piece of art that it is.
It's hard  impossible really  to understand why a person would commit an atrocity like a mass killing. We understand loneliness, anger, desperation  but what pushes someone that far over the edge? So often we chalk it up to mental illness, often to avoid the discomfort of attempting to fathom that kind of empathy. "We Need to Talk About Kevin" stares this notion down through the lens of a mother's grief, guilt and self-inflicted punishment.The subject matter isn't an easy one, and not because of the sensitive topic, but because it's so hard to relate to any scenario that could possibly lead down such a dark path. Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay dares to lead the way, crafting one of the most emotionally challenging film experiences you'll ever have. "Kevin" is frustrating, horrifying and difficult to sympathize with it, while also chillingly poetic and visually poignant. Ramsay, who directs a script she co-adapted from Lionel Shriver's book, boldly and beautifully weaves together different parts of the mother, Eva's (Tilda Swinton), story. There's the tortured present-day Eva trying to live with all this, her flashbacks to the day her son Kevin (Ezra Miller) commits a school massacre, and scenes that recount pivotal moments between Eva and Kevin from Kevin's birth until the tragedy.The cinematic craftsmanship used to tell this chronologically disoriented narrative as well as the unfiltered and stripped performance of Swinton keep the film in a certain realm of excellence that the story might otherwise shatter. It's so difficult to believe the implied notion of Kevin essentially being the spawn of Satan and that Swinton could be so clueless as to lack all maternal and disciplinarian instinct in handling the situation.Eva is a character we sympathize with in the present day but whom we grow to dislike to an extent as we learn more and more about Kevin's upbringing. Post-massacre, for whatever reason, she continues to live in the town affected by her son's actions. Her new home has received a coat of red paint splattered across the front door, and she spends all her free time cleaning it off. In isolation, memories of raising Kevin, implicitly ones in which she wishes she could change what she did, flow freely in and out of her conscience.As a baby, Kevin wouldn't stop crying in his mother's arms and postpartum depression ensued. As a toddler, Kevin refused to comply with basic requests and tasks yet exhibited no signs of autism or behavioral disorders. He wasn't potty-trained until he was what looks like eight, quite possibly because he wanted the attention. His relationship with his mother only grew more distant as she didn't know how to respond to these outbursts.The nature of Kevin's malevolence in some way is exaggerated because we're to recognize that much of how we are seeing Kevin is through his mother's recollections after the massacre. She's blamed herself for not seeing all the signs and has manifested that guilt into her memory. Nevertheless, we as viewers struggle mightily with embracing it as truth. Perhaps the fact of the matter is that in order to create a character capable of such real-world evil, Kevin needed to be more extreme than any character we've ever seen. Miller gives Kevin with some believable rebellious teenage qualities, namely in the way he talks to his mother, but he's also portrayed with a near-supernatural darkness reminiscent of a horror film.What we can understand is Eva's inner monologue. We don't agree with it in a lot of the Kevin scenes, but Swinton grants us unfettered access into Eva's every thought. This gives Ramsay a greater degree of freedom in her use of visual symbolism. Nearly every scene is rife with metaphor, and our ability to identify Eva's every emotion through Swinton's performance allows Ramsay the ability to communicate through more abstract means. From the opening scene onward we are treated to images of messiness and disarray, of raw, pulpy filth and even mild self-mutilation. It both informs and aggravates the story being told, which adds to the difficulty of enduring its 112 minutes.For some, the challenge will be too great to bear, but for others, namely those who can key in on Swinton's performance and Ramsay's expert imagery, "Kevin" will be one of 2011's finest films.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Haunted houses and questionable children have composed many a horror film, but there's a reason they work. When they do so despite years of being recycled, it's usually thanks to talent. "Saw" director James Wan found something of promise in "Saw" writer Leigh Whannell's story "Insidious" and the same must've gone for stars Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. Horror films rarely get that infusion of talent, and as such, "Insidious" does not get lost in that dark dimension of forgettable horror.Josh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) Lambert have moved into a new home with their two young boys and infant girl. Like always, paranormal oddities occur in small doses here and there until one morning they find their son Dalton in a coma. A few months pass and they move Dalton back home. The freaky incidences increase and eventually Renai sees the ghosts. She convinces Josh to move them into a new home, but it gets worse, so they bring in a paranormal expert (Lin Shaye) who provides them with some shocking revelations about the state of their son.Like "Paranormal Activity" (a film thats producers have credits on this film unsurprisingly), the idea is to mount tension through paranormal phenomena and expert suspense. Wan provides a number of perfect angles and color to achieve the various moods. As much as you've been spooked this way by films before, you can't simply shirk the way the film creeps in  Wan won't have any of it. In fact, nothing here in terms of scare tactics will come as a revelation; many with a higher jumpiness tolerance will likely find it boring in many regards. No gore or horrific images to be found here  "Insidious" does it old school.Once Shaye's character Elise and her two employees arrive on scene, the story mutates from paranormal suspense to other-worldly mystery. Elise explains what's going on  something that involves Dalton's soul being lost in a realm called The Further  and now they must rescue him. Whannell constructs an interesting mythology here and the story goes from horror to more of a mystery/thriller with demonic elements. In a sense he borrows from science fiction in establishing the rules of what's going on. It's mostly interesting, but in many instances flat-out weird to the point that horror purists might not like it.The best way to describe "Insidious" is first half "Paranormal Activity" and second half something akin to Sam Raimi's "Drag Me To Hell," which equates to a nice balance between self-seriousness and horror fun. The "X" factor would be the performances. Byrne keeps Renai from becoming an obnoxious scaredy cat as her role's importance dwindles in the latter half of the film, in which time she still keeps Renai relevant. Wilson's character is no typical over- macho father figure or anything. Together they provide an unusual boost for horror, which typically strives for random faces with questionable experience.In general, "Insidious" possesses a professionalism not often seen in the genre; most horror films go for cheap across the board from the budget to the talent to the thrills. Although "Insidious" lacks distinctiveness in terms of story, not an ounce of it can be perceived as immature or hollow. What a rare (but not unusual) treat.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
As far as war films go, "The Great Escape" doesn't rank in the most dramatic or the most eye-opening. It doesn't even make the list of World War II epics with the most compelling characters. It's a movie with that intangible "it" factor that only comes from an impressive story. Films such as this one that are based on true events and real-life people (many of whom were acted by people with similar war experience), are the reason so many "based on a true story" movies have been made over the years. "The Great Escape" will have its skeptics because director John Sturges' approach to the film emphasizes suspense ahead of character development, which usually characterizes fiction. With a background in westerns, Sturges knows how to build up to and then milk the climactic scenes. The reason the final hour with the prisoners escaping is so good is because it took nearly two hours to get there. It certainly didn't help the film's credibility to have Steve McQueen demanding to "do more" in the film and insist on riding a motorcycle, but many remember "The Great Escape" for this reason.The true elements of the story come from an actual escape attempt by Allied POWs from a German stalag. Paul Brickhill, who wrote the book upon which the film is based, actually assisted in planning a tunneling effort. That should put to rest any questions about the film's validity. Undoubtedly characters were created by mashing together multiple real-life persons and their fates did not match exactly what happened to them in reality (who could know?), but this was no cheap Hollywood attempt to exploit a terrific true story. After all, the ending is certainly more akin to a war drama than entertaining historical fiction.Sturges calls upon many of the stars from "The Magnificent Seven" (released three years before this one) to assist him in this film: Steve McQueen as the leader figure notorious for getting in trouble and ending up in "the cooler" or isolation, Charles Bronson as Danny the lead tunneler who ironically is claustrophobic and James Coburn as Louis "The Manufacturer." Other notable stars are acclaimed actor/director Richard Attenborough, future James Bond villain Donald Pleasence and James Garner. What their characters lack in depth written into the script, these fine actors inject back into their roles as best they can."The Great Escape" takes a bit too long to get to the climax so clearly spelled out by the title, but the wait is worth it. The first hour and a half to two hours plays out as a series of episodes showing the preparations and the characters behind them, some more effective than others, but the movie earns its place in war film history with the final act. As these characters flee the prison, you start to realize how much you do indeed care about what happens to them. There's so much suspense inherent in the story and written into the script that a dramatically adept director could've made "The Great Escape" a monumental film, but thrilling and unique are acceptable adjectives when all is said and done, even if they could have been arrived at a tad bit quicker. After all, much of what there is to marvel at this film about has to do with its fascinatingly true story.~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.com
"Wag the Dog" is one of those smart comedies. That's not to say it's an elitist brand of humor, but it certainly doesn't have a mainstream appeal like physical or situational comedy. It's a witty concept comedy, and the humor comes through characters and the humorous set-up. It doesn't exactly leave a profound impact on you either, but it's certainly a unique film.The great concept for the film is that a DC PR guy for the president and a Hollywood producer team up to distract the public from a presidential sex scandal that emerges just weeks before he is running for re-election. They decide the best way to do it is by creating a fake war between the US and Albania. This alone holds a lot of promise and that promise, in many ways, is delivered thanks to the minds behind it.First, there's one of the writers, famed playwright and screenwriter David Mamet, who gives the film its intellectual edge. Director Barry Levinson is much the same kind of director in his approach to comedy and certainly marquee actors Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro don't team up for just any old jokefest (I'll pretend "Meet the Fockers" hasn't come out yet).Stealing the show is really Hoffman, whose quirky, "if you can dream it you can do it" mentality permeates the down-to-business attitude of the other characters and scenes. He keeps the humor of the whole situation in check with his requests for Calico kittens and patriotic songs from Willie Nelson's character.Most interestingly, you never see the president in the film. He's not a character at all--it's entirely about the people behind him. Whereas the film could be written so you identify with the public, it's written to give you a secret little viewing room into the world of spinning the media. It does seem a little exaggerated at times, but it's very unique among comedies. It's not supposed to make you laugh as much as grin sheepishly at the side of politics you're not seeing.
Tom Hanks, arguably the best white actor of his generation and Denzel Washington, easily the best black actor of his generation--and the film is about homosexuality and the AIDS epidemic. That's the easiest thing to overlook and perhaps the most brilliant part about "Philadelphia:" Never once do you feel an ounce of racial tension between their two characters in this film. It's as if to say that we've broken a social barrier like this before and we'll do it again.The film follows Hanks as Andrew Beckett, a young stud lawyer in a major Philadelphia firm who learns his HIV has become AIDS just as he is promoted. Before long, Beckett finds himself fired for incompetency, though he believes it is based on his disease. He seeks the help of Joe Miller, a civil attorney, who at first turns him away due to his own homophobia, but later accepts. The film sort of baits us on our interest in courtroom drama and challenge us with some reflective, personal, human moments. While the film is about this legal battle, "Silence of the Lambs" filmmaker Jonathan Demme makes sure to remind you that its really about a man and his family struggling with a terrible disease.The genius of the script is that it blatantly plays on American prejudices about homosexuality and AIDS, reminding us of our ignorance about the virus and its disease in the way that it is contracted most specifically. We are supposed to come at it from Joe's perspective, slowly coming to understand that our homophobia is unfounded. It's not flawless execution as some of the ignorance feels artistically forced, but most of it is very real. This is one of those movies that uses such a sharp societal lens that it will leave you with "shaken head syndrome' where you can't help but shake your head based on how terrible and prejudiced some of the things said and done in this film are."Philadelphia" definitely seems to be on the upward portion near the climax of the illustrious acting careers of both Hanks and Washington. While best actor awards tend to make people think of the most dramatic performances, it is the way Hanks shows the debilitating effects of the disease through the course of the film that makes him Oscar-worthy. Washington's performance is familiar, but what makes it stand out a bit is that transformation in perspective we see him undergo.This is a story driven by content and meant to play toward emotions. It is meant to be sad and uplifting, both of which it is. It is a landmark film in its willingness to address AIDS and homosexuality in the "pre-RENT" era of entertainment. While it is a courtroom drama and meant to handle a serious subject matter, its more simplistic and raw than profound and artistic. "Philadelphia" is a very important story sandwiched between a great Bruce Springsteen song and a good Neil Young song that belongs among the library of issue-focused films
"What happens in Cedar Rapids stays in Cedar Rapids," says Joan, a "one of the guys" kinda woman played by Anne Heche who views her yearly trip to an insurance conference in Cedar Rapids as momentary liberation from her life's irrevocable commitments. For those of us who've tried to spend as little time in Iowa as possible, that little mantra's something of a joke, but escapism means something different to everyone. "Cedar Rapids" puts much in perspective this way by showcasing adults as the children they often are.Ed Helms gets his first starring role as Tim Lippe, an insurance agent from Brown Valley, Wisc. who's never set foot out of his hometown and is even sleeping with his seventh grade teacher (Sigourney Weaver) to whom he's "pre-engaged." When the insurance company's golden boy dies of auto-erotic asphyxia (which Tim regularly refers to as "an accident"), Tim must represent the company at the annual ASMI conference in Cedar Rapids where he must win the coveted Two-Diamond award for excellence or it will cost the company dearly.Helms nails the fish-out-of-water character using much of the same naiveté that made him a beloved addition to "The Office." Although in many instances his super-small-town mentality serves as a comedic ploy, it informs the way we watch the rest of the film, namely how he interacts with his new group of friends, characters that rather accurately represent the array of business types.Tim first meets Ronald (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), the amicable by-the-books guy with who tells bland jokes and means well. Then John C. Reilly storms onto the scene as Dean Ziegler a.k.a "The Deanzy," the straight-shooting schmoozer with absolutely no filter and as such, the source of much of the laughs so long as you find humor in creative vulgarity. Last would of course be Joan, who jokes around about seducing Tim but behaves otherwise. Heche seems to have found the path many actresses looking to rebound have taken: playing a damaged middle-aged woman trying to feel things out.Essentially these characters are grown-up children in much the same way that the "The Office" brings playground dynamics to the adult world. Team-building activities and getting drunk are just the beginning for what these characters do and consequently how they behave. For Tim, it's a long-delayed loss of innocence. He learns that even parts of his ho-hum life can have a two-faced nature; those people he believes to be bad end up good and vice versa.Director Miguel Arteta ("Youth in Revolt") seems to show an adeptness at this kind of comedy, drawing performances from the cast that provide nuanced characterization and believability. A comedy about Midwestern insurance agents doesn't work if the people don't seem average, yet at the same time, the characters are far from dull."Cedar Rapids" mostly struggles as most indies do in finding a balance between comedy and poignancy. The over-the-top comedic elements seem to push away from the dramatic, which is the film's greater strength. There's plenty of humor to be had in the nature of the story to the point that a scene with Tim going over the edge and smoking crack with a prostitute doesn't seem essential to say the least. Tim's reactions to moral conundrums seem a bit exaggerated as well in terms of the writing. The ending lacks a bit of zing, but the intentions of Phil Johnston's script are pure and true. His focus stays on a well-cast protagonist and Tim's attitudes help create the perspective shift that allows us to enter the characters' shoes. The results are light-hearted and not preachy in the least.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Universal's 1931 "Dracula," and specifically the count's portrayal by Bela Lugosi has become so completely intertwined with pop culture it's virtually impossible to say anything bad about it. The reason we all imagine Dracula with the cowled cape, widow's peak and pale white face is entirely thanks to this film, and that kind of iconicity should not go under-appreciated.The film itself plays in stark contrast to what you think of when you think old movies. Whereas the Silent Era featured nothing but music, "Dracula"  due to certain Hollywood notions at the dawn of the Talkie era  completely avoids the use of any scoring. With nothing to enhance dramatic effect, the film becomes an exercise in creepiness.The gingerly pacing of most of the scenes, namely Dracula's attacks, and their lack of any satisfying conclusion thanks to cutaways forced of course by censorship requirements back in the day, could warrant a good share of criticism. Without the music to build toward these turning points in the film, it's almost awkward, but there's a sense of a deliberate, artistic choice behind each slow creep toward a victim, each shot of Dracula's face and his unforgettable stare. In a two-hour film it might be an unnecessary pain, but at 75 minutes, it has a place. Director Tod Browning gets his credit there to be sure, but he's not the reason we revisit this monster movie."Dracula" comes from the stage adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel rather than the novel itself, specifically. In it, we follow Dracula to London as he secures the Carfax Abbey property with his recently converted servant Renfield (Dwight Frye) as he preys on young Lucy Weston (Frances Dade) and then her friend, Mina Seward (Helen Chandler). Mina's father (Herbert Brunson) and fiancé, John Harker (David Manners), turn to the help of Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) to prevent her from turning into a vampire. Lugosi played the role of Dracula on stage, and became known for getting a bit too into the character over the course of his lifetime. He made concessions to do whatever it took to be in the film, and we benefit from it. His stare and his mannerisms create the (at the time) wholly unique image of Count Dracula.It's not textbook suspense, but you can't help but be curious to see what Dracula will do next. He's a magnetic figure and he drives our curiosity to the point that we become wrapped up in the story, no matter how slow it might feel at times.You can't say "Dracula" is not a classic with a straight face. You might not identify it as a truly scary movie, or a truly suspenseful one, but its imagery has become so synonymous with the folk depiction of Dracula that it definitely did something very, very right.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"The Grand Budapest Hotel" is Wes Anderson's most imaginative effort yet. The perpetually quirky master of symmetry expands his scope in a way not seen since "The Life Aquatic," but this story is infinitely more accessible and entertaining.The film, set in a fictionalized version of Europe, takes an unusual storytelling approach. A now- deceased author (Tom Wilkinson) relays the story behind his most famous novel. When he was younger (played by Jude Law), he visited the once-infamous and decrepit Grand Budapest Hotel, where he comes upon the its owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who tells the story of how he came to own it. He's the film's primary narrator, telling the story of how as a young immigrant boy (Tony Revolori) he came under the tutelage of the hotel's flamboyant and unapologetic concierge, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes).Fiennes gives a much-welcome change of pace performance as Gustave that is both hilarious and delightful. The tone of "Grand Budapest" leans this way as well. Whereas most of Anderson's films move from that quirky, dry humor into stark depictions of relationships, "Budapest" almost never loses its comic edge. Far and away, the film earns its label as Anderson's funniest movie. From the outside, the plot looks like a murder mystery farce. Gustave wins the affections of rich old women who stay at the hotel through flattery and sexual services. When one of his most devoted customers, Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) turns up murdered, she wills Gustave the priceless painting "Boy with Apple," provoking the ire of Madame's scornful son, Dmitri, (Adrien Brody). To ensure he gets what's rightfully his, Gustave and Zero steal the painting and Gustave makes a deal to make Zero his heir in exchange for his help. The next day, Gustave is arrested for the murder and Zero tries to help him escape and prove his innocence.Gustave and Zero form a hysterical but meaningful relationship. For all of Gustave's risky, eccentric shenanigans, he grows fond and protective of the boy. This kind of friendship has never been the center of an Anderson film; usually, its sibling or family dysfunction. Consequently, "Budapest" is a bit shallower in character depth, opting for moments of pure entertainment than inward exploration. On the plus side, it does make "Budapest" more accessible than earlier Anderson films, which could now be considered a trend given that "Moonrise Kingdom" was even more so that way.The case of "Grand Budapest" extends well beyond Anderson's circle of actors, relegated most of the usual suspects to cameos and small supporting roles. In doing so, Anderson proves he can direct any actor of reasonable talent into fitting with his style. This ensemble is especially vast, though the one real standout is Willem Dafoe as Jopling, Dmitri's brass-knuckled henchman.Anderson really ups the adventure and fun of "Grand Budapest" and celebrates his filmmaking style. He adds even more brightness, color, symmetry and hijinks, something he can get away with at this point in his career due to greater audience familiarity. He hasn't gone his deepest, or really pushed himself as an intellectual, but "Grand Budapest" proves to be immensely satisfying.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
"The Pianist" is a film that is impossible to dislike. In fact, it may be impossible to love it as well. It's a traumatic and difficult biographical account of one of the many unbelievable Holocaust survival stories. What makes "Pianist" stand out, however is the traumatic realism, the way that the story evolves to strike an emotional chord in regards to the Nazi's crimes and the unique role of music in the film."The Pianist" is the Oscar-winning best adapted screenplay from the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), an accomplished Jewish pianist in Warsaw right as World War II strikes. The film plays out as several scenes following a timeline from the initial invasion to the Warsaw ghetto to Szpilman's many hideouts in the city throughout the war. While the true sense of time is skewed and thus the true agony of Szpilman's isolation unrealized, the timeline clearly shows how the Jews and everyone in Warsaw for that matter had their lives transformed.What makes this film so effective is the way Oscar winners Ronald Harwood (screenplay), but mostly director Roman Polanski, go right for your heartstrings. The Nazis are portrayed as cold-blooded killers. There is no emotional build-up or excessive suspense in the film's violent moments. It is sudden and mechanical, leaving you wondering how anyone could do such a thing, when the fact of the matter was that's exactly how it happened: many times arbitrary, heartless killing. The whole effect that Polanski has created with the violence being viewed by Szpilman and his family through windows, isolated from the mêlée, is very effective in the way that it connects with how the viewer is very much isolated from the true nature of the violence. Polanski conditions you to be afraid every time Szpilman looks out the window that violence might occur, which is exactly what Szpilman was: very curious about what was going on, but truly afraid. The effect is brilliant.The films third Oscar winner, Brody, doesn't give an emotionally moving performance per say, but his performance is award-worthy in its realism through exquisite use of non-verbal skills and his natural demeanor. You can tell how the war has transformed him as a person through each stage--from day one to the final moments of the film.If there's a weakness to the film, it's the fact that it doesn't spend enough time grasping Szpilman as a pianist. There is no sense as to how important his playing is or why he plays. Instead, the focus is more on the unfolding the events of WWII. While the idea the film presents of him being a pianist simply because that's what he knows to do is effective towards the end, a greater understanding of what playing the piano means to him would have been ideal in the beginning."The Pianist" is a tremendous achievement in terms of successfully telling a often repeated story in a way that is uniquely effective. It focuses on the aspect of the Holocaust that speaks to perseverance, basic survival in a life of fear that plays out outside your window. It is a tough film, but it's a good one.
Family drama can be cliché, but not when that family consists of a teenage brother and sister and their two moms. Hollywood's family dramas have yet to break out of the traditional family structure for obvious albeit not necessarily defensible reasons, but independent film promoter Focus Features has found a gem of one in Lisa Cholodenko's "The Kids Are All Right."Joni and Laser (Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson) were born to a lesbian couple, Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic (Annette Bening), using the sperm of an anonymous donor. Joni, now 18 and in her last summer before college, decides along with her brother to seek out her biological father, who it turns out is a local farmer/restaurant owner named Paul (Mark Ruffalo). His presence in their lives begins to challenge and complicate the relationships in this already unique family unit."The Kids Are All Right" relies initially on our interest in the dynamic of a two-mother household and at times on some soap opera-like plot devices, but the film couldn't be less shallow. The characters have remarkable depth and complexity and the writing and acting feels more sincere and genuine than any other indie film of this kind.Rarely does a film get so quickly on the same page with its audience. There's something about Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg's character writing and the terrific actors bringing them to life that creates an instantaneous connection where you know exactly how each main character feels and what they are thinking in a given moment. Everything about the interplay between characters is so organic and natural. The first time Paul meets his "kids" you identify with the situation both he and the kids are in, how he tries to be cool yet you can see his concern with making a good impression. Then there's the kids who go into the scenario with distinct attitudes that are instantly challenged by Paul's laid back, chill personality.Ruffalo has never been better. So many films have free-spirited college dropout characters who haven't settled down and then are challenged in that lifestyle by some unexpected event, but Ruffalo lets us in below the surface. Paul is not "that character" at all and it's comforting to know that a character can have so many "typical" traits yet feel fresh and distinct instead of an indie dramedy cliché.Then there's Bening and Moore in outstanding roles. Both take lead at different points in the film, which is part of what makes Cholodenko's film so effective. Nic and Jules' screen time is balanced and both generate equal sympathy for their characters, so when conflict arises between the two, both sides are clear, the audience sees where both characters come from and thus "Kids" never feels one-dimensional in its themes and ideas.Most people will gravitate toward Bening's performance as the more concerned of the two moms. She's strong and likable yet definitely flawed, but the biggest difference is in the subtlety of her flaws, her controlling nature and need to feel in charge of her kids and family. The cause-and-effect nature of events that drive the plot in terms of relationship tension echo this too.All the main characters have strong and resonant emotional vulnerability, which makes them so compelling to us. Even Hutcherson and especially Wasikowska -- a truly gifted actress -- play more than your typical roller-coaster emotional teens. Each has something to gain from having Paul in his or her life, but each has an issue to wrestle with as part of it. Most importantly, "The Kids Are All Right" still touches on important family themes despite a more "radical" premise. The simultaneous sympathy for all characters that Cholodenko has beautifully crafted makes the resolution of conflict so much more meaningful and the message of unconditional love all the more powerful. It's further proof that the best dramas, the ones that leave the biggest impact, paint characters in many shades of gray and not just politically speaking.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
If I had the ability to time travel (and who's to say I don't, because I'd never tell you if I did) and felt inclined to show a movie to the citizens of the '20s or '30s that would fully capture for them life in the 21st Century because I wouldn't be able to take them there myself, I think I'd choose "Friends with Benefits." For one, it's predictable romance  that much hasn't changed in 80-90 years. For another, the presence of technology is rampant, which would awe them while also proving another thing that hasn't changed in 80-90 years: product placement. In all sincerity, however, Will Gluck ("Easy A") has crafted yet another comedy that's savvy to its audience, and though the contemporary attitudes, humor and references come heavy-handed at times, he captures our sensibilities and can identify the talent that can make that writing work.The only thing the screenplay doesn't write its way around is the formula to which the film's premise inextricably links itself. As funny and even touching as the writing can get, it can't outrun the predictability factor of two friends who try having a relationship built on emotionless sex. Dylan (Justin Timberlake) moves out to New York City from Los Angeles thanks to Jamie (Mila Kunis), a head hunter who sets him up at GQ. Knowing nobody in the Big Apple, Dylan spends a lot of time with Jamie and they connect over bad past relationships and some healthy sarcasm. Each plagued by their own issues, they determine they could try sex without feelings.Yup, we know how this story goes; we even had a refresher course in January with "No Strings Attached," a botched exercise to say the least. What that film lacked were (outside of Natalie Portman) the talents that "Benefits" has to sell us this recycled story as if brand new.It's a tough sell, so any measure of success should be hailed a victory. For starters, Kunis and Timberlake are funny people  sincerely funny people. Undoubtedly improvisation was involved, but they understand the material and they make it natural and honest (as well as hilarious often times). Maybe more importantly, the supporting characters defy the norm of best friends and roommates. There's Woody Harrelson as a charismatic stereotype-breaking gay colleague of Dylan's at GQ, Patricia Clarkson as the free-wheeling and somewhat unmotherly mother to Jamie and other that pop up along the way. Certainly they only exist to provide the key advice necessary in these types of rom-coms, but their characters serve that purpose in fresher ways.Although he didn't write "Easy A," Gluck helped pen this film using similar techniques to try and subvert the rampant clichés. Much in the way that "Easy A" (which gets a shout out in the airport scene at the beginning if you watch closely) mixed modern humor with homage to teen comedies of the John Hughes variety, "Friends with Benefits" both honors romantic comedies and calls them out on their crap. Jamie is a hopeless romantic who despises the movies for warping her views on love and as she and Dylan drink beer and broach the subject of sex for the first time, they're even watching a rom-com, albeit a made-up one "starring" Jason Segel and Rashida Jones. The extra pinch of satire softens the fact that we all know even this film will descend into similar mushiness because that's what these movies do. The fact that we still embrace this obvious outcome speaks volumes to how well "Friends with Benefits" avoids being the awfulness its premise suggests.Occasionally the film struggles to balance its excessive contemporary humor with moments of actual sincerity and a few characters and subplots (such as Dylan's family with his troubled father played by Richard Jenkins and his sister played by Jenna Elfman) though well done, feel out of place or unnecessary. Otherwise, the jokes hit and the sentimentality takes root as needed. Although I could've laughed half as much as I did at some of the jokes, the cast proves to make the difference in feeling the sting of some of the mediocre humor versus letting it slide.~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Paul Rudd gets a lot of love from moviegoers, just not enough love. It's not a wayward assessment to say that other than (arguably) Steve Carell, Rudd is the best actor doing comedy right now, in the sense that he could do so much, but he sticks to the joyful life of comedy. Thankfully he's darn good at it.Rudd plays the comedy everyman ("Role Models," "I Love You, Man," "Dinner for Schmucks") as good if not better than anybody in today's comedies, yet no one's surprised when he takes a role like that of Ned in "Our Idiot Brother" and hits a home run with it. That's because he's always taking risks and offering something different when he's not the lead. "Our Idiot Brother" gives us the best of both Rudd-worlds.Jesse Peretz's film also exists in an uncomfortable middle ground between modern comedy and indie family dramedy, which would explain why it has been met with mixed criticism. It succeeds mostly when looked at as a simple comedy with honest truths and strong performances.Ned is a pretty complex idiot. Peretz built the character and Rudd builds his performance around his "benefit of the doubt" world view, and it makes Ned different from that dumb character you've seen before, though certainly pieces of his personality will feel familiar. His dumbness is quite believable, which says a lot considering the film opens with him selling pot to a uniformed police officer. Perhaps the difference is that he doesn't sell right away, he gives it to him, but the officer can't make the arrest unless he sells it, yet he manages to convince him to ask for money in return. Whole other idiocy ball game.The comedy has a fairytale structure as Ned must rotate between living with his three sisters: Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) the strong-willed independent journalist, Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) the spontaneous lesbian stand-up comic and Liz (Emily Mortimer) the hardened mother of two with an emotionally unavailable husband (Steve Coogan). With a reluctant sense of obligation, they all give him things to do and of course a place to sleep.So it goes that Ned finds a way of making their lives more difficult either through ignorance or some other means and they harshly overreact and blame Ned because they're all kind of selfish. You can see it all unfolding, but Rudd has such charisma and these actresses are no slouches. Deschanel and Rashida Jones might not make the most convincing lesbians, but the film never falls apart thanks to poor characters. Without them, it would be hard to look past the obvious conventions, but they and the general high jinks Ned finds himself in keep you smiling.There's a definite comfort in this family redemption story no matter how many times you see it. What makes "Our Idiot Brother" different is that character fullness. Instead of writing in one-liner jokes, Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgall focus more on humorous situations. Although not wildly original, the actors step in and give them that fun genuineness that makes you want to see things roll out how they do, even if you know exactly how it'll happen.The optimism Ned preaches guides the rest of it from there. The scenarios feel less contrived and more like sincere approaches to the question of how someone who's so honest and looking to appease yet so ignorant of consequences would cause himself problems. His sisters' reactions might be overblown, but the conclusion ends up quite sweet. Those who don't corner the film into comedy or indie comedy/drama will find it hard not to be won over by this film and especially Mr. Rudd.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com
To set the record straight -- maybe pun intended -- "Humpday" is not a true gay and lesbian film, nor is it a "bromantic comedy" with homophobic slapstick. Lynn Shelton's film is simple: what if two best heterosexual guy friends somehow got it in their heads that filming themselves having sex with each other would be a good idea? "Humpday" explores the bond between men and the difficulty they have with intimacy, particularly when its sexual in nature.Ben (Mark Duplass) is a recently married man planning on starting a family when his old best friend, the free-spirited Andrew (Joshua Leonard) shows up at his house in the middle of the night. At a party, the two learn about an amateur porn competition and come up with the idea that two straight best friends having sex with each other would make a real artistic statement. Although they laugh at the idea the next day, their machismo of not wanting to back out in addition to some internally buried needs they feel the film would fulfill turn the idea into a serious project.The most prominent feature of "Humpday" is its amateur documentary film-making style. Shelton is filming like she's the camerawoman in the Real World house making a reality show. There's an impressive realism with the dialogue and the way the characters relate to one another and it only lets up in a few spots. The story does a great job convincing you that this could theoretically happen even though it never would. I don't think under any other set of circumstances other than the ones Shelton has imagined would something like this legitimately take place. Duplass, Leonard and Alycia Delmore as Ben's wife do their best to convince you otherwise. They really seem like legitimate people in real-life relationships.At many points in the film, Ben and Andrew address why they're doing this. It's an important question to the film and one that should also be asked of Shelton too. At times "Humpday" is supposed to be funny but there's a lot of it which is meant to be taken seriously. You start to wonder yourself -- namely if you're a straight man -- if you'd be able to go through with it which is one of the film's great strengths. At other times, you kind of wonder why the issue has been blown up this much in the first place.I think Shelton made this film because she wanted to explore the male bond and this was really the way to pull and push at it and manipulate it: by creating these circumstances. The film is surprisingly perceptive with some interesting insights into relationships but it gets a bit too hung up on two guys talking about having sex with each other and will they or won't they."Humpday" is an LGBT film in the sense that it comes from a very sexually open and progressive mindset. There are a couple women in the film for example, one played by Shelton in fact, that are in a relationship but one is into Andrew as well. In that sense LGBT characters are a significant part of the film, but they mostly add to the discussion of sexuality and relationships as seen through these two best friends. Lose any expectations that the poster art and brief summary provide and "Humpday" will leave you pleasantly surprised.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
There's something so timeless about "North by Northwest" and it's not necessarily that it will echo with any generation. Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill, for example, feels a little foreign among today's thriller protagonists (accent aside) as a 50-year-old everyday man thrown into a mess of a government situation. The action is certainly not big-budget like modern films either with the exception of one explosion. The "it" that "Northwest" has is something more unique and a lot of it stems from great thriller writing and of course the direction of Sir Alfred Hitchcock."Northwest" follows the story of how Thornhill is taken against his will and accused of being a man named George Kaplan. These men try and kill Thornhill results in him rushing to prove his innocence, which actually leads him deeper into the mystery of George Kaplan. The writing of Ernest Lehman is absolutely terrific and it seems a shame that Hitchcock never collaborated with him again. The dialogue is not only very pointed and helpful to the plot, but also the plot movement with its twists and turns and clever way of revealing information to the viewer is simply classic--no film in this film's nearly 50 year old shadow has been able to eclipse it.Then there is Hitchcock's signature directing. No one seems to choose better moments to employ certain shot techniques than Alfred HItchcock. He knows how to turn the best parts of the film into highly memorable and often times unforgettable scenes. The crop-duster attack is easily one of the greatest scenes in thriller movie history. Conceptually, but especially direction-wise as it could be potentially boring or over-directed to be more intense. Instead, it finds its intensity from Hitchcock's decision to let it build and fall back as the plane flies by and circles around again.Perhaps the immediate impact of this film made it an instant classic and nobody wanted to borrow any obvious ideas or techniques--although the two-faced femme fatale played by Eva Marie Saint is certainly an archetype of a lot of these kind of movies. "North by Northwest" simply still stands out through its inventiveness and will always continue to do so.
Name another context where the line "your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries" is funny. If it's not John Cleese as the taunting Frenchman or said in that very same obnoxiously fake French accent, it's about as funny as missing tea time."The Holy Grail," far and away the greatest comedic work of the Monty Python gang of Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam is a masterful example of the power of improvisational humor and satire. It is also testament that nonsense, when executed properly, is brilliance.No comedy can even touch what King Arthur and the knights of the round table's divinely charged quest for the Holy Grail does. Whether it is a rant about various forms of government, a tragically flawed scientific logic for burning witches or knights who keep sacred words like "Ni" and demand shrubberies, just about everything in the film is memorable, quotable or at least highly enjoyed by those with bad recall abilities.The Middle Ages is perfect fodder for Monty Python, mixing a definite sense of history with tales of fantasy -- the ideal balance for satire and nonsensical fun. But truly, comedy is about timing and execution and no one does it better. The subtleties of "I'm not dead yet" and "i'm getting better" are examples. Delivered in another way they could miss the mark entirely, but the Python crew gets just about anything to be funny. A definite improvisational element keeps the scenes fresh and all the more hilarious."Holy Grail" nails joke after joke and only lacks a satisfying end. Still, the sheer comedic genius of the rest of the film is so good that the whole unit is meaningless. You don't walk away thinking it's a bad ending, you start quoting the taunting Frenchman, or the leader of the nights who say "Ni!" or the Black Knight. That's what makes the film a true classic.
What's most admirable about this most recent zombie-crushing comedy is that it knows exactly what zombies are meant for: killing. Funny, creative and most of all low-budget killing. Rookie director Ruben Fleischer and Columbia Pictures capture that essence in the quick but fun "Zombieland," a post-Zombie infection apocalypse action comedy with a small cast and a whole lot of make-up-covered stunt people.To be frank, there's nothing that will blow you away completely in "Zombieland," it's just all executed very well and the story satisfies despite cutting short its character arch and development. Action-wise, Fleischer I'd dare say one-ups Zak Snyder on the slow-motion technique. He holds little back when delivering some of the more gruesome zombie kills. He'll definitely get some potentially lucrative directorial offers with the success of this film, no doubt.The characters are strong but if anything is lost in the film's barely even an hour and a half run time, it's them. Jesse Eisenberg's neurotic virgin unlikely hero only really learns to grow a pair and Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee has both the conscious and subconscious desire to find a Twinkie. Although writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick allude to some good ideas about how a character would feel being one of few survivors in a barren and zombie- polluted United States, namely a person who was anti-social to begin with, no relationships in the film come out of the oven beyond medium-rare.Truthfully, however, the cast is great. Eisenberg is better than Michael Cera at the dorky hero who manages to get the hot chick and Emma Stone is one of the actually talented young "hot chicks" working today. Add Harrelson and Breslin and kudos goes to whoever made the casting decisions. With barely any other characters, a lot falls on them to be real and interesting and as actors, they're all the types who avoid being shallow.What makes "Zombieland" likable in the end, however, is creativity. An ending sequence of Harrelson taking out zombies in an amusement park is just good imaginative thinking by Reese and Wernick. Say what you want about zombie-killing scenes, but you don't feel like you're watching something you've already seen. They understand location is everything in these kinds of films (shopping mall in "Dawn of the Dead" anyone?). A trip to Hollywood to stay in a famous actor's mansion is another example of outside the box."Zombieland" treads the respectable middle ground of delivering quality examples of what it promises and not going too much for glitz and mindless action or the other extreme: shooting way high for excellent character development and drama. The cast and the writers appear capable of that next level, but instead we get more entertainment factor, which is fine considering the entertainment is creative.Zombie genre fans, comedy fans and quirky/creative film fans will all find something to really enjoy out of "Zombieland," one of the better entertainment-driven thrills of the year. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Washed up celebrities, surrealism, truth and the theatre converge into an extraordinary film from Alejandro González Iñárritu ("Amores Perros," "21 Grams"), a master of weaving multiple story lines together tackling dark but powerful themes about human nature and love. "Birdman" does not veer from these themes, but it is a dramatic structural shift for Iñárritu; rather than disparate subplots or vignettes, the film is intended to look like one continuous take.Michael Keaton aptly stars as a celebrity whose heyday ended in the '90s  Riggan Thomson, a.k.a. Birdman. Riggan is about to enter previews with his Broadway debut, an adaptation of Raymond Carver's "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love," which he wrote, directed and stars in, yet he's haunted by Birdman, a voice in his head that provokes him and tells him he's above it all. But Riggan has everything tied up in this production: a ton of money, his pride, his self-worth as an artist (not a celebrity) and even his personal life. His daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), is fresh out of rehab and working as his assistant, and he's dating his co-star (Andrea Riseborough).It all hits the fan, however, when one of the play's male leads suffers an accident and in walks Mike Shiner (Edward Norton). A Broadway star, Mike's views on theatre and acting put him at creative odds with Regan. He also creates more backstage drama because his girlfriend is the play's fourth star (Naomi Watts) and he also strikes up a connection with Sam. Thus begins a series of tumultuous events as opening night nears, where everything could unravel with one bad review from The New York Times.Iñárritu gleefully plays with reality, keeping the audience constantly guessing as to what's real. This isn't just limited to what's going on in Riggan's head and whether or not he has telekinetic powers; the script floats in and out of its own dialogue and the play's dialogue, blurring the lines between the two, especially because the play, of course, echoes the themes of the film. Iñárritu does a masterful job keeping us from ever quite establishing what's "real" in the movie, a tactic the serves to heighten our attention to detail while watching everything unfold.And my, what details indeed. An entire review could be written about the film's continuous takes, or about the rhythm and timing of all the shots and scenes accentuated brilliantly by a score performed on a single drum set. "Birdman" feels like its own organism, with Iñárritu, composer Antonio Sanchez, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and editors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione working in perfect harmony. It's kind of amazing that their work doesn't distract from the story's complexities, let alone bolster them.The actors are far from pawns in this intricate machine of a film, however. Keaton rises above simply being cast for the obvious ways his career mirrors Riggan's and meets the demands of this role in a way with surprising aplomb. Although he'll go down in the history books as Batman and Beetlejuice, this is the crowning achievement of his acting career. Norton, Watts, Stone and even Zach Galifianakis as his manager/assistant are a pretty extraordinary ensemble of supporting cast members helping him to succeed.The themes, ideas and commentary about art and celebrity make "Birdman" a total critics' film and one with an endless pile of conversation-starters. Each relationship between characters, Riggan's relationship with himself and with Birdman brings its own ideas to the overall film, plus there's the notion about truth in art, being an artist versus a celebrity, the relevance of social media in our lives as it relates to these things and more. Add in how the technical aspects of the film complicate these themes and "Birdman" is a total intellectual triumph. It's also darkly comical, dramatic and bizarre, so the entertainment factor doesn't fall by the wayside.Audiences will enjoy "Birdman" to the point that they can play along with Iñárritu's distortion of reality. Getting too caught up in what's real or what's actually going and not exploring the artistic messaging going on below the surface or emerging from the details will make "Birdman" a frustrating viewing experience. Expand your comfort zone and imagination and "Birdman" takes captivating, creative and majestic flight.~Steven C Thanks for reading! Check out Movie Muse Reviews for more
Judd Apatow delivers again in what is easily his most poignant comedy while still staying true to the antics of his usual band of characters. "Knocked Up" is able to still deliver a lot of the laughs while being honest and meaningful: in other words, something for both guys and girls to enjoy equally. While some might argue that both kind of cheat the other of realizing their full potential (it's not meaningful enough or funny enough), I say the strategy works perfectly.The true quality of this film emerges in the simple contrast between its main characters: Ben, a 23-year-old jobless stoner played by Rogen and Alison, an up-and-coming talent for TV network E! The fact that they have irresponsible sex and Alison gets pregnant forces their different lives together, which allows for a lot of humor in addition to serious relationship drama. With some great writing, Apatow really finds a way to make this a movie everyone can see, enjoy, laugh at and take something away from--a guaranteed success.If you're a girl, you will love Heigl if you for some reason you don't already which means you're one of no people who doesn't watch "Grey's Anatomy" and falls into the target demographic for this film. I would go as far as to say she's so talented that she's rather above this film and doesn't fit. Both she and Leslie Mann, who plays her sister, have a great rep on screen and turn this into a film that can be almost as much for girls as it is for guys. For the guys, Rogen is great in his first leading role and his posse of friends including Jason Segel and Jonah Hill keep the comic relief coming quickly if you feel there isn't enough of it. Their humor doesn't dominate the film, but there's a healthy dose--I didn't find it shortchanged although it was not exactly side-splitting. Rogen is most skilled at being able to do both the romantic comedy and the stoner comedy and not seeming unnatural.Of all the films he produces, the ones Apatow directs (this film and "40-Year-Old Virgin") seem to be the most meaningful ones. His style is very natural and allows for focus on the situations, dialogue and characters, portraying them in a way that is truest to real life. In this sense, "Knocked Up" trounces "Virgin." If you've been in a serious relationship, you've heard all these lines before and of course unplanned pregnancy is a very real occurrence in this world with a set of consequences and predictable actions. The fact that he found a way to do this while still including his trademarks is a testament to his grip on the film industry and will guarantee him a lot more success until someone can match his comedic prowess. Until then, any films with the Apatow tag on them will be the most anticipated comedies each year.
Unlike it's title character, "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" knows exactly what it is. This is a no- questions-asked camp-filled biographical rock musical about a transvestite singer/songwriter. It delivers every bit of that description and anyone expecting something more mainstream from the film should have his/her head checked. But just because it isn't told in conventional fashion doesn't mean it doesn't have the same impact of conventional films--you just need an open mind about, well, a lot of things.The story begins as Hedwig, a transvestite, and her band the Angry Inch tour the Midwest of the United States playing restaurants and other unlikely gigs, following in the tracks of famous recording artist Tommy Gnosis, Hedwig's former lover that appears to have stolen all her songs. In all her gigs, Hedwig tells the story of her childhood in East Germany and her journey to America that includes a botched sex change operation. What is most impressive about the overall film is its ability--through song--to weave the narrative of both past and present. Star, writer and director John Cameron Mitchell gets a lot of credit for that. I never saw the stage production, so I don't really know how much credit that deserves, but it certainly takes a strong vision to create a film that adapts that simultaneously and successfully. His performance as Hedwig simply helps that vision along. Even if you're uncomfortable with trans-sexuality, you warm up to JCM as Hedwig quickly because there is nothing surface-only with his character in this film and he shows that the entire time. The catchy music (if you like punk rock) helps that along too. Most commendably, this film doesn't hold your hand through any discomfort. It's established from the start so there aren't any "GLBT themes," just GLBT characters, though some of the issues they face manifest themselves in ways.The filming in general is very artsy and out there, especially in the final half hour. Everything kind of becomes symbolic at that point and almost entirely unconventional. Some of those scenes are good, but the film leaves you a bit confused because the final half hour is largely dialogue-free and almost all music. It keeps the film from taking the next level, but it doesn't hurt it's overall quality. The film is not something that JCM tries to cater to all film-goers--it definitely takes a person with certain world views and diverse tastes, but that doesn't stop it from being a great film for what it truly is.
If you've never heard of "Sunshine" before or its director Danny Boyle, you probably have one simple and understandably justifiable question: is this another one of those formula space thrillers where people die one by one? The answer is yes...but not exactly. The reason is because "Sunshine" is smarter and more intellectual than any other film where people on a spaceship die one by one, thanks to Danny Boyle.Boyle, most famous for zombie thriller "28 Days Later" shifts to sci-fi for "Sunshine" which is about a crew of astronauts aboard the Icarus II, 50 years from now, on a mission to reignite our solar system's dying sun with an enormous nuclear bomb. The entire film takes place in outer space and the events that unfold are a result of some complications. Perhaps the fact that the ship is the Icarus II is some indication of that. While science skeptics will be quick to jump at the film, the suspense of disbelief comes quite easily and between the writing and producing, the film creates some scientific authenticity in its defense that many similar films don't have.The cast of people dying one-by-one is mostly unknown, though Chris Evans ("Fantastic Four") and Cillian Murphy ("Batman Begins")are a couple of recognizable faces. Evans is actually quite likable whereas that's not so much the case in "Fantastic Four." Since the characters aren't given a backstory, a lot rests on Boyle's shoulders to give the characters some depth and he certainly does that. His attention to eyes and the symbolic idea of the crews' eyes meeting the brightness of the sun brings the plot to level where it is more than just a vehicle to make crazy events happen.While the film most basically addresses the the theme of the individual crew members lives vs. the greater mission of reigniting the sun for all of humanity, there is more going on here. There is a real push of the idea of these characters 'meeting the sun,' as if there is some ultimate confrontation bound to happen that will at the very least have awe-inspiring consequences. It's almost like a science-fiction nerd's allegory for heaven and the afterlife."Sunshine" has the potential to fade out and become just another sci-fi space thriller, but it doesn't because of Boyle. His attention to detail and character and his respect for outer space as being more than just a cool environment for crazy stuff to happen is apparent and worthy of a lot of respect. Here, he demonstrates he is not just a master of suspense, but a master of human drama as it relates to science-fiction.
After two wildly success movies, Sony's "Spider-Man" franchise led by director Sam Raimi seemed as if it could do no wrong. My, how spoiled we were by "Spider-Man" and "Spider- Man 2" that we could be so naive."Spider-Man 3" isn't bad, just ambitious and convoluted. Like its predecessors, the story and screenplay's primary focus remains on Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), the man trying to balance being a student, a boyfriend and New York's No. 1 crime-fighter, and how his new journey will change his perspective on playing all those parts. It's the smallest juggling act of all, however, compared to the plot of this movie."Spider-Man 3" features three villains and four romances between five people. The numbers pretty much say it all there as far as the notion of "too much going on" is concerned. There's no reason a similar core story couldn't be told with half as many subplots, and as such the resulting story reeks of studio interference.The first big-screen appearance of Venom is certainly the big selling point, but if the core of the story is the sun, the story of Venom and Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is Saturn. The symbiote arrives via meteor shower early on, but doesn't latch on to Peter until an hour into the film (nearly halfway). Venom doesn't rear his sinister head until the 100-minute mark (that's all the time most films get). So ... did anyone really want to include Venom in this film?You don't get the sense that Raimi did. Sure, he and fellow writers Ivan Raimi (his brother) and Alvin Sargent find a way to genuinely connect the symbiote subplot to Peter's journey in the film and make it seem as if Venom's appearance is essential to this story, but it has no weight or power  just a lot of great visual effects work.The character of Flint Marko a.k.a. Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) comes off more like a Raimi kind of character. Like Dr. Octopus, and even in a sense Green Goblin before him, Sandman is a sympathetic villain as his motivation is to find the money to make his ill young daughter well again. But as with the film's many parts that show promise, the juggling act stunts it almost completely. Church's character and performance comes across as one- dimensional, especially after he disappears for the entire middle act.The other reason he would've been a fine choice as a solo villain is the way he's linked into the murder of Uncle Ben. To Raimi, Peter has never been able to get over the guilt of incidentally bringing about his uncle's death, and Marko's role in it complicates things for Peter emotionally. This story line provides the one true sense of continuity between the three films and could have potentially put a rounded punctuation mark and emotional note on Raimi's trilogy, but rather than have two characters who badly misunderstand each other duking it out, Venom has to join the party.Oh, have I not mentioned the third villain yet? As suggested in the second film's conclusion, Harry Osborn (James Franco) takes on the mantle of the New Goblin to avenge his father's death and kill Spider-Man, who he knows is Peter. Rather than talk it out with his best friend, he finds him on the street and tries to kill him. This whole subplot  despite being a thrilling action sequence  feels like unfinished business from the second film rather than an integral part of the third. In fact, it results in Harry suffering amnesia, at least as long as it takes to focus on developing the other subplots in the film before vengeful Harry becomes necessary again.Pause from the criticism to praise how high the action and visual effects bar is raised between "Spider-Man 2" and "Spider-Man 3." The CGI looks excellent and the early action scenes showcase Spider-Man doing aerial stunts like we'd never imagined.The other crowning achievement of the franchise has been the romance. We knew the fact that Peter and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) finally came together at the second film's end wouldn't be so happily ever after, but now suddenly they are out of touch with each other's feelings and afraid to tell each other the truth despite MJ knowing Peter's biggest secret. After getting fired from her new show, MJ devolves into a needy and jealous character and Peter has let the fame of being Spider-Man get to his head. These qualities didn't exist before in these characters, but suddenly they do. To complicate matters, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes between them as well. The story of the symbiote is meant to exacerbate their relationship problems, just as it does all the other subplots of the film. Actually, that is about as connected as it all ever gets. The symbiote suit is Peter's choice, and it has consequences throughout each element of the movie.This is Emo Peter's cue. The symbiote naturally has a negative influence on Peter, but rather than simply amplifying aggression or other emotions, it makes him cocky. Raimi gives Maguire this emo look and films him walking down the street handing out catcalls land doing a dance routine in the jazz club where MJ works to make her jealous. Raimi has never shied away from humor, but these scenes are tonally light years away from the rest of the film not to mention the franchise, and they sour nearly the whole movie experience.It's easy to deconstruct the problems of "Spider-Man 3," however, and harder to admit that it's an engaging film with good intentions. Minus the emo sequences, it's just a disappointment, though it didn't have to be. If only there weren't an impossible amount going on, or at least someone told any of the film's creative minds that obvious fact beforehand.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
With "Black Dynamite," it's pretty simple: what you see is what you get. Blaxploitation at its finest, the film attempts to rediscover, through means of both tribute and satire, an oft- forgotten genre of the 1970s. Drug-dealing, flashy clothes, afros, kung fu and a soundtrack layered with wah-wah pedal all contribute to flawless period re-creation. Quite simply, "Black Dynamite" provides a nice care-free jaunt to an odd corner of movie history.Michael Jai White stars as Black Dynamite the ex-CIA Vietnam vet ladies' man with a black belt in ass-whooping. Considering pop culture's ever-growing love of old school badassery (all the Chuck Norris jokes, for example), this character concept fits in with the popular cannon, otherwise the film could come off as a pointless exercise in dead film-making techniques.Black Dynamite takes to the streets with a vengeance because his brother has been shot and killed and children in orphanages are doing smack and ODing more than ever before. The story follows him from lead to lead: every tip-off he gets brings him closer and closer to the people behind his brother's death. To explain more would be a gross waste. Your time will best be served scanning about for the subtle jokes rather than trying to figure out where the "mystery" will go next.Loaded with more "cats" and "jive turkeys" than you could shake a nun-chuck at, "Black Dynamite" relies on the money-maker one-liners, occasionally sneaking in clever bits (especially with regards to the '70s portrayal of women characters) that satirize and honor the entertainment-driven genre of yore."Black Dynamite" provides a rare entertainment experience and merely by attempting to reawaken the genre for a new generation. In spite of how stale the last thirty minutes feel as the plot loses steam, there's no question that the film provides an experience that simply has no equal. Even the styles of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, who have woven '70s technique and style into their essentially modern films, do not pay nearly as much homage to one of film's most interesting eras as "Black Dynamite" does.Rarely does a film provide a cinematic education while essentially existing solely for the purpose of entertainment. Either way, it's enough to get this honkey on board.~Steven C
It's hard to believe a film such as "Harold and Maude" was made in the 1970s. Movies like this one, the off-kilter teen coming-of-age story, haven't really become common place until today. Hal Ashby and Colin Higgins' film was undoubtedly ahead of its time. It's not rooted in pop culture, popular folk-style music is a central element and its sense of humor is a one- of-a-kind blend of dark and free-spirited. Teenagers of today would have an appreciation of it that teenagers in 1971 probably didn't have. It was still probably uncomfortable for a lot of people to embrace the relationship of an older teenager and a crazy old woman, but it's a thing of beauty in this movie.Bud Cort stars as Harold, a morbid teenager obsessed with faking his own suicide, likely because he's been raised in a mansion by his self-centered mother his entirely life. Although a bit repetitive, Ashby creates some of the most memorable scenes on film, like when Harold's mother fills out a matchmaking survey for her son and answers every question for him based on what she thinks while the entire time, Harold is brandishing a pistol and pointing it at her and himself. At one point she can't take it anymore, so Harold sees a shrink, who is of no help.One of Harold's favorite activities is attending funerals, and on one occasion he meets Maude, an old woman with no sense of logic who is just shy of her 80th birthday. Played by Oscar- winner Ruth Gordon, she is a delightful character. Gordon paints her as cuckoo but completely lovable, even if she's a nutjob. She and Harold spend a lot of time together and she enlightens him with her strange but wonderful world view. Their relationship is about teaching the death-obsessed Harold about what it means to live.Maude is a special soul. Her attitude is inspiring. She might be crazy in her ways, but she's as wise as any person experienced in years. There are countless of surprisingly powerful moments from this film, but one great example is of Maude telling Harold how in a field of daisies, each is different though they may look the same. She pities those who see themselves as the latter and not the former. Ashby pulls away to a pan of a huge cemetery where the two can't be seen among the thousands of identical graves. That's a vital theme, really relevant stuff in a coming-of-age story. The fact that there's anything profound in this story is impressive."Harold and Maude" is also funny in a mature way. Nothing is recycled physical humor and as many ways as we see Harold pretend to kill himself, the way it juxtaposes with other elements of the story such as his ignorant mother is true comedy. Higgins and Ashby are all about defying expectation and its really smoothly worked in throughout the movie.I won't spoil the film, but there's one scene that makes "Harold and Maude" a masterful film and not just an ordinary quirky comedy. Normally when you drop a knowledge bomb on your audience, you expect it to sharply impact the rest of the film. It's just merely included here, added to what you know about the complex characters and the fact that it doesn't get so much attention makes it so powerful. Few comedies ever achieve great touching moments like these and that's part of what makes "Harold and Maude" timeless.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
"Role Models" is a film that should be looked up to as a truly bankable comedy. The idea of two oddball characters screwing up their lives and being court-ordered to try and make a positive impact on the lives of two oddball kids is simply rich with opportunity and "Role Models" milks that for all it's worth.Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) are co-workers that promote their energy drink "Minotaur" while simultaneously giving drug talks to schools. Danny has the sudden epiphany after ten years on the job that he's unhappy with his life and it gets him and Wheeler in legal trouble. That brings them to Sturdy Wings, a big brother/big sister program, where Danny is assigned to help Augie (Mintz-Plasse), a teen caught up in the world of medieval role play, and Wheeler to Ronnie (Thompson), a foul-mouthed and quite crude child. Of course, neither of these men are fit to deal with children.The plot sets up several clashes in personality and it results in one of those comedies that never loses sight of the human element. All the characters have problems and their chemistry not only makes us laugh, but causes us to identify with them more, even if their are some soft spots in the script.Rudd is in standard form with his first-rate deadpan. Scott is simply another incarnate of his Stiffler character from the "American Pie" movies, but in the context of a smarter film, he comes out much better than he has in any of his recent work. What really makes the comedy tick, however, is its supporting cast. Jane Lynch as the Sturdy Wings director, for example, provides some of the film's most outlandish lines that merely capturing Rudd and Scott's non-verbal reactions to her is enough to make us laugh. There are also a bundle of familiar faces from the Apatow world and other comedy realms that do this successfully too.The jokes range from outright jokes about breasts and drawings of genitalia to parts of dialog simply ending in overt sexual innuendos that you can miss if you're not listening carefully. The film's creator David Wain ("Wet Hot American Summer," "The Ten") definitely has a presence in the film, but it's clear that Rudd and others assisted in many ways as the humor is not all dry or all crude. There's jokes all along the way, really, and while you may not laugh at all of them, you're guaranteed to laugh at most.It's been awhile since a comedy with a more traditional premise has really been--good--and "Role Models" does it.
Nicolas Cage and director John Turteltaub found a certain magic with the "National Treasure" movies, so it's not surprising that Disney turned to them again in hopes of turning another existing property in the form of the infamous "Fantasia" scene into a possible franchise starter. A story of ancient sorcery and modern action in present-day New York City, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" puts some cool pieces on the game board, but ultimately lacks an "it" factor to captivate its audience.The story begins with an expository prologue (never a good omen for a fantasy film) explaining that the infamous wizard Merlin had three apprentices: Balthazar (Cage), Veronica (Monica Bellucci) and Horvath (Alfred Molina). When Merlin's great rival Morgana was at her most powerful, Horvath turned on the three. Veronica sacrificed herself by containing Morgana within her and Balthazar trapped her and Horvath in a magical nesting doll of sorts. Thousands of years later, Balthazar is in New York City searching for Merlin's successor (know as the Prime Merlinian -- an unfortunate pun on longitude's Prime Meridian), who's the only one who can put an end to Morgana forever. In 2000, a young Dave Stutler wanders into his shop and -- and you believe it -- Merlin's ring fits him. However, Dave accidentally release's Horvath from his doll and Balthazar traps them both again for another 10 years. The experience "ruins" Dave's childhood, but 10 years later Balthazar seeks college-aged Dave (Jay Baruchel), needing his help to stop Horvath who plans to free Morgana and finish what they started.Balthazar takes in a somewhat reluctant physics geek Dave as his apprentice, although Dave would much rather court Becky (Teresa Palmer), a girl from back in his grade school days who he discovers also goes to NYU. Baruchel is effective in his typical socially awkward guy going after the girl role. He's quite adept at turning corny fantasy exposition/explanation from Cage and making a joke of the cheesiness of it all. The trouble is that Baruchel is hard to identify with if you're the target pre-teen boy group Disney's going for. Dave's "in college" and Baruchel has a background in R-rated comedy, so he's not enticing for younger viewers. Women also have nothing to like here as Becky is more the geek's dream girl type character who doesn't factor into the fantasy story except for a small (yet "critical") part. So with no one's attention but the geek audience, it's no surprise "Apprentice" struggled at the U.S. box office. It's a shame because the film does some creative and cool things. The way the modern context and the magic blend is often executed creatively like in the dragon chase scene in Chinatown when Horvath unlocks a long-fingernailed sorcerer friend of his to try and stop Dave and Balthazar. Molina gives the villain the class a good villain ought to have, the only trouble remains that his plan to unleash Morgana so they can raise an army of undead is less than inspiring.Part of the "it" factor that's missing lies in the fact that no character truly steals any of the film as, say, Johnny Depp did in "Pirates." Sure, that's the perfect example, but Cage, albeit funny at times, has no unique characteristics. Part of this also lies in that he's written to give a lot of the explanation and doesn't get to develop a special personality. The writing team has put these characters in a creative and well-established universe, but they simply do nothing memorable with it. Turteltaub gives the actions sequence some razzle dazzle that entertains, but "Apprentice" ultimately falls short of being memorable.As a fantasy geek close to Baruchel's age, watching Cage and our protagonist fling plasma balls around along with other various tricks/curses makes great fun. Also, seeing the naturally gorgeous Palmer, who plays the chill awesome no-drama pretty girl so well, fall for the nerd, takes unfair advantage of my nerd sensibilities. But not only am I not who Disney wanted to go see this film, specifically, but even I can detect that "Apprentice" is a few ingredients shy of a guilt-free romp.~Steven CVisit my site at http://movimusereviews.com
"Singin' in the Rain" is like a theatrical necklace, strung together with gems in the form of musical numbers and then crowned with a sparkling diamond in the middle: the unforgettably classic title track. The running thread in between them might be a little weak, but it's the jewels that that win out in the end.Each musical number carries its own unique magnitude, breathing life, emotion, charm and romance into a lackluster plot. The story is about what happens when the motion picture business in the '20s develops the first talking picture (the appropriately referenced "The Jazz Singer" starring Al Jolson) and how it affects two of the business' biggest stars: Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen)...and of course their quirky piano player Cosmo (played by physical humor extroadinaire Donald O'Connor). Underlying it all is Lockwood's love for a wannabe actress Kathy Selden played by Debbie Reynolds, a relationship built on one of the more preposterous Hollywood fantasies.Because of the plot's unoriginality and the sometimes lengthy tangents the songs take you on, "Singin' in the Rain" is enjoyed by the scene. As a viewer, you pick your favorites and pay more attention to them, dismissing those that bore. O'Connor's humorous turn in "Make 'Em Laugh" is a surefire favorite as is "Moses (Supposes)" and of course "Singin' in the Rain." The choreography and the non-stop energy in these numbers makes them so fun and easy to watch. Other scenes like "Broadway Rhythm Ballet" fit the tastes of the dancing connoisseurs as Cyd Charisse steals you away from the film for a good 15 minutes with her incredible shape and grace. There's also a good amount of gags and slapstick filler between numbers, but the numbers are what make "Singin' in the Rain" stand out. The title number is about the only one that perfectly accompanies the storyline. Don is so head over heels for Kathy that he could sing and dance carelessly out in the pouring rain. That's what makes the scene stick out as classic: most of the other numbers are not extensions of the storyline, they're detours from it, but "Singin' in the Rain" endures on this glorious number.
As a huge fan of the intelligence and beauty that Alfonso Cuaron brought to the third Harry Potter film based on J.K Rowling's fantasy book series, I was saddened to hear that he backed out of the fourth, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," because of the quick year and a half turnaround. Though director Mike Newell -- the series' first British director -- is no slouch, he doesn't fully capitalize on the potential of "Goblet of Fire" being such a departure from the previous novels and full of new characters.The book is cut down immensely, but it works. "Goblet of Fire" moves quickly but stays engaging and has plenty to offer in terms of action and special effects. Potter scribe Steve Kloves does his best work whittling the script down without compromise the key and most memorable parts of the story. In this installment, the much older mop-headed Harry Potter (Radcliffe, now on pubescent decline) is unwittingly selected as the fourth competitor in the Tri-Wizard tournament, a once-in-a-lifetime competition combining Hogwarts with two other magic schools: the boys of Durmstrang and the girls of Beauxbatons. New faces include Brendan Gleeson as MadEye Moody, the new teacher that aids Harry in figuring out tournament clues, Miranda Richardson as nosy reporter Rita Skeeter, "Doctor Who" star David Tennant as a follower of evil Lord Voldemort and Voldemort himself, finally appearing, fittingly played by Ralph Fiennes.An unfortunate side-effect of the condensed script is a slight sacrifice of character. The only actor who gets to take a notable step forward is Emma Watson as Hermione, who gets to play some of the more emotional scenes in the film, in fact she plays a role in just about every one of them. Newell stated this film was intended to shed the kids' goody two-shoes appearance and show them as more mischievous teenagers. While everyone else acts nasty, however, Hermione -- other than a few lines where she acts like a mother to Harry and Ron (Grint) is the exception. Watson's facial expressions -- where a smile sometimes slips in the face of danger or sadness -- is surprisingly candid. We honestly get little growth elsewhere in this film. Even Harry, who despite great acts of kindness in the story that put others ahead of his own would-be gains, doesn't appear to choose the actions so much as just do them because it's in the script. Newell could have been of more use here.Newell also seems to strip just a bit of the magic of seeing so much change to the Harry Potter world that this story brings. He keeps the more realistic street clothes element Cuaron emphasized, especially with the Tri-Wizard competitors wearing the equivalent of Nike for wizards, but every new element that "Goblet of Fire" introduces is sort of done so abruptly. We aren't teased with it or slowly shown its wonder. When we finally see the young adults from the other schools appear in the Great Hall, they do this campy show that hardly captures our imaginations. Even the awe of the Quidditch World Cup is cut short. Apparently we're to believe that a giant CG stadium with flashing lights happening very quickly is enough to scratch the itch of our imaginations. I would have gladly sat through another 10- 15 minutes for a bit more out of all these elements (most of which are in the first half hour)."Goblet of Fire" is quick, entertaining fantasy -- a great adaption of a very lengthy book that is one of the series' most fun and adventurous. I don't quite understand the PG-13 rating, though there are certainly scarier elements as these books only get darker and darker. It simply would have been nice to see the maturity and intelligence that Cuaron brought to the series continued or pushed further.
As a fan of science fiction allegory, social experiment, "The Twilight Zone" and the thriller genre -- no less all those elements combined -- Richard Kelly and his film "The Box" should've at least won me over, but it doesn't. It can't even decide if it wants to remain completely mysterious or explicitly tell us what's going on and any film that has to contemplate that is too complex for its own good. With any story this daring, there's potential for something meaningful. "The Box" does let you glimpse it and draw a few interesting conclusions, but through intellectual jail bars placed before our eyes by the myriad of plot contrivances. In other words, too many plot elements exist in in the film that keep us from ever putting our mind around what Kelly is trying to say. Although he starts simply by focusing on a couple (James Marsden and Cameron Diaz) and their child making an ethical decision, the scope widens to include everything from Arthur C. Clarke references to mindless drones to some indiscernible notion of the afterlife.This beginning piece is based on Richard Matheson's story "Button, Button," which was a short story turned into a "Twilight Zone" episode. In "The Box," a mysterious man with a half-burned face played by Frank Langella drops off a box with a button in it at the doorstep of Norma and Arthur Lewis and their son Walter. He later comes back and gives Norma a proposition: don't press the button and nothing happens, or press the button and receive one million dollars and subsequently someone, anywhere in the world, whom they don't know will die.Well, Norma, a teacher, just lost her teacher tuition discount for her son and Arthur's application to be an astronaut was just denied and despite living in a nice looking house in Richmond, Virginia they apparently have no money, so it's not hard to figure out ultimately what they'll do. After all, don't press the button and there's no film -- not that some people who sit through this would've minded that in retrospect.As with his cult hit "Donnie Darko," Kelly keeps "The Box" fascinatingly creepy. It starts with the colors, the classic string soundtrack from the band Arcade Fire and some peculiar Easter eggs and moves on to more jarring occurrences. There is never a point where things get so absurd that you don't care what happens in the end, even if there's a chance the end could be terribly unsatisfying. It's one of few saving graces for "The Box," but perhaps even this is only for those intrigued by high concept sci-fi mystery that parallels human nature no matter how vague.When any thriller collapses somewhere after the midway point, you can usually blame the fact that too many occurrences in need of explaining were written in order for the writer to achieve his desired end. When James Marsden gets hit in a car by a truck and comes out of a giant light warehouse and that ultimately never gets explained, its degrading to the viewer.The real trouble with "The Box" is how ambitiously it tries to combine the ideas of intelligent life/space exploration with religious notions of life, death and what might come after as well as numerous other elements too many and too difficult to explain. Kelly found that balance between time travel and inter-relationship drama in "Donnie Darko" but "The Box" implodes on itself by severing its little social experiment from the characters with too much unexplained phenomena.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
"At World's End" or "At Wit's End," whatever you want to call it, the third installment in Disney's theme-park-ride-turned-mega-movie-franchise has lost steam thanks to the poor choice to make two sequels narratively dependent on one another. "At World's End" benefits from being the destination and not the bridge that was "Dead Man's Chest," but both films have too many sub-plots and arcs connecting them. The flavor and fun of the characters and acting simply cannot keep up with how quickly the story expands the "Pirates" world.It takes a good half an hour to understand at all what's going on if you're not familiar with the events of "Dead Man's Chest." Jack Sparrow (Depp) is "dead," stuck in Davy Jones' Locker lest he and his beloved Black Pearl be retrieved by friends Will Turner (Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Rush), who makes a triumphant return back from the dead himself. The film's first main sequence takes place in Singapore with Swann and Barbossa trying to enlist the help of Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to man a crew to find Jack.But that's not even the half of it. Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) has made a pact with Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and crew of The Flying Dutchman to track down Sparrow and eradicate all pirates period. Will also has his own plans, to get the Pearl for himself so he can free his father, Bootstraps Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgaard) from the Dutchman.I'm skipping a few sub-plots, but you should get the gist of it by now: too much going on, too many scenes of dialogue involving one character making a deal with another only to break it later in the film. It's almost impossible to catch up, but you can just as easily focus on the caricatures and determine for yourself who's mean and who's likable. All the cast members add something unique, although the relationship between Will and Elizabeth grows weaker seeing as their characters have become so run-of-the-mill. Will's darker side intrigues a bit throughout, but bottom line is that Jack Sparrow doesn't get enough of a spotlight. He's merely one on a list of a dozen characters who get special attention. Whereas the original film had two clear sides, this film has four or five.Sure, the teasing of the greater pirate world out there excites one's imagination a bit. When the pirate brethren come together for their meeting in Shipwreck Cove, we see pirates from all over the world and all the fun the costume and make up departments got to have. The extensive lore that writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio developed begins to take more shape and you start to think that a prequel showing the early pirate years would be a cool thing to see. Then you realize they're talking too much again and they should just fight if that's what they say they're going to do.Upping the stakes in a sequel to bring the world that has been created and embraced by a global audience to such a large scale does seem exciting, but boiled down, "At World's End" could be called a gigantic mess as much as it could be labeled an expansive epic. There's plenty of adventure to be had and some fun, memorable scenes, but these sequels don't take you on a journey in the emotional sense like the first one did. In terms of characters, that's what keeps the quality of these films higher than average. Captain Jack Sparrow is one of those once-in-blue-moon heroes that simply never gets old. Depp continues to be terrific, even though he's subservient to the plot here. Barbossa was a welcome return because Rush handles him so perfectly. Even Nighy, behind all the make up and CGI tentacles, turns Davy Jones into a character we'd like to really know more about.It all really comes down to the mistake of creating back-to-back films with a common thread and feeling this need to flesh out all elements of the film and all characters with sub-plots and back stories and such. It's blender filmmaking. Gore Verbinski probably had a lot of fun with "At World's End," but it turns out to be a super-sized macro version of the original concept rather than another skillfully crafted story set in the same universe.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Oscar deserved is about all one can say about Forest Whitaker's performance as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in "The Last King of Scotland." Whitaker commands each scene he is in, giving Amin the complex and deeply troubled personality that Amin would likely have.The film also deserves praise on other ends. James McAvoy simply gets shadowed by Whitaker, though he clearly holds his own as the film's main character. Director Kevin Macdonald provides a lot of suspense and drama, but more notably, does an excellent job with the other scenes, conveying the time period through both the style of several of the more upbeat scenes.Though the plot is interesting and full of strong cinematic material, it truly is Whitaker that takes it from beginning to end without making you lose one bit of interest. He takes just a solid period film and makes it a truly great one.
It's not hard to imagine the kind of comedy you're going to get from a film that combines amateur bowling washouts, rubber prosthetics and the Amish. That's what "Kingpin" delivers: Lots of gags and quirky, dumb characters. Impressively enough, however, the Farrelly brothers make slapstick feel fresh in this film with tons of obscene, crude and even plain old disgusting humor. This not a film for those who find no humor in stupid, for those who do, "Kingpin" is a very enjoyable film.Woody Harrelson stars as Roy Munson, the 1979 Iowa amateur bowling champion whose life goes south when he gets cheated by Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray) and it costs him his bowling hand. 17 years later he meets Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid) in a bowling alley and sees an opportunity to turn his life around. After convincing Ishmael to leave his Amish community, the two set forth for Reno's $1 million bowling tournament, teaming up with Claudia (Vanessa Angel) along the way.This is a cross-country (Pennsylvania to Reno) comedy adventure where each scene has a bunch of obvious gags, but they're clever (not overused) and usually short and sweet instead of drawn out. That, and the Farrelly brothers also supply some "unspoken" humor like Roy and Ernies' hair flying in several directions throughout the film. So there ends up being a lot to laugh about in this film, which helps a lot with the sort of aimless plot.Harrelson and Quaid are great in the film, though Billy Murray is the actor who really takes this film to the next level. The film's climax is all about utilizing his talents as a comedian and he helps make an okay scene (the climax to an aimless plot) way more tolerable to get through. The rest of the cast is pretty bad with the exception of Lin Shaye as Harrelson's landlady, a scene which deserves no spoilers. Angel is pretty terrible (other than her looks). She lets her British accent slip out a lot and I didn't know she was from the UK before I watched this film.This is a great movie in you're in the mood for some really creative silliness. A fun comedy with enough to keep you entertained the whole way.
It's been nearly 30 years since "Ender's Game" etched itself into the canon of important science-fiction novels, and like so many important science-fiction novels, a film adaptation has toiled in movie development hell, with the "unfilmable" label frequently cast upon it. Gavin Hood ("X-Men Origins: Wolverine") has taken a stab at adapting and directing Orson Scott Card's classic, and with a bold vision, he manages to capture its essence in spite of how narrowly he clears the hurdles of the adaptation.Timing could not have been more perfect for an adaptation of "Ender's Game." The popularity of stories featuring teens training for battle and alien invasion films in combination with today's visual effects capabilities created the perfect storm to finally warrant Ender a green light. The story takes place after Earth was nearly destroyed at the hands of an alien race called Formics, and decades later, we have prepared by training our youngest and brightest in the event that they return, to find a leader capable of eliminating the threat. Andrew "Ender" Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is young boy who has been scouted by Col. Graff (Harrison Ford) and Maj. Anderson (Viola Davis) for the military's elite battle school. He catches their eye because he exhibits unusual genius but also has tendencies toward both courage and ferocity as well as compassion and empathy. They push him through rigorous tests of character and skill to see if he might really be the one.Pushing through also appears to be the motto behind Hood's script. He strings together a number of well-constructed scenes that either inform us about Ender or challenge him in some way, but the film bulldozes through them, practically shoving Ender into his destiny. There are plenty of low-key moments that are unmistakably character-building in nature, but the film's forward momentum is so strong that there's little time to stop and look around, to live in the fascinating world of the movie.Surprisingly, the film doesn't suffer that much for its breakneck pace. Although it would have been nice to see more of the captivating zero-gravity battle room sequences, or have more time to completely grasp the budding friendships between Ender and his schoolmates including Hailee Steinfeld as Petra Arkanian, Hood does a nice job identifying the core themes and universal elements of the story and getting them across with effective storytelling devices.Most of this is as it relates to Ender. A victim of bullying who knows how to turn the tide in his favor, Ender is torn between the ruthlessness it takes to win and the monstrous toll it can take on ones conscience. He strives to be the balance between his older brother Peter's (Jimmy Pinchak) aggression and his old sister, Valentine's (Abigail Breslin) sensitivity. The way Butterfield manages to portray this inner conflict, which is the film's only real "sub-plot," suggests he won't be the kind of child actor who disappears after his teens.Entertainment value, however, rates highest of all that "Ender's Game" has to offer. Hood's vision of Card's world is rich to look at, with outstanding production design that blends sleek, stylish sci-fi elements with tangible technology. You're never once distracted or surprised by the futuristic elements of the film because they blend so well. Battle room choreography and the other sequences that play off technology benefit as a result.Something dissatisfying lingers and lurks about the film as it goes, like you feel cheated each time it takes a big step forward, but sometimes wanting to see more of a film is not a sign of a failed adaptation but of a great one. It would be a stretch to call Hood's adaptation great, but it's to the point and it manages to do the most important parts of the story  the themes  justice. It's not easy to make a movie adaptation that both meets the PG-13 blockbuster requirements of a studio and effectively communicates the mature themes of the source material. "Ender's Game" does it, and in less than two hours at that.Considering "Ender's Game" was once difficult to imagine in one's head, the fact that it comes together on screen in something of a miracle, regardless what you think of Hood's decision- making in actually getting it from one to the other. Plot-wise it leaves something to be desired, but the film achieves so much on a visual level without losing sight of the social message that Card meticulously crafted it to say. When it comes to films with weighty expectations, filmmakers have failed much worse.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
In a decade of reboots comes perhaps the most daring and challenging: the Star Trek franchise. With 40 years of history including a total of around 15 movies and/or TV spin- offs, a database of hardcore fans and a recent history of trailing off into oblivion, Star Trek has been on life support for about the last quarter of that time. Then came J.J. Abrams, a producer/director whose respect and credibility in the business had been entirely created in that 10-year span -- and suddenly Star Trek is getting the makeover that Trekkies might have feared, but that it definitely deserved. The new "Star Trek" is a true 21st-Century Star Trek (how fitting): explosive, exciting, character-driven and a miraculous spectacle to behold. It is surely 2009s first critical and box office success."Star Trek" follows the great action reboots before it in returning Star Trek to its origins: how the U.S.S Enterprise, the golden ship of Starfleet, protectors of the universe , came into being and how its characters forged their relationship on board its deck. Although there is a time travel element to the plot that declares this is an alternate reality and not the true story (to cleanse the creators of any mythos sins they elected to commit), it's a darn fine story that really establishes its characters and shows a maturing process.The catch is that in the future -- a long time after the U.S.S. Enterprise formed -- a Romulan aboard a mining ship named Nero (Eric Bana) watches as his home planet is destroyed by a supernova, an event that arguably could have been stopped ahead of time. The person he blames is Spock -- yes, the one we've come to know played by Leonard Nimoy. When Nero's ship is sent back in time by a black hole technology to the time when Star Trek heroes Spock and James T. Kirk are born, he decides to take his revenge by plotting the destruction of planet Vulcan and making Spock watch his home get destroyed.In the meantime, we witness the growth of Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) and learn how they join Starfleet, as well as the rest of the crew. The evil plot against Vulcan is what brings them aboard the Enterprise for the first time and under these altered reality circumstances, their friendship becomes quite rocky as they try and stop Nero."Star Trek" is an epic story of character development. Vulcans are notorious for being emotionless, but Spock is tested as a half-human whose planet is under attack. Kirk is a farm boy with all the leadership skills but too much of an ego who must learn what it takes to really become a leader. Abrams and writers Orci ("Transformers") and Kurtzman (who writes with Orci on Abrams' newest TV show "Fringe") decide to focus their attention on this and ways to cook up exciting visual sequences, spending less time on what made Star Trek a cultural force back in the '60s: the diversity, the belief in peaceful coexistence and the incurable optimism. "Star Trek" isn't a dark or pessimistic re-imagining at all, but it's distinctly more modern and with that comes intensity and more introspection. It's a different optimism, one that's much more ... informed.The mostly unknown cast is excellent. Abrams always seems to get great small-budget actors in his projects, "LOST" being a fine example, or more significantly that he made Jennifer Garner's career by casting her in "Alias." Quinto (from NBC's "Heroes") is fantastic as a Spock wrestling between emotion and reason and Pine is a really terrific find. Rarely do you find someone with leading man looks and presence who fits himself perfectly into a role as esteemed as Cpt. Kirk. He earns your respect very quickly, even though he's a wise guy. Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg ("Shaun of the Dead," "Hott Fuzz") as Scotty are excellent choices as well. Even John Cho breaks the stoner mold that "Harold and Kumar" created as Sulu. This is a visually striking film. If nothing else, the action will blow away anyone from the biggest Trekkie to the person who thinks Klingons actually cling onto things. There is no lack of imagination on Abrams' part, from the space jump suits to the 2009-style phasers and shuttles. In terms of staying true to the source, Abrams gets a passing grade. The best way to go into the film, however, is to be knowledgeable and mildly aware of the Trek lore. People with no idea will be thoroughly entertained, but the more educated yet open-minded you are, the more "Star Trek" will blow your mind. This will be an exciting new series of films for this incredible franchise.
This is not a knock on the comedic style of Owen Wilson -- I happen to like the guy in mostly everything he's been in, but Dupree? The third wheel constant laugh-getting role is not his forte. He's always been better in tandem (think "Starsky & Hutch" and "Wedding Crashers") and in "You, Me and Dupree" he is playing comedic back-up to the "Me" role, the just- married workaholic (Matt Dillon). Wilson is doing what he does best in the film, but the character isn't strong -- or more importantly funny -- enough. We pity him more than we ever laugh at him and it turns what looks like a fun comedy into an unfunny romance movie.Dupree isn't as much pathetic as he is a "live life by your own philosophy" guy, which has made him careless and ignorant and lands him on the couch of his best friend Carl and his new wife Molly (Kate Hudson) who have just moved into their new home. Essentially, Dupree is no better than any other downtrodden best friend, disgusting brother-in-law or crazy uncle that has made for many a comedy in Hollywood over the years. The only difference is there's nothing more special about him, so when the plot predictably moves toward the dramatic (aka Dupree starts affecting Carl's marriage and things go downhill at work) there's no reason for us to really care. You've either seen it all before, or you think Dupree is this exciting, new lovable character, which means you've never seen an Owen Wilson movie.Unfortunately, not even what's supposed to be funny is funny. There are only so many obnoxious three's a crowd roommate jokes to go around: the smelly bathroom, walking in on sexual acts, destruction of the house/property ... there's nothing new here. The reason could well be that writer Michael LeSieur has no prior credits on any films or TV shows and directors Joe and Anthony Russo have only a couple handfuls of "Arrested Development" episodes under their belts. Hudson is probably the best thing about the movie. Dillon is good, but as the film becomes more about him, he seems more and more unfit for the part. Even Michael Douglas, whose out-of-place"ness" in romantic comedy alone should be good for some laughs, seems to only be playing his Gordon Gekko character from "Wall Street" as Molly's big-business, tough-love dad. Hudson, however, holds together the romance plot line. She's always been talented and her combination of sexy, dramatic and playful make her the easiest character to like. The film gets a lot of its heart from her and from Wilson, and that quality is the most redeeming one it has."You, Me and Dupree" is likable in some regards -- you have to appreciate a film that has heart and wants to tackle ideas about what love and friendship really are. Still, dozens more do it better than "Dupree" and are funnier and more original at the same time.
It seems kind of pointless, in my opinion, to develop such an extensive mythos and history for a centuries old vampires vs. lycans (werewolves) premise when everyone's just going to try and kill each other anyway. Underworld creators Len Wiseman and Danny McBride impressively flesh out their world and backstory, especially so in "Underworld: Evolution" -- then they have all the characters' rip each others flesh out. It's fun for those looking for an imaginative gore-fest, but don't expect to feel deeply invested in the unnecessarily complex story. I imagine if I were in Wiseman and McBride's shoes, I would want to carefully craft my story down to the finest of details and take great pride in my own creation -- but that seems like a lot of energy expended just riddle a film with bullets and blood. Fans of the 2003 film, however, are apt to expect that and in that end they won't be let down.The film picks up right where the original left up and reminding us of the key pieces: Selene (Beckinsale) has killed vampire patriarch Viktor (Bill Nighy) and she and vampire/lycan hybrid Michael (Speedman) are now on the run from the one remaining patriarch of the coven, Marcus. To go any further into the story would take an essay's worth of writing.So neither will the fans who actually enjoyed the backstory and wanted to learn more be disappointed. But doing supporters a solid doesn't make "Evolution" great by default.From the opening scene back in the past with all the vampire immortals decapitating lycans in the snow, Wiseman lets you know this is all about bloody, gruesome death. He wants to catch you muttering "awesome" under your breath as many times as possible. It would've been nice for him to be a bit more selective and not actually construct plot events around creative death scene ideas to make the goriest ones stand out a bit more, but why be nitpicky?Wiseman is also a fan of the vampire sex appeal thing. There's some blood and nudity which is certain to get a select groups' blood flowing and it's incredibly deliberate and non- essential. It can definitely be accused of being bloody vampire porn, but let's just call it Wiseman aiming to please his audience."Underworld: Evolution" is mindless monster action thriller with a lore/backstory that vies to outdo the Old Testament. Fans of the genre will find parts of it to enjoy, fans of "Underworld" will love it and I enjoyed it just enough to feel like I wasn't wasting my time.
"Adaptation" will probably leave you disappointed. But, only the shallow or perhaps those who simply dismiss screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's point will think it merely decent or perhaps even bad. "Adaptation" is a movie about writing movies, a struggle to discover what has significance and meaning in life.The film stars Nicholas Cage as the film's screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, and his twin brother Donald who seems to be more the alter-ego, the opposing force, the opposite of Charlie. Kaufman takes on the project of adapting a book called "The Orchid Thief" for the big screen, only he can't seem to come up with anything - that is until he decides to write himself in the film. In summary, it's a movie about the real Charlie Kaufman telling the story of how he came up with the idea for "Adaptation" in his struggles to adapt "The Orchid Thief" for the big screen.The story is a lot less surreal than Kaufman's "Being John Malkovich" and is a lot more accessible as a result. The character Kaufman's struggles with writing and women are more than relatable, they're distinctly honest and real. The odd relationship between Charlie and Donald is the only strange dynamic, revealing quickly that perhaps Donald is not part of the factual element of the film, that he represents something greater. Cage is perfect for the role. His pathetic neuroticism is essential for the film's effectiveness, but also impressive is Cage's ability to play Donald, someone that feels similar to Charlie yet is distinctly different and namely more confident and care-free. It is easily Cage's best performance, which is not hard to say considering the garbage he's been in.Also wonderful are the supporting roles of Meryl Streep as the author of "The Orchid Thief" and Chris Cooper as the subject of the novel, a toothless flower-loving hick. Both actors bring their credentials to the film and are superb. Director Spike Jonze, though not the source of credit in this film, does do an excellent job (like in "Malkovich") blending the real and Kaufman's (the character) imagination.Without detailing the films climax towards the end of the film, the bottom line is that Kaufman (the actual screenwriter) has provided a film that highlights the direct conflict between higher art cinema and Hollywood blockbusters. His ending is disappointing so that you might think about which is truly more valuable.
There really is something a bit fantastic about Wes Anderson's stop-motion animation debut "Fantastic Mr. Fox." The quirky spirit of the Roald Dahl book could only be captured by a filmmaker with a deep and unforgiving wit. Anderson's dry and subtle sense of humor might not translate into big dollars (at least by comparison to giants such as DreamWorks and Pixar), but his affinity for diverse and amusing characters fits the world of animation better than anyone might expect.Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is a cocky yet certainly charming woodland creature who relocates his family to an area where three nasty and powerful farmers named Boggis, Bunce and Bean live nearby. A former chicken thief, Mr. Fox sees a chance to recapture some of his former glory, even if it means going behind the back of his loyal wife (Meryl Streep). When the farmers catch onto him, they go after his home and family.Snagging your attention from the get-go is the unique quality of the stop-motion figures. Anderson explores the medium's full potential, blending elements of the modern day detail- oriented school of thought with cartoon elements and also playing with the 2-D diorama aspect which is unlike anything done before. Stop-motion masters such as Nick Park are all focuses on making the world seem as real as possible whereas Anderson isn't afraid to make his characters look and feel like moving figurines. He embraces that quality in a way most filmmakers would likely be afraid to do.The details on the close-ups of Mr. Fox and friends are stunning. I can't recall any stop- motion characters that looked so good inches away from the camera. The fur and the way the eyes roll around in the sockets are two unparalleled qualities.Anderson's dry humor lends itself excellently to the family film, which fans of his work probably did not expect, but probably should have. His films have always been focused on family. Tone down the family members to PG levels and the extent to which they are dysfunction and you have an excellent director for such a film. "Fantastic Mr. Fox" would not top any kid's list of family/kid movies, but there's no issues of child-appropriateness. Some physical humor accompanied with the dead-pan wit of of Anderson and his usual suspects (Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, etc) achieve the child vs. parent-geared balance most animated films strive for.Then again, adults will appreciate "Mr. Fox" a whole lot more. Animation has proved itself a viable means of adult entertainment in 2009 with "Mr. Fox" capping it all off. The film will make you laugh in ways you never thought an animated film with talking animals ever could because of how ingeniously understated all the gags are.But "Mr. Fox" is equal parts art, taking stop-motion to new places. The opening sequences of Mr. and Mrs. running through a farm and stealing chickens serves as an ideal taste of what's to come. The camera pulls back and you see the set as if you were one of the filmmakers looking at these miniature models and the two are running around and jumping to some classic-as-always soundtrack choices from Anderson. It is a unique and spirited adventure that despite a somewhat disinteresting plot breaks ground in enough special ways to warrant some serious acclaim.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
A temperamental aspiring hockey star with no talent finds he has a gift for the game of golf and uses it to make enough money to buy his grandmother's house back. This has light- hearted sports comedy written all over it. Toss in the comedy of Adam Sandler and then you go from light-hearted to wacko and borderline stupid. Either way, "Happy Gilmore" is about as easy to watch as rain drops on a window.Like all collaborations between Sandler and director Dennis Dugan, "Happy" is full of strange characters (grandmas, midgets, awkwardly tall people) and stuck up, obnoxious antagonists (like Shooter McGavin) that make you like Sandler's terribly flawed character merely by default. Like many of his earlier films, "Happy" is one of Sandler's angry roles, where the physical comedy reigns supreme. Not his best gig, but amusing enough. The scene where he is learning to putt and takes his frustration out on a mini-golf robotic clown head pretty much sums it all up.There are a few humorous nuggets from this film that have a high place in the list of top Adam Sandler comedy lines/moments, like the fight with Bob Barker accompanied by the timeless "the price is wrong, bitch." Other than those few great lines and funny scenes, there isn't a whole lot to love about "Happy Gilmore," but it acknowledges that and doesn't waste your time at just 90 minutes long.
War is a horrible thing. That's the general message of Stanley Kubrick's "Paths of Glory," but it's not meant in the sense of people killing other people is bad, it's because war makes us dehumanize ourselves, make poor decisions and devalue human life. This is a war story told on one side. The antagonist in this film is not the other side, it's the people in power and our inability to see clearly because our judgment is clouded by ideas we claim to be greater than ourselves. The film might not seem like a fair portrayal of the military, but it is a masterpiece of showing how war can turn us into terrible people if we're not careful.Set on the French side against the Germans in World War I, the film is about a French offensive that ends in death and retreat. When the general charges the survivors with cowardice punishable by death, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) must defend the lives of three of his men from the military powers that want to make an example of their execution. It is a story told with blunt dialog about the use and abuse of power, but it is structured and executed in a way that creates audience sensitivity and emotion first to justify the dialog's use.It also helps the dialog to have much of it delivered by Kirk Douglas. Col. Dax is not a flawless character, but he's about as good as they come: smart, honest, passionate and selfless. Douglas plays the role with equal conviction -- it's hard not to cheer for his character and it's incredibly satisfying whenever he outsmarts the corrupt characters. Though he's far from French (a little authenticity in the film in general, like French extras at the least would've been nice)Though Kubrick's talents will flourish in his later films, "Paths of Glory" is filmed beautifully. It is not a very visual war film, there is a lot of dialogue, but Kubrick somehow conveys his meaning so clearly to the audience. He mixes in shots of various lengths, carefully picking his close-ups of characters to indicate the pivotal moments and sometimes capturing the whole setting from far away for dramatic impact. He also uses a lot of long takes, a couple of times following one character who is the focus of the previous scene until the character focused on in the next scene walks by, then he changes directions. The techniques are simple, but they catch your attention when meaningful. Douglas and others like George Macready as the corrupt General Mireau also help maintain that dramatic interest.Once fantastic choice Kubrick makes is keeping the Germans out of it. You never see them, only their artillery exploding in the war zone. It's critical to understanding that the real war here is not against the Germans, its within the French ranks. It's a war Kubrick wages against unfairness and injustice. He also portrays a wide range of character reactions to war. Of the three prisoners, each provides the viewer a unique insight to war and imminent death. The film really begins to make you rethink what courage is. Is it courageous just to accept death, even under unfair circumstances? Each prisoner's battle becomes a microcosm for the initial conflict of the soldiers retreating or in some cases not even leaving the trenches."Paths of Glory" is an incredible statement film about war's dark side, about how we're taught to fight for certain things like glory and patriotism and to obey all orders. This film downright questions it from the beginning and supports itself throughout its duration. It then goes on to address deeper questions of courage, faith and ultimately the timeless question of whether or not humans are inherently good or evil. At 87 minutes long, "Paths of Glory" still manages to tell a vital story with passion and grace.
James Bond has been going strong for 50 years on the big screen, but it has taken until this most recent incarnation starring Daniel Craig for anyone in control of this enduring franchise to realize that giving Bond a soul could be a good thing. Frankly, "Skyfall" gets personal  and it's about time. "Skyfall" maintains the serious tone set since "Casino Royale," though it's not as grim or humorless as "Quantum of Solace." With much of the film taking place in London and the U.K., suddenly MI6 has become this tangible thing rather than some elusive, top-secret government organization that has no bearing on the plot of the movie other than giving Bond a mission. M (Judi Dench) is a real person now, not just a talking head barking orders at Bond and reprimanding him with delightful sarcasm (though she still does that).Bond has also entered the era of cyber-crime. The launch point for the story is that M has lost a drive containing a list of NATO agents located within terrorist cells, not to mention that MI6 is being targeted by a cyber-terrorist who has also already managed to infiltrate headquarters. Suddenly the world of Bond feels as though it exists in our world, and Bond himself is no longer just the poster boy for tuxedos and acceptable misogyny.In the opening action sequence in Istanbul, Bond takes a bullet and is presumed dead, leading to a born-again story line that strips him to his weakest form and forces him to really think about why he's an agent. In a sense, "Skyfall" is a bit of a reboot after things didn't go so well in "Solace," examining the core of the Bond character.After the opening and Adele's strong theme song, "Skyfall" doesn't get that interesting until Javier Bardem enters the picture. The sequence in Shanghai serves the film's global appeal and teases us with the supremely lovely Berenice Marlohe, but it's Bardem who really steals the film.Considering his Oscar-winning turn in "No Country For Old Men" it will come as no surprise to anyone that Bardem makes a good Bond villain, but Raoul Silva is more effectively written than the majority of the franchise's baddies. In essence, he's a Bond-friendly take on The Joker. Bardem gives the role enough of a wacky edge to make the part eerily effective. Plus, when it comes to Bond movies, the bigger the villain, the bigger the stakes, and they're pretty high in "Skyfall."The most distinctive factor differentiating "Skyfall" from the rest of the Bond canon is how it explores Bond's relationship with M. Both characters come under a lot of fire in this film and in every way you can imagine, and the script uses this to create a new dynamic between these two mainstays of the Craig-era Bond movies.Visually, Sam Mendes does the job Marc Forster could not with "Quantum of Solace": bring his dramatic and visual pedigree into the world of the blockbuster action movie. Mendes has a smoother and more seamless style when it comes to the action scenes. Veteran D.P. Roger Deakins certainly brings a whole other level of aesthetic that the series just hasn't seen before as well. When we do get more sprawling scenic shots, they're worth the lag time.Bond movies have been much more explosive than "Skyfall," but it has no equal in as far as the level of depth. "Casino Royale" took Bond to a more emotional place, and as such it appealed to a wider audience, but it was not necessarily a deeper place. The psychological approach to the character is so refreshing and exciting for the future of Bond, at least while Craig is still involved. He is lucky to be given material much richer than ever handed to Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan or (especially) Roger Moore, but to his credit he just nails the complexity of this new-age Bond.Funny then, that in taking Bond down such a new path, "Skyfall" ultimately arrives at a familiar and comfortable destination. How the film does so many new things while staying true to the tone of Ian Fleming's great character and the film formula it inspired is by far its greatest achievement.~Steven CThanks for reading!

I called "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" a 2.5-hour exhibition of a hurricane in a hardware store. There should have been nothing exciting, therefore, about the prospect of a second 2.5-hour exhibition  this time of hunks of scrap metal perpetually raining over Chicago  filmed entirely in 3D. Yet with the added assurance of the 3-D fusion camera system and someone with as keen an eye for action as Michael Bay, there was something thrilling  at least in theory  about this installment.It also helped, for me, that Bay apologized. He was among many involved to admit the problematic nature and various shortcomings of "Fallen" and vowed a better experience this go-around in "Transformers: Dark of the Moon." Redemption, it seems, would be a good way of categorizing "Dark of the Moon." It's hardly the disaster its predecessor was, but it's also hardly what most would classify as "good." Fortunately, it has plenty of (thoughtful) satisfying action with enough traction for us to actually give a damn about what happens on screen.In this third chapter, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) lives in D.C. with his new girlfriend, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). She's a bit more charming, though equally positioned for the purposes of eye candy, than Megan Fox. Sam's trying to get a job, but finds that he only felt confident in himself or important when he was saving the world with the Autobots. When the U.S government makes a discovery proving that Transformers first made contact with our planet in 1963 when a ship crash-landed on the moon, a chain of events occurs and Sam finds himself with the chance to be a hero again. Basically, if the Decepticons were to get ahold of what's on the moon, destruction would befall Earth, unsurprisingly. For one, "Dark of the Moon" provides a worthwhile 3-D experience. Bay and 3D seem like a perfect marriage of auteur and medium. Only he and other style-first types could imagine an action sequence worthy of capturing in 3D without intentionally making stuff fly out toward the audience. Some of it's breathtaking, but most of it simply looks good. The "Transformers" series has only ever been as good as its paint job, and the look of "Dark of the Moon" is crisper and cleaner than "Fallen."Yet many of "Fallen's" problems transfer to this installment, in particular length, story and an overabundance of characters and robots. Other than a key plot twist halfway through, the story lacks any grounding. At this point as well, the focus shifts away from Sam and onto the Decepticons trying to take over the world. Writer Ehren Kruger takes so much time to set up the historical context of the dark side of the moon and Sam's feeling of insecurity, yet he throws all that setup out the window when the action finally takes off. By then, we're ready for Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots anyway, so who cares.An extended lineup of new mechanical friends probably made the folks at Hasbro happy, but there are too many Transformers to count in this film and so many lose the attention they deserve. Rather than focus on the effective ones like Soundwave and Laserbeak, Shockwave and Sentinel Prime, we get various bots shifting into the spotlight so that no one gets a distinct personality. Only those who've seen the prior films will feel moved by scenes involving Bumblebee, Optimus Prime and Ironhide, for example. The ceiling to care about these bots is high, but the sheer number keeps us from getting there.More problematic, however are the number of people actors. The human characters outside of Sam have always been obnoxious and inconsequential to the story, so to fill so many roles with A-listers such as John Malkovich, Frances McDormand and Patrick Dempsey feels more wasteful than not recycling a dead Transformer. Audiences are paying to see the robots fight in 3D, not the humans talk. Unless you're going to deliver a story where the humans matter, don't bog us down with them.Then there's the humor and political incorrectness that the "Transformers" movies can't seem to shake. Although nothing's as insulting as the racist twin motorcycle bots from "Fallen" that have been eliminated, the two "mini transformers" and some English race cars that McDormand calls assholes take their place. Some of the jokes are surprisingly spot-on, but it ends up excessive and uncalled for more often than not. Michael Bay also continues his lady- ogling with Rosie making her "Transformers" debut from the waste down.So maybe Michael Bay is just a stubborn old filmmaker who knows what he likes, but one gets the sense with "Dark of the Moon" that he sharpened up a bit to make sure this film didn't outrage the fan base. Some filmmakers whose movies make $900-some million take that as creative license to make edgier projects, but in Bay's case, he makes it more how he likes it: big, loud, slick and sexy. It's unlike most filmmakers to make their films more Hollywood- pleasing as they gain notoriety and respect, but Bay's turned it into an art form. In the case of "Dark of the Moon," he's upped the emotional and visual stakes to create an engaging feat of blockbuster. Although some of his contemporaries would have us believe that explosions and fighting should come with a side of philosophical sermon, Bay reminds us that there's value in wowing an audience and that doing so requires talent, even if that talent normally rates behind great storytelling.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Science-fiction films can be some of the most entertaining and intelligent films ever made and they can also be the cheesiest. "Pitch Black" falls somewhere in between, caught between the desire for alien horror flick entertainment and an intriguing concept for suspense and drama.Basically a group of space travelers awake from hypersleep to find their ship crashing. Their captain, Fry (Mitchell) manages to land them without killing them all on an unknown planet with perpetual sunlight. Man-eating aliens inhabit the underground though they are afraid of light, which isn't a problem until the travelers realize they will witness a total eclipse before they can repair a ship to escape on. They've also got a convict named Riddick (Diesel) as cargo.Riddick makes this film, in honesty. Everyone loves a good anti-hero, a guy with a bad rep that lays a beating on everyone and uses others' prejudices about him against them to look really clever. Oh, and a dude with night vision. Diesel gives Riddick the on-screen command his character requires. He comes off as brutish, but somewhat trustworthy. It's strange, but it really works.The rest of the characters aren't so great. Mitchell is a pretty good protagonist, but Cole Hauser, who plays Johns, the arrogant cop, acts like he's intentionally trying to be a poor man's Josh Lucas or Matthew McCoughnahey. It also doesn't help that the characters are under-developed, including Riddick, though that adds to his character in ways despite us wanting to know his past.The concept for this movie is cool, the way it goes from light in the first half to complete darkness in the second and the way that transition corresponds with our thoughts about Riddick is interesting. The plot, in general, is pretty lousy. For some reason, the writers opted to go with the disaster/horror movies formula of the 90s--kill off one person from the group at a time so only the characters that are well-received survive. Yes, there's that and the "get the fuel back to the ship on time and don't leave anyone behind so we can escape" cliché. David Twohy really saves the plot in those regards by keeping things interesting. He does some interesting shots that involve a lot of quick, simultaneous cuts and close ups--a more radical style that definitely works for sci-fi. In general, the color palette is very carefully chosen with the light and dark contrast and overall the special effects were very satisfactory for 2000"Pitch Black" is not a consummate suspense or sci-fi thriller, but it does keep you interested enough to want to know more about Riddick or what else the imagination of "Pitch Black" has drafted. Basically, what could have ended up really "b-movie-esque" and terribly cliché and awful ends up solid thanks to some good decisions by Twohy.
Ridley Scott's "Alien" was an eerie science-fiction masterpiece that perfectly captured a haunting feeling of space and redefined "intelligent life." Then comes time for a sequel and James Cameron, 80s action extraordinare, takes the reigns. Conflicting visions? You'd think, but somehow Cameron is able to increase the explosions without frying what made its predecessor so successful.Part of that success is the strength of Sigourney Weaver as the courageous Ellen Ripley, the best sci-fi heroine in cinematic history. This time, Ripley is awoken from hypersleep over 50 years after her first encounter with the Alien to find that the planet it was discovered on has been colonized by humans and those humans have suddenly lost contact. Ripley is asked to aide a team of space marines to check on the colonists and what they find are, well, Aliens. Lots of them.Cameron makes sure that the sequel continues Ripley's story, portraying her yet again as being doubted by others and having to correct the life-threatening mistakes they make. She continues to captivate viewers because she reacts naturally to scary situations but then chooses to act courageously.Then, Cameron adds plenty extra guns, flame-throwers, grenades, Alien goo and more. It's almost overkill how much stuff explodes in this film and yet it never loses credibility with its audience because of the believability of the characters' struggle for survival.The plot, while a very honest follow-up to "Alien," is structured in a very deja-vu manner to that film, most obviously the idea of making you think it's over when it's not over. There are also similarities in character betrayal as Ripley is apparently the only one that thinks straight up killing the Aliens is a good idea. "Aliens" is much more exciting and fast-paced than the original, though the original still one-ups it with its strong, resonant themes about space and life. This film continues those themes but doesn't add to them like a brilliant sequel does. It instead chooses to honor the strength of the original while pumping up the special effects, which are truly grandiose and stunning.
One crime, multiple vantage points. Sounds cool right? Yes. But "Vantage Point" never really pulls it off quite how it sets itself up to. The result is a cool action flick with some clever storytelling that sort of fizzles in the end.In "Vantage Point," the President of the United States (William Hurt) arrives in Salamanca, Spain to give a speech on global terrorism efforts and ties with Spain to improve them. He gets shot and then a bomb goes off killing many people. We get this story through the eyes of a variety of characters and by the end of the film know exactly what happened.The cast is a solid mix of familiar and old faces. Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, Matthew Fox (of LOST fame) and even Sigorney Weaver give this film the star power it requires. The terrorists are entirely new faces, which is no real surprise.As the film first presents the vantage point concept, the first thirty or forty-five minutes develop a redundancy. You do get many new perspectives, but seeing the same events happen over and over again and the cheesy rewind sequences to establish a change in POV really gets a bit boring. Sometimes you're not really seeing something new, just the same old thing in a new way that doesn't really bring more insight into the plot. Sometime it does and it really helps the film, but mostly it's not the vantage points, but cutting the story off at pivotal moments and clues into the mystery so that when they're revealed in another perspective you can get excited. It's just good storytelling, nothing unique.The film really loses its appeal, however, with the "final perspective." In fact, it's not really anyone's perspective. The writers sort of realized that adding five more perspectives to reveal the full mystery (which is what it would have taken) would really bother viewers and get absurdly repetitive, so they combined them all into a final twenty minute action sequence that is like any other normal action movie. Was deviating from the concept in order to please viewers and keep the film short the best course of action? For this film, yes. Sticking to the concept would have made it bad considering the complexity of the plot. But even the ending can also be seen about 15 minutes prior to when it happens, so it's not really all that great. This film would have been better, however, if it could both stay true to the structural concept and please the viewer, which means first-time writer Barry Levy stretched his idea just a bit too far. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/
Dancing, passion and familial struggle are all tied together in the high-spirited "Billy Elliot," the little independent film that could in 2000, when such films were drastically under- appreciated. "Billy Elliot" caught some attention however because it combines the dream-like fancy-free spirit of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films along with the social-historical context of the '80s coal miner strike in England. Youthful optimism and social reality are at odds as seen through the young Billy (a very talented Jamie Bell) and the film doesn't let either one completely win out, an admirable and unexpected quality for a story about a child.Pre-teen Billy lives in a small England town where his father (Gary Lewis) and brother (Jamie Draven) are picketing as part of the coal miner's strike, so money is scarce. His father then becomes especially angry to find out Billy's been taking the money he was supposed to be using to pay for boxing lessons for ballet instruction instead. Despite his father's disapproval at his son taking up a "girl's" activity, Billy meets regularly with Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters) to prepare for the Royal Ballet School audition.The feature film debut for both writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry, "Billy Elliot" is a real triumph of art imitating life. In a stroke of inspired creativity, Billy dances when he feels it, when he needs to express emotions of anger or excitement or when he was something to prove. Scenes are intercut often to show how Billy's drive to master ballet is indicative of a need for self-discovery, family approval and learning how to handle life's challenges.With a soundtrack mixing '70s English rock band T-Rex with classical music and orchestration by 1999 Oscar-winning composer Stephen Warbeck, "Billy Elliot" takes on this true independent spirit. It's far from the cheesy uplifting string music of an inspirational drama and more true to its historical context. Its much easier to sympathize with Billy's yearning for movement and his description of "electricity" in terms of how dance makes him feel with modern music.Billy's dancing outburst scenes give the film the feel of a dance musical movie ala the Fred Astaire era of Hollywood, while his angry and emotionally withdrawn father as well as Billy's own fits of irrational anger ground the movie in the struggles that surround the Elliot family on a daily basis. The film is also not a social commentary on gender roles despite the conflict of Billy wanting to dance and his father wanting him to box. Billy takes an unexplained interest in dancing and doesn't exhibit any "homosexual" tendencies. This is about doing something you're passionate about, not a child's struggle with his gender identity. Billy's cross-dressing friend is there to remind us that one thing is not connected to the other, but the film doesn't waste time overdramatizing this small conflict in a greater story."Billy Elliot" is a special film, one that perfectly fits the magic of finding one's passion within the troubles of real life and a cast that accurately reflects that vision from Daldry and Hall. It acknowledges that with good comes bad and with reward and hard work comes nervousness and discomfort. It's a unique outlook for a movie based about a young boy and his dreams. ~ Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
The American public is no stranger to the MPAA ratings system and its inherent flaws. Everyone has his or her own opinion about the level of censorship that goes on in Hollywood and what is appropriate for what age group and so on. But you don't really know what it's about until you watch Kirby Dick's documentary "This Film is Not Yet Rated."Anyone who pays more than surface-level attention to the goings on in the film industry knows an NC-17 rating is a death sentence for a film. You kill off advertising possibilities, your film won't get played in as many theaters -- millions of dollars are at stake. What you might not know is that (as Dick and most would argue) NC-17 is not a rating so much as a way to force filmmakers to edit "questionable" material. In some cases it's as specific as "if you cut this, this and this then you'll get an R."Dick interviews filmmakers and their experiences with fighting the ratings system in films such as "Boys Don't Cry," "The Cooler," and "American Psycho," but his goal is to find out who the raters on this panel of ratings screeners are because America is the only country that isn't transparent with that information. He hires a private investigator to obtain the information and the methods and results are interesting. It's very guerrilla-style and quasi- professional looking but it works.There are only a couple problems with Dick's film. It wanders at times from the subject of film ratings into other censorship-relevant topics that while important deviate from his objective of learning how the MPAA operates in terms of ratings as far as what they don't tell the public. At one point he explores discrimination in ratings toward gay and lesbian sex and themes and only briefly touches on how violence is not rated as strictly as sex. Important stuff, but it's just not given enough treatment to be effective in the film.The tone of the documentary is very Michael Moore without the conflict. It's satirical and gives you a couple head-shaking moments of disbelief, but its impact is not all that impressive. You leave the film thinking "yup, what they're doing isn't right" and having gathered some new insights, but other than reminding us that a handful of companies control our media and that everyone is in everyone's pockets, namely recently retired MPAA chief Jack Valenti, there seem to be no solutions, no forward movement on the subject matter. Definitely interesting and a worthwhile watch for any movie-lover.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
When promotions first started appearing for "Seven Pounds," nobody had a clue what this movie would be about. They saw Will Smith being intense and some trailer editing suggesting a mystery/thriller and figured exactly what the studio wanted them to think: "if that dude's in it, it's good enough." With Smith being Hollywood's most bankable star, the hope was that audiences, after sitting through what they thought would be an intense Will Smith movie, would enjoy one of the best payoffs recently written for the screen. Well, it's a good payoff, and Smith's good, but the end doesn't justify a whole movie of guessing what Smith's character is doing every time he gives us one of those emotional wrinkly faces. There's just not a lot of interesting conflict or drama to excite us for the whole two hours.Though it'll be a failed exercise to increase understanding, I will attempt to explain the movie's premise. Smith is Ben Thomas, an IRS auditor who for reasons we can only guess are related to a car accident and something happening to his wife/girlfriend, is attempting to do something good for seven strangers in need of medical help. One of them is Rosario Dawson and there's a lot of chemistry.The trouble with "Seven Pounds" is that the things motivating its main character are completely unknown to us, which jeopardizes us caring about the success of his mysterious mission to do good things for good people. Understandably, if we know what he's doing, the payoff isn't as good in the end, but good movies do both. Smith and Dawson create good chemistry, but Smith is acting purely based on what we don't know and we can't empathize with the fact that every time we feel their romance brewing, he emotionally backs away and deprives us of the conflict we're craving the whole film. Dawson really outshines Smith in the film. Her character is in need of a heart transplant and sees him as a chance to live a happy life despite staring death in the face every day. The broad-smiled actress really helps sucker us into the romantic subplot with her cute ways.Gabriele Muccino, who worked with Smith in "Pusuit of Happiness" provides great direction and milks the script for all the visual drama he possibly can, but there's only so much he can do with all juicy parts at the end of the script.Still, "Seven Pounds" does indeed have a great ending that beautifully adds meaning to the film and its prior events. Problem is it's all of the film's meaning and all at once. This is probably a movie that rates 8/10 stars after watching the second time (or for all the romantic drama softies on the first time). For his first screenplay, you have to give Grant Nieporte a lot of credit. He'll get it next time.
In the era of the gritty blockbuster actioner, tongue in cheek action has become a lost art in Hollywood. 1997's "Con Air" resides between the tongue-in-cheek heyday of the '80s and the explosive realism of today, but it certainly leans toward the former.Nicolas Cage stars as Cameron Poe, an Army Ranger who immediately after returning home to Alabama gets in a brawl with some drunks that turns deadly. He lands in prison, having to wait eight years to finally see his wife and the daughter he's never met. But when parole day finally arrives, his lift home comes in the form of a U.S. marshal max-security aircraft transporting the country's most dangerous criminals. When they manage to overtake the plane, Cameron proves to be the only one capable of thwarting them."Con Air" takes much delight in its concept. Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg gleefully crafts an array of criminal characters that are absolute freaks, but not without a large degree of self- awareness as to their rotten nature. Equipped with absurd nicknames such as Cyrus "The Virus" Grissom and Johnny-23 (23 being the number of women he's been convicted of raping), these villains strike a balance between formidable and not to be taken too seriously.John Malkovich leads the way as Cyrus, a "learned" convict who educated himself in prison. Malkovich has fun with his typical over-enunciation and patented snide tone, making him the ideal cliché mastermind. Ving Rhames plays his right hand and physical compliment, Diamond Dog, a black supremacist of sorts. The other convicts receive boatloads of personality and the script hypes them up ahead of time. Steve Buscemi's Garland "The Marietta Mangler" Greene even gets the Hannibal Lecter treatment ... yup, Steve Buscemi.These nut jobs actually make a lion-mained Cage speaking in an awful Southern accent seem totally normal. As ripped as he's ever been in his career, Cage makes for a convincing action hero, though his real strength turns out to be how flips countless one-liners into enjoyable movie quotes. Cage seems to know exactly what kind of a movie he's in and never flinches. Few actors can say the line "put the bunny back in the box" with a straight face and get away with it. Cage has always had that gift.Director Simon West keeps the tone light, but that doesn't mean he also eases up the on the action. "Con Air" has a pretty relentless motor and all of its major sequences feel as though they could be the climactic showdown. It could've ended an hour in and been effectively entertaining, so everything in the final hour feels like a bonus. The degree of explosions does get to an absurd level by the end, but that's part of the film's charm.To some extent, there does feel like a wasted opportunity to create an intense self-contained action thriller aboard the plane. One man trying to stop a plane hijacked by horrific convicts has plenty of potential, but the plane lands three times in the movie, plus John Cusack's character, Larkin, plays the U.S. marshal trying to rectify the disaster and keep an over- zealous DEA agent (Colm Meaney) from jeopardizing his plan.Helping us stay invested in the outcome is the desire to see Cameron and his daughter meet for the first time. The film spends not 10 minutes setting up the "relationship" between the two (Cameron's lone motivation) in hopes we'll care and somehow we do. Care too much, however, and you start to wonder how a guy on parole gets stuck taking a plane full of the worst of the worst and why at one point he elects not to take an easy out. Those are not questions worth wondering.A lot of action films struggle to cross the border from ridiculous and stupid to tongue in cheek and facetious, but "Con Air" is one of them. From the story to West down to the actors, there's an unspoken acknowledgement of exactly what kind of a movie this is and together they churn out one of the '90s finest guilty pleasure action films.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Nothing happens in "Before Sunrise." Two strangers, an American and a French woman, meet on a train and spend an evening together in Vienna -- end of story. Few combinations of script, director and talent could pull this off as a good movie, but Richard Linklater and stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy find a way. Filmmaking has never been this simplistic or difficult. You couldn't devise a film with a more generic premise, which is to say that you couldn't make it any harder on yourself as a filmmaker to make something from seemingly nothing. The characters have to not just be likable, but lovable, the romance has to suck us in and the dialogue has to shoulder the entire workload. Yet that's exactly what "Before Sunrise" does. The ceiling for the film is pretty low, but it presses right up against it.Maybe the best part about the characters of Jesse and Celine is that they're pretty normal- looking. They're both attractive, but subtly so, which is where Linklater's film and typical Hollywood fare differ. There's a layer of implicit sincerity there that we don't get from most love stories where beautiful people do things we could only fantasize about it on our best days. Jesse and Celine's connection is built on a natural chemistry and everything might conveniently "work," but it feels real and natural.Hawke and Delpy sell us hard on being normal people. The discussions they're provided in Linklater and Kim Krizan's script helps this along nicely, but the moments they share, whether nervous and tentative, tender or humorous are felt on all levels. What's written is never good enough in a romance, but how the actors convince us of the truth to their words with body language and communicating a multitude of signals both to each other and to the camera. Their romance feels like the romance we not only want to have, but unlike Hollywood, we also feel like we can attain. That's what sets "Sunrise" apart.Hard to imagine how this film came from the same mind as the man behind "Slackers" and "Dazed and Confused." All good films, but the focus on two characters here makes the difference. The real strength of the script here lies in the creation of complex character backstory without the use of expository writing or flashbacks. By the end of the film, you know exactly the kind of people the two of them are, even though you've only seen it through their interactions with each other. "Before Sunrise" should definitely be considered the benchmark for romance films. Literally no events occur in this film yet it stays interesting through lively and sincere conversation from two actors that have a knack for realism. Hundreds of films have and will be done better in the romance genre, but the structural bones of "Before Sunrise" are the most immaculate around. Even if a film doesn't put you on edge or do something special, you have to be able to recognize great intangibles and there's no arguing with those of "Sunrise."~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader," the third book in "The Chronicles of Narnia" series and the fifth chronologically speaking, is often cited as a favorite among fans of the C.S. Lewis fantasy books, which is a shame because the writers here have taken extensive liberties with the story. Although I'm one to frequently remind people that films are films and books are books, "Dawn Treader" the movie is mediocre no matter how you look at it or which order you visit the story's islands in.It's apparent now why Disney dumped the "Narnia" franchise after "Prince Caspian" yielded disappointing results compared to "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe." Fox tried to give it new life on a smaller budget, but sadly the lesser funds make it come off truly second rate. Better to not make any more films if you can't increase the wonder or impressiveness in the next installment. The green mist (that was made up by the writing team in the first place) serves as a terrific example of doing television-level special effects in a big-screen feature film.Set on the high seas, you might consider "The Dawn Treader" the "Pirates of the Caribbean" of the "Narnia" series (and the film even "borrows" some musical themes from the Disney franchise's iconic score), so the potential for greater wonder exists, but with a budget $70 million less than "Prince Caspian," that makes it tough. The imaginings of some of the book's most iconic moments lack a true artistic touch or inspiration.In this adventure, only Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) return from the first two films, which would be factually correct  that's not an example of the budget cuts. They're joined by their cousin Eustace, one of the most obnoxious children in literary history played brilliant (although much to our chagrin) by Will Poulter. When a picture in Eustace's house starts to leak water (one example of good special effects in the film), the three find themselves in the seas of Narnia where Caspian (Ben Barnes), now king, picks them up in his finest ship, the Dawn Treader. Although all seems well in Narnia, the kids join him on his quest to find the seven lost Lords of Telmar, which Caspian feels will give him some closure regarding his father.In "The Odyssey" fashion, the story takes the crew from island to island where they encounter an green mist, a growing evil force of darkness that looks to exploit fear and corrupt (think Darkseid in "Superman" or Galactacus in "Green Lanter"). Each main character has a flaw (some bigger than others) that will be exploited on the journey.Dragons and a battle with a sea serpent make up the main draws for visual effects and excitement. The battles are far from epic, but a PG rating will do that to you, especially on a smaller budget. The most that "Dawn Treader" has going for it is this un-hatable positive spirit powered by that child-like sense of wonder. Primarily through characters such as Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg), the film retains its charm and it keeps it afloat long enough. Lewis had an undeniable gift for the magic of fantasy and director Michael Apted helps keep that alive in some respects.Like Narnia no longer needed the services of Peter and Susan as will be the case with Lucy and Edmund, the audience these films needed to keep going strong has simply outgrown it or faded away with disinterest thanks to a focus on family-geared entertainment. I suspect the "Narnia" films (if they are able to make all seven), will always make an entertaining stop by, but without a slightly drastic change in vision, there's no reason to expect a return to grandeur.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Samurai films tend to lean toward either overly talkative and boring or hyper-stylized to the point that credibility comes into question. Striking that middle ground, however, can lead to greatness, or rather  great honor. Takashi Miike's "13 Assassins" might not match the great Akira Kurosawa films, but boy does it come close, and it does so with themes and blades of equal sharpness.If swords-and-sandals flick "300" had been less concerned about abs and Gerard Butler screaming war hyperbole, it would have looked and felt like this film. Anyone who hails Zack Snyder's 2006 film as a masterpiece should pull up a seat with this film for two-plus hours and see how it's really done.Both the aforementioned film to which comparison is inescapable and "13 Assassins" tell a story about how the number of men indicated in their titles fought against an army numerous times the size. In this film, the reasons for fighting a battle most certain to result in death are less glossy and brash, as well as guided by some consideration for historical relevance.The story takes place at nearly the end of feudal era Japan, when samurai have become nothing but show thanks to a lengthy time of peace. Yet one lord seems to undermine this peace with acts of cold-blooded violence: the shogun's half brother, Lord Naritsugu (Gorô Inagaki). It is expected, however, that when he returns from Edo, he will have a place on the shogun's council and have political influence to go with with warmongering ways. After a respected samurai commits harakiri in protest, the elder of the shogun council charges a samurai named Shinzaemon (Kôji Yakusho) with putting together a squad of samurai to kill Naritsugu before there's widespread unrest.The beginning of the film shows us Naritsugu's cold and horrifying ways with enough brutal imagery to make anyone want to pick up a sword against this guy. The story then continues with the assembling of the 12 assassins (the 13th comes later) and their strategy for accomplishing the task. Yet on the other side is Hanbei Kitou (Masachika Ichimura), the samurai sworn to obey and protect Naritsugu who must develop counter-strategy to foil Shinzaemon, an old classmate of his from the dojo.The game of strategy boils toward a 45-minute climactic battle in which the 13 assassins use everything from trickery to explosives to straight-up sword hackery against an army of 200 men from Naritsugu's clan. The delivery of these sequences rivals any modern action film, and that includes battle cries, little humorous lines tossed in for fun and especially creativity. One samurai takes out 30-plus guys in a narrow corridor that he prepped ahead of time with several swords carefully stationed throughout.But most impressively, "13 Assassins" never loses sight of what its whole conflict is about. The plot doesn't exist merely as a formula guaranteed to produce an unforgettable culminating battle. Throughout the entire film, characters are questioning the values passed down to them for hundreds of years of honor and duty. Having essentially stood their whole lives as symbols of a fading age, they take on this quest in search of finally fulfilling that purpose of total commitment and servitude, yet this battle will teach them what it truly means.Essentially, this is not the same movie if set in another time or another place, which sets it apart as a truly great action film. As replicable as a story of a small band of skilled warriors taking on the impossible is (it possesses a great number of similarities to what's considered the best of its kind, Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai," for one), writers Kaneo Ikegami and Daisuke Tengan give "13 Assassins" its own thumbprint with the context. Miike then delivers the full impact of all the tones from pure syrupy action to dark, shocking drama. He knows exactly how to take a high-tension scene to a whole other level by creating a full spectrum of what we see versus what is kept from us, especially in terms of violence. As soon as he wants to export those talents to Hollywood, someone better answer. We could use more action films like "13 Assassins." ~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com
Squarely on the shoulders of Al Pacino rests "Scent of a Woman," a film of unlikely friendship and moral education spanning an epic 187 minutes. It is film built on memorable quotes and moments from Oscar-winning "One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest" adapter Bo Goldman as well as one unforgettable performance.Though its length deflates a lot of its punch, there's a great humor driving "Scent of a Woman." Pacino's portrayal is magnetizing and reckless -- the master of on-camera shouting perfecting his craft. You laugh because he makes you uncomfortable, he's blind and his dialogue is, well, frank. He speaks his mind because he's not afraid of the consequences. He enjoys the pleasures of life, particularly women, he drinks without abandon and yet there's an uncanny wisdom in everything he says or does. Sometimes an exceptional character study can make a movie and Pacino's Col. Slade certainly does.The film is about how a young man at a prestigious east-coast boarding school (Chris O'Donnell) ends up taking a random babysitting job to earn some cash during Thanksgiving break as opposed to forking out for the plane ticket back to Oregon. His assignment is of course Uncle Frank, who flips the weekend upside down when he swoops off with him to New York City where Frank has some plans to live it up -- and teach the young Charlie a thing or two.Unlikely friendships are the stuff of many great films and although "Scent of a Woman" really pushes these two clashing personalities together, it's not without the best of intent. Charlie's subplot is that he's leaving a big scandal behind at school during the break in which he has was interrogated by the headmaster as to who pulled a big prank. (The other witness is his friend George, played by a young Phillip Seymour Hoffman.) The headmaster has hung the threat of rescinding Charlie's recommendation to Harvard over Charlie's head and it his decision of whether to snitch becomes the moral dilemma that Frank will eventually assist him with.There are great scenes in "Scent of a Woman" from the ruckus at Thanksgiving dinner when Frank takes Charlie, both uninvited, to his brother's house where the relatives don't think much of him to Frank teaching a young woman to tango or at one point driving a Ferrari despite being blind. Memorable moments they are, but all relevant and all worthy of every second being drawn out? No. Director Martin Brest ("Beverly Hills Cop") could've cut at least a half hour from this film. Each scene concludes after the audience has already figured out what will happen.The things that Frank teaches Charlie (and of course vice-versa) are lessons of great moral significance. There's no denying you could quote this film over and over again whether it's Frank shouting "Hoo-ah!" or his "there are two kinds of people in this world" speech. At the same time, scripted wisdom is not what makes a film great and that's why greatness eludes "Scent of a Woman." What we learn from the film we do not learn through empathy or in an organic or home-grown manner. It doesn't make the pearls any less valuable or interesting, they're just deprived of a blossoming epiphany.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Hayao Miyazaki has captured the imagination of audiences young and old across the globe, and his most recent cinematic work of art is "Ponyo," a children's fairytale borrowing on story elements from The Little Mermaid. Of course like other Miyazaki classics such as "Spirited Away" and his last film, "Howl's Moving Castle," "Ponyo" is full of a creativity that can only be truly appreciated by adults, but this it is distinctly more a children's story than those recent efforts. It's a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable, aiming for charm instead of conflict."Ponyo" is the story of a bug-eyed childish-looking fish of the same name, the daughter of an undersea sorcerer, who longs to escape the sea and become a little girl. When she does, she quickly befriends a young boy named Sosuke. In the process she gains a strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea, and a giant storm drowns most of the cliff-top town where Sosuke lives with his mother, and it threatens to end the world.Like "Howl's Moving Castle," Walt Disney picked up "Ponyo" for an American release and dubbed it over with an impressive selection of Western voices, even choosing homegrown products in the youngest siblings of Disney band the Jonas Brothers (Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (younger sister Noah) to voice Sosuke and Ponyo, respectively. Also voicing characters are Liam Neeson (Fujimoto, Ponyo's father), Tina Fey (Lisa, Sosuke's mother), Matt Damon (Sosuke's father), Cate Blanchett (Ponyo's sea goddess mother) and a trio of hilarious elderly women are played by Betty White, Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. The effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to American audiences and Disney is getting close.But voices are of little significance in a Miyazaki film, which is all about visual creativity. A fan of transformations and animating liquid and fluid motion, creating a fairytale taking place partly underwater must've been a joy for Miyazaki to work with and maybe even his entire motivation for choosing this story. Among the highlights are droplets of water that Fujimoto sends after Ponyo that move like living waves, as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make "Ponyo" as awing as any other Miyazaki film.As a children's story, however, "Ponyo" concentrates its efforts on being adorable. The discovery of true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is heart-warming, even if Noah Cyrus shouting childishly when Ponyo excitedly embraces human life can get a bit annoying. But as delightful as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships are, there's very little antagonism or danger. Past Miyazaki films have clear villains, but the conflict in "Ponyo" actually shrinks as the story goes along. Sosuke believes he's lost his mother at one point and in the background is the idea of the world going out of whack and that humans should be ashamed of polluting the sea, but "Ponyo" is mostly tension free. Most glaringly, its climax is uneventful despite how overall likable all the characters are."Ponyo" will surely satisfy Miyazaki's fans in every way with its imagination, and newcomers will still be smitten by his simple yet visually ambitious storytelling, but this is distinctly more of a children's movie, best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of its form or target audience. It's not quite what you'd expect from Miyazaki considering his recent work, but it's sure to be remembered as another of his beloved stories. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
"Get Smart" is best described as modern re-imagining of the original TV show. By adding modern action sequences and the comedic stylings of Steve Carrell, it's certainly not intended to appease the show's fans as much as do some homage here and there--and justifiably so. It's much more modern-day blockbuster formulaic, depending on gadgets, stuff blowing up, and a wealth of stars to draw in all audiences including Carrell, who has proved himself rather bankable when he's playing an idiot.The story is about a secret government spy organization called CONTROL that fights terrorist threats whose top analyst Max Smart (Carrell) gets promoted to a field agent when CONTROL comes under attack by KAOS, its overseas nemesis organization. Accompanied by the beautiful but quite lethal Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), Max tries to figure out what KAOS is up to.Easily the best part of the film is the humor. Not always dead on in the script (though it is incredibly witty in spots), Carrell adds his brand of physical humor which is certainly important in an action comedy. In general, the film is surprisingly foul-mouthed (in a PG-13 way of course) for something that seemed to sell itself more to families with older children.The other thing the film does well is credit to the casting. Hathaway, at this point clearly a proved leading actress, certainly attracts a younger (and certainly female) audience, while actors like Alan Arkin and an assortment of cameos from the likes of Bill Murray and such will definitely please the older crowd.As an action/spy movie, the gadget lore is certainly not a priority with special effects not exactly at their finest. The look of the film is not a sleek and modern as it could be. The emphasis budget-wise was clearly the comedy and the stars and it pays off for what is a generally enjoyable comedy that is unimpressive but entertaining.
Based on his Oscar-nominated short film of the same name, Sean Ellis' "Cashback" is an elegant and funny independent film mixing elements of drama, comedy, romance and fantasy. Musing on the relationship between the speed of life and love, "Cashback" is an artists rendition of a familiar romance formula."Cashback" begins like every other romantic comedy, with its main character Ben (Sean Biggerstaff, best known as Oliver Wood from the first couple Harry Potter movies) getting dumped by his girlfriend, launching him into insomnia and unrelenting personal reflection in the form of narrative. But Ben is an aspiring portrait artist, so Ellis, like his protagonist, reflects that appreciation for imagery in his direction, giving every scene stylishness and grace.Ellis moves the camera in fascinating ways that capture our attention, making so many shots and sequences have an epic quality. At the same time, it's interesting that the film uses so much narrative, making it seem more literary, almost a memoir even, yet Ellis never leans on this writing -- so many images stand out memorably.The fantasy angle of the film comes in when Ben discovers he can slow down and pause time for as long as he likes, a skill he learns at the local Sainsbury's supermarket where he's taken up night hours to make use of his lack of sleep. A long-time connoisseur of the female form, Ben freezes time to draw women in the supermarket, often times nude, yet he reserves some modesty when drawing his new crush, Sharon (Emilia Fox), one of the store clerks. Ellis perfectly captures these images of Ben's affection and the result is that we see the beauty that Ben sees."Cashback" is very sexually forward, unafraid but not gratuitous or obnoxious in its use of nudity or sexual reference. Its sense of humor comes mostly in the form simple things like quirky characters and clever one-liners or quick shots. Its humor relies on the viewer finding it endearing and lovable.The movie is also a meditation on time and love, giving us something to think about more so than letting us draw our own meaning. What usually happens is that just as we have surmised our own understanding, more narration comes in speaking of new ideas and we're sort of left confused. Other times, the narration adds key thoughts to our heads that add meaning to what comes next.Boiled down, "Cashback" is a really fresh take on the boy gets broken up with, does something as a result, finds new girl and struggles to make sense of love in the meantime. Adding in the simple fantasy element of time control, it manages to look at what we've seen in movies in ways we've never really seen them before, which dresses up the romance clichés quite nicely. ~ Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
In terms of Westerns, they don't get much more gun-slinging than Clint Eastwood, the face of the great Sergio Leone Westerns that inspired generations of filmmakers. How fitting, then, that Eastwood should produce, direct and star in "Unforgiven," a film that honors yet challenges everything those and other classic Westerns stand for. Gritty and, well, unforgiving, the film skeptically examines the creation of the Western tall-tale while providing us one of its own, a masterful homage and commentary all in one.Once you understand just what "Unforgiven" is doing, the gates open and the film becomes a powerful Western. Eastwood stars as William Munny, a former gun-for-hire and now a widowed pig farmer caring for his two children who stopped killing and drinking years ago. When a young thrill-seeker by the name of "The Schofield Kid" (Jaimz Woolvett) tells him of a $1,000 reward for the heads of two cowboys that cut up a whore in Big Whisky, Wyoming, he goes against his better judgment and rounds up his friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) for a last job of sorts.But Big Whisky is no average small town; it's run by a sheriff named Little Bill (Gene Hackman) who lays down the law and lets everyone  especially guests toting guns  know it. Trouble brews when the whores pool their money together to offer the reward, as it draws some crooked folks into the town such as English Bob (Richard Harris) and his book-writing cohort. Little Bill makes short order of English Bob and begins to tell the novelist the "real" take on the Wild West. Hackman's portrayal of this ruthless simpleton who likes to feed the mythos behind the Western tall-tales is a cutthroat and honest one. Little Bill's a contradiction in that he serves as proof that the West isn't glamorous but that's how he tells it.A similar dynamic develops between Will, Ned and The Schofield Kid. The Kid asks Will about the stories he's heard of how he took out two men that had him dead to rights and so on. He talks a mean game including the five men he's killed. Old Will and Ned have clearly seen worse in their day, but they remain silent. With their past kept a mystery in David Webb People's brilliant script, we just see them as two experienced but rusty gunslingers with thick character and a time-tested way of doing things. Despite their plan to kill for money, we like them, which the film tests in its powerful last act.Eastwood's performance isn't tremendous here, at least in the beginning, but the script calls for him to be a bit reserved. Instead, the first act benefits from Hackman's performance, which comes on quickly once English Bob gets in town. Harris is also excellent with some sinister nuance, although we're left wanting more from his character in terms of screen time.The film manages to not only work in terms of story as both classic and gritty Western, but also in terms of the feel. The tone is largely subdued at first to serve as a sign that life in the West isn't as glorious as the stories make it out to be, but the film turns into one of those legends in its own way. Thus, "Unforgiven" film exposes its genre as fantasy while also affirming it for being such. The lesson ends up being "it is what it is" in the sense that life ain't pretty, but there's right, there's wrong and there's people who do something about it. The message gets amplified by Eastwood's late one-liner, "deserve's got nothing to do with it." If nothing else, Eastwood beautifully caps off a long career of Westerns with this perfect ending film for any actor.
"Into the Wild" is one of the best films I have ever seen that is 95% without addressing any kind of human sin or vice. Almost no one wrongs anyone or indulges in anything of moral consequence: this is a film about man vs. self and of course man vs. nature. It is a coming- of-age story and then some; it is an adventure that explores the American countryside as well as the human soul. Sean Penn has rarely written or taken the director's chair in his career and it's clear to see why he took a seat with this project: it's a truly inspiring film."Into the Wild" is based on a Jon Krakauer book that catalogues the true story of Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch), who after graduating Emory decides to rid himself of his family and all of his worldly possessions, call himself Alexander Supertramp, and travel the country with hopes of living out in Alaska. The film takes a narrative and literary structure that redefines the phrase "adapted from a novel." There are actual chapters and the scenes really do feel like chapters the way they are split by very verbose narrative from Chris' sister Carine (Jena Malone). It's a terrific style that Penn has created and rather essential for understanding the film's ideas.McCandless' story is an empowering one: It would seem hard to screw up. The trick, however, is keeping it interesting (especially at almost 2.5 hours long). The way that Penn has it jump from McCandless when he finally is in Alaska to the story of how he gets there helps that along. Penn also uses some really cool techniques and though-provoking shots that carry deeper meaning in addition to being stylistically pleasing. While "Wild" does drag at times, the great ensemble cast helps it change pace. The only regret I have with the film is that despite how long it is, the supporting characters don't get enough time to develop. That and the overall tempo are the only things keeping this from a 10/10 in my eyes.Hirsch does a very good job of capturing the free spirit of McCandless and getting across the values and reasoning for why he did what he did. It's more so Penn's script that slowly kind of reveals this logic, but Hirsch will definitely have a terrific career doing dramas, no question. Supporting actors Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and Hal Holbrook are also very good (Holbrook's last scene is one of the more touching moments in the film) though it would have been nicer to have seen more of them. Though that's sort of the point of the film in a way. McCandless abandons everything for the sake of living free and dissolving himself of the fabrications of society (particularly money). He is completely driven in this regard that it makes him ignorant of the way he touched the lives of those he met and most importantly, how they truly meant something to him.This is a film that will make you take a long hard look at the way you live and will likely unearth a deeper appreciation of life's simplest gifts that get lost in the hustle and bustle of society and its fascination with material possession. The only person who wouldn't get that from this film is one who has a profound hate for Emerson and Thoreau. This is just a great movie and best of all, it is one that is incredibly positive: now that's a Hollywood rarity.
When it comes to winning awards, boxing films seem to always be contenders; as such, the thought of watching "another boxing film" can be off-putting. But "The Fighter" hangs in and fends off those labels, earning every bit of its critical praise. That's because most of the fighting in this film takes place out of the ring; "Irish" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) spars with the troublesome brother who trains him and his mother who manages him and these superb supporting characters have their own challengers to overcome.David O. Russell brings a needed dose of realism to the boxing genre, downplaying the underdog nature of Micky's true story and focusing on the relationships that push him through and hold him back all throughout his journey toward the welterweight title. Much of the time, in fact, the story feels equally Micky's and his brother's. Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale), as beat over our heads early in the film, went ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard and knocked him down, becoming the pride of small working-class town Lowell, Mass.  which as one might imagine, wasn't hard.But Dickie, an off-kilter, fun-loving yet irresponsible guy (a transformative performance from Bale to say the least), spends the time he's not training Micky in crack houses. In fact, he's completely oblivious to the fact that HBO is following him around for their documentary on crack abuse, not one about his "comeback." It's clear that his behavior is keeping Micky, whose had a string of bad losses of late, down. After an embarrassing fight in which Micky was mismatched, Micky suddenly finds himself wondering whether he should keep his boxing career and family separate.The idea of it irritates Micky's mother Alice, played by Melissa Leo, who impressively embodies every controlling mother. Alice sits in her house most days and smokes cigarettes while her seven grown daughters pathetically vie for her attention. Leo keeps Alice from being an aggravating total monster, providing a more complete picture of a mother whose blurred the line between business and family.Amy Adams also excels in her supporting role, a bartender and college dropout, but one who  like the audience  sees how Micky's family has kept him back and as his girlfriend pushes him toward the right path. Interestingly, as she grows more invested in Micky's career, the script divides her from the audience, which gives her performance more weight.Russell's characters have a harsh reality to them, much like the Boston-based characters in Ben Affleck's films "Gone Baby Gone" and "The Town." In addition to looks, clothes and mannerisms, Russell chooses a more hand-held documentary feel for the film like Darren Aronofsky's "The Wrestler" and even opts to film parts of the boxing sequences with lenses like the ones used in the late '90s to give the feel of watching a live broadcast.The fights, though effective, remain secondary to the other "fighting." Watching Dickie spiral downward and come back up again, Alice have trouble letting go and Micky struggle to speak up for himself and recognize what he truly needs serves as the more compelling conflict. All together, they give "The Fighter" the best ensemble cast of 2010. And like all great boxing films, all these tensions blow in and out make their way symbolically into the boxing ring for that final fight. As Dickie urges on his brother in the waning rounds of the championship fight, he captures it perfectly when he says "everything that's happened, take that out there with you."The emotional moments of "The Fighter" do lack a real knockout and many intimate moments are tempered with humor in awkward but not scene-ruining ways, but rather than be a heavyweight drama that rides the underdog story for two hours, "The Fighter" opts to be something a bit more natural by fixing on the right things: the people and the personal relationships that hurt or harm us, are all essential to our success.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Love stories are essentially the same -- it's a matter of how you dress  them up. Many will see through "Love and Other Drugs" and count the  romance clichés and formulaic characters, others will find the 1996  setting and the pharmaceutical angle refreshing. Both forces are hard  at work in this film, but the tipping point goes in favor thanks to the  leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway.  There's a reason most romantic films are judged based on the chemistry  of their lead actors. When it comes to romance, it's not about how  cleverly written the two characters are and how unique and special they  feel to us. What counts is whether they can convince you of their  attraction/love and get you to -- without blunt coercion -- invest in  what happens to them. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have what it takes to do  just that in spite of a script that sometimes tries to lean too hard on  conventional tactics of boys meets girl.  Gyllenhaal plays Jamie, an expert salesman who lands a gig as a  pharmaceutical sales rep for Pfizer, right before Viagra hit the  market. He's also adept at landing any woman he desires. He epitomizes  a Don Juan and he's plays the type well, but when you can predict that  he'll end up in bed with the next attractive woman that shows up on  screen, the writing has taken it a bit far.   As good of a filmmaker as Edward Zwick is, his best credits include  "Glory," "The Last Samurai" and "The Blood Diamond" -- not exactly  romance. He co-wrote the script (based on Jamie Reidy's memoir) with  longtime collaborator Marshall Herskovitz and thriller writer Charles  Randolph ("The Interpreter"), so no real romantic comedy prowess exists  among them, hence the tendency to stick with genre conventions. One  such convention is Jamie's brother (Josh Gad), who plays the little  brother crashing on Jamie's couch who has a porn addiction and makes  clueless statements, usually to the tune of no laughs, but he does help  break the tension.  Enter girl. Jamie meets Maggie, a bit of a free-spirited cynic who (in  a unique twist) has way early onset Parkinson's. Many will be quick to  jump on the "diseased girl" archetype, but don't judge Hathaway's  prowess that quickly. As completely pathetic as Maggie's self-esteem  might be and how strictly anti-commitment she is, when her character  caves in to the romance as they all do, Hathaway gives Maggie a  believable fragility rather than a melodramatic tone.   Jamie's motives for wanting to spend more time with Maggie and not  simply continuing his streak of banging all who possess lady parts are  reduced to the reason of "she's playing hard to get," which is not the  best of reasons. The same can be said about Maggie constantly accusing  Jamie of having pity sex with the diseased girl. However, watching  these two charm each other and overcome the cliché has a definite  appeal.  The two spend a lot of naked time together, making "Love and Other  Drugs" the best date movie this holiday season. But on a serious note,  the drug angle and the "recent past" setting give us something else to  chew on, which is nice. Zwick never truly marries that story line with  the romance except "Jamie sells drugs and Maggie has a disease that  lacks an effective one." The thematic ties are not quite there despite  the plot coincidences and the fitting title.  "Love and Other Drugs" is hardly the cure for the common romantic  comedy, but the consistent dosage of its two stars by and large pushes  away those symptoms.  ~Steven C
Danny Glover and Mel Gibson as cops Murtaugh and Riggs had enough chemistry in 1987's "Lethal Weapon" to generate more than four times the film's estimated budget that it easily green-lit a sequel. "Lethal Weapon 2" gives us further development of that relationship, but what you didn't necessarily expect was that the story and the action in the sequel would improve too. Well, Richard Donner and Joel Silver bring the heat once again in this sequel. It's just as witty and clever as the original and even more stuff explodes. The action even takes a turn from cool to serious as the bad guys (members of the South African consulate who use their diplomatic immunity to cover up their crimes) seem to be everywhere and taking everyone's life. You really don't like them at all. The film also deepens the humanity of Murtaugh and Riggs (specifically Riggs in this one) at the same time, which is pretty admirable for an action script back in the 1980s.The gunfire does get excessive at times and much like the original there's some crazy new scene unfolding around every corner with little lead in, but by some point in this film you just accept that as part of the Lethal Weapon universe--the bad guys are everywhere and there's always something going on. It really allows the film to pack in as much action as possible.Donner in the director's chair also deserves more accolades this time around. He simply gets how to weave action and drama by focusing on the characters a lot while also capturing the scope of the action sequences.Glover and Gibson really are a great tandem. They are both untypical for action heroes because they have such a wide range of emotions. They both joke around, take their jobs seriously at times, can be filled with hate or revenge and they truly know what's most important to them. Too many cops in films are one or two-dimensional but Shane Black's characters are not.Perhaps the only thing wrong with the film, other than it's odd racial undertones in tackling Apartheid South Africa, is that it forced writer Shane Black to walk away based on where Silver and Donner wanted to take their blooming franchise. Hard to argue with a gross more than double that of the original though.
In the "Purple Rose of Cairo," Woody Allen finally stays behind the camera for the first time since 1978's "Interiors," stepping away from constantly playing these neurotic show- biz/writer characters to brings us more of a romantic comedy that celebrates film as a form of escapism rather than a form of art. It's a delightful breath of fresh air for those that love his films but are tired of seeing Woody do his same old shtick.Allen's muse of the 1980s, Mia Farrow, stars as Cecilia, a Depression-era New Jersey waitress with an abusive husband who spends nearly every day at the movies, seeing the same pictures over and over again. The latest movie, "The Purple Rose of Cairo" stars the charming Gil Shepherd as the naive and optimistic Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels). Cecilia is charmed by his performance and returns again and again, until suddenly the character Tom Baxter walks out of the screen and into her life, creating a crisis at the theater and flipping Cecilia's world upside-down.This odd fantasy element is intriguing in concept, but it's rather jarring in the film to start with. Allen must quickly establish that it's only the character Tom, not the actor Gil, coming out of the screen, that it's just this one theater in New Jersey and all these other details to get us to subscribe to his imaginative idea. After awhile, however, it all makes sense and it works brilliantly to create a conflict of fiction versus reality.Farrow is great as this stammering, broken and hopeless romantic who struggles with her convictions and her drive to go where her heart leads her. She ends up in a conundrum as what was only an escapist fantasy becomes a tangible part of her life. She can either choose to live out her fantasies despite them not being real or live a real life.Allen challenges us to understand the lines between fiction and reality, to grasp why it is we go to the movies, what it is we seek there. "The Purple Rose of Cairo" does this in a silly, satirical way, but occasionally a line will be spoken that is quite poignant (as Allen does well more overtly in his other films)."Purple Rose of Cairo" is a really nice change of pace for Allen, the type of film that will still challenge his audience but also give them the escapist romantic fantasy that we so yearn for when we go to the theater.
A classic British farce, Frank Oz and Dean Craig's "Death at a Funeral" will produce some of the deepest laughs you've had for awhile and prove that even death can provide hilarious comic situations.Dark humor is one way to put it, but "Death" isn't dark as much as it takes what should be a dark and dramatic subject and turns it into something hilarious. The tone is set when the hearse delivers the wrong body and we know we're in for hijinx when the departed's niece (Daisy Donovan) accidentally gives her fiancé-to-be (Alan Tudyk) a highly potent form of acid from her brother's (Kris Marshall) flat not even an hour before the service. Things get serious (or seriously funny) when a strange man (Peter Dinklage) who no one has ever met arrives with a secret about the deceased."Death at a Funeral" has a full cast of wonderful unknowns, perfect for the small family who gets way in over its head. Only Tudyk, who had a role in American comedy "Dodgeball" and has done a lot of voice work, is recognizable and his performance, in which 90 percent of the film requires him to act like he's tripping, is responsible for much of the laughs early on.When a great concept for a farce clicks like it does here for Dean Craig, everything seems to work perfectly and this is one of those ideas. Its only challenge is being set during a funeral, an event that brings out the emotional, reflective side of people. So when Craig asks us to care about the serious aspects of the plot, it's hard for us to turn the laugh switch off and even if we do get that far, it's hard to really care. Still, anyone who loves outrageous comedy will find "Death" a killer farce.
Aging is hard, as it accepting your lot in life. "Nebraska" adds another poignant story about life's tragic beauty to Alexander Payne's filmography and it's likely the most universally accessible of all his previous efforts.Whereas his last film, the 2011 Best Screenplay winner "The Descendants," drew some criticism for being overly depressing, "Nebraska" has sadder moments but is much lighter in subject matter. Don't let Payne's choice to film in black and white fool you: this is a contemporary film that will connect with adults of all ages.Bruce Dern and Will Forte star as father and son, Woody and David Grant, who set out from their hometown of Billings, Mont. after Woody receives a marketing sweepstakes letter telling him he's won $1 million, though he has to go to Lincoln, Neb. to cash it. The prize is obviously a scam, but when Woody keeps sneaking out of the house in attempt to walk all the way to Lincoln, David thinks maybe a little road trip would be good for both of them. On the way, however, they're forced to detour through the Nebraska town where Woody grew up.Small-town jokes, sarcasm and senility humor abound, but both Payne and this spot-on script from Bob Nelson (HBO's "Hung") always keep the futility of this quest in perspective, and the time-tested theme of "it's about the journey, not the destination" informs the plot's many twists and turns, as does the basic human desire of having something to live for.When all of Woody's hometown friends and relatives hear that he's won a million dollars, they take immediate interest in his return to town. His similarly quiet and stubborn brothers, former business partner (Stacy Keach)and former girlfriend all come into the picture, and then there's the relationship between Woody and David, which goes through its own rigmarole. Woody has been an alcoholic in denial for most of his life, who never developed a relationship with his kids (David's brother is played by "Breaking Bad" star Bob Odenkirk)and from what we can tell, spent most of his life indifferent if not regretting his marriage to Kate (June Squibb), who lambastes him at every possible moment for being useless, crazy and stubborn, like an all-too-familiar grandmother figure.Dern's portrayal of Woody is scary authentic. Most great performances have some kind of emotional, dramatic heft to them. Dern stays true to the inexpressive nature of his character, yet watching him you can see the seasons and the life experiences and the underlying emotion, the hardship and the regret, even though we only learn of it through dialogue or stories from other characters who knew Woody way back when. He does so much with silence and short, curt responses and that has a dramatic power of its own.Squibb as his wife Kate is absolutely hysterical as whip-smart elderly woman with a great memory and no filter along with the most brutally honest opinions you can imagine. Nelson writes her some outstanding dialogue, but she sells it. Payne, of course, is known for getting outstanding stuff from his cast. How many others could cast Saturday Night Live alumnus Will Forte ("MacGruber") and still have their film considered among the year's best? Music and scenery play a huge role in this film as with Payne's previous work. The black and white seems like a curious decision, and though it's hard to argue that it was 100 percent necessary, it certainly adds to the nostalgic moments of the film such as when Woody, David and family explore parts of Woody's past. Mark Orton's score also adds so much to the poignancy of a film that has nothing but images of flat, rural Nebraska to try and elicit an emotional response from its audience.At times loud and hysterical and at others quiet and sad, but so is "Nebraska" captures so much of this duality that's so true of life itself. The longing of a child to connect with and understand a parent, and the longing of a man in the twilight of his life to find fulfillment are universal sentiments true of the young and the old. "Nebraska" certainly isn't the flashiest or most exciting of dramatic comedies, but Payne hits all the right emotional notes with his film's simplicity.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

I liked "Waiting ..." Want to know who hates it? Real-life owners of the typical Americana family sit-down restaurants that the film mocks with "Shenanigans," the restaurant where the film takes place. Why? Because after you see this movie, you might never want to eat at one of these places again. Not that what happens at Shenanigans happens in real restaurants per say, but if it did, I certainly wouldn't blame them."Waiting ..." works as a comedy because despite excessive gross-out humor, it does pretty well at containing itself and minimizing the many ways it could have become completely stupid. For instance, even if it was for budget reasons, keeping the film entirely set in the restaurant minus a few scenes prevents the story from getting far-fetched and keeps the attention on the comedic talents of its actors rather than the creativity of its script. That's what creator Rob McKittrick gets right, by far.Calling on the talents of Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris, David Koechner, Dane Cook and Luis Guzman most notably, "Waiting ..." delivers a quirky array of performances that will get you to laugh whether you feel good about it or not. For example, you probably won't find the fact that head waiter Monty (Reynolds) is into under-aged girls that funny, but Reynolds won't quit until he's sold you on a couple laughs. Then there's the male genital flashing game all the guys in the kitchen play. Disgusting and immature, right? But it's the camaraderie and the fun these actors have that makes it work. We also know what these restaurants are like. You don't see the classiest of people in there and frankly it must be boring and excruciating at times. It's the antics that keep everyone's sanity. Although many characters are assigned stereotypes or quirks that aren't all that original, there's still a large element of that natural interaction that keeps "Waiting ..." from spiraling into all out stupid.The story is not so much an overarching plot as it is assigning each character a story. The film takes place over the course of 24 hours -- a full day at Shenanigans. Everyone who works there has some conflict. Dean (Justin Long) is the college grad re-evaluating life and stuck between deciding on whether his future will involve Shenanigans. His "girlfriend" (Kaitlin Doubleday) deals with some nasty patrons, Calvin (Rob Benedict) has to overcome his inability to pee in a public bathroom, etc. Not deep stuff, but it keeps the film moving and provides an opportunity for laughs, which is all "Waiting ..." cares to serve up when all is said and done.In a decade of gross-out comedies, "Waiting ..." holds its own because it doesn't get out of hand. There's some stupid stuff in this movie and pointless characters, but McKittrick keeps everything simplistic, opting to give us an interesting environment for his, well, shenanigans.~Steven CVisit my site at moviemusereviews.com
Did Peter Jackson really just conclude his second Middle Earth trilogy? His take on J.R.R. Tolkein's "The Lord of the Rings" was a completely exhausting adventure that in many ways feels like seven films, not three, while "The Hobbit" trilogy feels exactly like it is on paper: one straightforward adventure broken into three parts. "The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies" proves a fitting, exciting conclusion to this particular trilogy, but compared to the conclusion of "The Lord of the Rings," quite frankly and pun intended  it gets dwarfed.As with "The Unexpected Journey" and "The Desolation of Smaug," "The Battle of the Five Armies" is another beautiful achievement in fantasy filmmaking, with stunning production value and an outstanding director in Jackson. It is creative, humorous, action-packed, brimming with talent and gravitas and so many of the things that made "The Lord of the Rings" the achievement it was. So why was this trilogy less acclaimed and somewhat anti-climactic? Part of this undoubtedly has to do with novelty. We've been to Middle Earth before, we've seen the makeup and the elaborate sets, we know how Jackson navigates a battle sequence. Although "The Hobbit" has new locales and new characters and was the first film series screened with a higher frame rate, it's not as groundbreaking an achievement. Also, that accomplishment set the bar high for "The Hobbit" given how many people have returned from "Lord of the Rings" on camera and off.Yet the real culprit is story. "The Hobbit" is a children's book, so splitting it into three parts is merely dragging out a streamlined plot of "company seeks treasure and justice, company faces challenges along the way culminating in a mighty dragon, company overcomes odds." The added subplots put more meat on the bones of the three films, especially "Desolation," but did not necessarily add complexity or maturity to it."Five Armies" at least does not waste any time. The first act is entirely buildup to the titular battle with plenty of suspense as sides try to negotiate in order to prevent an unnecessary war when a much greater evil is growing in Middle Earth. After Smaug torches Lake-town, Thranduil (Lee Pace) and the Wood-elves march upon Erebor, where Thorin (Richard Armitage) has reclaimed his rightful throne. Thorin, however, is corrupted by his greed, and rather than help the displaced people of Lake-town, grows restless because his treasure's focal point, the Arkenstone, has yet to be found. Bilbo (Martin Freeman), who has been hiding the Arkenstone, sees Thorin's madness could cause a senseless war, which of course it does, only the battle takes a different shape when Azog the Defiler and his orc army arrives.So corruption and selfishness become dominant themes of the film until the final battle, which doesn't disappoint in scale, entertainment, or visual effects. What it doesn't do, however, is command a vested interest from the audience. And when the larger battle halts entirely in order to follow the main characters, it hurts the larger overall narrative, or rather, calls attention to the fact that there really isn't one at this point in the story other than "kill the orcs." Yes, the fate of Middle Earth is at stake, but we already know how things will ultimately play out.Someone who has never seen the films watching all six in order could be something special, though. "Five Armies" does make "The Hobbit" trilogy a rather strong bridge to "Lord of the Rings," even in its last shot. In a way, Jackson acknowledges that that tale is the bigger story, the one that matters most. The parting message is kind of like "we hope you enjoyed these three fun movies, but 'The Lord of the Rings,' that's where it's really at." As moviegoers who witnessed "Lord of the Rings," this doesn't quite work for us, because we wanted to go back to Middle Earth for something more, to build on the experience of "Lord of the Rings." "The Hobbit," however, like any good prequel, is the foundation, not the next step, and because the story is so simplistic, it doesn't quite do enough for us on its own."The Hobbit" is a fun, small adventure filled with courage, danger, evil and love set in the world of "Lord of the Rings," and "Five Armies" is that big scene at the end of the story where everything comes to boil. That's the gist of it. The rest is Jackson and his extraordinary cast and crew bringing that elaborate world back to life for us to enjoy one more time.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

As much as "The Goonies" is distinctly an 80s film, there's no denying that sense of timelessness about it as a kids adventure film. It's got buried treasure, creepy yet conveniently klutzy bad guys, and that archetypal rag-tag group of kids who all go by nicknames. That's pretty much the foundation for live action kids movies for at least the next decade. Unfortunately, that kind of kids' entertainment has fallen by the wayside to make way for CGI in this century, but that shouldn't cheat "The Goonies" of its sense of magic, mystery and the courage of children who refuse to let rationality plague their thinking while they're still young."The Goonies" follows a group of kids on the Oregon coast, all with their own amusing quirks, as they search for a treasure that would give them enough money to save their homes from being bought out by the wealthy folks in town. There's Mikey (Sean Astin), the fearless leader, Mouth (Corey Feldman), the smart-ass, Data (Jonathan Ke Quan) the crazy gadget nerd and Chunk (Jeff Cohen) the rotund, hunger-driven, paranoid, klutz. When the boys escape, they're followed by Mikey's older brother Brand (Josh Brolin) and his love interest, Andy--the teenage friendly subplot. Of course the treasure is buried beneath the house of some insanely creepy murderers named the Fratellis who are completely stupid yet no less creepy. Joe Pantoliano plays one of them. They're your standard villains and perfect for the fantasy element of the movie. Obviously this film tries to play off producer/writer Steven Spielberg's success with Indiana Jones by setting up underground cave booby traps as the kids go after the treasure. This is a very funny movie in both the cute family way and clever way too. The humor that comes from these kids is fun for children viewers because it's visual and funny for adults because of what comes out of their mouths. While this is mostly a boys-oriented film, it's definitely intended for families, although I was surprised by the swearing of some of the kids in the film.Considering Spielberg, Richard Donner (one of the 80s most famous directors) and future Harry Potter director Chris Columbus all played a part in the creation of this film, it should be no surprise this film has the imagination and the talent behind it to work on all these levels for all these different audiences. While I do think the movie kind of fizzles in the last half hour with all the focus on the treasure and escaping, the rest is so strong that you can get through it easily. This is simply a kids/family classic.
We know that Denzel Washington can helm a thriller and we know that Tony Scott is more than capable of guiding him in such a project, so reasonably, expectations for "Deja Vu" are high. Knowing that the film puts a time travel twist on the traditional federal investigation thriller and was the first film to be made in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina makes the interest level soar."Deja Vu" ends up being one of those movies that meets your expectations. It takes the conventional aforementioned thriller full of CSI and mystery nuggets and combines it with a typical Hollywood sci-fi depiction of time travel. You've seen both before, just never like this, and the result ends up being --like you've seen it before. Deja vu anyone?Washington plays ATF agent Doug Carlin who begins investigating the explosion of a boat in a New Orleans harbor believed to be an act of terrorism. When the FBI gets involved, Carlin gets pulled onto the crack team to figure out who did it. They introduce him to an incredible technology that via satellite allows for an invisible camera to travel four days back in time. Carlin, however, is not only interested in apprehending the killer, but is smitten by a young woman (the Halle Berry-esquire Paula Patton) that while dead in present time is central to the case, and he goes about trying to reverse her fate.Scott's style with the film sort of cleverly imitates that of the "invisible camera" that goes back in time. He gets all these sweeping shots of the bay where the ferry exploded and aims to get as many perspectives as possible. If you want a director that will deliver surefire quality in this genre, there are few guarantees other than Scott. It may not be a touching or deep film, but it will satisfy viewers.Washington does his job here too, taking over the film with his presence and giving it the sense of urgency and importance it requires. This is why he can play basically the same part over and over again from movie to movie and no one will say anything about it: he doesn't create a character, he just invests himself into the part. He just sort of makes every role his and it's so convincing that you don't care that you've seen it before.The only thing not "standard" about "Deja Vu" is that Jim Caviezel was cast as the terrorist, a part usually reserved for an unknown actor in these types of films so that the antagonist is easier to hate. I can't say it makes a difference, because it's immaterial, but what really misses the mark is the film's attempt to insert some post-Katrina-sensitive patriotic themes. The way Scott captures the city with such great awe is testament enough to how it endured, there doesn't need to be anything in the script about it outside of mere setting context.There's plenty of great action shots and mystery unraveling to keep "Deja Vu" interesting and the actors hold their own to create a solid film that although not capable of astonishing most viewers, will earn a lot of fans.
Some films challenge you down to the bones. The question comes to whether or not getting your insides churned to butter serves not merely as shock value, but comes with an apparent and insightful significance. "Hard Candy" might be more along the lines of 80 percent shock, existing to jar you in every way possible, but it's darn effective.The film opens with an instant messaging conversation between 14-year-old Hayley (Ellen Page) and 32-year-old Jeff (Patrick Wilson). They are clearly having an inappropriate conversation and agree to meet each other in person. Their "date" constitutes something bothersome but not entirely atrocious  yet. Jeff understands his boundaries, but it doesn't stop him from making certain comments or being vocal about when Hayley "teases" him. He's not a likable guy, but he clearly seems to have a grip on his "issues." Nevertheless, he brings her back to his house so she can borrow some music she wants. They make some cocktails and then suddenly Jeff falls unconscious. He wakes up to find himself tied to a chair."Hard Candy" is no revenge fantasy. You don't enjoy as Hayley turns the tables on Jeff. It's painful and at some obvious points, quite gruesome. Yet in Page's performance, you feel a twisted rage and a cold determination uncommon in a girl her age, but not entirely unbelievable.Her malicious ways, however, are not even the most challenging aspect of the film, but rather it's the way that Brian Nelson's story  amplified by the direction of David Slade and Patrick Wilson's vulnerable performance  makes us sympathize with a man who might well be guilty of the things his captor accuses him. A lack of proof as to whether Jeff is a bona fide pedophile curiously sways our view of who's right and who's wrong. In that sense, "Hard Candy" reveals more about its audience than either of its main characters.Much of the film is an agonizing experience for the viewer between actual torture and this holding of a mirror to the way we perceive sexual deviance. In Wilson's performance we see someone struggling psychologically and emotionally, but that does not make him a morally laudable character. In Page's performance we see a deeply troubled girl with iron-clad conviction, but that doesn't make her the hero of the story. The ambiguity here lends to the film's strengths while also compound the difficulty of the viewer to find a comfort zone for any length of time during the film.Slade appropriately paces this film as a thriller, lingering on tougher moments and effectively moving the camera exactly where it needs to go to magnify the effects the script intends. There are a lot of strange transition shots where the camera leaves the scene in one direction and comes back to it like a super-fast fade out and in. But like any good psychological thriller, his effects mimic those same processes that the brain does or might undergo being in the scenario of the film or being a viewer of it as we are.The culmination of an hour of difficult movie-watching isn't exactly perfect. The ending isn't entirely satisfying as mentally we must recalibrate our moral compasses yet again, but such should be the nature of a film so jarring: we should not leave with our views on this moral conundrum affirmed nor completely refuted. Essentially, "Hard Candy" achieves this brilliantly, leaving a haunting effect on the viewer that in and of itself warrants praise.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The fact that "West Side Story" is based on Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" is one of those knowledge tidbits that people seem to pride themselves on, but the truth is that the classic tragedy of star-crossed lovers is most of what makes "West Side Story" strike a note with audiences. Add to that story an impeccable score written by musical theatre legends Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein, some vivid choreography by the legendary Jerome Robbins and you have something that can capture the hearts of almost anyone.In 1950s New York City, the streets are owned by the gangs: the Jets, good old American bad boys, and the Sharks, Puerto Rican immigrants. Though generally both sides are all talk, no actual action, that all begins to change when an "ex" Jet (because when you're a Jet you're a Jet all the way) named Tony falls for Maria, little sister of the Sharks' leader Bernardo. Their secret affair grows amid a forthcoming rumble that promises to change all their lives."West Side Story" nearly swept the Academy Awards, taking home statues for 10 of its 11 nominations. From a modern perspective, it's hard to see why at first, but when you get down to it, it's very clear. Robbins, who also directs, (alongside Robert Wise), creates a Manhattan that could only exist in a fairytale. Not that it's magical or enchanted, but it intentionally lacks any historical/locational context outside of the costumes and hairstyles. The streets of the city are empty except for the gangs--nothing seems to happen outside of their little world. What this does is set us up to watch that world come crashing down as the tragedy ensues.Robbins creates that world with a long opening sequence of gang members dancing and fighting with elegant grace. It comes off as odd, but it really sets the desired tone for the film. Everything is a song and dance. Robbins' choreography is sharp and popping, adding to the excitement of the film. The music is phenomenal, providing a wide range of styles that create a wide range of emotions. From the aggressive, vibrant "Dance at the Gym" and "America" to the youthfully optimistic "Maria" and "Somewhere," there's various moods all throughout this film. The costume and background colors (reds and purples for the Sharks and blues, golds and oranges for the Jets) reflect this at points too.The acting is certainly not the film's best aspect, but it shouldn't go unmentioned. Oscar- winner Rita Moreno plays up the fantastic part that is Anita, Bernardo's girlfriend; Natalie Wood outshines her co-star as Maria. In general, the characters of the film are rather one- dimensional, so actors like Richard Beymer (Tony) can get away with having only a love- struck look on his face the entire film. At the same time, the one-dimensionality is part of creating the fairytale illusion. You know that by film's end these characters are going to be more complex.What it comes down to, however, is that the story will get you every time. It's the reason "Romeo and Juliet" has resonated through centuries: seeing the tragedy unfold when you know these kids were just monkeying around is very sobering, especially after the whimsical, musical journey that is the major portion of the film. It's an inescapable emotional trap: even though you see how ridiculous Tony and Maria's love is, you care about the story unfolding and the hate and prejudice bothers you. It's as if out of nowhere, this fun, cute little musical evolves into something that resonates tremendously as a period piece and warning about intolerance in general. It's the stuff classics are made of.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
If there's a quick and easy way to make a movie out of Stieg Larsson's "The Girl Who Played with Fire," the second of the "Millennium Trilogy" books, screenwriter Jonas Frykberg and director Daniel Alfredson have found it. Rather than wrap their minds around Larsson's tome, they trim the fat and deliver the bare bones. Fortunately for us, Noomi Rapace still stands front and center.Rapace's Lisbeth Salander becomes the main suspect in a murder investigation several months after the events of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo." The murder of a journalist and his wife working on an expose of sex trafficking for Millennium takes Sweden by storm, but you'd never know it in this adaptation. The scope of the investigation is significantly diminished. The way the papers and various investigators on the case fetishize and distort Salander's image as a psychotic possible prostitute gets lost, which would not be a problem if it didn't damage the Larsson's superb themes and the ultimate portrait of Salander that's so vital to his novels.There's no denying the advantages to trucking along in a story with an insane amount of components and frankly, reworking these 700 or so pages into a two-hour framework is something I wouldn't wish on any screenwriter. To Frykberg's credit, he figures out exactly the minimum of what needs to go in to make the story work logistically. As for Alfredson, he hopes that attention to detail (making sure Salander uses a PowerBook and that the blond giant drives a Volvo) will appease the fans who feel maimed by the large structural gaps of the script.The lone pole that keeps this tent pitched is still Rapace. In retrospect, it's hard to believe she has so few lines in the film because her inner monologue runs constantly. She perfectly captures the introverted qualities of the character, even if she seems a bit soft at times when her inner badass could be a bit more ferocious.Unfortunately, co-star Michael Nykqvist as journalist Mikael Blomqvist ends up one of the casualties of the script's skeletal nature. He gets a few strong scenes, such as his interrogation of Gunnar Bjorck, a key source relating to the murders, but the essence of his characters has been reduced to crusader for Salander's innocence, leaving him largely one- dimensional. The film never revisits or reminds us about the deep yet ailing relationship between him and Salander forged in "Dragon Tattoo" that plays a subconscious role in the outcome of this story. Fans of the book will find this effort faithful but hollow, a by-the-numbers adaptation that works as a mystery and acts as good enough imagination-to-reality wish fulfillment, which is always the primary reason why we feel inclined to watch movies based on books we've read. Although the creative hands adapting the series have seemed to change for the worse, at least Rapace remains and as strong as ever.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Forget former child stars and D-list celebrities, The Muppets needed a comeback more than any of them. Heck, we needed them. We live in glum times, people. Optimism seems about as trendy as boy bands these days. Maybe that's why Jim Henson's beloved creatures disappeared in the first place: The world disregarded the sense of unabashed silliness that they embodied for 30-some years in exchange for ideals such as progressiveness and "edutainment."The wayward trajectory of the Muppets in the 21st Century definitely fueled the fire for Disney's "reboot." Art imitates life here as "The Muppets" focuses on bringing the gang back together and ultimately defying those who believe there's no longer a place for the kind of entertainment and energy they bring.It only takes moments, however, to realize their place in all-ages entertainment stands eternal. Nostalgia covers this film like a warm  felt  blanket. The Muppets have returned and hopefully for good.Co-writer and star Jason Segel must've realized in no time that the idea of the Muppets drifting apart spoke quite directly to the themes that the various shows and movies of the last 40 years have championed. To represent the lifelong fan spurned by Jim Henson Company's inability to make the Muppets relevant in today's age, Segel and Nicholas Stoller create Walter, the first truly humanoid Muppet, though his fuzzy nature is seen as something that simply makes him "different than all the other kids." When he first sees the Muppets as a child, he becomes their biggest fan.Walter travels with his older (human) brother, Gary (Segel) and Gary's girlfriend of 10 years, Mary (Amy Adams), to Los Angeles to visit the old Muppet theater. After sneaking into Kermit's old office, Walter learns of an evil plan by oil tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who plans to knock the theater down to drill for oil. He convinces Gary and Mary to help him warn the Muppets so that they can band together and put on a show to raise the money needed to save the theater."The Muppets" features countless easter eggs for those who enjoyed the Muppets as children and now have children, while remaining simple and innocent enough in delivery to be loved by said children. It's also extremely faithful to the silly and musical nature of the brand, but with the self-awareness necessary to be a hit with folks of all ages of "the Modern era." One of the funniest bits is when the Muppets learn Miss Piggy currently resides in Paris and determine the fastest way to travel there is "by map." This, of course, refers to the movie convention of showing lines moving across a map to demonstrate a major change in a story's location. Where once was a flaw in logic/realism becomes a hilarious joke. Wocka-wocka.A similar attitude is taken toward the musical numbers. "Life's A Happy Song," the first major number, exudes "Muppets" catchiness despite all its corniness, while the simplistic emotionally soul-bearing ballads the brand has been most known for (such as "Rainbow Connection," which gets its own spotlight) show up too. There's the hilarious yet deeply felt "Man or Muppet," in which we see both a Muppet version of Segel and a human version of Walter (a cameo of course  you'll be amused). Like any musical, the songs work best when they naturally fit in with the story. Also, Oscar nominee Chris Cooper raps. I'll leave it at that.The many cameos are befitting a "Muppet" movie, but the humans never dominate; that would not be true to the mission of the entire film. As perfect as Segel and Adams are for their roles, this movie stars Walter, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Animal (hysterical) among the many others. One almost wishes there could have been more screen time given to some of the memorable Muppets not named Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo or Fozzie. Personally, some more Bunson and Beaker would've been nice. Hopefully this is sequel fodder.At the same time, part of what makes this movie excellent is the way it uses nostalgia and rallies around the idea that the Muppets should never be forgotten. The story works perfectly in context, but as such it's not one that can be replicated in future films. It will take some more outside-the-box thinking to keep the Muppets on this roll, but no doubt "The Muppets" will spur on some kind of long-term plan for these beloved characters whether in more films or back to television again.~Steven CVisit my site, moviemusereviews.com!
The story of God telling Noah to build an ark, all the animals coming aboard in twos, and then there being a great flood, has largely been deemed children's stuff. Given the last on-screen version of this story was the Steve Carell family film "Evan Almighty," this stigma of biblical films has held true. That brings us to "Requiem for a Dream" and "Black Swan" filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's version."Noah" has long been a passion project for Aronofsky, who clearly saw something profoundly cinematic in this story and wanted desperately to challenge the cookie-cutter version told in Sunday schools all over the world. Indeed, Aronofsky has crafted a mature telling, one that creates a rich mythology around the biblical verses and stages a mighty battle for the redemption of humanity, with the essence of man's true nature at stake.The story imagines Noah (Russell Crowe) and the flood as the critical final chapter of a narrative arc that started with creation and included the expulsion from Eden, with humanity descending from two men: Cain, the one who killed his brother, and Seth. Noah and his family descend from Seth and are protectors of creation, but they are the last of his lineage, so "The Creator" sends Noah visions of a flood  and you know the rest. What you might not know, however, at least according to Aronofsky and co-writer Ari Handel, is that angels who were sympathetic toward man and defied The Creator were banished to Earth to live as rock monsters.The science-fiction/fantasy approach of "Noah" is reminiscent of Aronofsky's polarizing film "The Fountain." He crafts this world with the best of artistic intentions, but just in playing around with sensitive material, he walks the fine line between creativity and irreverence. "Noah" is best enjoyed when thought of as a creative, fantastical interpretation of what happened between the lines of the Old Testament.The main plot points of this story are quite well known, so creative interpretation is everything. "Noah" doesn't lack for creativity, but the various "interpretive" plot points drag things out on occasion, and in some cases get weird. The film's final act, after Noah and family board the ark  yes, after  evolves into a horror thriller of sorts and warps our perspective of the protagonist quite a bit. Aronofsky has expert intentions here that can be admired amid the strangeness of this shift in tone, but it may sour some folks.Even more radical are Noah's vision sequences and a scene that depicts the days of creation. You can see Aronofsky's "Requiem for a Dream" roots here, his penchant for grotesque imagery that is bound to stay with you well after the movie. Although this merely adds artistic value to "Noah," which would otherwise just be a biblical blockbuster, it is memorable.Although talented, the rest of the cast largely serves the purpose of expounding on Aronofsky's interpretation. Much of what happens to them serves as a side-plot exploration of the deeper ideas of mankind's nature. Ray Winstone as Tubal-Cain epitomizes our evil inclinations, for example, while Noah's son Ham (Logan Lerman) is the "Luke Skywalker" of the story, with everything hinging on which way he will lean."Noah" is a film of astounding visuals designed around philosophical ideas. As such, it's entertaining to watch and ripe for discussion, but the story operates almost exclusively to make these thematic points rather than to provide the most enjoyable narrative possible. At the same time, working within the confines of a story thousands of years old, Aronofsky and co. undoubtedly bring something new to Noah and the ark that brings its message into a mature, modern context.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

I've never been a big fan of the character The Hulk. He's not a typical superhero in that instead of being a human who has some cool new ability and utilizes it for moral objectives, he's a man with a genetic defect that turns him into a lumbering green giant with a knack for destroying things. But a love of Marvel superhero movies kept me rather open-minded for this one, and indeed, watching this film, Bruce Banner/The Hulk seems like a protagonist with a compelling story to tell about fighting one's inner demons. However, the way this story is told, "Hulk" completely fails to fully utilize what makes The Hulk a unique character in the Marvel universe.In short, "Hulk" is a botched attempt at an origin story. So get off Ang Lee's back if you think this is bad and tear up the three-man team that wrote this mediocre script for him to work with. While Lee does give a poor depiction of the Hulk that is more gentle giant than mean green killing machine, that's the least of this film's problems. James Schamus (story) and his crew don't create a story that really gets at Bruce Banner's dilemma or even lets us access Bruce's psyche. He feels distant for a protagonist and the connection between Bruce and the Hulk is not smooth. Eric Bana as Banner didn't help. The nerd element of Banner doesn't come across and while I find Bana talented, he was too serious and plain in this film and his emotions came across that way too. Bottom line, I felt little to no pity for him, which is unacceptable in a film of this nature.The dialogue of the script is also pretty subpar, except for Nick Nolte's lines as David Banner, the wackjob scientist that screwed up his son. The lines are a bit direct because they carry too much of the load for moving the plot forward. The beginning, Bruce's suppressed childhood memories, a mystery that sort of unfolds with time, is particularly choppy and the connection between Bruce and the viewer never really gets established. We see no more than flashes really of his past and he goes from a 4 year old to a college student in about 2 minutes. I guess the movie needed to be longer, but it would have been worth it to make us actually care about Bruce. I'm not surprised that Schamus and Co. haven't been behind any of Marvel's highly touted films since then, only the mediocre or worse ones: Fantastic Four, Punisher. In fact, Schamus never got another stint with Marvel. I guess co-writing "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" doesn't guarantee success in the world of superheroes.The next beef to have with the film is the action. Fault both Lee and the writers here. To say there isn't enough is justifiable, but at the same time, I'll take a film with less action if it's giving me some great character drama, which "Hulk" obviously doesn't, so the lack of action hurts the film here. The action scenes are brief and Lee simply doesn't mess enough stuff up. The Hulk doesn't really get beat up or end up completely destroying something out of sheer rage. The dog fight scene fits the plot but is tasteless and the rest is kind of anti- climactic. For being in a state of blind rage, Lee doesn't give us a Hulk that is sloppy and destructive. In fact his blue eyes (when they're not green) make him a bit effeminate in ways. (Side note: Bana has brown eyes, way to go)I'll give Lee and the editors credit for the paneling technique used to portray a comic book feel. At times it really makes the movie different and neat, though its use feels rather arbitrary and sometimes pointless. At the beginning it works well but as it gets used more and more it doesn't work as well. I also give credit to Nolte and Connelly as Banner's love interest Betty Ross. Connelly pulls off the soft, sensitive vibe. At least someone cares about Bruce. Lastly, kudos to Danny Elfman as always. I'm a big fan of the vibe the score gives off for this film.This is not one of Marvel's bright spots. They brought in the wrong people for this film and ultimately as much as I could pick it apart, there is just no personality to this film and no emotional connection. The whole film is straight-faced, confusing and forgettable. No surprise 5 years later the franchise is already being reinvented.
Judd Apatow continues to get personal with "This Is 40"maybe even too personal. When you think about it, it's kind of awkward that he directs Paul Rudd as husband to his real-life wife (Leslie Mann) and father to his real-life children (Maude and Iris Apatow) and it's really awkward because the film is about family strife and resentment. I can only imagine the therapy his daughters will have to endure.Now, I'm sure Mann's Debbie and Rudd's Pete are not exact replicas of actual Leslie and Judd, nor would he make his children just like their actual selves, but it's hard to imagine him writing such an upfront and honest film without drawing from his own experience.Pete and Debbie are having a variety of marital problems and realize at 40 that change is necessary. Both are dealing with issues related to aging and responding in different ways, both have vices they hide from the other and both have issues with their parents. Their daughters antagonize each other now that the older is an adolescent too, and money is also becoming a problem bearing down on it all. The film puts their relationship in a pressure cooker and displays the results.Debbie and Pete come from Apatow's "Knocked Up," but while some supporting characters overlap (Jason Segel and Charlyne Yi for example), Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are nowhere to be found. The film is much more of a study of a family and a couple on the cusp of middle age than a comedy with clear setup, conflict and resolution. Apatow explored that gray area of screen writing in his last film, "Funny People" and it too ended up going on a little too long."This Is 40" hits more identifiable, real moments than "Funny People," however, so that's a major plus. Apatow puts his keen observation skills to good use, and his sense of humor and ability to quickly seize on pop culture references in a way that doesn't treat the audience like it's stupid continue to be among his best trademarks. There are countless "funny because it's true" jokes that hit really well and more intimate moments that people of all ages old enough to see the film will be able to relate to.That said, the trees are much nicer than the forest. The film as a whole is disjointed, a seemingly endless back and forth of humor and sadness, sincerity and profanity, Pete and Debbie fighting and Pete and Debbie making up. A lot of specific scenes work especially well and in some cases are even hysterical or profound, but connecting points between them don't always make sense.Rudd and Mann are terrific together at making the loving and the fighting look real. That's huge. Without their chemistry, there would be more of a skeptical eye cast upon how logical (or illogical) it is that they're experiencing whatever happens to be their emotion-du-jour. Too much of the time we're left scrambling to piece together how they got to that point from the either intensely happy or intensely sad scene that preceded it.I don't doubt Apatow wanted to capture the complete emotional disarray of dysfunctional family life, but the moods swing a bit too conveniently. Considering the film takes place over the course of a week, the quantity of dramatic occurrences is absurdly large. This does, however, help with the lengthy run time.With "This Is 40," Apatow continues to blur the line between real life and the movies. Obviously not in the documentary sense, but in terms of how what happens in his movies replicates real life (must I offer a reminder that most movies, especially comedies, are not like real life?) It's a strange genre to go for a more vérité approach, but now that he's gone there with these films, it's hard to imagine him ever going back, for better or worse.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

Interconnecting stories are a tricky business, so kudos to young rookie filmmaker Greg Marcks for pulling off "11:14" to the extent that he does, managing to keep the film suspenseful and (mostly) unpredictable, entertainment never lacks. But when you light five different fires within close proximity, the expectation is for quite a spectacle in the end. The pure lack of poignancy or consequence deadens what was a script possessing sharp albeit twisted wit.Perhaps its my fault for being tricked into believing "11:14" would be something more than mystery-revealing aha moments strung together along with some unsuspecting comedic horror. Marcks had me so taken by trying to figure out what answer lay beneath the intersecting stories of these desperate small-town idiots that part of the entertainment intended through shock value and perverse turns of events never sunk in.The film begins with the character played by Henry Thomas (the kid from "E.T.") driving drunk and out of nowhere hitting someone at exactly 11:14 and then panicking because the police are coming and he has a drunk driving record. The story then takes us to a van of teenagers who at the same time plow into a girl and drive off, even though the accident has -- ready for it? -- severed the manhood of one of the boys. We're shown a few other perspectives throughout the night to see how it all connects.And our findings, as I mentioned, don't satisfy. Marcks intends to fuse the thriller genre with almost B-movie-like comedy, but the two simply aren't cooperating forces. I would find it hard to believe anyone could truly enjoy "11:14" as both and not one or the other. The sheer ridiculousness of the behavior of some of these senseless small-town characters offers an entertainment all its own, but the film is so convincingly serious that what's coming next commands more of our attention than letting it actually soak in that Ben Foster's character's penis is lying on the street somewhere.However, credit to Marcks for making a film that rounded up a killer cast of vets and up- and-comers from Hilary Swank, Patrick Swayze and Barbara Hershey to Ben Foster, Colin Hanks, Rachael Leigh Cook and Jason Segel. The actors all seem to understand the tone he's going for, which should be taken as a compliment, but I'm not sure if there's a way that the performances could have better cued us in to the "this film's not so serious" moments.The one nugget the film leaves us with is the theme of desperation. It's clear that none of what happened in the film would've happened without all the characters in some way being desperate for something whether money or simply not to end up in prison. However a thematic noun hardly provides the flourish a film with interconnecting stories needs to win over its audience.I hate to be the one who says he didn't like something because the ending was unsatisfying, but premises such as this one are built on, around and for the payoff. It's not tough to praise Marcks for a quirky and genre-bending script, but in the process of providing some refreshment, he sacrificed the one no-no of satisfying audience expectation. You simply cannot make a film with a cryptic "all this will make sense" title like "11:14" and deliver perfectly on the suspense without that golden nugget. It makes for a fun ride, but a hit- and-run ending.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
According to his friends and himself, Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is a five out of ten on a scale of general sex appeal. Funny, because that's the exact score I give this film. Kirk's a decent enough guy. A bit scrawny, has some self-esteem issues, but he's funny at times, genuine and often charming. I don't know about those negatives, but the positives could also be said about "She's Out of My League." There are moments when the sweet-natured interior of this story of "geek gets girl" shines through a bit and I speculate "Sex Drive" writers Sean Anders and John Morris intended that more than the finished product would lead us to believe. But it seems as though a producer stepped in and said, "this isn't Judd Apatow enough," so "League" gravitates between being a surprisingly likable romantic comedy and a direct-to-DVD stereotype. So much is hit or miss in this film that it's likely to be enjoyed or despised, which strangely reflects the thematic angle of how we perceive ourselves and the people we're interested in or dating. Molly (Alice Eve) defines ten out of ten in terms of looks, a well-paying job -- the whole package. Kirk, meanwhile, works at the airport for the TSA. By a stroke of luck they even interact with each other and once you get over that she asks him out, their relationship is the best part of the film. Eve impresses, maybe because she's written to be more than just boobs in a dress, even if the camera ogles her and every cast member is supposed to stare slack-jawed at her at some point in the film. After director Jim Field Smith establishes that she's hot, she gets a likable personality and Eve manages to create a complexity about her even though her character's motivation is "you like Kirk because he's 'safe,'" which I don't think is enough to defy laws of a attraction, but somehow she makes it work. Baruchel is a likable schlub and so the two manage to pull off the romance elements of the film. It's when they go back to their friends that the film goes back to being bad.You know them well by now, the group of friends in every movie who are nothing but cardboard cut-outs intended for humor, pop culture references and the like. In this case, because the movie is about this relationship and literally nothing else, they also serve to create a dialogue of the main characters' consciences. The two best buddies to Kirk and Molly respectively are Stainer (T.J. Miller) and Patty (Krysten Ritter). Ritter is quite possibly the least funny thing about this movie because she has no comic timing. Miller occasionally pulls off the sentimental stuff well, but his character is one of those typical stream-of-insults guys who's a mix between a Seth Rogen character and Napoleon Dynamite and sometimes he looks like he's just saying the funny stuff written in the script. One of Kirk's buddies is played by Nate Torrence, who proves why he's been in other films with his solid timing.The biggest source of problems for "League" is its director. Smith cancels out every good scene between Baruchel and Eve by putting in something that makes him seem completely negligent of the script, which is actually good. Whether its a cliché pan around Stainer's head as he tells of a sentimental memory or your typical slow-mo build up when Kirk and his brother are challenging each other to a hockey game in the basement, Smith provides plenty proof why he should probably be directing all those "American Pie presents" frat movies that get churned out twice a year. It's particularly painful when you can sense that there's some quality in a film and the director worsens it and it succumbs to the "let's do what we think is popular" machine.So "She's Out of My League" gets a five. Though it could easily be a seven or a three.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Woody Allen's comedic films and darker films are both very distinct, but very similar within each genre, and while the film begins as something much different in the drama realm, it turns out to be Allen relying on his strengths, simply from a more modern point of view.In "Match Point," Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Allen's troubled protagonist Chris, a former tennis pro, torn between his love for his wife Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and all the support her family provides him through his new job, and his undying passion for Nola (Scarlett Johansson), the former fiancée of his brother-in-law (Matthew Goode). Much of the film focuses on Rhys-Meyers figuring out what it is matters most and the drama this causes both his relationships, but then a long ways in turns very dark, Woody Allen dark, much like 1989's "Crimes and Misdemeanors."The films strengths are in the dramatic relationships and events that have a more modern realism to them to keep Allen's style fresh and effective. Thematically, like past Allen films, the movie thrives on the impending choice and consequences Rhys-Meyers will make and deal with as a result. (Ironically he reads "Crime and Punishment" along with a reader's guide early in the film.) On the weak side, there is also the theme of luck constantly being pounded in, or as Chris the tennis pro puts it, "sometimes the ball falls on your side of the court and sometimes it bounces over," although tennis, despite the title, hardly plays any role in the film outside of metaphor and symbolism. While luck can be pulled off as a theme, it appears more like a cop out for Allen than an important lesson, as anything can happen if you're lucky enough. Allen does, however, use it effectively through small directorial choices that keep the viewer constantly predicting the consequences of Rhys-Meyers' actions before they occur, and then looking incredibly clever when he throws in luck as a curve ball, but for the most part it seems unrealistic and somewhat bothersome.Aside from the need to be thematically explicit, the film succeeds as a more modern telling of one of Allen's old stories, which in some ways helps the film and hurts the film. The characters are incredibly strong and the passion and tension in the film is very effective, but as a whole the story is rather thematically questionable in terms of whether Allen's sometimes clearly stated ideas are truly as he says they are.
It's amazing how incredibly well-made movies like "Oldboy" manage to slip under the radar, at least in America. It may be a South Korean film, but it appeared at Sundance and its plot and style are easily catered to a Western audience. Regardless what happened, "Oldboy" is a film that can't be missed. It is a crime thriller and mystery that is delivered with such force and style that you can't help but be wowed.The movie is sort of like a much more contemporary spin on Alexandre Dumas' "The Count of Monte Cristo." Oh Dae-sue is kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years then suddenly released. Naturally, Dae-sue seeks answers and more importantly, revenge against his captor, but there's more to his situation than he realizes and he will soon find that the outside world is a giant prison in its own right.Chan-wook Park directs and writes the film based on a comic by Nobuaki Minegishi. That's a good place to start. Both the writing and directing is absolutely fantastic. There is a strong mix of active dialog and reflective narration from Dae-sue's perspective. The transitions between present action and past memory are not only creative but clear and seamless. While the film's only weakness is that it's difficult to follow and understand as it moves at mind- pounding speed, what you can follow is quite a lot considering the film's complexity and how little detail we know through so much of the movie. Nothing starts to really make sense until maybe halfway through.Park is also incredibly creative. The two-dimensional (like an old video game) fight sequence where Dae-sue takes out some guys with a hammer is unforgettable. His transitions to past memories that combine footage of the previous and upcoming scenes are quite smooth and interesting. One critical flashback, that (without spoilers) involves a hand-held mirror is elegant and powerful. So many amazing choices are made and they're not just good, they're highly memorable.Min Sik-Choi, who plays Dae-sue, gives an astounding performance, taking us into the tortured, vengeful and penitent heart of Dae-sue. There are times where he's comedic and times here's pitifully comedic. A lot of the film rides on feeling that emotion, feeling his motivation as if it's part of our own. This is without question a difficult film. Torturing images, incest, scenes that will nearly scar you litter this film. It is its greatest strength at times but obviously it makes it very difficult for some people to tolerate. Also littering the film, however, are quotes and phrases that gain meaning as the film progresses that are beautiful and thought-provoking. No matter the scene, "Oldboy" will grip you and make you think long and hard about it as the credits roll.
The Vietnam War is not something filmmakers have shied away from, so the challenge for Michael Cimino right away was to make "The Deer Hunter" something different. He succeeds. "Deer Hunter" is a portrait of life for American soldiers before and after war. It's goal is not to expose the horrors of the war or acclaim the bravery of its soldiers, but to show the far- reaching effects of post-traumatic stress. Although the film drags frequently because it doesn't use traditional storytelling methods, the feelings Cimino wants to get across are felt.Unlike any other film before it, "The Deer Hunter"'s greatest asset surprisingly lies in a plot device: the "game" of Russian Roulette. Although a small percentage of this three-hour film, the mere concept of loading one bullet into a six-shooter, pressing it against your head and pulling the trigger is a powerful means of storytelling. All the suspense, anticipation of gore and the fact that the main characters Michael (De Niro), Nick (Walken) and Steve (Savage) have to play it makes ten minutes of Russian Roulette just as intense as a 25-minute battle scene in another war movie. If "Deer Hunter" is remembered for nothing else, Russian Roulette alone assures it will never be forgotten.There really isn't a plot in this film in the traditional sense. The characters have no specific goals or desires, no obvious motivation. They have enlisted in the war apparently because they believe it's the American thing to do, but even that's only a sense we get from their limited patriotic dialogue. The only through-line in the entire film is De Niro's character trying, from what it looks like, to get everyone back together again like nothing terrible ever happened. Again, it's not a clearly expressed objective, but when you think about it there's nothing else that could possibly be living for. Basically, Cimino relies on our empathy with these jolly small-town characters to understand what's going on in the film and why it matters."Deer Hunter" is a visual film. The setting in both Pittsburgh and Vietnam is a crucial part of Cimino's attempt to create the empathy, seeing as he doesn't provide us any easy access. Dialogue is not his preferred method of revealing character and creating drama -- we have to keenly observe how these characters change from the beginning when they joyously drink and celebrate Steve's wedding to how they cope or fail to cope once they suffer the trauma of Russian Roulette. It's a heck of a challenge staying on board with Cimino's vision, but the Russian Roulette scenes, as intense as they are and as primely located in the film's plot structure as they are, really keep the film glued together as well as our eyes on the screen. Seeing that happen justifies the speechlessness of these characters as their lives continue after their experience in the war. Cimino knows how effective this is because loud noises are planted in the post- war scenes and they always make us think someone fired a gun. When John Cazale's character Stan brings up his little revolver prior to the war scenes, we don't care, but when we see it after De Niro comes back from 'Nam -- instant suspense. It's a shame Cimino never continued successfully after this film. Few films could get away with non-traditional storytelling and manage to leave the impact that "Deer Hunter" does.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Crack open the mind of filmmaker Terry Gilliam and you're likely to find something akin to the imagination world inside the mirror in his film "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus." Known for surrealism, candy-coated visuals and deliberately hacking at all that stands for common sense, Gilliam applies these trademarks to the kind of film where they belong most: in a fairytale fantasy.Although the details are certainly fuzzy, "Parnassus" makes itself fairly accessible compared with the rest of Gilliam's repertoire. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) is an ageless man who runs a traveling side show with his daughter, Valentina (Lily Cole), a dwarf (Verne Troyer) and a young man named Anton (Andrew Garfield). Their act offers people a unique chance to see possibility of imagination by stepping into a mirror where a world of their subconscious awaits them.At the end of one's trip into the imaginarium is a choice that reveals the heart of the film. The first path belongs to Parnassus, but the second is commandeered by the devil himself (Tom Waits). Turns out Parnassus has engaged in many a bet with "Mr. Nick" over the years, including one that promised him Valentina on her 16th birthday, which has nearly arrived. Parnassus and Mr. Nick are in an argument over human nature and through the imaginarium, Parnassus hopes he will prove his point. By this point, the devil has made a fickle alcoholic out of Parnassus, but all that is about to get complicated when the travelers pick up Tony (Heath Ledger) from the brink of death.Ledger's unexpected death in 2008 certainly threw a wrench into this film, but in a world where anything's possible with Gilliam defining "possibility," there shouldn't have been much doubt. Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell all play versions of Tony when he enters the imaginarium, where the person who enters sees things according to their deepest desires, thus justifying the change. It works excellently and the three actors capture the spirit of Ledger's oddball performance.The premise of "Parnassus" alone provides Gilliam every excuse he needs to justify the whimsical and bizarre events of the film. Those with big imaginations themselves will pick up on the "rules" of his story fairly quickly, particularly the visual metaphor. The film is also driven by an idea: human nature. This is not the age-old worn down debate of good vs. evil and whether humans are inherently one or the other. It's about whether -- when given free will -- we can face our mistakes and continue to write our own personal narratives despite temptations to rest, to give in and save ourselves the woe of uncertainty. This choice is what manifests itself in the world of the imaginarium and in Mr. Nick and the doctor's wagers.I suppose most will struggle to see this brilliant meditation on a rarely discussed theme amidst the swirling surrealism and abundance of strong characters played by equally strong actors who offer the temptations of simply watching the character subplots unfold from the love story to Tony's back story. The young Garfield and Cole create memorable characters for being new faces, which credit their casting in this film. Gilliam has always had a knack for finding exceptional talents and recruiting proved ones. Between Ledger, his fill-in, Plummer, Garfield and Cole, Gilliam has compiled one of the few excellent multi-generational casts.Stick with "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" and good will come of it. Gilliam does not want to alienate anyone; the very last scene alone provides some excellent last minute insights into the themes. Behind the abstraction, the odd clash of period-style costumes and dialogue in a contemporary context lies a wonderfully human story.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
In a decade where CGI has dominated all animated forms of entertainment and a year where 3D has exploded into prime time, Walt Disney Studios steps back, reaches into its old bag of tricks and pulls out its first hand-drawn feature in five years. The decision might feel like a ploy to boost Disney merchandising with a new princess, but Disney has made plenty movies that achieve that end only they don't have half heart and soul poured into them that "The Princess and the Frog" does. Dedicated to moral-focused storytelling and creating lovable characters, Disney has rediscovered a touch of its former magic and delivered an age- appropriate children's film -- it's best effort of this kind since 1998's "Mulan" and maybe even "The Lion King." Complete with musical numbers, this is Disney's old formula executed to a T. Princesses, wishing upon stars, a journey with new friends being made along the way, danger, transformation, talking animal sidekicks -- there's no question Disney wanted desperately to recreate the feeling of its classics. Set in Jazz Age New Orleans, Tiana is a dedicated young woman with a knack for cooking who aspires to open up her own restaurant one day and do the memory of her father proud. She knows all about the value of hard work when it comes to achieving one's dreams. Already, here is Disney making it clear that it wants to teach children a valuable lesson above all else.The sacrifice made for that is adult-level humor. Whereas Disney threw in numerous jokes back in mid-'90s that flew over kids' heads, there's maybe only a handful of those chuckles in "Frog." Make no mistake, this one is for kids. Disney nostalgists will enjoy it too -- but the focus is kids. Lots of run-of-the-mill physical humor and talking animals acting silly: most of the time you'll laugh because it's cute and sweet.The plot is okay. The foreign Prince Naveen comes to New Orleans and he has a run in with a hoodoo-voodoo witch doctor, the sinister Dr. Facilier (ala James Bond villain Baron Samedi in "Live and Let Die"), who in a spooky, smoky flash-bang big-band music number promises him wealth (princes can get cut off by their parents you know) and also his mutton-chopped assistant princely fame. Planning to use them as pawns of his own devise, he turns Naveen into a frog and the assistant into Naveen. The frog Naveen finds Tiana and promises that if she kisses him, he'll make her restaurant dream come true. When she agrees, she ends up a frog too. Together, they journey through the Louisiana Bayou in hopes to find Mama Odie, who will have the power to turn them human again. Along the way they meet a cuddly trumpet-playing crocodile named Louis (after Mr. Armstrong, naturally) and a goofy Cajun firefly named Ray. Its when Louis and the frog Tiana and Naveen sing about what they'll do when they become human ("When We're Human") as they float down the river that suddenly you feel that old fuzzy Disney musical feeling and "Princess and the Frog" becomes a success.Randy Newman's tunes are catchy and fun, representing a range of Southern music from jazz ("When We're Human) to banjo-plucking folk ("Gonna Take You There") to the film's best song, Mama Odie's moral-delivering number asking us all to "Dig A Little Deeper" in full gospel fashion. The last one aside, they're not all that memorable, however, most likely because they never give in to full theatricality. There just feels like a little reservation in making "Frog" an all-out musical jamboree on Newman's part as well as longtime Disney directors Ron Clements and John Musker. For many adult Disney-lovers, it might be the difference between a "cute" and a "great" Disney film.Certainly, however, even if just in brief moments, Disney has tapped into the magic of old with this heart-warming story preaching that our personal dreams and desires don't mean nearly as much if they lose sight of love and family. It even manages to be pleasantly less predictable than one would expect in the end and it also avoids some past warranted Disney criticisms with regards to racism and stereotyping gender roles. Kids will love it (one girl in the theater was even dancing in the aisle ... out of plain sight of course) and parents will feel good about taking them to see it. A definite success for Disney.~Steven CVisit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com
Foreign language films lose out on a wider audience for two reasons: limited distribution and subtitles. Most audiences view subtitles as a hurdle to their enjoyment of a film, but regardless of whether that's a founded argument, it's inconsequential for "Let the Right One In," a Swedish film that reminds us that imagery is the universal language (sorry math nerds).Tomas Alfredson's film based on the John Ajvide Lindqvist book is haunting, touching, moving, creepy and so forth; the mood goes wherever he takes us and despite the generally quiet vibe of the film, "Right One" intrigues from start to finish.A story of self-preservation and young love (in more the fondness sense of love), "Let the Right One In" certainly doesn't tread typical 21st Century vampire movie territory, which might be enough in itself to warrant the film heaps of praise. Digression aside, the film centers around Oskar (Kare Hedebrant), a 12-year-old boy being bullied at school and enacting revenge fantasies in his spare time and his encounter with your anything-but- typical "girl next door." Yes, Eli (Lina Leandersson) lives next door, but she's not a girl so much as a blood-thirsty vampiric creature. Eli lives with her "father" (Per Ragnar) whose life exists solely to keep her alive by bringing home fresh blood, something he hasn't been so good at lately.Like any relationship between 12-year-olds, Eli and Oskar bond over simple things (a Rubix Cube for starters) and are mostly feeling each other out, especially Eli, whose never had interaction with a peer in so far as we can tell. She inspires confidence in Oskar to stand up to his bullies and the two find a tenderness on which the rest of the story builds. "Let the Right One In" has plenty of cringing moments to warrant being tagged in the horror genre, but it's this story of simplistic love that makes it a cut and several puncture wounds above the rest.Adolescent relationships (anything with kids or actors clearly not at least 16) can be a touchy area, but Alfredson plays it nicely and avoids any discomfort. His strength remains mostly in the dramatic elements of the film and in working with Hedebrant and Leandersson. Considering the film focuses on this burgeoning relationship, it requires a lot of maturity from the actors and they live up the test without sacrificing their youthful innocence (and insecurity).As far as horror goes, while "Right One" is not genuinely scary, the climactic moments of vampire attacks and such are striking and surprisingly memorable. Alfredson finds compelling and non-traditional ways to frame these key moments, especially the end, that engrave the film in your brain. They deliver such an impressive punch to the viewer that any wandering off done during a lull in the action instantly disappears.To cap it off, all this is told with visual prowess. Alfredson demonstrates clear mastery in terms of understanding how what's not seen on camera can be just as powerful as what is and can turn a moment of medium-level interest to high-level and high-level to instantly memorable. The way scenes materialize despite a lack of traditional framing of faces and focusing on certain objects impresses. The symbolism, namely of hands reaching out to walls and windows toward others, rarely receives better execution as well. Even the more bizarre events in the film have a powerfully surreal quality to them. Something with the lens being used or some subtly change brought a rare energy to those climactic moments."Right One" might never get due recognition outside the foreign-film appreciators community, but certainly not for any fault of its own -- just the bias of specific people. It combines the best of visual storytelling and human-to-human drama all in combination with a familiar and beloved sub-genre of vampire stories. It's a winning combination and one that just about anyone is capable of appreciating regardless of the vampire expectation.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
"Frequency" is a film that finds a really easy way to your heart and keeps you captivated with a great mystery premise. If you're a sucker for time-travel films, you'll like this one right away. There's something about a son getting to talk to his dead father 30 years in the past and getting a second chance that is unavoidably likable.John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) is a homicide detective who comes across his father's old hamm radio. He makes a friend only to find that friend is actually his father (Dennis Quaid) 30 years ago, the same year that he died. After some convincing that it's all real, John explains to his father, a firefighter, that he dies trying to save someone on one particular job. When John saves his father's life, however, it alters the future and all of a sudden the Nightengale murders John has been researching become a bit personal.The premise is unscratchable. A father and son speaking to each other through some strange time discrepancy, working together for a second chance for their family that was devastated by the accident. Caviezel and Quaid are great actors and they sell it well, even in their talk of of the 1969 Mets. It's a great father and son film, to say the very least about it.The mystery element is nothing completely original and special, but for what this movie is really about, it doesn't particularly matter. This is just a really well-executed movie that understands what kind of film it is and doesn't try to go beyond that.
Through much of the beginning of "Easy A," you have to find all the  '80s teen comedy homages fishy. Maybe director Will Gluck and Burt V.  Royal are trying to dress up a classic Hughesian formula with modern  banter and social media references. Then, somewhere near the halfway  point, comes the admission. Olive, played by up-and-comer Emma Stone,  confesses she wants her life to have a "Sixteen Candles" or "Breakfast  Club" or "Say Anything" moment. Ah, and suddenly this is homage  territory -- much better. Like the rest of this hip, fun and  surprisingly touching comedy, any time "Easy A" wanders down the path  of cliché, a killer line or great scene nullifies it.   It all begins and ends with Stone, who can do a little bit of  everything, which ought to ensure her a long career. She can do typical  teen comedy lead autopilot/earn our sympathy, she can command the  improvisation-like tangential dry humor that has defined the comedies  of the last five or so years and she can be the sensitive, fragile  Molly Ringwald type. Nothing feels forced or unnatural in her  performance. She seems to be having fun and milking to goofy nature of  Royal's script.  More importantly, the reason "Easy A" is so good is because it never  stops being about Olive's story. A high school nobody, Olive lets her  best friend (Alyson Michalka) pressure her into lying about losing her  virginity. The simple lie gets overheard by the super-Christian Miss  Everybody (Amanda Bynes) and suddenly everyone sees Olive differently,  or sees her period. After deciding to embrace the attention as school  slut (the story reaches here a bit), Olive then starts to pretend to  have sex with guys in need of a reputation boost, which consequently  sullies her own.  The only real problem with "Easy A" is that there's no good reason to  believe Stone was this unattractive nobody given her actual  attractiveness and the friends she has -- and we're supposed to believe  that suddenly everyone is interested in her because she lost her  virginity. Gluck tries to spin this into a positive by making it almost  comical how everyone is staring at her or waiting in a perfect line for  her to come down the hall, but it's the one scratch in this gem -- take  it or leave it. The script and humor and situations that arise  eventually more than make up for this road bump.  Gluck's filmmaking is hip and common of modern comedy while the writing  is clever and spontaneous. For no logical reason, a scene when Olive's  gay friend Brandon (the one she helps first) comes over, Stone and  Patricia Clarkson, who plays her mother, do this quick exchange of  pretending they're in the Old South and a boy has come over and asked  for her. Though completely random and a bit forced, they actually work  well at making the characters seem more organic, which is the challenge  of most comedies, especially those made today.  Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as the parents are the comic relief. When  was the last time parents in a teen comedy were genuine comic relief?  They walk a fine line between wacko and genuinely caring and loving  parents, but it totally works. Two more originally funny parents have  don't exist in any movie. Characters such as the aforementioned best  friend Rhiannon and Bynes' are more by-the-book as far as being teen  comedy stencils, but like every other small flaw with the film, they're  covered up by all the multi-dimesional and more interesting ones.  Worthy of mention are school faculty members played by Thomas Haden  Church, Lisa Kudrow and Malcolm MacDowell.  Most intriguing of all is how the film actually succeeds at finding  moments of genuine drama. A few well-thought-out and creative plot  twists introduce an intelligence seemingly foreign to these kinds of  comedies. The key once again comes from staying focused on Olive's  story. The film is structured as a retelling with narration from Olive,  so it's told in a reflective manner, which ultimately keeps it from  veering off course. It's about Olive wrestling with this lie and her  feelings about how she wants to be perceived, along with her  understandable pity for the boys who request her "services." High  school's rough and reputation seems to be everything. Some elements of  the high-school experience in "Easy A" might be way off, but that's  dead on.  Although it lacks the intangible innocence of the numerous '80s  comedies it references, "Easy A" has a unique and lively spirit of its  own and is the best teen comedy (at least featuring a female, finally!)  in years. More importantly, it shows that the modern teenage sense of  humor and good storytelling don't have to be mutually exclusive.  ~Steven C
More than a half century after "Sunset Blvd.," audiences are well aware that Hollywood is not all glitz and glamor -- that there's a stark reality. Yet despite that knowledge, "Sunset Blvd." is still an eye-opening and deeply affecting motion picture today as it was in the 1950s. Because even though our "access" to Hollywood is greater than that of yesteryear, great film-making and chilling performances are timeless and that's what this classic delivers.Billy Wilder was already famous for his string of films in the mid-late '40s, but "Sunset Blvd." is in a category of its own. There's something shockingly real about this noir drama. Maybe it's the fact that actress Gloria Swanson, who plays faded silent film star Norma Desmond, was in need of a comeback herself, or that famous director Cecil B. DeMille plays a big role as himself, or that several old silent film stars such as Hedda Hopper and Buster Keaton appear in the movie as Norma's friends. It's kind of enchanting really, but doubly so because of the suspenseful tone of the film."Sunset Blvd." is about a work-starved screenwriter named Joe Gillis (William Holden) who by coincidence ends up in the mansion of an old silent film star, Norma Desmond. Desmond has written herself a comeback (or return, as she prefers) role and convinces Gillis to redraft it. Oddly, however, she insists on him staying at her mansion, where he inevitably becomes her plaything.The script by Wilder and longtime collaborator Charles Brackett (along with D.M. Marshman Jr.) creates some awkward but powerful moments, such as a New Years Eve party where Gillis discovers he's the only guest. Although the beginning scene was a last-minute addition, the excellent shot of him floating in the pool is the first of many affecting images and scenes that Wilder has crafted with a touch of horror and creepiness to be truthful. Franz Waxman accentuates this tone with his suspenseful score.But it's way Gloria Swanson carries herself as the iconic Norma Desmond that generates the creepy effect. Head tilted back, she stares at you with those 1930s movie star eyes and moves her hands in such a manner that will terrify everyone just slightly. Not getting an Oscar win just goes to show what a great year for film 1950 was, though speculation is the film's mildly negative portrayal of the industry could have been partly responsible. All the main characters in this film got nods but lost out on the prize in fact -- and truth is all were deserving of being there.It's hard to see now, but Hollywood was all about reputation in those days. It was about the image and deceiving the public with glamorization of the business. "Sunset Blvd." was a classic of its time for getting beneath the veil that Norma oh so cleverly has on when she goes to visit the great Mr. DeMille, but it's a classic for all-time because of the subtle haunting quality of Wilder's work and bewitching performance of Swanson.~Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com
The cure for cancer is still an exhausting search, but the cure for bad movies about cancer has finally taken affect. A few years ago, Jonathan Levine's "50/50" changed the portrayal of and dialogue about cancer in movies. Fast-forward to 2014 and the TV show "Red Band Society" and this film adaptation of John Green's "The Fault in Our Stars" are normalizing cancer in teenagers. It's a weird trend to highlight, but if Hollywood can start treating other "taboo" subjects the same way, there's hope for film as a meaningful teaching tool yet."The Fault in Our Stars" begins by essentially scoffing at picture-perfect love stories. Its narrator, Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a Stage IV thyroid cancer survivor not even 20 years old, warns us that this story will not have a happy ending. She's right, but that said, you won't be blindsided by some Nicholas Sparks tearjerker move either.Hazel doesn't know her timeline, but she knows her cancer is terminal. She carries an oxygen tank with her everywhere she goes, including a support group that she only attends to keep her mother (Laura Dern) and father (Sam Trammell) happy. But it's there, ironically, where she meets Augustus, or Gus, (Ansel Elgort), an osteosarcoma survivor with a prosthetic leg and an impressively positive yet realistic attitude about life. Both of them witty, sharp and sarcastic, Hazel and Gus become fast friends and their romance grows in spite of Hazel's best intentions to avoid falling in love.There's a terrific sense of humor and approach to cancer in this script that even makes "50/50" seem dated. The characters are not defined by their illnesses but by their attitudes toward life, the way they cope with the ups and downs. Hazel and Gus are surprisingly mature for their age, partly because they're written so well but also because they've been through a lot and ripened at a young age. They still feel like teenagers though, and that's key.Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, writers of the outstanding "(500) Days of Summer" and "The Spectacular Now" nail it again with the chemistry between Hazel and Gus. Obviously much credit belongs to Woodley and Elgort, but these writers know how to craft real, authentic dialogue. They so effortlessly evoke our own memories of love and life's challenges at a young age in addition to creating compelling drama.They've also got modern teenage relationships down pat. There's just enough use of phones here to make texting a meaningful component of Hazel and Gus's relationship, but not so much that the movie is overbearingly "contemporary." Director Josh Boone handles these scenes delicately and in a way that's true to those who have experienced romance develop through text. But anyway, these characters are in the business of making real connections; after all, they've been through more hardship than a majority of kids their age.The movie is the story of their relationship, which doesn't become a romance for them as quickly as it does in the audience's mind. Trained to know in movies when two people should fall in love, we are conditioned to look for a first kiss scene well before it happens in this movie, which reflects the inherent, largely unspoken challenges of Hazel and Gus's relationship. As much as teens will gravitate toward this film, it's the adults  who know the heartbreak, who know what teenage romance is like, who would likely tell these two to be cautious  that will most appreciate the story's attitude toward love and relationships. In a lot of ways, "The Fault in Our Stars" could be a great film for teens and their parents to begin to have conversations about these things.Even though the opening narration insists that the story won't sugarcoat anything, it doesn't mean it's free of melodramatic twists that ratchet the drama and sadness up to 10. The approach to scene work and dialogue and characters is more authentic, but the plot doesn't exactly follow suit. In the story's defense, however, we'd have a very boring film on our hands without something to really challenge these characters. Even if you might argue their lives have been challenging enough, it's still a movie.Thematic richness is another strength of "The Fault in Our Stars." It's an emotionally deep and resonant film just in the way it handles cancer, but it also presents difficult concepts and subplots that even further inform the core story. When Gus uses his "Make-a-Wish" to take Hazel to Amsterdam to meet with the author of her favorite book, this seemingly tangential segment in their larger journey brings a surprising number of new layers and ideas to the story, including the author's unexpected reaction and a visit to the Anne Frank House."The Fault in Our Stars" is one of the films changing the way we look at major issues. There's nothing politically charged about cancer, but films wanting to approach anything from race to sexual orientation could certainly adopt some of the techniques here to approach those issues in authentic ways. Teaching tool or not, it's still a quality coming-of-age story right next to "The Perks of Being A Wallflower."~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more
If you think about it, "300" really is very little more than ripped men in loincloths cracking one-liners and killing everything in sight despite the fact that it's obvious that they all will die. What give it its appeal, however, is the way that a story that could be told like any other classic world war film (maybe "Spartacus" is a good example here?) is told with a unique 21st century twist.In actuality, to be fair, the movie is based on a graphic novel of the same title and tells the story of King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and how he rounded up 300 men to fight the Persian empire who was planning on taking over all of Greece and how the principle was more important than the obvious outcome of the battle.What director Zack Snyder does is give the film a more artsy look, something more focused on images and contrasting light and dark. The result is a somewhat superficial look, but that's the idea. The story is told from the one man (David Wenham from "Lord of the Rings") who is personally asked by Leonidas to go back to Sparta and tell the story before they all end up dying. He of course, trying to convince the rest of Sparta to fight, glorifies the telling. It is an incredibly wise choice then, for Snyder to glorify the telling in the movie, with excessive blood, slow motion and a variety of strange middle eastern music. The actors are mostly British or Scottish to seem more classic (if "Gladiator" can pick Russell Crowe, "300" is allowed) so clearly the goal is to be over the top. Butler, by the way, gives a commanding performance that with a more serious film would warrant much praise.Without these choices, Snyder would have a boring piece of unmolded clay on his hands. He brings the life into the film. It's not remarkable nor should it be award-winning, but it certainly is entertaining and proof that there is more than one way to shoot an epic war movie. If "300" was trying to be more than cool or even just cool with a proved formula, Warner Bros. would have released it in December or over the summer. Instead it's a breakthrough in unique film-making.
It's always nice when a movie surpasses expectations. It's even nicer when that better-than- expected film negates the potential title-related puns that critics could have used to lambaste it. In other words, there's nothing despicable to say about "Despicable Me" other than the title's overall irrelevance and potential roadblock to making more money.In a time where the age demographic for animated features isn't confined to under 10 thanks to our friends at DreamWorks and Pixar, one never knows what to expect. "Despicable Me" is explicitly for the kiddies, however, with a few under-the-radar adult jokes. Adults will appreciate its cuteness and be generally amused, but Illumination Entertainment's debut film stays mostly slap-happy and goofy, very much so in the tradition of "Looney Tunes." In fact, you might even miss "Looney Tunes" a bit after this hour and a half of predominantly physical gags where characters walk away from explosions with nothing but soot on their face.Following the trend of superheroes and supervillains pervading family entertainment the last 5-10 years, "Despicable Me" focuses on devious Russian-accented supervillain Gru (Steve Carell), who's best known for stealing the Times Square Jumbotron and the statue of liberty - - well, the miniature from Las Vegas. Needless to say, Gru is losing his mojo and to make up for it, he plans to steal the moon. Only problem is, a new rival villain named Vector (Jason Segel) has stolen the shrink ray -- that he stole. Without it, he cannot steal the moon, nor secure the loan he needs from the Bank of Evil to build his rocket ship to get there.That's where the "Adventures in Babysitting" part comes in, another all-to-common trend in family entertainment of late. Fortunately, here's another area where "Despicable Me" has gone and made it work anyway. Three orphan girls with the unfortunate names of Margo, Edith and Agnes manage to get into Vector's super-secure high-tech hideout right in front of Gru's eyes. He concocts what he thinks to be a brilliant plan: adopt the girls and have them bring Vector robot cookies that will infiltrate and steal back the shrink ray. As you'd expect, the girls become more than he bargained for, and ultimately test his cold, stubborn heart."Despicable Me" doesn't necessarily rise above these clichés with a fresh or innovative approach. It merely executes them well and not to excess, never seeming like too much of a kids movie. The yellow pill-shaped minions, for example, while not all that funny or lovable, work well and add a somewhat different dimension to the movie to keep it balanced.The film's plot is irrelevant and stays that way, which is a sign of a film that understands its role as entertainment and executes as such. By selecting simple and predictable narrative patterns, directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud's creativity with the sequences and characters becomes the focus. Arguably, however their ability to not take any moment of the film too seriously makes "Despicable Me" work. Considering the tried-and-true physical comedy spread throughout, it definitely takes a certain silliness to make decades-old cartoon tactics work for a modern audience. "Despicable Me" figures it out and does so without pandering to kids and families, a movie that's age appropriate but not exclusively so.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Few crime films seem to transcend their genre. "Silence of the Lambs" is one of them. With incredible characters and careful, thoughtful direction, it's not a complete surprise that this film is among the many elite that call themselves Academy Award winning best pictures.The film centers around Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster), an FBI trainee that essentially because of being young and feminine, gets assigned to work with a serial killer: the infamous Hannibal Lecter, one of the most chilling villains of all time played by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Eventually she finds herself thrust into another serial murder case involving "Buffalo Bill" and must seek the nutty Lecter's advice in order to solve it.Starling and her struggle to ward off the sexist world of that surrounds her in this field is the film's centerpiece. Director Jonathan Demme does a great job focusing on Foster's strengths: her facial expressions, her constant nervousness knowing that this will make or break the career to which she aspires. Demme also does a great job making it clear, but not too overtly so, how the men in the film eerily gravitate toward her in every situation. It's bothering, but the fact that she is indeed the film's hero makes it somewhat empowering.While little attention was paid to "Buffalo Bill," an interesting character with a powerful metaphor and comparison to Starling in Thomas Harris' book, the focus is substituted with full attention to Lecter's scenes and his role becomes more pivotal in the film, which is clearly worth it given Hopkins' talent. It is then more about how he affects Starling and how they work together and form a unique relationship. It is unfortunate both could not be stronger, but there's is no arguing with the strength of this screenplay."Silence of the Lambs" is not the kind of film that will move you, but it is an excellent example of how great characters can take an ordinary serial murder plot and make it something more than just a genre film.~Steven CVisit my site: http://moviemusereviews.com
You kind of get exactly what you expect out of "Man on Fire." Denzel Washington kills people, there some seriously innovative and abstract camera-work and editing from one of the finest action directors in the last 20 years (Tony Scott), and there's even a mystery to unravel. The film even bravely attempts to bring in a family oriented theme in what it tries to sell as an unlikely relationship between Washington and Fanning. But understand that this is an action film first, and even if it takes about an hour to get that, it's the truth. It's good, but it's mostly an artistic action piece. Washington's bad ass named John this time is known as just "Creasy." From the start he is an enigma. All you can really tell is he's sort of a war-torn alcoholic ex-US Intelligence assassin. With no other direction in life, he agrees to take a job as a body guard for a wealthy guy in Mexico City (Marc Anthony), where many kidnappings have been happening recently. There he forms this "unlikely bond" with the daughter Fanning, who of all her roles, this is the least annoying I've seen. She breaks his tough skin and then things take a scary turn when she is kidnapped. Unfortunately, that above paragraph is the first hour of the film. I understand the need to establish the relationship, but it all kind of becomes amoral anyway when Creasy decides he's going to kill everyone tied to the kidnapping. The rest of the film is Creasy seeing red and just taking it to everyone. As much as you understand the motivation, it just doesn't click right when he goes on this spree. He's very good in the role--outstanding I would say, but as a film the cohesiveness doesn't exactly work. I would give high marks to both halves of the film, but they don't exactly mesh together.Scott's use of flashing and repetitive images that he slows down and speeds up works better in the second half to accommodate the intense revenge/action scenes, but it feels a bit out of place in the beginning. Scott usually only uses it as it ties in to Creasy's past, but his past is not exactly something the film explores--it sort of takes it for granted. In general though, it's cool and unique and shows why Tony Scott is capable of handling any action film.I think what I'm saying is go in for Denzel and for the action, but I think that's what most people interested in watching "Man on Fire" are looking for anyway. Perhaps the family element will go over better with some more than others, but I see no family values in a film where Denzel is depriving people of fingers, no matter what they try and convince me. This is a great premise and an entertaining film and worth a watch.
The highly anticipated sequel to "Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle" is finally here and it comes with the subtitle "Escape From Guantanamo Bay." It's the same old bag of tricks for this stoner comedy duo, only this time it takes a few political jabs, so for fans of the first film, "H+K2" will quickly and easily satisfy the random, gross-out humor munchies. Everyone else will just be floored by this film's audacity to be both politically incorrect and utterly stupid.The sequel picks up just where the last one left off, with Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) going to Amsterdam in pursuit of both Harold's love interest from the previous film and of course the ability to freely smoke marijuana. Smartly enough, their ethnicities combined with pot-smoking ambitions make them appear as terrorists for which they are sent to Guantanamo Bay from which they promptly escape. We are now twenty minutes into the film. That will give you a sense of how much creators Hayden Schlossberg and Jon Hurwitz pack into this film and it doesn't get cashed for another hour and twenty.For those unfamiliar with the 'franchise,' both films and especially this film is your typical stoner/college-teen comedy set up ala "Eurotrip," which gets referenced in the film appropriately enough. In other words, our main characters are off on some preposterous adventure where they meet strange characters, shenanigans and trouble at every turn while at some point taking a step back to add some unprecedented friendship sentimentality. Add plenty of drugs and plenty of nudity and you have yourself the formula. Schlossberg and Hurwitz have done nothing outside of these films and it's clear why."H+K2" fires jokes at you like machine gun bullets, knowing that if it shoots 100, at least a bunch are guaranteed to take you out. There are definitely some very funny, hysterical and dare I say clever jokes in this film, but then there are a zillion others that completely miss the mark. One juxtaposition, for example, could be a bong being mistaken for a bomb and goat poop. The characters are mostly decent. Harold and Kumar are your typical duo of one anal, cautious guy and one laid back, risk-taking guy. It's a timeless dynamic even these writers can't screw up. At least the fact that they are Korean and Indian set the film apart a tad. Smartly, they take advantage of racism to take some outlandish, though definitely present, cracks at America. While not poignant like say "Borat," this film finds its own bizarre way of making a statement with limited effectiveness.I won't bother to explain the plot in any detail, because it's garbage--even if it acknowledges it--though I will say it takes them to the ghetto, a KKK party, a whorehouse and yes, even the Bush family ranch. Nothing else needs to be said. You have to press play on this film recognizing that the plot will most likely be absurd and you just want to laugh. So on laughs, this film is pretty half and half with hit and miss. All in all, it would be wrong of me to say this film isn't a good time if you're in the mood or under the influence.
"Spirited Away" is a great film, but not great in the way that most Americans will think of movies. This film is an adventure unlike anything the western hemisphere has ever seen (unless of course you belong(ed) to your high school anime club). It's a story about simple, pure and true values, not a story about life's deepest questions and that's what separates it from the dominant form of "Western" films.The story is about a young girl named Chihiro who is moving with her parents to a new town when a stop along the way leads them to what appears to be an abandoned carnival. You get the feeling things aren't that simple and before Chihiro knows what hit her, she is in a spirit world and her parents have been transformed into pigs for gluttonously infringing on the spirit world. To return to her normal life and get her parents back, Chihiro must work at a spirit bathhouse led by a cruel witch named Yubaba.There is no explanation of what this world is in relation/comparison to the real world that the characters were in in the beginning, but once you get past that, it's all about the creatures, characters and bizarre events that happen. The world is unbelievably imaginative, combining both elements of conventional fantasy and ideas that are completely fresh. Whether it is the odd, but powerful creature named No Face, the multi-legged old boiler operator Kamajii or the bug-eyed, insane Yubaba, "Spirited Away" boasts an intriguing cast of characters.Most importantly, the film is about the values of love, friendship and helping others. We watch Chihiro, a sort of passive, ignorant girl learn (in some of the oddest ways) what it means to be selfless and giving and the film is her transformation into a better person. That's it. No deep criticism of humanity (other than don't be selfish), no questions about life, just a reinforcement of ideas that so often are either overlooked or expressed in uncreative, unoriginal ways. A children's film could have gotten the same ideas across, but "Spirited Away" shows that there are different ways to think about why those values are important.
Disney is no stranger to the fairy tale (understatement of the last century), but princesses, curses and kingdoms are definitely new forays for its partner, digital animation powerhouse, Pixar. John Lasseter and company have always been more preoccupied with breathing life into inanimate objects and giving vocal cords to animals, so a film with humans taking place in the Scottish highlands and only lightly sprinkled with magic, is starkly traditional by comparison. For a studio so pristinely viewed by the masses as the cutting edge of animated storytelling to retreat to one of the world's most ancient forms of storytelling might seem a bit confusing and maybe even disappointing, but Pixar does all that it does so well with "Brave," even if the means and the ends are all too familiar.Firstly, Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) would put all the classic Disney Princesses to shame. If they all gathered in the same room, she would stand out with her frizzled red hair and generally antsy disposition, not to mention think them all lame and boring for being dainty and predictable.Although the princess who would rather shoot arrows and run around outside all day than learn how to sit and speak properly is far from an original thought (these days you might consider her a cross between Katniss Everdeen and Arya Stark), Disney desperately needed a heroine who is self-sufficient and strong enough not to need a male co-star and Merida is perfect in that regard. She's not merely rebellious for the sake of the story, but you truly feel as if her character is not fit for a life of royalty.The movie follows a predictable path but a likable one, likable in its familiarity and likable because the issues and themes it speaks to are timeless. The core of the story is Merida's relationship with her mother, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). As it comes time for the lords of the three tribes to champion their sons for Merida's hand, the strain in their relationship boils over. Elinor tries maddeningly to make Merida understand her duties as princess, but Merida grows frustrated with her mother's lack of consideration for her own wishes.After an awful fight, Merida flees to the forest and follows the will-o'-the-wisps, desperate to change her fate by changing her mother's mind. After a strange witch presents her with that chance, Merida makes an impetuous choice that has major consequences and challenges her to see just how brave she can be.Merida is also a terrific heroine because she's not perfect. The Queen is not some evil stepmother, so while we understand Merida's feelings, we are frustrated with some of her initial choices. Regardless, you root for her the entire time and she successfully carries the weight of the story on her back.The male characters leave a little something to be desired, though the king, Fergus (Billy Connolly), is a lovable character and father. While he has plenty of foolish moments, he's also responsible and kingly when it's required of him. The lords from the rest of the kingdom are amusing but wild and one-dimensional until the end when Merida convinces them of one of the most obvious notions in human history.Related to the male characters in the film, the level of needless violence in "Brave" is surprising, though used for comic effect. Even the old witch, who's in the film for not even 10 minutes, beats her pet crow for no good reason. "The Incredibles" aside, Pixar has not traditionally been known for violence, and one could make the case that "Brave" is a bit scarier than most family-focused offerings.The humor of "Brave" goes beyond physical gags, however, though not into seriously laugh- out-loud territory. "Brave" is clever in the way you've come to expect from Pixar, by using truth, heart and goofy supporting characters. The three triplets are the comic highlight of the film to be sure.And heart is where "Brave" wins points for Pixar yet again. The commitment to storytelling, even if we're talking basic fairy tale outline with this film in particular, results in plenty of emotional catharsis. Mothers and daughters should particularly be moved by the outcome and moral of this one. Once again, no revelations in terms of the take-home message, but it's such a relief when Merida finally has her epiphany and learns from her actions."Brave" receives all the humor, character, heart and visual detail of its Pixar brethren, but much of its achievements will get overlooked. The animation, for example, could be considered among the studio's finest, yet the story and characters are so engaging you forget about it aside from some sweeping landscape shots.Therefore, the bar set by Pixar is the biggest hurdle for "Brave." Innovation has always been the studio's norm, but the only real innovation in in the film is a major plot point that the marketing keeps close to the chest. This will lead some viewers to classify "Brave" as one of Pixar's "lesser" efforts, but wrongly so. "Brave" is everything you could want from a fairy tale and then some, but a fairy tale is a fairy tale.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
The political campaign system in America has done a good enough job  making a joke of itself that "The Campaign" as an idea for a comedy  either seems redundant  or perfect. With contemporary comedy staple  Will Ferrell going toe-to-toe for the first time with fast-rising star  Zach Galifianakis, there is no cap on the potential for hijinks both  absurd and sharp.  Although director Jay Roach has ample experience making films that deal  with political figures and subject matters, "The Campaign" leans toward  the absurd anyway. The film consists of a series of rapidly (and  ridiculously) escalating tactics between two candidates running for a  North Carolina U.S. congressional seat.  Ferrell stars as the incumbent, Cam Brady, who embodies all the  superficial fluff of a Southern politician, focused on keeping up  appearances and championing his three main platform points: America,  Jesus and freedom. Galifianakis plays Marty Huggins, a blissfully  quirky local tour guide and child of politics convinced to run for  office in the interest of the wealthy and influential Motch brothers  (John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd), who unbeknownst to anyone intend to  build a massive Chinese factory in the district.  "The Campaign" is not shy about making its jab at the corporate  interest-driven nature of the political machine. Chris Henchy ("The  Other Guys") and Shawn Harwell's ("Eastbound & Down") script goes for  the over-the-top, exaggerated approach to satire, imagining how far two  candidates would go to sabotage each other.   To be fair, "The Campaign" establishes that it's not going to play by  normal rules early on, in fact as early as an opening quote from Ross  Perot saying politics "has no rules." The whole story is also set in  motion after Brady leaves a salacious and vivid voicemail on the  answering machine of a young Christian family, a call intended for his  mistress.   In the real world, that would destroy any campaign, but this is just  the starting point for Brady. Later on, for example, but still early in  the film, he outdoes Anthony Weiner and Tweets his mistress a picture  of his genitals with his pubic hair groomed into a handlebar mustache  (we are spared the visual).  The film paints Huggins as the underdog you'll want to root for, at  least in the beginning. When he agrees to run, he immediately finds Tim  Wattley (Dylan McDermott, not Bryan Cranston's character on "Seinfeld")  in his house ready to run his campaign, starting with fixing his weak  image. For starters, he must get rid of Muffins and Pound Cake, his  "Chinese" pugs. Ultimately, it's Wattley who pushes Huggins to play  foul.  Huggins and Brady exchange blows in what feels like a collection of  "what are the worst things you could do while running for office?"  scenarios: adultery, punching babies, drunk driving  you name it. The  script assumes that the obvious end goal of winning the election is  enough to keep the stakes high, but that's not entirely true.  Still, Galifianakis and Ferrell are in top form, and the gags  themselves boast a certain degree of cleverness. The political campaign  context helps keep most everything fresh and original  there's no pain  induced by feeble attempts at scoring laughs.  As for being a smart satire, those thoughts are definitely built into  the script, but "The Campaign" ends up too far-fetched to be taken  seriously in that regard. It has been so far loosed from reality, and  even then, choosing to go after the manufactured, aesthetics-driven  nature of political campaigns isn't exactly making a bold statement.  Rather, it affirms the average politically jaded person's observations  on the whole process.  Revelatory socio-political commentary, however, should not be on the  list of expectations for an R-rated comedy starring these two buffoons.  The degree of absurdity is welcome, even if it ultimately weakens the  film's attempt at catharsis as Brady and Huggins stare down their  various moral indiscretions and must make some important choices.   Countering that, however, are enough personal moments littered  throughout to give these characters some sense of humanity. They are  somehow grounded enough, in spite of their actions, and are likable the  more you can detach who they are from what they do.   "The Campaign" succeeds less as a political comedy and more as a comedy  that uses politics as its vehicle. It cuts the legs out from under its  satire, but delivers on the crazy end of things to a satisfying degree.  ~Steven C
Movies that claim to be under the romantic comedy genre are supposed to be just that, a funny story that despite some conflicts along the way results the way everyone wants it to: happily ever after. "The Break-Up," partially written by and starring the silver screen's currently most trendy funnyman Vince Vaughn along with Jennifer Anniston, sells itself as a slightly funnier and less romantic formula-follower, but boldly takes up a path of its own by the end.The film comes right out of the starting gate with everything that is 'Vaughn comedy' and continues to do so for the majority of the film. Vaughn is at his best in this movie, with ramblings that surpass previous hit "Wedding Crashers" in wit and humor. While Anniston's character results in simply a sounding board for Vaughn's humor, she is at her best despite playing yet another victimized woman in a relationship not dissimilar to her role in "Bruce Almightly" in which she was also second to a male comedian in Jim Carrey. Together they assume the very clash of men and women in relationships, much different from the typical female-oriented romantic comedies, giving the movie a broader appeal and a chance to act as a milestone in the improvement and success of the guy-meets-girl romantic comedy, a genre waiting for its comeback since "Hitch" became the highest grossing movie of its kind.With Vaughn as the glue, the comedy sticks to a highly successful "Crashers"-esque formula bringing in a handful of quirky characters such as Jon Favreau as Vaughn's best friend, John Michael Higgins as Anniston's comfort zone-violating, in-the-closet brother, and even Vaughn's "Dodgeball" co-star Justin Long as Anniston's extremely feminine co-worker. Vaughn and Anniston continue go back and forth devising different schemes in attempt to make the other feel jealous enough to want the other back. The typical formula has this "war" being followed by some drama, which the film does, but unexpectedly takes a turn at the end. It seems as if Vaughn and his co-writers were simply uninterested in sticking to the norm, but wanted to use the norm to sell the movie, resulting in a less than impressive deviation that is simply too difficult to believe, leaving viewers frustrated and dissatisfied despite the films promising first hour or so. Perhaps someday a romantic comedy focusing on one guy and one girl will come along and outdo this movie, but it would be impressive for it to have all the right tools for success that "The Break-Up" has.
If you're reading this comment to decide if you should watch "The Godfather," then I truly have no comment to that. That would mean that the #1 of 250 ranking on the title page, the name "Francis Ford Coppola," the cast list including Marlon Brando, the "won Oscar for best picture" and the phrase "I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse" mean absolutely nothing to you.This is the greatest crime drama if not the greatest drama if not the greatest film of all time, so yes, it is worth your time. Then you need to watch "The Godfather: Part II."This is a deep, enriching and beautiful film in every sense of those words and will forever echo through cinematic history.Looking for any other sweeping statements? I could go on and on. You can't say anything bad about this film. You could say 175 minutes is too long, but if that's what it takes for a masterpiece, so be it.If it's not every bit of what I said it is, the canolli's on me.
I consider myself a Will Ferrell fan, although nothing since "Anchorman" has ever compared to it and I didn't even see "Blades of Glory" or "Semi-Pro." That aside, "Step Brothers" made me shocked that this was the same duo that made me laugh so hysterically in the past. Now I wouldn't call any of Ferrell and director/writer Adam McKay's collaborations "mature" by any means, but "Step Brothers" is a giant immaturity-seeking missile that really doesn't best utilize the humorous talents of its stars. Maybe the obscure insults and mythological references have gotten cold with me, but this film shows that this duo's work is out of gas.The premise is pretty much an excuse for immature humor, as two jobless, loser 40-year- olds move in with each other when their parents get married. From the get-go, stars Ferrell and his favorite cohort, John C. Reilly, stay committed to acting 10 years old the entire movie. No, they're not acting like 40-year-olds with 10 year-old tendencies, they're literally acting 10, just with fouler mouths. So, like all 10-year-olds, sometimes they're funny and sometimes they're annoying and stupid. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough consistently clever humor to excuse the dumb jokes at any point in time.I don't know how much was improvised or not, but the dialogue was pretty terrible. Either that or that humor has just gotten too stale. I definitely didn't expect this to be as good as Ferrell's best films, but it wasn't even close. I can quote most of those other movies, but I won't remember many lines from this one. I'll admit I laughed frequently during this film, but at it because it was dumb, not with it because it was clever.The rest of the cast was, as expected from anything Apatow produced, a broad range of crazy characters with their own quirks. The only guy I really liked was the father of Reilly's character, played by Richard Jenkins. He was able to pull off the two-faced nature of his character, being both goofy at times and really serious and uptight. The rest of the cast were actors getting a chance to climb up the Apatow ladder, none of whom stood out."Step Brothers" is pretty much ridiculous, enough to make me laugh, but not enough for me to say I actually liked it as a film. This is nothing more than a DVD rental for those who simply need a dose of shenanigans.
Though it would later be cemented when they re-teamed with George Roy HIll in 1973's "The Sting," Paul Newman and Robert Redford create one of the greatest film duos in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." You'd be hard pressed to find two names that lit up a marquis together like these two back in their day and its exactly what makes a film like "Butch Cassidy" go from good to timeless.No, the film wouldn't be nothing without them, but it's their over-masculine insults trying to mask their deep care for one another that makes them both funny and endearing, as does their care-free attitude about theft. Hill reflects all of this in his film and it makes it that much better.The movie follows its titular outlaws in the twilight of their infamous careers. Their reputation precedes them and their age, particularly Butch's, catches up with them. Throughout the film is a sense that times are changing and that they won't be able to keep robbing banks and trains forever, an appropriate and meaningful foreshadow that affects the film. Things stay good for part of the film, but eventually someone is on their trail and they're just as crafty. Butch and Sundance go on the run, unable to shake them off the trail.Newman brings his usual swagger to the role of Butch. He's clearly aging, but his idealism and vision for finding the next big job never fades, even when it gets him into trouble. Newman carries the perfect sense of humor and is never afraid to make Butch seem vulnerable, as legendary as he is. Redford is the skilled, more easily angered of the two, always keeping his logic handy. He's always quick to insult Butch but always quick to defend him. The unspoken bond between these two is strong and excellent.The cinematography in this film is top notch, especially in the beginning. Conrad L. Hall gives these men the mystique, makes each scene feel like a tall tale or a legend. It's really quite beautiful and the changes from sepia to living color sell this mood even more. Even more than the images, the choice of scoring this film is the most interesting and daring choice of all. Burt Bacharach provides an old saloon theme, a more positive tune as his only scoring and then writes the classic tune "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" to accompany a care-free montage. The music echoes not the danger and peril as would a typical Western score, but the joy and timelessness of the story. It seems strange at first, but it's the right choice given the film's themes.No one forgets a great on-screen tandem and that is Newman and Redford. There's an undeniable chemistry between them though they are both strong enough to star on their own. It's this duel alpha male butting of heads that makes them play off each other so well and ultimately not be a contest of upstaging. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
After completing the Dollars trilogy, one would come to expect Sergio Leone to have reached his peak with "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" just two years earlier, but he doesn't let up an inch with "Once Upon A Time in the West." The Italian-born filmmaker delivers once again the kind of western the genre will be remembered by.Then there's Ennio Morricone, Leone's longtime composer. He is the glue of "West" if not arguably all Leone's films. Assigning musical themes to each of the film's three main outlaws, he gives us something to truly remember the film by, something to cushion his intense close-ups and lengthy takes. What makes his work in "West" so special, however, is that it carries so much more weight. It's a living, breathing part of the script and it gives the conflict energy considering these characters don't say much, at least compared to Clint Eastwood's character in the Dollars trilogy. Although Morricone's "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" theme is his most memorable, that film has more to hang its hat on."West" is Leone's dream spaghetti western, an American western done in his style. Admiring Henry Fonda, he convinced Fonda to play one of his most unique roles as the outlaw Frank, a merciless killer employed by a railroad owner. Then he brings in Charles Bronson as the quiet but hardened Harmonica, who offers his help to the beautiful widow Jill McBain, whose husband and family were killed by Frank because their huge property stood in the way of railroad expansion.It's classic revenge-driven western, where every scene feels on the verge of something big. The use of the Techniscope when filming, which helped make "Ugly" a step above its predecessors, continues to serve Leone well for close-ups and various camera movements. Faces are so important in Leone's work and he has some excellent ones to work with such as the blue-eyed Fonda.Then there's the way this film quietly revolves around the railroad, the wheels of progress, the symbolism of movement -- all of which are inherently American while also making great material for Leone. One of the film's best scenes, for example, is when the third outlaw, Cheyenne (Jason Robards), who Harmonica enlists as help, takes out a bunch of guys on a moving train.But what this film keeps coming back to is the way Morricone's score tells this story, or as I've read, even dictates the story at points. Every time his music is at its fullest, electric guitar riffs and all, the film is just infused with this great power. Even when what's on screen doesn't completely say everything you need to know, this masterful score fills in the gaps. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
How does one put a Monty Python twist on a dystopian/Orwellian (whichever term you prefer) science-fiction fantasy? The answer might not be clear, but as long as Terry Gilliam knows it, it can be done. The "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" director begins his career of daring reality-bending films with "Brazil," maybe his greatest or if not most signature film.Named after the iconic song, "Brazil" is a quirky-spirited and outlandish futuristic film that operates subtly and with peculiarity as only Gilliam would have it. Unlike the more popular dystopian films of today, you can't rely on theme-heavy dialogue to understand Gilliam's warning to society, you have to sit and absorb the bizarre imagery, seemingly irrelevant dream sequences and comic downplay of dramatic events. Once you understand why it's there and stop worrying about exactly what it means, the genius becomes clearer.The film stars Jonathan Pryce as Sam Lowry, an unambitious bureaucrat who works for the Ministry of Information in a very mechanical society with an extensive yet inefficient process for bringing criminals, namely terrorists, to justice. Therefore, a small printing error leads to the unlawful arrest and death of Archibald Buttle, not Archibald 'T'uttle. Lowry must investigate the error and in the process comes across a woman (Kim Greist) whom he recognizes from his dreams where he's soaring in the air with wings toward a beautiful woman in white robes. He decides to pursue this woman and it leads him down a dangerous path.Gilliam introduces us to this society by showing its excessive yet seemingly unreliable technology. Sam's air conditioning breaks down, gourmet food is needlessly ground into globs and everything has a large and obtrusive cord attached to it. All this seems strange because its on the periphery of what's happening to Sam, so it can easily be dismissed as excessive detail. On the contrary, it's what quietly makes this Gilliam's masterpiece.The more human story is in Sam's pursuit of this dream in reality, a dangerous feat. Claiming early in the film that he wants nothing for himself, this woman is the only exception. He pursues it relentlessly and it costs him. As completely absurd as some of the events occurring to him appear to be, these trippy sequences ultimately test his character despite their strange tactics.Icing all this is the quirky Monty Python style. It's not the humor that lends itself to the film, but sort of the spirit of Monty Python. Even Michael Palin plays a small role to sort of perpetuate this feeling. Since everything goes mostly unexplained, this humor compounds the oddities of the film, poking fun at the excessiveness whether it be Sam's mother's face lifts and same surgeries that slowly kill her friend or playing up the dialogue between Sam and other characters such as Tuttle (De Niro) in the midst of an abnormal scenario."Brazil" might not be a science-fiction film for everyone, but it deserves classic status for lovers of the genre. It's just very untypical in its delivery, going for a hallucinogenic and more discomforting style of film-making that Terry Gilliam has made a name for himself on. It won't appease the average viewer who demands more direct service between him/herself and the creative mind behind the film, but it will offer a lot to ponder to those who like partaking in that when the credits role.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Watching Monty Python's "Life of Brian" is not blasphemy. In 1979, that might have been more reasonable. Let's just say that the penalty in today's society would be crucifixion and that back then it would have been something worse."Life of Brian" doesn't directly insult Judeo-Christian history, it just takes it extremely not seriously. The result is a satire not of specific religions, but of religious characteristics that apply to most of the world's religions: people being quick to believe, notions of what is sin, etc. It plays off a western sensibility, but it doesn't directly criticize Judeo-Christian religious practice. The incredible Monty Python cast delivers this in their typical sketch humor manner, though this film has much more continuity than 1975's "Holy Grail."Brian Cohen was born the same day as Jesus, but Jesus is separated from the film early on, so the film becomes about how Brian finds himself looking for something to believe in and eventual finds people strangely believing he is the messiah. He is a true protagonist in that the ridiculousness happens to him instead of the other way around. It is the rest of the cast in their multiple roles that surround his story with humor.The array of comedic characters are not nearly as diverse and memorable as "Holy Grail" and for that matter the film is not nearly as memorable or funny. The comedic elements are the same, but they are much more potent in "Grail." However, the plot line is much smoother, with the sketches fitting into the plot line instead of bouncing all over the place."Brian" is good as a satire, better than it is at being a comedy. While the film will still has the distinct look and feel of a Monty Python work, it doesn't go from hilarious scene to hilarious scene as one might expect if they've only seen "Grail." There's a lot of clever humor, but "Brian" is not nearly as out of the box as you'd like. But in terms of offensive, only if you take all discussion of religious ideas and history very seriously as the Monty Python crew quite literally turn the sacred into the profane.
It's not exactly new territory for Woody Allen, but "Hannah and Her Sisters" plays out in a much more compelling manner than his other films about quasi-pretentious intellectual 30- somethings living in New York City. For one thing, Allen takes himself a little bit more out of the picture than in the past. Once again he plays a neurotic hypochondriac working in show business, but his character is not central like it has been. There are a few story lines that are each compelling in their own way with no character at the center. Even the titular character Hannah (Mia Farrow) isn't central -- Allen's chosen her name for a much more compelling reason.The film centers on a family of show business talent. Hannah (Farrow) is the successful one despite her failed first marriage to Mickey (Allen) and the fact that unbeknownst to her, her current husband Elliot (Caine) is madly in love with her sister Lee (Hershey) who lives with a grumpy artist named Frederic. Then there's the third sister, Holly (Wiest), who can't seem to find success in love or her career. The interconnectedness of everything, the family element of seeing where everyone is at each year at the family Thanksgiving party makes "Hannah" one of Allen's better successes.It's not that it's new -- Allen continues to take shots at how over-dramatic his characters make their love lives when they're lucky that all they have to care about is art, opera, architecture, ee cummings' poetry and classical music. Still, it's so identifiable with the middle class because it's real. Allen's dialog is great and his cast really doesn't disappoint him at all in this film. There's also some dramatic storytelling. Having characters voice over their thoughts and contradict them with their actions really connects with everyone that wrestles with thoughts and emotions and their consequent actions. Allen doesn't have to get up close to the actors' facial expressions -- he can let the scene set itself nicely. To be truthful, "Hannah and Her Sisters" would make a great play.What's also nice about the film is it's not negatively spirited. Set to classical music and light jazz piano that typically plays the famous showtune "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered," the film has a very down-to-earth feel -- never over-dramatic with characters making drastic choices. That is for Allen's future work. This one sort of relishes in the ironies and paradoxes of life and love, how people change (and are allowed to) and can fight or cheat and still manage to find happiness and make it work without something outrageous.So it may not be Allen breaking new ground, but the narrative techniques make the message come across a bit stronger, make the relationships a bit more real and compelling. It's not "Annie Hall," but it's his next best thing.
Shane Acker's Oscar-nominated animated short "9" impressed on ingenuity and creative visuals. Its anthropomorphic googly-eyed burlap protagonist, 9, connectedly instant with the short's viewers and the wealth of imagination poured into his world and surroundings made it fascinating. With the help of numerous producers including "Wanted" director Timur Bekmambetov and legendary stop-motion filmmaker Tim Burton, Acker tries to expand his short -- and 9's universe -- into a full-length feature. "9" visually rises to the challenge of expansion, and at 80 minutes, the imagination packed in is maybe even more astounding than the short. Where Acker and writer Pamela Pettler struggle a little bit fleshing out their stitched-up characters. The post-apocalyptic world where machine has destroyed man works in the viewer's mind, but at 80 minutes we still feel like we barely tasted it, even if we really enjoyed what we were able to savor.The greatest addition to a once-silent animated short is the context. We learn 9 was created by a scientist and there were indeed 8 others before him. We don't really know their purpose, but they were created in the wake of a Terminator-style war between man and the machine. At the time of the story, 9 (voiced by Elijah Wood) has awoken and meets 2 (Martin Landau) who is taken away by a robotic beast along with a talisman 9 was carrying. Hiding from that beast are some others who are led by the elder 1 (Christopher Plummer), who believes hiding is all they can do. In an effort to save 2 and get answers about the talisman, 9 and 5 embark on a journey where they awaken the terrible machine that started it all.At this point it goes without saying that the visuals of "9" are absolutely stunning. Next to the last couple of Pixar films, the detail and artistic direction for the world of "9" are second to none. One can't help but realize the importance of animated storytelling when seeing what Acker does with visuals that just might never have been done with live action. The machines in particular and Acker's eye for exciting action make "9" watchable.But any post-apocalyptic story, particularly one with no humans in it, requires a lot thematic meaning. "9" never quite gets there with its array of seemingly lovable characters, not doing much to prove there's anything but stuffing and a few wires inside its sewn-together protagonists. The mythology going into this film is clearly extensive, but it just doesn't reflect it because minimal effort has gone into building relationships or themes of any kind. Friendship themes are barely communicated between 9 and 5. It seems all the attention went into expanding the universe, not building it around a theme. The commentary "9" offers on humanity comes too little too late."9" is a good start for imaginative animated film-making and an even better story as a film. It's nice to see UCLA student's culminating project get looked at by influential filmmakers such as Burton and allow the undeniably creative mind of Acker and his team to make a film few producers would likely let him on a mere pitch. Animation can be for an older audience too, and that's important.~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.com
Calling "Boyhood" "unlike anything you've ever seen" is stating the obvious, yet there is almost no other way to describe it in as many words. Making a film over the course of 12 years with the same cast, Richard Linklater has transformed everything we know about filmmaking, in some ways challenging the very definition of "film." It sounds simple: tell the story of a boy growing up in close to real time by filming him every year of his life instead of having him play a younger version of himself or casting another actor in the role. But "Boyhood" accomplishes so much more than the mere use of an edgy approach to storytelling. It turns out that watching a character grow up on screen has a radical effect on how we perceive the character, how we relate to him and how we connect to him. It's a completely different experience for the viewer.As such, Ellar Coltrane has the coolest keepsake/chronicle of his childhood anyone could ever ask for as the star of this movie. He plays Mason, ages 5 through 18, who along with his big sister (Lorelei Linklater, Richard's daughter) lives in Texas with his mom (Patricia Arquette) and occasionally visits with his dad (Ethan Hawke). The film chronicles his growing pains and formative experiences, from trouble with his stepfathers to life transitions to adventures with his dad."Boyhood" is easily the closest that fiction has ever come to cinema verite. It often feels similar to watching a documentary. Linklater tells the story in chronological order, unlocking the true potential of his film in doing so because jumping back and forth would have given off the appearance of significantly more editorial control, damaging the powerful realism of the project.What makes "Boyhood" more than just a really successful filmmaking "gimmick," however, is the power of its nostalgia and the universality of Mason's experience. Linklater didn't just pick a random kid and film his life; he crafted this story. The film's realism, the fact that it reflects pieces of our own life experiences back at us, is not a byproduct of this storytelling technique, but by Linklater's own design. Not just any director could've undertaken this project and achieved the same poignant result. His filmmaking experience ("Dazed and Confused," "Before Sunrise" and its sequels, and "Bernie") shows he has a real knack for playing with time and realism in his films.This in mind, Linklater's prowess as an editor really shines in "Boyhood." When you endeavor to make a film over the course of 12 years, you can't possibly know what you will need in the final every last piece of footage has been collected. Making sure at the time of filming that he had the right amount of footage to choose from later on and being able to tell one story from disjointed periods of filming takes the keenest of skill.A lot of the brilliance of the film is how past and future Richard Linklater work together. Past Linklater, the man behind the camera each of those years, understood the value of capturing footage that would put a distinctive time stamp on each year of filming. Future Linklater, the editor piecing the entire film together, used the powers of hindsight to sort through this footage and include scenes or bits of dialogue that add powerful nostalgia to the movie.For example, a short, wordless scene shows younger Mason, Samantha and their step-siblings at the midnight book release of "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" in July 2005. Linklater soaks up the entire ambiance of this moment, which has nothing to do with the plot, and then however many years later, edits it into the movie in such a way that the millions who felt connected to those books when they were first released feel an instant, deep connection to it watching the film. He captured a collective cultural memory as it was happening and weaved it into the greater story of one child's life, not unlike the way we experience these moments in our own life. They happen once and they become memories. Similarly, Hawke's character is very politically outspoken, so we get treated to his thoughts at the end of the Bush presidency and the beginning of Obama's, reminding us of public sentiment during these years.The fascination with watching years of our lives in the form of Mason's play out in just hours is the film's hook, which allows the story flexibility to be more true-to-life. As moviegoers, we are conditioned to wait for the other shoe to drop, the scene of heightened melodramatic tension  there's almost none of it. The ratio of actual drama in our own lives to actual drama that happens in this film is virtually the same. Hawke's character, for example, isn't the deadbeat dad stereotype who comes back to cause problems for Mason and his family. He's more complex and less predictable. There's no full-circle effect in this movie or plot twist of thematic significance, just a straight linear story of how things change (or don't) with time with a few meaningful reflections at the end.Most films need those plot devices to be interesting. "Boyhood" doesn't. That's what makes it so unique, like dictionary definition of unique a.k.a. purely in a category of its own. Filmmakers could imitate this concept, but they probably would struggle to reach the same degree of authenticity, to have both the foresight and the hindsight, the ability to plan ahead and be flexible, to make a cohesive product. So Linklater didn't just make a cool film, ground-breaking film; he has transcended the very notion of what filmmaking can be.~Steven C Thanks for reading!
Car chases, gun fights, slow motion, a protagonist with exceptional yet hidden assassination talents, Angelina Jolie's bare backside and Morgan Freeman as a wise leader figure. Let's just say that "Wanted" has all the bases covered when it comes to building an action movie. Hard to argue with that formula and to be honest, what you see is what you get. This movie is action, action, and more action that's been injected with steroids. If you want substance outside of the overdone "choose your own destiny" theme, look elsewhere. Seriously."Wanted" stars James McAvoy in his first blockbuster-style movie as Welsey Gibson, an ordinary loser accountant that hates his life until he's magically whirlwinded into learning his father was the greatest assassin ever and that he too has those abilities. Wesley of course learns from the best, Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie as he assumes what he comes to believe as his destiny.This film walks a fine line between borrowed concepts and clichés from action movie secret society stories. At times you get the sense you're watching something you've never seen before and yet you get this feeling that it's all incredibly familiar. For example, there are some really awesome, unique scenes, particularly the car sequences and then there are overdone slow motion techniques that first-time director of an American film Timur Bekmambetov uses. As a result, the film bounces back and forth from cool and engaging to overdone and over-stimulating. So, when the film spits this edgy narrative and flashy style at you, you either say "awesome" or "seriously?"It's easy to say this film is fun. Cool is a bit more risky because it tries to be a bit too much and usually cool films don't try to act too cool. It's for sure entertaining and a good kill of a couple hours, which is all you need from a film sometimes. There are a lot worse action films out there that won't keep your attention but this one does. Somehow, you still are interested in these characters, even if they're a bit hollow. Gotta give "Wanted" credit though. Nowadays, you don't usually see "all-formula, all the time" films come out and get solid reviews. It's really good at recycling and putting twists on familiar concepts and making them appear a bit more fresh. "Wanted" knows which cards to get and how to play them right, that's for sure.
It's never easy to follow up brilliance. After suddenly rocketing to notoriety, Quentin Tarantino was left with an inevitable task: make a movie after "Pulp Fiction." His choice came in the form of "Jackie Brown," the story of an airline stewardess (saying "flight attendant" would not gel with the vibe of this film) caught between an arms dealer and the law and hoping to pit them against each other in order to walk away with a half a million dollars.Despite an abundance of a badass trash-talking Samuel L. Jackson, "Jackie Brown" doesn't have the same growl as "Pulp Fiction," but the comparison only exists beyond that because they're crime dramas made within three years of each other."Jackie Brown" has a distinctly more retro '70s vibe than "Pulp Fiction" as well. Tarantino paints Jackie (Pam Grier) as a tough-as-nails woman who can stick up for herself in a man's world, but that doesn't make it any easier for her. This "Charlie's Angels"-style feminism in addition to music choices and title sequences intend to make "Jackie Brown" kick old-school ass. It doesn't run all that deep, but it certainly keeps Tarantino's signature nice and shiny.The film feels an awful lot like a foul-mouthed version of a Coen brothers film in that small- time characters put themselves way in over their heads. The core relationship in the film exists between Jackie and Max Cherry (Robert Forster in an Oscar-nominated role). Max is enamored with Jackie, perhaps for her sheer courageousness and fierce independence. As a bail bondsman, we expect him to remain peripheral to the story, but after picking up Jackie from prison for the first time, he becomes more and more intertwined in the conflict, putting his life on the line frequently. Without his pure admiration and sympathy, Jackie would never have been able to consider pulling off the "sting." Although neither of them are morally commendable protagonists, there's still a sense of who deserves what.The Jackson storyline with Robert De Niro in an unusual character role keeps the film stylistically akin to a Tarantino script. Jackson is the same no-nonsense character from "Pulp Fiction" only without the temper. He presents a world of trouble for Jackie, albeit one she got herself into. De Niro is out of place, probably because its weird to see him play second fiddle for an entire film. Together they set the mood and allow for the Tarantino dialogue to shine through."Jackie Brown" comes across as lighter Tarantino fare  except in terms of appropriate language. The story here retains an admirable simplicity, but nothing strong enough to crawl out of the shadow of "Pulp Fiction," at least not at the time, hence its reputation of being the "underrated" Tarantino film. With particularly strong characters that we like despite their moral behavior, "Jackie Brown" rates as a unique retro crime drama.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
If one were taking a course on how to appropriately adapt a novel for the big screen, "Atonement' would certainly need to be among the required materials. Though I personally have never read McEwan's novel, the attention to detail that Joe Wright and his team bring to telling this story visually is superb."Atonement" is the story of a young girl named Briony (played well by three actresses at different ages of her life) with a very incurable appetite and curiosity for plot and drama, enough so that she tells a lie that separates her sister Cecilia (Knightley) from her newly discovered love of Robbie (McAvoy), the son of their mansion's grounds keeper. The rest of the film is the consequences of Briony's actions and her struggle to forgive herself for what she did. The acting is top notch, but not as deserving of accolades as the production crew and the minds behind the cinematic telling of this story. The art direction and Wright's choices are simple and beautiful and most notably is Dario Marianelli's original score that is both creative and effective, particularly in the beginning and end of the film.The only thing holding "Atonement" back is the middle of the film, which lacks attention- grabbing substance. The symbolism is all over the place, but the plot lacks a distinct something during the point in which Robbie and Cecilia are separated to really grip the viewer as the film's wonderful ending reveals itself. I can't believe that I would be the only one who really needed more convincing of the love and passion between them.That said, the story is still Briony's story at heart, hence the film's title, and her story is told with brilliance. Unfortunately, the aforementioned middle part keeps her out of the story for a significant amount of time. The film, therefore, requires patience and really keen eye for the the subtlety that makes a film more than just a story told with a camera.
If you need proof that an action super spy franchise can handle a through plot line/sequel, "The Bourne Supremacy" is it. It is a very true follow-up to 2002's "Bourne Identity." There is no re-imagining done by new director Paul Greengrass. In fact, he makes Bourne even better. The action is grittier and more realistic and the pacing just as intense and engaging despite a story that is a little more complex, being more wrapped up in Bourne's past than the first installment.At the beginning of the film, Bourne (Damon) is in India with his love interest Marie (Potente), thinking that the CIA program Treadstone that turned him into a super-assassin is officially old business and going to let him be. Well, they don't. In addition to someone coming to kill him, It turns out Bourne is set up for destroying a separate CIA operation in Berlin, so once again he's a wanted man. This time, the casting directors throw in another gem in Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, who heads up this mission to find Bourne. She's joined again by Brian Cox as Abbott, presumably the only person in the CIA left who knows anything about Treadstone. Julia Stiles also reprises her role in the film.Bourne is motivated by anger and the drive to figure out more of his past (due to the amnesia he suffered at the beginning of "Identity"). He has fuzzy flashbacks that allude to his very first mission as an assassin. Of course it takes him all over the world and he's chased by police in about 3 different countries. "Supermacy" is loaded with car chases as its primary action sequences, all of which are done in style by Greengrass, who took the director's chair from Doug Liman, who moved to producer for this film. Greengrass uses a lot more cuts and hand-held camera-work to up the intensity of the scenes.The film really works as both a sequel and its own plot. Knowledge of "Identity" is only necessary in this film if you want a better understanding of Bourne's character and parts of his motivation. It certainly does make "Supremacy" better but isn't a must to enjoy and understand the film as well as how awesome of a protagonist Jason Bourne is. Tony Gilroy, who worked on the "Identity" screenplay, makes sure this story functions on all these levels. Damon also continues to give a performance that capture's Bourne's fragility despite his stone-cold action persona.While it's more of a continuation, another episode in the Bourne journey, it really does function well as a whole, stopping you from demanding more answers about Bourne's past. It also shows that clearly Bourne is the dominant movie action hero of the decade
When Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody struck gold with "Juno" in 2007, they did so with a rare combination of contemporary wit, quirkiness and heart. Their four-year reunion in "Young Adult" won't be nearly as heralded, but it might arguably be a better film. Although ironic when juxtaposed with its main character, a 37-year-old who hasn't gotten over her high school sweetheart, Reitman and Cody display obvious evidence of maturation. The subject and humor are decidedly darker, and the emotional energy more raw and challenging. Charlize Theron stars as Mavis Gary, perhaps one of film's most hopelessly pathetic protagonists. Before giving the opening credit sequence its cue, Reitman puts Theron to work and paints a clear picture of spiraling drunken loneliness, reality TV and apathy toward responsibility. Appropriately, she's a young-adult fiction writer for a dwindling book series who's also a former prom queen. Theron is perfect for the role with her combination of in- concealable beauty and dramatic prowess. Mavis never becomes a caricature under her watch.Unable to get past the fact that her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) just had a baby, Mavis flees her depressing cyclical lifestyle in Minneapolis for her home town of Mercury, Minn. with the intention of winning him back.Mavis' delusional and deceitful quest to be a home-wrecker proves maddening through much of the film at the slow-burn pace Reitman has dictated, and it becomes obvious that at some point the bubble on her misguided journey will burst into an ugly mess. Yet despite this foreseeable direction, the climax proves stirring and not without a set of surprises.Adding to the complexity of Mavis reclaiming her past is Matt (Patton Oswalt), a former classmate she barely noticed because they were miles apart on the social spectrum. The two bond over their appreciation for (or dependency on) bourbon, and their relationship allows Theron's character a chance to blow off steam, albeit irresponsibly. Mavis eventually remembers Matt as the "hate crime kid" because he was brutally beaten to the point of being disabled in high school at the hands of some jocks who thought he was gay. He serves as a strong comparison point for Mavis' high school experience throughout the film. Oswalt's wit also matches well with Cody's style and Matt actually turns into one of the better depictions of a disabled character probably ever. Other than the incident that caused it, we're not asked to sympathize excessively with his condition, nor do Mavis' snarky remarks about it come across as rude. Cody's dialogue is much more restrained this time around; "Juno" is eons funnier as a result, but the sacrifice of laughs allows us to focus on the film as a character study of a woman who hasn't quite learned how to be an adult. The script's only deficiency comes from a crater- sized hole in Mavis' history. "Young Adult" deserves praise for being a film about living in the past that contains not a single flashback, but knowing more about Mavis' divorce and how she came to break up with Buddy the first time could have significantly informed the story, especially as to why Mavis willfully lives her life as the trainwreck it clearly is.The film's climax helps a bit in this regard, and Mavis' epiphany avoids being cliché despite the obvious "appreciate what you have" motif. Part of the message oddly suggests that small- town folks lead purposeless lives for the sake of achieving some kind of blissful stasis, but at the same time the idea that all of us are broken people that need to affirm and trudge forward  not backward  with our various blemishes, will surely resonate.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com
Most movies don't know how to handle cancer. Heck, most people don't know how to handle cancer  and I'm not talking about the patients. Cancer, or any other terminal illness for that matter, almost always plays some kind x-factor in a film  that is when a film even dares to enter a realm often deemed depressing and "not for the movies." Most often, scripts will position cancer as a tearjerking emotional turning point in a film or as the initial spark of some banal "live life to the fullest" comedy."50/50" puts an end to that. Written semi-autobiographically by cancer survivor Will Reiser, it would seem it takes one to write one. Although cancer drives the entire story, the story doesn't fixate on cancer or melodramatize the terrible truths we already know about potentially fatal illness. Perhaps you could tell as much from the trailer thanks to some typical Seth Rogen antics, but the injection of contemporary R-rated humor is neither irreverent, insensitive nor an attempt to simply put a positive spin on a depressing subject. Life  believe it or not  doesn't stop for cancer. People don't sit in the hospital the entire time and then lie at home in bed the rest. Reiser's story provides a mostly unforced and honest depiction of a young man's diagnosis and treatment for potentially fatal spinal cancer, one where cancer isn't the conflict in and of itself, but the way it so dramatically changes the behavior of the people whose lives it enters and positively and negatively alters relationships.Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues his spree of playing absolutely lovable main characters as Adam, a play-it-safe 27-year-old who after the initial shock handles his diagnosis in stride, keeping his ups and downs internal other than when the script cues him to let it out a bit. The more external symptoms come from Adam's girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) and mother (Anjelica Huston).Other than focusing on these relationships, director Jonathan Levine ("The Wackness") puts particular emphasis on character perspective, which will change instantaneously at points throughout the film. In one terrific sequence, Adam enters the hospital for his first chemo treatment and gets bummed out by all the sick and ailing people in the hallway. After the older men he meets while getting treatment (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) give him some marijuana-filled pastries, he leaves down the same hallway high as a kite, suddenly elated despite the same negative images lining the hall. Levine understands that so much of how you deal with cancer relates to mood and perspective at any given time.Levine coaxes brilliant and thoughtful performances out of his actors. Even though Rogen exerted his usual shtick a bit more than needed, he handles his character as written, someone who wants desperately to help his best friend but hides behind shallow self-centered form of support that many men turn to because they can't communicate emotions all that well.The women of "50/50" also deliver if not more so. Howard's character is an unlikable mess but she gives her performance convincingly. Anjelica Huston perfects the ideal on-screen mother, the best since Melissa Leo's Oscar-winning mother in "The Fighter." Anna Kendrick also continues to blow me away with her talent. She plays a psychiatrist working on her PhD who receives Adam as just her third patient. She gives such lifelike quirks to her characters and Katie plays right to her strengths.But in a drama/comedy about cancer, the key lies in tone and for that Levine should become an A-list director. "50/50" could have easily turned into a Hollywood hack-job like the various comic-toned cancer films before it, a film that either overplays the dramatic or overcompensates with the humorous, but "50/50" might be one of film's best balancing acts between the two. The shifts feel completely natural between moments of deep sentiment and moments of levity. Those who can't help but fixate on this being a movie about cancer will likely have to remind themselves to feel serious when "50/50" just wants you to simply absorb it as you would any other film.Other than some predictable moments and plot devices to give the film a nicer Hollywood sheen, "50/50" provides a genuine and heartfelt movie experience, one that neither goes for the emotional sucker punch nor the sugarcoated version. Instead of making us look at cancer in a specific way, it makes us look at the way we look at cancer  or any uncomfortable subject  the way we talk about it or don't talk about it, the way we interact with those who live with it and the way we cope with it ourselves. That way when someone we love has a serious problem, we can ultimately do what's best for that person.~Steven CVisit my site, moviemusereviews.com!
Eagerly we have awaited Neill Blomkamp's follow-up to "District 9," which gave audiences an almost unrivaled combination of entertainment, mystery, emotion and intelligence. The bar was understandably high for "Elysium," an even glossier film with bigger stars and a higher concept with higher stakes.Matt Damon stars as Max, an Earthbound factory worker who has dreamed of going to the space habitat Elysium his entire life. All the poor live on a pollution-ravaged Earth, while the rich all bolted for Elysium, where they've developed the ability to cure all illness. Understandably, Earth is full of people desperate to break into Elysium and steal back both life and hope. Max becomes among the most desperate when a factory accident leaves him with five days to live."Elysium" and "District 9" have a lot in common and warrant a comparison. Foremost, Blomkamp proves beyond a doubt with this film that his imagination when it comes to science fiction, especially high-tech weapons, has no rival in Hollywood. What he and his creative team have dreamt up in this film, from the exoskeleton armor to the countless guns, will make any geek squeal with joy.The juxtaposition of futuristic imagery with dirty, crusty, rugged imagery is another trait Blomkamp's two films share. He's clearly fascinated with the war of the classes, which is the main theme of "Elysium" in particular. The wealthy characters in power, such as Elysium's defense secretary (Jodie Foster) and the tech mogul who supplies Elysium and Earth with all its robotic law enforcement (William Fichtner), are portrayed as downright despicable, greedy and malicious. Interestingly, Max isn't inherently good. His past record isn't so clean, for one. Yet we're persuaded quite strongly to hate this dystopian world and want to see Max succeed.The scope is much wider and stakes much higher in "Elysium" than in "District 9," which already presents a challenge in terms of minimizing plot holes and becoming invested in the characters. Plus, the story follows a much more typical formula; there's little doubt as to how it will end, so the mystery element is not as strong. "Elysium" excels more in the realm of entertainment and creativity, with action sequences playing out like an awesome video game. Kruger (Sharlto Copley), for example, a sleeper agent being illegally utilized by Foster's character, plays a frightening badass of a villain, the kind that will make you a little nervous when you reach the boss level. Damon makes for as good a lead as you could ask for in his most physical role outside the "Bourne" series. Desperation to survive guides Max, who to begin the film has the worst day ever, but he's remarkably poised, which helps balance the character out. And Blomkamp is careful to give him a soul through use of flashbacks and symbolism, even if that emotional hook only sinks so deep because he has to wedge it in there amidst the busy plot. "Elysium" is definitely more fun to look at than it is to think about, though the effort on the intellectual side was probably worth it to avoid the film from being too hollow. Blomkamp shoots a bit too high with his second film, trying to stay true to the intelligent spirit of "District 9" while moving in the direction of a full-on blockbuster. Only Christopher Nolan has done that successfully to this point with "Inception." so it's not exactly easy territory. Thankfully, "Elysium" has plenty to dazzle audience with in the event that it wasn't as stimulating for other parts of the brain. Blomkamp has the kind of vision that's on par with today's great directors and he might be the most detail-oriented of all of them. He will continue to make entertaining films because of it and occasionally write something or come across a script worthy of his imagination. "Elysium" is not a blemish on his slow-building resume, but when all is said and done, hopefully it can be considered a better-than-average learning moment in a fantastic career.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Tom Hanks, it's good to have you in the captain's chair. The two-time Oscar winner hadn't quite found his footing since turning 50, but "Captain Phillips" proves that with the right role, there aren't many actors you'd rather have playing the good guy. This titular role lets Hanks' average joe qualities shine, not to mention his strength of presence and demeanor.Captain Richard Phillips is a cargo freighter captain with a no-nonsense attitude. While maneuvering the Maersk Alabama down the coast of Africa, two small boats of Somali pirates show up on radar, and despite everything Phillips does to shake them, one of the boats, led by the utterly determined Muse (Barkhad Abdi), manages to get on board.Seeing as it's based on a real-life 2009 hijacking, "Phillips" could have no better director than Paul Greengrass. Here's a filmmaker that made "United 93" an emotional, captivating and suspenseful at a time when everyone felt a September 11 movie was too soon. Again, Greengrass brings that palm-sweating play-by-play account that keeps the audience on edge despite a known outcome. Even if you don't know how the story ends, you know the ship gets boarded from the trailers, and even that first set of sequences remains totally gripping. And it's real-life suspense; very little of what Greengrass does manufactures tension in a Hollywood-like way.Billy Ray's adaptation of the real Phillips' book also doesn't overstep at all. There are a couple Hollywood moments, and some scenes in which Hanks and Abdi frame the events with some food-for-thought dialogue, but "Captain Phillips" feels especially down to earth. Even the way the film depicts the Navy doesn't glorify what they do very much.Narratively, "Phillips" is a straight line with an upward trajectory and maybe two lulls in the tension. There is no trickery or plot twists, but we remain blind to just how the events will unfold, analyzing who has the leverage in this hostage crisis at every turn. So simple and straightforward, yet so captivating.Hanks does in fact give his best performance in years, though the role is tailored perfectly to his strengths. Phillips is an unsung hero who with courage and resolve attempts to do whatever he can to manage the situation, including making some risky, dumb moves. He doesn't just flip his bravery switch and he flinches time to time. Hanks does this kind of humanity effortlessly."Captain Phillips" sticks mostly to a suspenseful retelling, but Ray's script doesn't lose sight of the value of this story. Most films of this nature are content to leave the "foreign aggressors" faceless and nameless, but their conflict, their objectives, their feelings are a significant part of the film. This isn't a piracy situation for the sake of an entertaining plot, there is a motive here; real Somalis did this because it's what they felt they had to do.Rarely do non-fiction and suspenseful entertainment cross paths, yet Greengrass usually finds them both in his crosshairs. "Captain Phillips" proves once more that history and current events don't have to be boring while giving Hanks the vehicle he deserved.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
The latest modern film to play swords-and-sandals dress-up is "The Eagle," starring Channing "Pretty Boy" Tatum, a name I bestowed upon him having played "Pretty Boy" Floyd in Michael Mann's "Public Enemies" back in 2008, albeit a part of no significance. I suppose when they coined the term "hunk," no one expected it to apply so literally to the thick and broad-shouldered 30-year-old.Tatum plays Marcus Flavius-Flave Aquila (okay, just Flavius), Roman centurion and son of a disgraced commander who disappeared along with the entire Ninth Legion and Rome's beloved eagle standard in the north of Britain in 120 AD. Fast forward 20 years and son has chosen to be posted in Britain in hopes of gaining back his, his father and Rome's honor by discovering the fate of the legion and recovering the eagle. For Tatum, this trip into dangerous territory beyond Hadrian's Wall, as it turns out, is also a test of leading man meddle.Heading up the real American heroes of "G.I. Joe" doesn't exactly count for star capability, and while "The Eagle" barely holds a candle to the Roman epic of all Roman epics that is "Gladiator," it certainly can be seen as a more serious step and one in which the target audience has no interest in ogling him -- just watching him kill rebellious "Seal Men," (precursors to Scots).Tatum's grades are definitely passing, but he earns more sympathy than attention. He's not quite a commanding presence, but Jeremy Brock's script doesn't exactly show us anything about him other than he feels disgraced and he's a good soldier. Flashbacks and dreams about his father riding off never to be seen again are hardly adequate ways to build a hero who can rally our spirits. He can throw down with the best of them, but he's better stoic.For the most part, "The Eagle" follows suit. Kevin Macdonald, a versatile and underrated director who has an Academy Award for Best Documentary and also directed Forest Whitaker to his "Last King of Scotland" Oscar, keeps the action moving and more old school -- old school being the days before CGI. The fight in the beginning all the way to the journey beyond the wall and the perils he faces excite and hold attention. For an epic film that places honor and friendship at the center, the stakes just never feel high enough. You'll make an investment in hoping for a peaceful ending, but nothing stirs beyond that.The film tries to create several dynamics such as Marcus' daddy issues and the relationship between Marcus and Esca (Jamie Bell), his servant whose life he saved, who over the wall could betray him at any moment, but little doubt seeps in. After all, while Esca's a tough and resilient guy, he was once Billy Elliot -- he's probably not screwing anyone over. Actually, Bell's performance hurts Tatum's when all is said and done; he's much more unpredictable.Roman history nuts will find little to enjoy from that perspective with "The Eagle" as political undertones are practically non-existent and you have Americans playing Romans and Brits playing savage Brits. Brock's script sticks to the action and compelling events, using a historical period to create a tone, much in the way "300" did. Appropriately adjusting expectations for "The Eagle" to this level will help it retain the honor it deserves for capturing 120 minutes worth of interest with eventful action sequences.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Need for Speed is a great movie with a very enjoyable storyline and a very talented cast.The story is certainly nothing new or original,and the trailers don't make it seem like its going to be any different to the Fast and Furious movies but it is very enjoyable and dosen't feel like a carbon copy of previous car related films.What made this movie for me was its extremely confident cast,I am a huge fan of Aaron Paul,because of Breaking Bad of course,and I didn't think he would be able to deliver the same level of great acting as he does in Breaking Bad,but,while Tobey Marshall is certainly not Jesse Pinkman,he still delivers an outstanding performance,he clearly has a great movie career ahead of him and this is his first film since Breaking Bad finished,and there's no doubt he has more great performances ahead of him.I also really enjoyed Imogen Potts and Dominic Copper's performance,these are two actors I've heard of,but haven't seen in anything previously,but after seeing them in this I look forward to seeing them in more films.After he is let out of prison,Tobey Marshall sets out to seek revenge against the man who framed him for the death of his friend.
Few franchises truly get better with age, but the "Bond" series most certainly did in its first three films. The third film adventure based on Ian Fleming's now internationally beloved character, titled "Goldfinger," introduced a number of franchise hallmarks (the Aston Martin chief among them) and holds up as an exciting, suspenseful and colorful spy film.Sean Connery returns to the role and as dashing as ever. The film's opening sequence takes place on a prior mission unrelated to the rest of the film, but showcases 007 sneaking about, setting off explosions, chasing a beautiful woman, taking off a wetsuit to reveal a white tuxedo and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Does it get much better?A number of new elements keep Bond fresh yet again in "Goldfinger." Guy Hamilton, who replaces Terence Young ("Dr. No," "From Russia with Love") as director, demonstrates an exceptional understanding of what makes Bond tick; the script makes some unexpected deviations from the pattern to up the stakes; Shirley Bassey's gutsy theme song sets the bar for music in the series and Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) marks the first great "Bond" villain."Goldfinger" sees Bond tracking this title villain across the globe. In Miami, he learns quickly that Goldfinger isn't messing around, and after a debriefing from MI6 and a rundown of his gadget-loaded new set of wheels from Q (Desmond Llewelyn), he follows him from London to Switzerland and ultimately to Kentucky, where Goldfinger plans to lay siege to Ft. Knox. It's not all that simple, however, as we become slowly aware of what Goldfinger is really up to.Interestingly, Auric Goldfinger has no connection to SPECTRE despite the first two films involving the secret organization. Instead, Goldfinger is motivated by greed. He loves to win and he wants to do whatever it takes to get wealthier and wealthier. Bond also gets particularly close to Goldfinger, a trait that becomes increasingly common with the "Bond" films going forward. We get to know him much more as a character than either of the previous main villains.The girls of "Goldfinger" play a different role than in the past films. There's still that trademark '60s misogyny, but Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), in spite of her character name, is her own woman: a pilot (and the oldest actress to play a "Bond" girl) who works for the enemy. Sure, she gives in to Bond's charms too easily, but that's the franchise for you. She's at least more than a piece of young, foreign meat, which Ursula Andress and Daniela Bianchi were.Between the souped-up Aston Martin and the first ever use of a laser on film, "Goldfinger" offered a lot of novelty, which shouldn't be too much of a surprise given the film's substantially larger budget. Still, it's the way these flashy elements are utilized effectively that makes "Goldfinger" a timeless action film.The secret weapon of this film is definitely Harold Sakata, Goldfinger's formidable personal assistant, Oddjob. A silent, short and stocky Polynesian (the character is supposed to be Korean) with a deadly bowler hat, he's one of the most original evil henchmen in film history.Firing on all cylinders would be an accurate way to describe "Goldfinger." Every element that you look for in a "Bond" film can be found and in top form in just this third movie in the franchise. It could well be that that's because "Goldfinger" set that standard and all the films have tried to live up ever since, but even so, it takes a great deal to craft a film that forges such iconic cinema.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Young adult sci-fi adaptations have run rampant since "The Hunger Games," and "The Maze Runner" is the latest attempt to copy that model and hook the same audience. James Dashner's tale of young boys trapped in a glade surrounded by a giant maze is much simpler than "Hunger Games," so while it can't achieve anywhere near the kind of character depth, it certainly has a chance to be as entertaining.Viewers are advised to look to "Maze Runner" for a fun, sci-fi themed, mystery-driven movie. Director Wes Ball gets the most out of it in this sense; he knows how to use the camera to add intensity to a story. He will undoubtedly go on to make more good action movies. As for building the emotional connection, however, it's almost entirely absent, though a lot of this can be attributed to the script, which favors plot points over character-building moments.To be fair, there's a lot of explaining required in "Maze Runner" as with much of the futuristic sci-fi bestsellers. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) awakens in an elevator shaft that takes him to the Glade, where he's greeted by an entire village of boys who live surrounded by a mysterious maze. All of them arrived just as he did, with no knowledge of anything that happened to them before they got there, but they believe they need to find a way out. Especially curious, Thomas starts a chain reaction of events that lead to some answers.Although Thomas spends a lot of screen time with each of the boys he meets in the Glade  including Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster of "Game of Thrones"), Gally (Will Poulter), Alby (Aml Ameen), Chuck (Blake Cooper), Minho (Ki Hong Lee) and eventually a girl, Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), whose arrival really shakes things up  they mostly talk about the plot together, or explain things to the audience about the maze or any of the mysteries surrounding it. The few character-building moments are really wedged in. O'Brien is perfectly likable as Thomas, as are most of the others, but "Maze Runner" clearly leans on its premise and entertainment value.That's okay, because it has enough of an intriguing mystery, enough creative art direction and enough of a dark and creepy factor to pass muster with folks over the age of 18. Those who haven't read the entire series will likely find a less-than-satisfying ending, but these stories are written in threes these days (with the third part split in half, of course). Fans of the books will be a bit surprised by some of the changes, but ultimately should feel the story stays true to the spirit of Dashner's books.Thanks for reading! Visit my site for more ~Steven C
You'd think putting together an action ensemble of some of the best muscle-bound men to ever grace the silver screen warrants an effort that goes beyond casting, but that's not what we got in 2010's "The Expendables." The healthy dose of blood spatter and explosions certainly whetted action fans' appetites, but the film ultimately fell short on a number of fronts.Well, it seems that Stallone and co. heard the criticism, and so it's a relief to say that "The Expendables 2" is a distinct improvement and in the simplest way  giving us a story worth a damn.The two big improvements are so fundamental it's hard to understand just why they were ignored the first time around: a formidable villain and a purer motivation for ass-kicking. In scouting other action stars of the past to join the fray for the sequel, bravo to whoever's bright idea it was to not just add them to the list of heroes. Jean Claude Van Damme makes a perfect villain just merely by the esteem in which he's held in action fans' eyes. All that needs to be said about his performance is there are roundhouse kicks.As for the motivation piece, it's as simple as revenge. Although Church (Bruce Willis) starts the plot going by telling Barney Ross (Stallone) that he owes him, the mission morphs into one of avenging a fallen comrade, and it's done tastefully enough that we actually care.From an action perspective, "The Expendables 2" opens with a James Bond-esque pre-credits scene on steroids. The mission in this opening has nothing to do with the rest of the film, but grabs our attention instantly in addition to being all kinds of fun. Director Simon West, who takes the reigns from Stallone in the first film, uses this scene to set the tone early: You will get blood, explosions and badassery of the highest order in this movie  so don't freak out when we try to give you a story and actually develop the characters later on.In addition to more Church and a lot more Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the other characters seem to get real personalities. Dolph Lundgren's character, Gunnar, in particular, is hysterical in this film, whereas in the first he had a weird role as a bipolar freak who turns on his old team. In general, the sense of humor is vastly improved and the camaraderie between all the characters feels more natural."The Expendables 2" also gets distinctly more self aware and meta, so much so to the point where you don't see the characters, just the actors who play them. Gunnar, for example, is painted as a scientific genius turned mercenary, which is true to Lundgren's life story subbing "mercenary" for "action star." This instance in particular helps expand the palette of personalities in the group, but other instances come off as just pandering. Pretty much everything Schwarzenegger says, for example, is derived from one of his famous one-liners of the past. At times it's funny, at others just pitiful.The script's preoccupation with both massaging the stars' egos and jabbing at them with deprecating humor doesn't take too much away from the blowing bad guys away spirit of the movie. The action still plays out like "Grand Theft Auto" with all the cheats turned on, but there's something sickly satisfying about that approach, especially in a movie that so clearly recognizes that its audience didn't come for the realism. Plus, the concept of putting all these actors together in itself is larger than life.Most every actor gets a moment in the sun, but many do in odds ways. The handling of Chuck Norris' "lone wolf" character makes no degree of sense, which is consequently amusing somehow, Jet Li and Liam Hemsworth get a chance to look badass but aren't in the film from beginning to end, and Randy Couture is just scenery. On the contrary, Jason Statham gets a ridiculously slick knife sequence and Sly and JCVD play a game of fisticuffs in the finale to balance out the absurd degree of gunfire. Not part of the marketing but a major piece in the film is Nan Yu as Maggie Chen, who adds brains to the mission as well as a chance for Stallone to tell a woman he can't get close to her because of the life he leads."The Expendables 2" is the same degree of testosterone-jacked fun as the first film, only this time the cast, writers and directors decide to give us a little extra in the story to make it worth our while.~Steven CThanks for reading!

If you describe yourself as the type of person who loves people-watching, then "Rear Window" should or already does rank as one of your favorite films. Not that dissecting people's voyeuristic tendencies is the film's only strength, but it is certainly what sets this film apart from all other films as well as other Alfred Hitchcock classics. It operates at a much slower pace, and it isolates the viewer by almost never taking the camera out of the room. This experimental technique is the mark of the artist working on his masterpiece, which is certainly the case (although just the first of many) with Hitchcock and "Rear Window." I don't think any director who didn't have his own checkbook could have successfully pitched this film's concept. It's about a photographer named L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) who breaks his leg and has nothing to do all day but watch the people outside this window. Then one day he sees something suspicion and is taken in by it completely. It sounds like classic Hitchcock paranoia thriller, but it's too static and uneventful for that to summarize it accurately. The suspense that Hitchcock is masterful at is merely used as a crutch to keep this film going. Its ultimate goal is to make you just as itchy and paranoid as Jeffries is.The way that Hitchcock brings you right into the lens (pun intended) of his main character is about as good it can be done in film-making. Stewart is a good actor, but it's more about the perspective and the isolating feel of this one-set film that gets you to conspire along with Jeffries, trying to figure out what's going on because you desperately want some sort of drama. But Hitchcock never gives you drama--he gives you suspense, suspicion and suggestions about all the people outside the window in the surrounding apartments--but never drama. It's sinister and cruel, but it's absolutely genius. It takes a true master to earn appreciation for that kind of a technique.Just as good as the exploration of human nature at an impersonal distance is that at a personal distance. The relationship between Jeffries and girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) is about the close as the film gets to drama. Jeffries is convinced that her posh, urban mindset is not the right fit for his adventurous, rugged photojournalist lifestyle. Their troubles and the fact that he's more focused on the people outside his window than her adds to the complicated contrast between reality and perceived reality. Kelly is absolutely stunning and it adds to the strength of her role.Without giving anything away, Hitchcock rides a fine line between truth and perception in this film and has you on the fence the entire time, bringing things to a trademark climax that gets your heart pumping. In general, however, this film is for those with a love of suspense and an appreciation of films that keep you inside your head the entire time. It is not a traditional thriller though it plays off some of those characteristics. It's really hard to get comfortable in this film, which is it's only weakness but perhaps its greatest strength.
The one-liners, the dazzling locales, the raw sexual tension (and appeal), the inventive action sequences, the wit--these are the things "Indiana Jones" fans know and love about this film franchise and its beloved hero, Dr. Henry "Indiana" Jones Jr, and naturally that's what they've come to expect--even 19 years later--from the fourth installment. But that's not the forte of "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." Instead, it's a mildly entertaining, more visually refined and mythology-focused take on Indy that lacks the charm and irrepressible love the past films evoked."Crystal Skull" lets its premise hold it down. While "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Last Crusade" only took one 5 minute scene to explain the ancient artifacts involved and the stories behind them, "Crystal Skull" takes constant moments here and there to keep the viewer up to speed with what exactly it's all about. It's necessary to understand the film, but it takes too much time away from the fun parts of the franchise. It's definitely interesting though: the idea that the South American legend of "El Dorado," a city of gold, was created by an ancient civilization who worshipped an extra-terrestrial life form. It sticks to the supernatural nature of the artifacts like in the other movies, but it's simply way too complex. The premise really forced George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson to write the script almost entirely to accommodate it.One of those things that get shorted for plot's sake and something that never should get that way is character development. The characters in this film get thrown in as the plot roles along and we're supposed to act like we understand the bond they all share. The rekindled relationship between Marion (Allen) and Indy in particular is one of those relationships that never really has time to establish itself. Rising star Shia Lebouf isn't bad in the film and neither is Cate Blanchett as the antagonist, but neither role enhances the enjoyment of the film. Even Indy himself has lost some of his swagger. Ford doesn't deserve to be faulted entirely for the disappearance of the command that his performance had over the original trilogy. Indiana appears to be written more as the nerdy professor in this film instead of a dash of professor as used in the trilogy.The film still has the series' action and creativity through action. It's not nearly as exciting and innovative because the plot limits the possibilities, but it's entertaining. The witty dialogue however is not nearly as frequent. The humor of "Temple of Doom," especially in the characters is not even close to matched in this film. You can tell they're trying to be that way, but it doesn't work the same because the character development is lacking.It's hard to knock an Indiana Jones film, but it's safe to say this film was the worst of the four, unless you never could take how bizarre the plot for "Temple of Doom" was. It can easily be said this movie entertains through the action, the riddles and the mild intrigue of the premise, but it almost entirely fails to take advantage of the fact that its basic foundation is one that the public fell in love with over 20 years ago. It never uses that to suck the audience in except in a few scenes, mostly involving fedoras or snakes. You shouldn't hate "Crystal Skull," but you could very easily be disappointed. Anyone who is unfamiliar with the franchise is quite frankly best served by holding off on spending the cash and renting the other three first.
Movies about obscure characters doing obscure things can be pretty hit or miss. The key is tying that obscurity into something that people can understand and relate to. With "Bottle Rocket," Wes Anderson (in his very first cinematic credits) establishes that he understands this must be done and he does it with relationships. While "Bottle Rocket" may not be all that poignant or satisfy the tastes of all movie watchers, it certainly does offer its own style of entertainment. For those familiar with Anderson's more mainstream work, this is a film that brings some insight into how he established himself as a revered director.Let's not forget the Wilson brothers either. Both Owen and Luke can thank this film for being a great resume starter. It highlights the very talents that they took with them all the way to the bank in the last ten years. Luke is Anthony Adams, a lovable, naive guy who finds himself in trouble thanks to those around him, namely Owen's character Dignan, the quirky, high-aimer who takes things to a comically serious level. You see attributes of these characters echo in nearly every role they've played since this film gave them a spotlight. Together, the two are small time crooks who consider themselves professionals and set out with their friend Bob only to further reveal to the viewer that they have no talent whatsoever. There's not a whole lot driving this plot. While part of that is the point, more could actually happen to make things interesting. Instead, this is mostly focused on how the characters all deal with their collective ineptitude. They argue like most friends argue, only most friends aren't amateur thieves. Like Anderson's films after this, the characters all wrestle between a group or family mentality and their individual desires. It's very easy to see for anyone who has seen most of Anderson's work. Fortunately for him, these characters and dilemmas only get stronger and more interesting as his career progresses.The film is also not much of a comedy. While Anderson never has done traditional comedy, the laughs come at the expense of some of the strange characters. They're not nearly strange enough to be consistently funny. Instead, the characters and the whole film is likable, but that's about where it stops. It never gets beyond likable. At least likable is better than bad and this film is definitely leaves a good taste in your mouth.
There are parody movies and then there are movies that stand out individually while parodying other movies, and that's where "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" comes in. Driven by the incredibly talented character actor Mike Myers, Austin Powers is meant to be a vulgarization of everything that is James Bond, but at the same time, Powers and the surrounding cast are so unique that "Austin Powers" is really a franchise all in its own, with or without the Bond references.Austin Powers (Myers) is a 1960s British spy in the model of James Bond only he's less talented with his fists, hornier and uglier than Bond. His nemesis is Dr. Evil, also played by Myers, a bastardization of Blofeld of the early Bond films. Evil's plan is to cryogenically freeze himself and then come back in the future to try and hold the world ransom. Powers does the same and both are reawakened in the year 1997. This time travel element is probably to not alienate younger viewers who have no sense of the 1960s.Myers really showcases his talent for the first time in this film. Both Powers and Dr. Evil are unique, funny and likable. The strength of Dr. Evil in particularly is his sensitive side that we don't see in many villains in comedic films. Powers is such a strong protagonist because he brings some catchy 60s British jargon that is largely unexposed at this point to American audiences and other countries. The raunchy humor is also quite genius at times, which is about as high of a compliment as you can give raunchy humor.The movies is best described as silly, but clever silly, and there's certainly a lovable aspect to it. It's certainly not supposed to be plot driven and you really can't fault it for flaws in that area. It's just very rich with jokes (it would take multiple viewings to catch them all, especially the Bond references) and primarily structured on little sketches. I wouldn't call them gags because they are more cleverly integrated into the plot. Overall, "Austin Powers" is a shagadelic good time.
Everybody's talking about what happens after the apocalypse these days.  "The Book of Eli" is sort of the boiling point of this science-fiction  concept, a combination of last year's "The Road" and George Miller's  "The Road Warrior." America is a post-apocalyptic wasteland and Denzel  Washington is the only self-sufficient badass. So originality is not  exactly "Eli's" calling card, but it clearly establishes its ruinous  world and the Hughes brothers ("From Hell") take good care of its  characters while supplying top-notch action.  Washington stars as our stolid protagonist, Eli, journeying westward  with his canteen, a large machete, a couple guns and a special  leather-bound book. He lives on an Earth that was fried 30 years before  by the sun because of a war that ripped a hole through the ozone layer.  Sun-goggled bikers run amok pillaging, killing and raping passers-by,  yet Eli is morally sound and focused on keeping his book safe no matter  what so he can deliver it somewhere out west.  Although written by a first-time screenwriter and former PC Gamer  editor, Gary Whitta, "Eli" impressively creates its world between the  sunglasses/goggles due to the sun's power, trading of goods because  money's obsolete and the constant examining of hands to determine if  someone is jittery from eating too much human flesh. Whitta also places  Eli squarely in the story. He's a good but dangerous man who's not  afraid to kill, and as he sits idly by as a couple gets attacked, it's  abundantly clear that this is a world where compassion is secondary to  survival and self-interest.  Where the plot comes in is "Eli's" weak link. It doesn't try too hard  to hide just what exactly the book is and that sort of dissolves some  of the film's mystique. The plot is essentially Eli wants to protect it  and take it west and he has a run in with Carnegie (Gary Oldman), an  older man who runs a small town and desires it for selfish  power-related reasons. Along the way, anyone who threatens to lay a  hand on Eli gets sliced up or shot. In the two or three fight scenes  where he takes down numerous guys at once, you can't help but wonder  why after he kills the first few guys, the others don't run the hell  away, especially considering people are otherwise in self-preservation  mode living in a wasteland (and they know nothing of the book).  The Hughes brothers make those scenes worthwhile, however. There's a  style and grace to their action scenes -- they create a sort of a  moving tableau in some scenes and execute a wide range of tempos in the  action sequences to make them more intense. When Carnegie's men  encounter Eli and the young woman (Mila Kunis) that he inspires who  follows him at the home of some old folks (cameos by famous Brits  Frances De La Tour and Michael Gambon), they place the camera in the  middle of the action and sweep along with the gunfire (part- digitally)  from one side to the other. It's very cool and is an example of one way  the Hugheses keep the focus away from the plot's shaky skeleton. I only  have beef with their excessive slow-motion walking-toward-the-camera  shots and showing a bit too much of the cloudy green-gray sky.  Some people are going to be more surprised and impressed with the  film's big reveal than others, but anyone with a love of action and  that post-apocalyptic context will find something to make "Eli" a  worthwhile watch regardless of plot weakness. Washington is slightly  under-utilized but he's an ideal fit. He brings an intensity in his  demeanor that makes him an intriguing character and the film does a  good job of making his character more central than anything else.  ~Steven C
Young boys getting involved with something way over their heads out in nature almost immediately evokes Rob Reiner's 1986 classic "Stand by Me." Coming-of-age stories have a certain power to them when the boys are actually younger than high school age and don't live comfortably under their parents' roof. "Mud" possesses that same grit and spirit.The Mississippi River imagery of "Mud" and the story of young boys helping a runaway also strongly evokes "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," only with a more modern world view and a realistic sense of danger. The boys are Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), 14-year-old Arkansas boys who look and act as just that. They value their independence and like to get away from home (both have unstable family situations), plus they have become preoccupied with the opposite sex.One morning they sneak out in a motorboat and head to a small island on the river where Neckbone has discovered a boat lodged in the trees. They explore it and soon discover a man lives there. Mud (Matthew McConaughey) strikes a deal with the boys to let them have the boat in exchange for food. They bring some back and slowly develop a relationship with him, even after they discover he's a wanted man. Turns out Mud is trying to connect with his longtime girlfriend, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) so they can run away together. Ellis, inspired by their love, puts himself in a dangerous way to help Mud escape.Writer and director Jeff Nichols could well direct an Oscar-winning film in the not-too-distant future, and at the least, certainly an Oscar-nominated one. His last film, "Take Shelter," was an engaging, suspenseful drama with universal themes and beautiful nature cinematography and "Mud" does the same, proving he's here for the long run.Most films like "Mud" would utilize voice-over narration, usually from the main character as an adult telling a story of his boyhood, but Nichols relies on nothing but pure visual storytelling and demonstrates a serious knack for it. We can make out for ourselves how the rift between Ellis' parents, played by Ray McKinnon and Sarah Paulson, drives him away from his riverboat home to seek more time with Mud, and how his own emotions and feelings about love, naive as they are, push him to help Mud and Juniper.Ellis is definitely the film's main character and that says everything about Sheridan's performance. This young man isn't going away anytime soon. Ellis is a lovable kid despite his occasionally reckless behavior and penchant for trusting others too much. He's strong, fearless and independent, especially for his age, which Sheridan does so well, yet the innocence (and ultimately its loss) is present in his performance.McConaughey continues his independent film tear in the title role. Mud is a pretty straightforward character, but he's not charming or mysterious or unpredictable. The script puts everything out there that you'd need to know about him, so McConaughey has to put some soul into the part, which he certainly does. Mud is a likable guy because he treats the boys like adults, like true friends, despite questions of his past transgressions.The rest of the cast is sound, though no roles especially stand out aside from Sam Shepard as Ellis' cross-river neighbor, the man who looked after Mud when he was a boy. Witherspoon, who commands a hefty salary, presumably liked the script so much that she made concessions, because Juniper isn't a particularly strong character, just a tough one.Those who love films that put a bit of a folk twist on reality will easily take a liking to "Mud." The Arkansas town where the film takes place is about as dingy as they come, but Nichols finds some real beauty in it and his story gives it the same mythic energy as the Southern setting does in "Huck Finn." The film does take some harrowing turns, but they are never so dark and violent that it shatters that folkloric bubble entirely, rather it reminds us about the many hard truths of this world.It might look like an inaccessible Southern-set drama, but "Mud" will engage, entertain and strike a chord with all types of people with its expert treatment of loss of innocence and coming of age.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

The first thing one ought to know about the film "Sydney," originally released as "Hard Eight," is that the former name is most appropriate. "Hard Eight" sounds like a gambling thriller and this film is a very far cry from that. Craps just has a metaphoric role in the film. "Sydney" is the name of the lead role and considering how this is an ensemble, character-driven drama like nearly all of director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson's later films would become, that's a fitting title."Sydney" stars Philip Baker Hall in his most intensive role ever out of the hundreds he has had. Sydney is a puzzling character. All we know about him is that he used to make himself by appearing to be a big gambler and he passes that skill on to John (John C. Reilly) in the first part of the film. This is really the premise of the film and then things take a turn. The interest in the film is purely in its characters. From scene one, Sydney's motivation is unknown: he appears very morally enigmatic, always wearing a black suit with a white shirt and a black tie and never stating what it is he wants, only telling John what to do. He ends up appearing as a father figure to John and his girlfriend Clementine (Paltrow).Trying to understand Sydney is the film's only interest point. Otherwise, the film is rather boring. Such a small cast makes it seem like it would be better off as a play. Thematically, the film is strong in the way that its characters and theme work together. This has always been Anderson's biggest strength. His later films show a greater plot strength in addition to the characters, which frankly this film lacks. Its beginning is rather misleading and superficial in making you think it might turn into a gambling/con movie with slick dialogue. The end result is positive, but nothing truly special.
Nothing the Coen Brothers ever do is really a change of pace, but "Inside Llewyn Davis" is about as close to one as you're likely to get from the filmmaking duo that has rolled out nothing but critically acclaimed hits since 2008 Best Picture winner "No Country for Old Men." Even with a three-year break between directorial projects for the first time in almost 20 years, they strike again with "Llewyn Davis," perhaps their most understated and emotional effort to date."Davis" is a melancholy story that finds occasional moments of classic Coen Brothers humor (that killer combination of wit, frankness, exaggeration and irony) and stirs the soul with an influx of folk music. Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a couch-surfing folk singer of unquestionable talent struggling to make money in New York's Greenwich Village in the winter of 1961. Plagued by a number of mistakes in his work and personal life and followed by the shadow of his stint as one half of a folk duo, Llewyn impatiently pursues his big break despite the lousy circumstances.Isaac get his much-deserved big break as Davis, a role that could really only be played by someone yet to become a full-fledge movie star. In fact, the Coen Brothers veer away from casting their usual suspects entirely (except for John Goodman in a small role), which gives "Davis" both a different feel for the Coens in general and helps to get across the sense of anonymity in the folk scene. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake play supporting roles as Jean and Jim, some lovable local favorites performing in the scene, but they're a small part of the film overall.This is Llewyn's story entirely, a disheartening portrayal of the American dream, and without an ounce of sugarcoating. Plus, Llewyn is far from the brave and naive optimist who's hopelessly in love with his craft. He sees it very much as his passion, but it is his career, his work  a means to a paycheck. He's not the smartest or the most likable character, so it's actually the scenes in which he performs so beautifully that will move the audience to root for his success. We can observe his talent, but objectively, we can also see the very qualities in his personality and even his music that account for his struggle.Although "Davis" has a number of striking scenes, some of which are difficult to watch, there's not much shock factor in this particular Coen Brothers film. The plot is non-traditional in the sense that there's no main conflict with scenes that move toward a resolution, rather everything that happens is meant to give us a window into the unforgiving nature of the life Llewyn has chosen for himself. His desperation road trip to Chicago to try and land a gig for a man with a prominent club sums a lot of this up. He bums a ride with Goodman's character Roland Turner, a jazz musician who tests Llewyn's wits to no end, and his "chauffeur," Johnny Five, (Garrett Hedlund), a poet of few verbal words. The trip takes a strange turn with less than desirable results.In most Coen films, each character or event, no matter how small, has something to say to the greater overall theme and ideas of the film. "Davis" is no exception, though it does so in much more subtle ways. One of the more prominent metaphors involves an orange cat that falls into Llewyn's care. Although the symbolism is obvious, the meaning remains open to interpretation in a way the Coens do so well.Music is of course integral to this film in a way it has not been for the Coens since "O' Brother, Where Art Thou?" Music immediately sets the tone in addition to creating a nostalgic, poignant feeling throughout the film. The script explores the many uses of folk music as well. There are soul-bearing, intimate ballads like those sung by Llewyn to the political hijacking of folk music such as the scene in which Llewyn and Jim record "Please, Mr. Kennedy," to the way folk music has evolved from songs from the "old country." "Inside Llewyn Davis" is a film that all artists will appreciate, and quite possibly anyone who has dedicated themselves to something only to end up disappointed time and time again. The Coens approach this subject with brute honesty but also a certain poetic sensitivity. Especially when held up to their many irreverent comedies, "Llewyn Davis" will long be used as evidence supporting the Coens' knack for artistic, nuanced filmmaking.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

A good special-effects era mythology movie is bound to happen at some point, but we're definitely still waiting. "Clash of the Titans" is merely a modern incarnation of the original that in the age of CGI monsters and impressive fight sequences plops lazily in the category of status quo, something its 1981 cult predecessor was anything but thanks to the groundbreaking stop-motion work of Ray Harryhausen.That's where my comparison of these films nearly 30 years apart starts and ends. 2010's "Clash of the Titans" has enough faults of its own. It serves up the meat and potatoes we come to expect of any action film, especially in a post-"300" world of modern swords-and- sandals epics, but there's a definite lack of gravy. No surprises, no unique features -- even star Sam Worthington as the hero Perseus comes off dusty after the true "titan" that "Avatar" was.The myth of the Greek hero/demi-god Perseus, though butchered completely in this movie, is still essentially the quest to retrieve the head of Medusa. In "Titans," Perseus finds himself in the troubled city of Argos after his adoptive family is killed by Hades, who has uncharacteristically left his domain in the Underworld because humans have begun acting out in defiance of the gods. Hades gets the gods of Mt. Olympus to agree to unleash his Kracken, the beast who defeated the titans long ago, on Argos if they don't sacrifice their princess, Andromeda, in reverence of the gods.Angry at the gods himself, (and already embittered by the opinions of his father who not- so-subtly suggests "someone, someday will take a stand"), Perseus is slightly unhappy to learn he almost is one. He agrees to consult the Fates and learn what he can do to defeat this fearsome beast, but he wants to do it on his terms -- as man, not as a god.Twisting mythology is small stuff, however, on the list of the script's flaws. It's a typical hero's journey story told almost entirely by dialogue. Not narration, but using dialogue to move the scenes rather than let images and events speak for themselves. It's horribly amateur and as a result the lines are all throwaway. The script speaks of grand themes such as humanity vs. godliness which don't work when you don't care for the humans because the beginning is scraped together and told in this talk-heavy way.Impressed by the action work on "The Incredible Hulk," I had reasonably high expectations for director Louis Leterrier, but the action scenes are aimless and ill-conceived. I once again fault the trio of inexperienced and low-quality writers, however, because they gave these scenes no shape and which prodded Leterrier toward milking them for whatever they did have, using too many slow-mo shots and the like. He does some great flying camera takes and the Medusa scene turned out fairly exciting -- even though the gorgon was kinda awkwardly sexy, which you can interpret however you like.The art direction renders mixed results. Medusa's lair was well-conceived and I did like the vision of Charon the Styx ferryman, but the weird shiny armor of the gods was corny and the horrific makeup used to disfigure venerable actors Neeson as Zeus and Fiennes as the oddly asthmatic Hades was below true blockbuster quality. The cgi effects were pretty good, particularly Hades turning into puffs of smoke and such.Finally -- and no spoilers here -- yes, the Kracken is released, just in case you didn't catch Neeson saying that in every TV spot. Why Warner Bros. wanted to release the Kracken in ads and completely spoil the biggest reveal/tool to shock the audience the movie has is a question is beyond me and says a lot about their confidence in this generic adventure film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"Everything Is Illuminated" is sort of the independent filmmakers preferred story line for doing a film about the Holocaust. Instead of historical fiction, it is a contemporary journey, generations later, in effort to shed more light on the true historical significance of the Holocaust: the stuff that can't be found in history books. In addition, it is an offbeat comedy about a clash of cultures and a story of personal reflection and understanding.Based on the book of the same title, "Illuminated" stars Elijah Wood as Jonathan Foer, a young Jewish American adult who is very quiet, but is an avid collector of things that are valuable or hold memories. In hopes of learning more about his grandfather's past (a Holocaust survivor from a Jewish shtetl in Ukraine), Jonathan travels there and enlists the help of a guide service, which includes a young Ukranian man named Alex who speaks amusing English (Eugene Hutz) and his crazy grandfather. The film also marks the directorial debut of Liev Schreiber, whose wide shots, elongated moments of silence and written text scene transitions fall easily in line with that indie vibe. Most noticeable of all, however, is the music. Interestingly enough, supporting actor Eugene Hutz is the frontman of the band Gogol Bordello, which fuses that Eastern European folk sound with modern song structure and rhythms. I don't know if the soundtrack features Gogol Bordello music specifically, but it features that style and a lot of it. Music is very intentionally integrated at moments and not merely used as transitional fluff--the sign of a definite independent film. The style seems to represent the coming together of cultures and is very catchy and unique, adding to the easy-going, humorous beginning of the film.Yes, the beginning is much funnier than I thought it would be, though this of course changes as the journey becomes more difficult for the unlikely trio and eventually as Jonathan finds more of what he is seeking. With the exception of a few moments, this is not a Holocaust- focused film that will disturb you. It is more about the historical significance from a much smaller perspective, of a person to generations past without which he would not exist. The film cherishes all that is sentimental, focusing on objects and artifacts (especially seeing as Jonathan is a collector) and understanding the ways the past can influence the present in the most basic of ways. Anyone can relate to Jonathan's journey and that's the best part of this story. Maybe not to the character himself, who we really don't know all that much about given his timid nature, but definitely to memories and wanting to understand where we came from. We all have attachments to sentimental objects which is why objects have such a powerful significance in society and literature/film. Schreiber gets how important that is to the film and really nails it. "Illuminated" is a must-see for anyone whose Holocaust education is limited to textbooks and other movies, for those that haven't really heard the stories of the people who lived it.
A film of few words, "Conan the Barbarian" strays from the path of most action films as far as storytelling goes. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who would become notorious for delivering one- liners has only one or two opportunities in this film. But how can one possibly complain about an action/adventure film that doesn't waste its time blabbering? "Conan" should be applauded for creating the epic feel of a war movie like "Spartacus," but elaborate sets and costumes don't count as points toward character development.Writer and director John Milius, who penned "Apocalypse Now," knows a thing or two about war films. Namely, he gets the power of telling a story without words. Except for a narrator, significant chunks of "Conan" are told with music and images that attempt to spin the story into a folk legend akin to Greek mythology. Aided with a healthy budget for creative and inspiring costumes and set pieces, "Conan" sells itself as a true epic.The lack of dialogue, however, causes a fair share of problems. Events seem to lack a rhyme or reason with only the thread of a common revenge tale holding it all together. Conan sees his parents die, gets sold into slavery, grows up, becomes a gladiator, trains to be a warrior and then is suddenly free. The film doesn't need dialogue for the sake of telling us what will happen next, but in developing some of the relationships between the characters that provides the motivation for the story to travel in one direction or another.Schwarzenegger wastes no time becoming an action hero you can root for. The script throws men waiting to be crushed and naked women at his feet and for a barbarian, he shows that he's not so much an animal as someone who refuses to act entirely human as a way of defying the system. When he's given a woman to mate with, for example, he doesn't simply take her and have her like a dog, and when he's in the arena, he clearly kills not for his owners, but out of some emotional void.On the opposite end of the spectrum is Thulsa Doom, played by James Earl Jones at the height of his "voice of Darth Vader" fame. An unforgettable villain from the name inward, Doom gives "Conan" the evil force it needs to make Conan's motivation function successfully. His philosophy of seeking human followers rather than wealth and riches makes him rather unique as well and it allows for some intriguing philosophy for an otherwise shallow movie.I suppose swords, sweat, snakes and sex have their place in adult action/fantasy; the trouble with "Conan the Barbarian" only lies within a conflict of objectives. The film cannot seem to settle on being more of a war epic or completely embracing its potential for cult fantasy. Its characters lack too much depth for the former and its story too long-winded and humorless for the latter. Either way, it presents a world and mythology that makes for an intriguing revenge tale.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"American History X" is the first film to put more than a name and a face to the white supremacy/hate speech movement and that alone is worthy of applause. This film enters familiar cinematic territory in presenting the tragic nature of the cycle of violence as it relates to social inequality and race, but never before has a film taken the risk of putting us in the shoes of someone who believes in hate. It's a bold move and it delivers one of the more eye- opening films of our time.The film centers around the Vinyard family, whose eldest brother Derek (Edward Norton) is one of the most respected leaders of a southern California hate group, who has just gotten out of prison for the ruthless killing of two black men that were trying to rob him. Prison has definitely changed Derek, but his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) looks to follow in his brother's old footsteps anyway. The film spends a lot more time in the past, with black and white flashbacks showing what turned Derek into the man he became and the impact it had on his younger brother and his family.This is nothing short of a powerful film. It will make you cringe, shake your head, question your beliefs, and maybe even make you cry. Norton is so convincing that when his character makes his case for hate it's scary how logical he can sound despite how the argument fundamentally lacks any sort of compassion or belief in equality. A lot of that credit should go to first time writer David McKenna whose script is absolutely fantastic, never feeling unnatural. It's hard to believe this was original material. Norton, however, deserves a lot for coming off as so convincing and making the drastic change for his character such a believable one. Furlong as the young Danny is also terrific as an impressionable young teen who is both rebellious yet loving and innocent. The supporting cast is also without flaw.It may be hard for some viewers to get past some of the brutality in the film or even sit comfortably through hate speeches, tons of hate imagery, or even just take interest in characters that believe in all that, but McKenna and first-time director Tony Kaye do a tremendously sensitive job of handling the subject. No one party comes off as seeming like more of the bad guy as that is the nature of the cycle of violence. The characters are also so multi-dimensional that you can't justifiably criticize the work that's been done by everyone behind this film.For those curious, the film receives its title from the name of the assignment that Danny's principle give him which asks him to analyze his brother and understand what made him who he is. Throughout the film Danny works on this paper and comes to his own stunning conclusions the same as we do. The structure is so good and so compelling and its a shame the brutal nature of the film and its subject kept it from truly getting the critical recognition it deserved.
What was the point of making a "21 Jump Street" movie? No, really, why bother remaking or rebooting re-imagining a short-lived cop series from the '80s, especially when you've targeted your movie at people born long after it went off the air?The way writer Michael Bacall along with Jonah Hill, directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller and anyone else with a creative hand in this movie answer this question earns "21 Jump Street" its badge of honoror dishonor, depending how you look at it."21 Jump Street" is as monumental of a sendup as has ever been committed to film. It's mere existence serves us a refreshing dose of Hollywood self-ridicule uncommon in today's movies. Oh, and it's really funny.The film reveals its intentions early when Nick Offerman's Dep. Chief Hardy assigns our heroes Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) to 21 Jump Street where they'll be debriefed on going undercover as high schoolers, but not before rambling about how the higher-ups like to waste everyone's time reviving dead programs from the '80s. Sounds like Hollywood in a nutshell.Everything from chase scenes to the buddy-cop dynamic to explosions faces the satirical scrutiny of the filmmakers and Lord and Miller play it up to the point at which it can neither be taken too seriously or blown off as immature twaddle.Hill and Tatum make a good duo, but Tatum's presence in the film makes it fresh. Unless you subjected yourself to "The Dilemma," you've never witnessed his comic prowess. His combination of bravado, idiocy and deep-seated social insecurity as Jenko make him a real hit. Hill also works the full range of smart and awkward to totally outrageous.The script uses the brilliant device of having these two accidentally assume the high-school identity intended for the other, so Tatum has to hang out with the dorks while Hill must get in with the cool kids. A spot-on satire of how high-school kids have completely changed in just a matter of five or six years emerges here. Of our two high-school drug dealers, one cares a lot about green initiatives and the other is gay, which is not exactly in line with high-school stereotypes. At one point, Tatum profanely blames "Glee" for screwing up the once-Darwinian nature of the high school social hierarchy.As for jokes, "21 Jump Street" piles on crude humor, though usually with more effectiveness than most run-of-the-mill R-rated offerings. Seeing as Schmidt and Jenko must track down the supplier of a new synthetic drug, the movie offers more than a couple instances of drug- trip sequences, namely one in which Eric (Dave Franco, James' little brother) makes the two try the drug so he "knows they're cool." Given that the script explicitly states that the drug works in four main stages  one of which is "tripping major ballsack"  it builds up the humor more effectively.Immaturity abounds in the film, but with a wink and a smile. Except for maybe an older, slightly more ignorant audience, few people will watch this start to finish and not realize the filmmakers are aware of the dumb and silly moments in the movie. You can even see through the awkward quasi-romance between Schmidt and Brie Larson's character, Molly, because no one would find romantic catharsis in a budding relationship between a 25-year-old and high school senior.Like most modern comedies, "21 Jump Street" has a number of misses in spite of its many successful laughs, but the majority of them work, especially because in painting this typical picture of high school, it adds a few fine details of what high school is really like these days.Best, however, for those familiar with the TV show to divorce themselves from anything related to it, as the movie merely leeches off the name and premise, then tosses everything off to the side minus a few obvious in-jokes. It's typical Hollywood, but the self-awareness of this phenomenally goofy comedy sets it apart from its peers.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out more at moviemusereviews.com
In telling chapters of history, films have the benefit of hindsight. As obvious as that statement sounds, Oscar-winning screenwriter Brian Helgeland takes advantage of almost 70 years of history in writing/directing "42," to the point where he can set the stage with the perfect emotional tone for telling the story of Jackie Robinson, one of the greatest legends in all of sports, who broke baseball's color barrier in the 1940s. "You want a player who doesn't have the guts to fight back?" Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) asks of Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), the man who dared to put him in a Major League uniform. "No, I want a player who has the guts not to fight back," Rickey says. The exchange is music to our ears, but did it ever happen? Probably not quite like that. You can pull lots of dialogue from "42" and make the same argument, but it doesn't matter; Helgeland is telling the folk story of Robinson and that's the story we want to see anyway.The film opens with Rickey, a shockingly refreshing change of pace for Ford, who never played a non-fiction character in his life, endeavoring to bring in a player from the Negro Leagues. The reason? None given at first, but no matter. Today, it wouldn't be surprising for one person to take a stand on a matter of civil rights, but back then, it was probably hard, assuming Rickey had a care about civil rights. The film hints that he just wanted to win and make money, but it goes on to paint him as an ethical hero too, because  just because. And why not? We want to believe that's the man Rickey was, and his character is totally lovable for it."42" doesn't sugarcoat the discrimination Robinson and other African-Americans faced during this historic time, but we still lap it up. The most memorable instance is when Phillies manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) shouts slur after slur at Robinson over the course of a game and ultimately makes amends with him as a publicity move. Harsh, brutal and tough to stomach, this discrimination makes us feel for Robinson when he heads into the clubhouse and unleashes his anger because he couldn't do it on the field. How hard it was back then and how terrible people could be, but the movie presents it in this "my, look what he had to overcome!" sort of way. Helgeland stirs up our emotional response, even though the reality was probably much uglier.A perfect example is during one of Robinson's first few big league games presented in the film when a man takes his boy to the ballgame and they look like they're having a great time, until the father shouts slurs at Robinson when he enters the field. The kid, who clearly didn't feel negatively about Robinson to being with, joins in the heckling because that's what the other men were doing. Engrained racism doesn't need to be showed in such a picturesque light, but it adds to the emotional experience of the film.Boseman's Robinson is both humble and bold. We see him hold back and keep his temper in check and we also see him instigating by showing off his athletic prowess. Boseman makes Robinson every inch as lovable as we imagine the man to have been. He's unafraid to bring on some extra heat, but like most of us, he has a breaking point. Surprisingly, we don't see that breaking point much; the script doesn't care much for that kind of melodrama, just the feel- good kind."42" embodies everything you'd want from a feel-good movie. Helgeland perfectly sets up bad characters or characters with bad attitudes to get served with witty civil rights-affirming dialogue or scenes in which they have to eat crow (or  yes, I'll go there  Jim Crow). The film definitely panders to the obvious inclinations of its audience, who so many decades removed, very clearly stands on the right side of history. I won't be so naive as to believe that everyone who sees "42" has no racial prejudice, but what Robinson stood for and how what he did changed society let alone sports has few opposers these days. In reality, Robinson was and is a hero, but in the minds of a generations removed, he's a legend. The film honors the legend of Robinson in a way that it will feed whatever idealistic notion of Robinson you might have developed in your mind. "42" is the comfort food of sports drama, which is the comfort genre of cinema. In other words, it's any food item analogy you wish with lots and lots of butter. But there's butter for the sake of butter, and there's butter applied in perfect, mouth-watering amounts, and "42" has the proportions measured out just right.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"In the Bedroom" is a very quiet film that is shot and acted in a very restrained manner. Todd Field, who is essentially the man responsible for the film, uses a technique that is all too fitting for the story he tells: shocking tragedy in a family and the way it changes people."In the Bedroom" is about a family in Maine consisting of a husband and wife (Wilkinson and Spacek) and their only son Frank (Nick Stahl) who is in college, home for the summer, and romantically involved with an older woman (Marisa Tomei) who has two children and an ex- husband (William Mapother, currently of LOST fame). The trouble occurs as Frank naively believes he can continue his love affair without repercussions and eventually tragedy occurs.The film's true beauty comes with character reaction to the tragedy. Wilkinson and Spacek are both perfect at showing an inner monologue without saying anything, which fits Field's style: a series of stills held for long periods of time (sometimes shorter but feel longer) without almost any camera movement. When the camera doesn't move, your eye has a tendency to explore and your mind a tendency to reflect, which allows the viewer to empathize with the life-altering epiphanies of the characters as they struggle. A lot is then placed on the actors to draw attention to themselves through facial expressions.Field's style also does really well with suspense. A film shot in a more typical fashion would have a very light and easy feel given the setting, but this technique give it a more ominous feel. Field really masters this film from a director's chair, but instead of an Oscar nomination for that, the credit all went to his equally strong screenplay instead.If you can handle the slow parts and keep your mind (and your eyes) open, "In the Bedroom" is an incredibly well-told story with dynamite acting. Family tragedy has never been so real and believable because Field gets you to know exactly where his characters are coming from. It's a treat when something so simple (less than $2M budget) can be so great.
The explosion of Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, the emergence of James Cameron, and a couple classic one-liners are among the many things "Terminator" brought into cinematic culture forever, but one of the least considered gifts of this 1984 smash sci-fi action thriller is the introduction of movie goers everywhere to "the future."A "terminator" cyborg (Schwarzenegger) is sent from the future with a specific objective to kill a girl named Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). Hot on the terminator's trail, however, is a human from the future named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who must save Sarah. Why? Sarah is the mother of John Connor, the leader of humanity's only resistance in the future when our machines/computers turn on us. The machines, desperate during this future war, have turned to time travel to completely eliminate Connor's existence. "Terminator" is a story that takes place in the present (well, 1984 present) but it's relevance is for the future and does include some "flash-forwards" of what creator James Cameron's man vs. machine apocalyptic future might look like. Most significantly, it's film's first serious attempt to imagine where science and technology might lead us.Sure, "Star Trek" and "2001: Space Odyssey" are among some of the ways Hollywood has imagined the future, but those are much more fantastical and not focused on Earth. "Terminator" is a much darker depiction that strongly considers science, not on dreaming up crazy sci-fi gadgets and the like. It's also more of an action thriller than sci-fi, seeing as the action mostly takes place in the 80s. Basically, the Terminator is an unstoppable force that follows Sarah and Kyle wherever they go no matter how many bullets he takes or explosions he endures. It's a non-stop thrill ride that really gets your blood pumping.While the movie thrives mostly on your amazement with the Terminator, wondering if he'll ever be stopped and how much carnage you'll get to watch along the way, eventually you get hooked on the future/sci-fi element as Kyle tells Sarah all about what's going on or he tries to convince the police to believe him. What makes each scene so attention-grabbing, however, is the mechanical nature of the way Cameron has shot this movie. Everything the terminator does is filmed in a very sequential manner, using lots of angles instead of constant camera movement. What's interesting is that he films construction vehicles and other normal machines we're used to in the same way, using close ups as if they're working on their own, without humans. It's his way of using the present to foreshadow the future.The acting in the movie and love story that develops between Sarah and Kyle are among it's biggest weak points. Hamilton is good, she really stands out as the most normal, human thing about the whole film, but Biehn is terrible as a lead actor. He comes across as creepy and odd and you only like him because he's helping Sarah, so when she starts to like him, you're kind of grossed out. Someone stronger would have made this a nearly flawless action film. So while "Terminator' may seem like an example of a classic because of Schwarzenegger and all the action and explosions, it really leaves its mark as showing how capable Hollywood can be of creating an entertaining AND believable future, inspiring future films (no pun intended) to do just that.
They don't get more typical '80s teen comedy than "Better Off Dead." Savage Steve Holland's debut feature even goes so far as to have the main character challenge the jerk jock to a ski race in front of the entire school down a supposedly untamable mountain. Basically, that either makes you want to throw on a pair of leg warmers and freak to some synth pop or it doesn't. Those who hold '80s comedy in high regards will likely consider "Better Off Dead" a treasure, everyone else will be amused and eternally grateful that era is gone and never coming back.Everyone can at least be grateful to this film for launching the career of would-be teen icon John Cusack. Though he wouldn't cement his legacy in that decade until Cameron Crowe's 1989 film "Say Anything," he's an instantly likable softie with a tough exterior as Lane Meyer, a teenager whose girlfriend with which he was unhealthily obsessed has left him for the high school's ski team captain to better serve her reputation. Life seems to do nothing but suck after that for Lane, who half-heartedly attempts suicide to comical results.Filling Lane's universe is a kooky family along with a space case mother (Kim Darby) and peculiar science wiz little brother, a demon child paper boy who has come to collect, a best friend (Curtis Armstrong of "Revenge of the Nerds" fame) who will snort just about anything and a big-boned dorky neighbor who's turned a French exchange student (Diane Franklin) with an eye for Lane into his personal pet.Some of these characters and gags are just off-kilter enough to work, particularly the clueless mother and her terrible cooking and Lane's little brother Badger who's constructing a space ship from homemade parts, but others like the recurring paper boy gag are terribly forced and unfunny. Such is '80s humor.Holland also uses a few out-of-place techniques that would work better as integral parts of the story. Instead, they come off as odd side ventures. One is when Lane animates his ex on his sketchpad in the lunchroom and it starts talking to him, the other is when Lane takes up a fast food job and imagines a Frankenstein creation sequence that results in an anthropomorphic talking pork burger. Such is '80s humor.With a 50-50 joke success rate, the impetus moves to the story to win out with heart, but down the stretch it clings to the overused '80s mold of boy discovering a new girl and then triumphing over the jerk, etc. And please don't call me out on spoilers; you know what's going to happen in this movie 20 minutes in, that's how obvious the pieces are. You simply have to be the type person who loves to eat the '80s up like comfort food to see "Better Off Dead" as more than just an amusing film.~Steven C
If an alarm didn't go off in many people's heads when "X-Men" and "X2" director Bryan Singer left the third X-Men project for "Superman Returns" and "Rush Hour" director Brett Ratner was hired in his place, it should have. While a lot of the fault for lauders of this movie can be put on writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn for letting the script get way too out of hand, Ratner lets this film become what Singer would have never let it: about the plot and the action and not the characters."X-Men: The Last Stand" takes place not long after "X2" at the announcement that Worthington Labs has developed what they call a "cure" for the Mutant X gene. Naturally, this upsets both schools of thought: Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) human and mutant cooperation/coexistence and Magneto's (Ian McKellen) mutants are superior and should embrace their abilities to the fullest at the expense of humans. Magneto uses the cure as a symbolic way to rally mutants for his cause and to take immediate action while Xavier takes the cautious and civilized approach.There's a lot more to the plot than this, but to describe all these subplots would require too much effort. That's the point: there's too much going on and while it makes sense, that doesn't mean it plays out well into a 100 minute movie. Take for instance Magneto's right- hand woman Mystique (Rebecca Romijn). She is imprisoned in a dangerous mutant transport vehicle and in the scene after Magneto discovers a way to get her back. Maybe 20 minutes and some major scenes later, we finally get back to the truck and Magneto's plot to get her back. If consecutive scenes like that have to be split up to make way for all this other material, it should be a red flag that this movie is overloaded. It might all make sense, but it inflicts serious damage on character development and themes.Another serious misstep in this script is the addition of too many characters. Singer would never have brought so many new characters in. There's Beast (Kelsey Grammar) as U.S. Secretary of Mutant Affairs, Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Warren Worthington III (Ben Foster) and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore, who did make a brief appearance in X2) all on the good side alone. That's absurd. Plus, Halle Berry, who plays Storm, requested a bigger role in the film, so she gets more attention in addition to the other characters from the first two films that we're already familiar with. You simply can't expect your viewer to invest emotion let alone believe in the characters with all those names to follow. ***Slight SPOILERS*** With people dying like it's their job in this film, it's not all that helpful when we're not moved by it. One tip might be not killing so many characters before the climax of the film. There's a reason people usually die at the end of movies.Sure, the characters all aid the plot in some way, but that's just plot. Characters need to exist to be developed or minute enough to move the plot but not generate interest. Some characters (a lot of the bad guys) do just exist to be cool, but too many exist in this limbo area of seeming important but really just moving the plot.Another problem with the script is dialog. You know the fast-paced action movie cliché of ending scenes with one-liners? Yeah, "X3" does it a lot. The President says some really awful lines and even the great Sir Ian McKellen can't deliver all of his lines in believable and not cheesy fashion. Plus, many of the lines are squeezed in to service the plot or enlighten the audience to something they may not know. Another sign that you should stop writing a movie like this is when you have to force people to say lines just to create comprehension.All that badmouthing aside, this is a visually stunning movie. The action is top-notch and the special effects are unlike anything you've seen in this decade. That alone makes this valiant attempt to pack all this into a movie worth price of admission and 100 minutes of time. While it might have been more appropriately done in 120+ minutes, it keeps your attention and moves quick, almost enough to overlook the flaws. For people who can step back and see what the writers tried to do as opposed to how they did it, you have to give them credit for a good idea. It's just the execution and Ratner's inability to keep humor out of things even when it's not necessary. Singer didn't care if you laughed but the writers and Ratner clearly believed it was part of the action movie experience. So there is a letdown factor for those that loved Singer's work with the franchise, but for everyone else, this is high in entertainment value.
"The Perks of Being a Wallflower" will be a relevant book for a long time, and consequently there's nothing dated about Stephen Chbosky's unique coming-of-age story now that it has finally hit the big screen so many years later. Anchored by strong performances from its leads and a powerful sense of poignancy, "Wallflower" is a thoroughly meaningful and enjoyable film.To come clean I've never read the book, but when an author tackles his own work as both writer and director, it can sometimes spell disaster. When adapting their own work, the creators of original source material either fail or succeed beautifully; either they can't do what needs to be done to their baby in order to make it suitable for film or they completely understand how to translate their work. Chbosky appears to have hit upon the latter.As a director, Chbosky's strength is capturing the nostalgia of his story, the emotions in particular from the unadulterated mirth to the sad, sad loneliness. With such talented blooming actors at his disposal, the film becomes all about them and we can't help but identify with them.The world of "Wallflower" is stereotypical high school, but somehow, even though countless films do the same thing, "Perks" feels authentic. Maybe its the setting of Pittsburgh, the king of blue-collar cities, along with the early '90s setting. Regardless of when you went through this phase of your life, there's something so identifiable in the way this film presents it.Charlie (Logan Lerman) is one of those protagonists that we all identify with too, and that's ultimately what makes this story powerful. We all have times when we feel like we didn't fit in, when we were ignored, when we felt like no one noticed us. And because Charlie wants to have friends, he isn't afraid to put himself in situations to succeed socially, we like him a lot. He's not the kind of loner who spurns the world around him.We meet Charlie upon his first day of high school. It's rough to be a freshman and Charlie has no friends. None. Everyone he was friends with as a kid has spurned him in some way and his best friend took his own life the previous spring. He's afraid to do anything to stand out, to embrace what makes him special. Fortunately, he puts himself in position to meet Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), two seniors who don't fall into any clique other than their self-described "misfits" label. They are sweet, genuine people (as characters and the actors playing them) and they embrace Charlie. We come to love them in a vicarious way, for reaching out to Charlie as we ourselves would like to.Another part of what makes "Wallflower" a great story is that while we identify so strongly with Charlie at first, we eventually come to learn more and more about him and to the point that we can't even truly imagine what it's like to be him. We both pity him and come to admire him all the more for having a strength we're not sure we could ever have.The bulk of the film showcases their adventures, along with Charlie's growing affection toward Sam and his relationship with other friends in their group. Every little scene evokes something keen, namely what we loved about being in high school. Drama and serious issues crop up too, but with them comes the implicit understanding that these were the problems we faced in high school and even if we would do things differently now, that's what we probably would've done then.Not enough praise can be given to the trio of Lerman, Miller and Watson for bringing those feelings to life. Lerman is brilliant when it comes to portraying Charlie's introversion and communicating the mess in his head that we don't fully comprehend until the end. He should drop the Percy Jackson act and find more indie projects.After seeing "We Need to Talk About Kevin," I thought I would never like Miller, ever, and always associate him with that terrifying title role, but he nails the courageous and flamboyant gay best friend, embodying the stereotype and then subverting it. His line delivery cuts the tension at the most ideal moments and he's the most lovable part of the movie by far. Sam is the weakest of the main characters, the girl next door with a troubled past that likes all the wrong guys. We're given her very much as Charlie sees her or any lonely teenager with a crush on the one he thinks he'll never get sees her. Watson, however, does a nice job keeping Sam's fragility with her at all times. When she's happy, it's an emotional breakthrough, and we get more of a sense of her character on the inside in spite of what the script gives us."The Perks of Being a Wallflower" doesn't break ground ground from a cinematic or storytelling perspective, but it does what it does  chiefly appeal to the emotions  as good as any movie out there.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Sometimes it takes watching a two-hour film set in a prison to understand part of what life is about. At least "The Shawshank Redemption" has me convinced that's the case. This movie is one that does all the little things right and ultimately lets the story do all the talking--a story of hope and finding meaning, purpose and motivation in life or sometimes quite frankly, to live.Writer and director Frank Darabont, who is the unquestioned king of adapting Stephen King prison stories and turning them into touching motion pictures, debuts here as a director who has an understanding of when to leave excessive artistic tinkering out of a film. Having created this outstanding screenplay, the script and the images flow seamlessly together throughout this film, so much that even the big moments feel naturally styled. He uses dark and light contrasts and some repetitive images to create a slightly fluctuating monotony to the prison life and those are the only "tricks."The story is that of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), convicted to Shawshank Prison in the opening minutes of the film to life x2 for the murder of his wife and her lover. The film then shifts to the narrative of Red (Morgan Freeman) who has been a con at Shawshank since he was very young. While the film focuses on what happens to Andy in this vortex of inhumanity, what you don't realize is how the story is really about Red and what Andy makes him realize. Andy is a smart and clever guy and most of the first hour of the film is about how he brings some humanity to the prison and a mentality that is not common in a place with guys serving life terms.Robbins was definitely ripped off on an Oscar nod. Its not that he blows you away with his dramatic skills, but it's that as you watch him you never once question his integrity as a character. Sometimes being that believable should be worthy of an Oscar, not just over- dramatic talents or actors playing unique roles. Freeman, however, gets his nod and that was also deserved. If I could have anyone narrate my life, it would be Freeman.The second hour of the film turns it into a bit of a thriller as the warden (Bob Gunton) turns corrupt and begins to test Andy's limits. While many films do this, what makes "Shawshank" special is that you figure things out just as they are about to happen, which is satisfying. It's not too early that you think it stupid, but it doesn't come out of nowhere either. This hour of the film picks up the pace and brings it from just a depiction of prison life to something special and it's crucial to making the film as enjoyable as it is."Shawshank" is not one of my favorite films, but it's the kind of film I could stop and watch every time it's on TV just because of its prevailing positive attitude. While it is so dark, it is so positive and motivating as it give the benefit of the doubt to those who do wrong. It's unforgiving, but then it becomes redeeming. The way it makes you conform to a prisoner's confined mindset and takes you out into the real world in just snippets that seem just eye- opening like the scenes in the grocery store can give you a whole other perspective on life. That and the script just writes itself out exactly as you know it should. Rarely does a film leave you as satisfied as this one does. While it might not be an artistic masterpiece of cinema, it is truly one of the greatest stories Hollywood has ever told.
"American Pie" should be better known to the world as "the comedy that launched 1,000 terrible movies." This is the film that slapped a sticker on the genre "Teen Comedy" and convinced movie producers everywhere that the way to attract the overpaying audience of teenagers is to give them movies focused around sex and sex jokes. While "American Pie" certainly deserves that rep, lost in it all is what makes "American Pie" better than all those movies (including those of the same name that followed it). This is a comedy that despite glorifying teenage sex, has an sense of genuineness that anyone who has graduated high school can't deny and that's what makes it stand out.The film follows four friends who make a pact to help each other lose their virginity by prom night. Nice, simple and vulgar. What makes the comedy tick is that these friends are all different and attached to teenage stereotypes. Naturally, they find themselves in situations with women that come into conflict with these stereotypes or make for comedic opposites. This is a character-focused gag comedy. It's not slapstick, but all about gags making you empathize even more with these characters. While it's all very formulaic, it works somehow. You laugh and yet you have some vested interest in what becomes of the characters.Credit to writer Adam Herz for creating such memorable characters, though the actors themselves are half the success. Director Paul Weitz knows when the script is at its strongest and helps get these young actors to make some believable stuff despite their insensitive hijinx. Somehow, he gets a believable performance out of Chris Klein, for example, who plays Oz, the jock who decides to "extend himself." Normally he'd seem like a junky character, but his unlikely relationship with Mena Suvari's character works despite just an OK script.Most importantly, it must be stated that this film kind of operates with the liberal mindset of those who understand teenage sex happens so you might as well make it into something funny. To its credit, the film does address issues of safe sex and being in love and having sex, but that's not to say the film addresses moral issues, because quite frankly, it doesn't hold them with high regard.So as much as I want to hate "American Pie" for all the stereotypes and formula work, there is a lot of strong work being done with this film. It has terrific characters and most importantly a sense of being true to real life--though only the real life of one who accepts teenage sex as part of real life. The fact that Weitz was able to get these great performances out of a bunch of 19 and 20-year-olds is really impressive. So despite all the ridiculous gags and unnecessary jokes and bad movies the followed, "American Pie" really does work on a higher level and deserves to recognized for its contribution to pop culture (The term MILF has transformed the porn industry) and the comedy genre.
Never underestimate Martin Scorsese. Just because "Hugo" lacks in F-words doesn't mean the master filmmaker is so out of his element that he couldn't possibly put his stamp on this family-friendly film. In fact, "Hugo" might be the most personal of the director's catalog. Based on the novel "The Invention of Hugo Cabret" by Brian Selznick, "Hugo" begins as a period piece fairy tale mystery and blossoms into a love letter to cinema in unexpected yet charming ways. Brilliant 14-year-old actor Asa Butterfield stars as Hugo, an orphaned boy who lives in the walls of a Paris train station in the 1930s. Scorsese portrays this world as a living painting brimming with potential for adventure, and though what awaits behind the door comes grounded in fact more than fantasy, it's not less magical.The blue-eyed Butterfield wins hearts instantly as the lonely Hugo, a boy who lost his father (Jude Law), a clockmaker whose only legacy to his son ended up being a wind-up automaton that the two were working on putting back together. With the hope that the automaton will reveal a final message from his father (or psychiatrically speaking, give him closure), Hugo steals mechanical pieces from a toy-shop owner (Ben Kingsley) to fix the broken machine. But when the toy-shop owner seizes a notebook from Hugo containing detailed diagrams of the automaton, Hugo begins a quest that will bring him closer to solving the mystery than he ever imagined.Hugo befriends and teams up with the toy-shop owners goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), a wide-eyed bookworm with a self-proclaimed love of adventure and secrets. Considering this is the same girl that swore up a storm in the action-comedy "Kick-Ass," the fact that she's so convincingly pure and innocent is a true triumph. Scorsese chooses to show her and Butterfield as angels only faulted by their unguarded optimism. The entire film ends up as a successful exercise in sweeping the audience into a heart-driven story and diverting attention from issues with some of the film's more practical components such as plot cohesion and character motivation. To elaborate would spoil the film, but those unfamiliar with the source material would be interested to know that the story connects to the birth of film at the turn of the 20th Century, which in large part explains the interest of an auteur such as Scorsese.Ironically or perhaps beautifully, "Hugo" also comes in 3D, and stunning 3D no less. Filmed in (not converted to) the extra dimension, not only does the film avoid issues of blurriness, but Scorsese also uses it to enhance the experience on numerous levels. Considering "Hugo" is far from an action film, the 3D must be utilized more creatively, and who better to experiment with this than Scorsese? The depth of field that 3D enhances allows him to focus on certain objects in certain ways and do tracking shots that feel as if they're literally moving somewhere. In one scene, Sacha Baron Cohen, who plays the train station's inspector, leans over slowly as he verbally reprimands Hugo, and though slow and subtle, the way he inches slightly toward the audiences magnifies the anxiety we are to feel in that scene. As easy as it is to bash 3D for its gimmicky origins, "Hugo" proves that in the right hands, no film technique should ever be shunned.The story's picturesque innocence and more importantly heart drive the rest of the film. Hugo's quest for purpose in life amidst his personal loneliness and tragedy lead him to discover others who in turn prove he's not alone in these struggles. As he and Isabelle get closer and closer to their discovery, the film also asks us to recall the essence of motion picture filmmaking and reflect on its vitality. Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan beautifully emphasize this through the use of side characters in the train station, including Baron Cohen.So although the number of physical high jinks as well as dogs and cats might be disproportionate compared to vintage Scorsese, he elevates this simple tale of friendship, discovery, movies and the reinvigoration of the human spirit to a place few can.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Having seen all of Wes Anderson's other feature films, "The Royal Tenenbaums" strikes me as the one project with which anyone can connect to Anderson's work. Everyone can relate to a dysfunctional family and Anderson's colorful and unique cast of characters portrayed excellently by his all-star cast might make "The Royal Tenenbaums" his best work.The film is about a family of child prodigies whose patriarch, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) ignores them as children and presumably causes all three children's lives to turn out poorer than expected twenty years later. When they are adults, Royal tells them he has a terminal illness, which reunites the family so that he can try and right his past wrongs.Hackman gives a praiseworthy comedic acting performance with his excellent portrayal of Royal. Danny Glover's character puts it perfectly when he says to Royal "I don't think you're an asshole, but your kind of a son of a bitch." You like him because you can tell he means well, but he's definitely a jerk in the way he behaves. Of all the children: Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow) and Richie (Luke Wilson), Paltrow shines the most. Her performance as Margot makes her the most interesting sibling and she truly excels in a role different from any that she has previously played. She excellently portrays the shy, personal, inward behaviors of her character, but you can see the desire for love and affection in her face and eyes. Angelica Houston as Mrs. Etheline Tenenbaum is also at her best in comparison to all of her other roles in Anderson's films, perhaps because it is the biggest role in all of them, but she's still very good at doing both the dry and the serious.Anderson really does a great job showcasing these brilliantly conceived and humorous characters of his and co-writer Owen Wilson's. His trademark single angle wide shots of scenes and full front mug shots of characters are both abundant and effective in the film, allowing you take in all the characters as much as possible. Even when a character is in the background of a scene, you're still learning about him or her.It's really the themes that stand out in this Anderson film. Anderson seems to do his best work when focusing on family and the desire for harmony as well as personal happiness. As the film progresses, it is amusing to see Royal turn from the character that is to blame to the only character who seems to have things figured out. Anderson shows that sometimes it takes a lot to get people to see what matters most, but he affirms that people can indeed find it and in turn make their lives better. With all this and still the dry, deadpan humor of Anderson's films, this proves a fine trademark work of his.
It was only a matter of time before WWII/Holocaust drama and Edward Zwick found each other. "Defiance" is the perfect little-known underdog war story that perfectly fits Zwick's ("Glory," "The Last Samurai," "Blood Diamond") tastes. Historical war drama with a heavy action slant as per usual, "Defiance" has all the elements that anyone who's enjoyed Zwick's past work is looking for: lush cinematography, gripping action and a strong leading male role played by an elite actor. At the same time, for a Holocaust story that hasn't already received the silver screen treatment (a rarity these days it seems), "Defiance" seems like it's been done before and doesn't fully extend its audience the extraordinary experience its unique premise suggest it capable of.For a different take on the Holocaust, "Defiance" follows the true story of a band of Jews who averted capture in Belarussia but were forced to hide out in its forests. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber play Tuvya and Zus Bielski, two daring, able-bodied and rather vengeful brothers who lead the group of nearly 1,000 Jews.The plot's most unlike the other Holocaust films in that it doesn't require pity and horror from its audience in order to become emotionally attached. That attachment is not as strong compared to these other films, but in this film, the Jews are largely in charge of their destiny. Craig's character has no less of a self-awarded license to kill than James Bond does when it comes to the liberties he takes killing German soldiers. At times it almost becomes tough watching Craig and Schreiber blowing Nazi brains out, and the whole revenge factor with the Holocaust is somewhat uncomfortable. I welcomed this feeling, but the script doesn't pray on our challenge stomaching some of its images and just lets them fizzle out before they can turn into something deep. The characters never become as troubled as we are by what they do, which really holds "Defiance" back.The neatest part of the script by Zwick and Clayton Frohman is its old testament imagery. The story of the Jewish people has sadly been about constantly escaping persecution and the way the film tries to reawaken the images of Exodus and running from the Egyptians and crossing the Red Sea really puts this film in a greater context of Jewish history. It's not about the tragedy of the Holocaust itself, it eludes to being a lot more. Still, there's more to be desired on this front too -- it's not exactly made integral to the story being told.There's a lot to enjoy about Zwick's film as there always is with him, even though the story underachieves more than many of his other films have. The action is exciting and modern without detracting from the historical context and the forest is captured beautifully on camera. If only it had been written in a way that would've gripped its audience with tender, intimate scenes revealing character instead of speeches about fighting. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
If 1979's "Alien" was the original hypothesis that the best science-fiction thrillers are psychological, then John Carpenter's "The Thing" is the study that proves it true. A remake of John W. Campbell Jr.'s 1951 classic "The Thing from Another World," Carpenter's re- imagining is another brilliant execution of quiet suspense that gets quickly into your head and hooks into your brain.Kurt Russell, Carpenter's star from "Escape from New York," takes the driver's seat again as one of a team of scientists living in Antarctica when a helicopter with two Norwegian scientists arrives at their facility trying to shoot down a husky. The Norwegians are killed and the husky lives, only the husky is actually an alien from another planet that survives by taking the identical appearance of the organisms it kills. Having had the dog in their possession for 48 hours, the men realize that any one of them could be a thing, causing a huge build-up of distrust and tension.The key part that makes "The Thing" stand above most other alien/creature/monster kills off a group of people one-by-one movies is that last bit about distrust. In other films, the creature is identifiable -- a shark, an alien, etc., but in "The Thing," it could be any of the characters -- now that's both terrifying and awesome. Instead of a thriller where we're just curious about the gruesome way in which the creature will kill the next random dude, we get the simultaneous thrill of wondering which person the creature is. It's like rolling a mystery into a sci-fi horror film.The nice part about that dual entertainment is they feed off each other. While we're busy wondering who isn't human, Carpenter can fully utilize shock and awe when the thing actually does attack and boy, does he ever. The amount of prosthetics and mechanical devices used to create the constantly moving spool of guts mixed with slimy Venus fly traps that is the thing and the people its imitating are incredible. More than 25 years later you almost wish more films stopped pushing computer-generated images so hard and stayed devoted to developing better and better prosthetics. But can shear paranoia and suspense along with the fulfilled promise of excellent visual effects drive a science-fiction story? Apparently so. Russell is the only known actor and there's not a whole lot to the characters other than the way they deal with their fear and paranoia. Another less obvious reason "The Thing" works so well is the parameters the story sets up for itself. Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster establish a very specific set of rules for what the thing is and isn't capable of, even going so far as to show us the science of how cells from the thing devour other living cells. We know that the thing only reveals itself when its alone with its victim and that it is driven primarily by a survival instinct. These rules lend legitimacy to the story and make it much more interesting for the viewer trying to stay a step ahead of the plot.When it comes down to it, "The Thing" is just smart formula film-making, even though the formula arguably came after this film. It has a director with impressive horror and suspense credentials in Carpenter, who directed "Halloween," one of the greatest film composers ever in Ennio Morricone to do the suspenseful, haunting score and a creature with more than meets the eye who wreaks psychological havoc on the characters and consequently, us. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Woody Allen has proved to be a filmmaker of many talents in his five-decade career, yet he continues to  every few films  push himself into new territory, and he's done so with "Blue Jasmine." Cate Blanchett stars as the severely troubled titular character and she and Woody prove to be a perfect match for each other, though not quite in the same way as Diane Keaton, Mia Farrow, Scarlett Johansson (arguably) and Penelope Cruz.I haven't seen every Allen film, but "Blue Jasmine" might be his only true character study. Relationship studies? Been there, done that. This, however, is a piercing psychological portrait of the main character and so it comes as no surprise that Blanchett's performance is surrounded by awards talk.Jasmine is a middle-aged woman who has moved out to San Francisco to live with her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins), because her world has fallen apart. For years she was married to Hal (Alec Baldwin), an impossibly wealthy New York businessman, but he was discovered for fraud (among other illegal practices), convicted and imprisoned, so Jasmine has lost everything. After having been surrounded by wealth and ease since before she was even able to graduate college, Jasmine's state of being is certainly less than stable. She occasionally hallucinates flashbacks of her "previous life" and pops Xanax at the first sign of discomfort, which is often. Allen is well known for characters with neuroses, but Jasmine is a walking diagnosis. Considering she was spoiled rotten her whole life and turned the other way when it came to her husband's business dealings and promiscuous behavior, it's also incredibly hard to have empathy for her.That's where the real power of Blanchett's performance (with credit of course to the screenplay) comes in. She nails the side of Jasmine that's teetering on the edge of insanity, but the fact that she can convey the complexity of Jasmine's wounded soul and earn sympathy points with the audience is a feat of the highest commendation. Allen has a history of unlikable lead characters, but Jasmine could have easily ranked among the worst given her sense of privilege. Allen does a good job grounding the character well enough to us to truly consider her circumstances and invest ourselves in the story.The supporting players are an unusual lot for Allen in terms of the actors, but they fit more into his mold as characters. Hawkins, who has been tearing up the British independent film scene for years now, finally gets herself in front of a larger audience as Ginger, who deals with the brunt of the Allen-esque sister tension. Hawkins takes the archetype of the woman who dates big blue-collar guys with tempers and can't seem to break the pattern and turns her into an independent, progressive character. Ginger wrestles with the change in perspective that her sister brings, namely the idea that she deserves better. Her taste in men brings in a most intriguing trio of men for an Allen film: Andrew Dice Clay as her ex- husband, Augie, Bobby Canavale as her overly sensitive new beau, Chili, and Louis CK  of all people  as Al, with whom she has a fling.The film is told with extensive flashbacks to try and create a sense of how Jasmine's brain works, with constant triggers to past memories. These memories show key moments in the rise and fall of Jasmine's marriage and life of wealth and slowly tell us more and more about her character. They also illuminate tensions between Jasmine and Ginger, which stem from the fact that Hal's demise essentially caused Ginger's split from Augie.The script highlights socio-economic tensions and divisions in society and challenges the idea of what it means to be wealthy, happy and to have your life in order. Jasmine's attempt to reinvent herself in San Francisco shows just how hard it is to live in a way that's less luxurious than you're used to. In this way, Allen has done so much more than tell another great story about a neurotic character with relationship problems. His choice to not put his comic bent on this particular film shows just how seriously he feels his main character's problems are in the world we live in."Blue Jasmine" lacks the charm of Allen's comedies and the dark, harrowing twists of his dramas, but it still has his fingerprints all over it. How refreshing to see him apply his techniques and story devices toward making a film that explores the deeply troubling divisions embedded in our society as represented by the main character rather than just making another statement about the life of the upper-middle class through characters bickering over trivialities. And all this at 78. Bravo, Woody, bravo.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more!
"In Bruges" is a very interesting film, and as dull as that term is, it truly feels most appropriate. Writer/director Martin McDonagh's first feature length film is somewhere between a European crime comedy reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's work and an existential drama. Sometimes this works and sometimes it honestly becomes schizophrenic: a marketing nightmare. I'm not surprised it was released in the off-month of February as a result. The film is an experiment that pays dividends in ways, mostly in humor and characters, and feels curious and strange in others when it comes to the more dramatic moments. As with most experiments, it's the kind of film that some people won't be able to stand and some will flat out love.The film starts off as it was marketed, as the off-beat Euro crime comedy. The premise is simply that Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) are hit men and their boss (Fiennes, who doesn't appear until an hour into the film) tells them to lay low in Bruges and await further instructions. The city thus plays a vital role in the plot and especially in the film's deeper meaning. The gentle balance between the humor and the themes of personal inner turmoil is where the film goes schizophrenic. The first hour is mostly all lighter and the second is substantially darker. The humor exists throughout though it grows darker as the plot does.I found the humor to be the greatest strength of the film. Each joke is sort of a swift punch in the gut: you laugh hard very quickly but it doesn't linger for long. The characters were obviously instrumental in this. Though I felt Farrell's characters was a bit too all over the place, he was really quite excellent at showing his inner monologue whenever McDonagh had a shot exclusively of him with no actual action or dialogue. Gleeson is also a terrific supporting actor and brings an interest to Ken though he's not the funnier of the two. Fiennes, though his time brief, does as he always does in sucking your attention toward him. When he plays an antagonist, he always steals moments in films and this really isn't an exception.The hidden gem of this movie is the notion of Bruges as purgatory or perhaps even hell and the way it psychologically affects the characters and their thoughts about life and death. How much you like "In Bruges" will pretty much depend on how well you make that connection and it resonates with you. It's easy to get caught up in only the humor of it the film and totally miss all that, or in some cases that thematic content simply is too subtle. In general, I felt that because it set the tone early on as an only minimally dark crime comedy, those themes fell short with me. So while I think "In Bruges" is one of the more interesting films I've seen lately, it didn't click with me all the way.
Never has a coming-of-age story been crossed with dystopian historical fiction, or however you might describe the world of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel "Never Let Me Go" and its film of the same title. The contrast in narratives works in an effectively haunting manner here: the youthful idealism of growing up with the exposed underbelly of a seemingly perfect world. Some people will not be able to accept the society created by the film, others will see it as an opportunity for unique character study, but Mark Romanek's work leaves a definite impression.Romanek ("One Hour Photo") sets the tone of a period piece. Without the narration of Carey Mulligan's Kathy, we'd be left utterly confused. As she reflects on the past, the film takes ups back to a boarding school named Hailsham in the '70s. The children are not brainwashed, but they're sheltered from outside influences. We only sense trouble through a peripheral character, a teacher played by Sally Hawkins, who takes it upon herself to tell the children they're being raised only so that they can serve as organ donors and that they might as well learn to love the little life that they'll get to experience.Miss Lucy is dismissed the next day, but the children don't seem to mind. To them, life is about discovering the opposite sex and typical pre-teenage things. Kathy in particular is drawn to Tommy, a boy who is made fun of and prone to fits of rage. They begin to form a bond until Ruth, Kathy's friend, goes after Tommy and the two become an item. The story continues when the trio becomes 18 years old and then again 10 years later. All the while, their fate becomes more and more prevalent to the viewer but almost never to them until it's too late.The toughest part about "Never Let Me Go" is having to accept the notion that certain children are raised only to be harvested for their organs. There is no typical sci-fi expository dialogue or other information provided through narrative. At the beginning of the film we are simply told that in the '50s a cure for all ailments was discovered and that eventually people began living to 100 with ease. Writer Alex Garland deliberately makes the choice to never satisfy our curiosity in hopes that we might focus more on the greater notion of Ishiguro's novel, which suggests to us what it is that truly makes life meaningful.Bringing this message home are three of the most gifted young actors working today: Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley. Knightley has the most experience of the trio, but she demonstrates an ability to act younger than her age quite well. We saw Mulligan do the same in "An Education" and Garfield also possesses a youthful quality (hence why he was cast as Spider-Man). In their expressions and reactions we feel that sense of life unfulfilled, of not truly understanding their lives, their unfortunate purpose and the consequent emotional void they possessed.That said, these emotions are not easy to relate to and occasionally the romantic subplot takes our attention away from truly processing their emotions. Romanek's camera gives the film the beauty it needs, but there are dull moments throughout. The pivotal scenes are quieter and brooding, asking us to open our minds more than our hearts in order to truly understand why the story was crafted this way.Mulligan's pitch-perfect voice-over dialogue at the end brings some needed clarity to the story and may prompt a second viewing, one less focused on plot and understanding the societal context and more interested in studying character. There's a beautiful notion about the insignificance of the length of our days, but the lesson doesn't feel perpetually in progress so much as we're awakened to it at the end. Nevertheless, the touching performances and delicate craftsmanship make "Never Let Me Go" a decidedly strong film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Far and away the most emotional film of 2008 is the biopic of openly gay San Francisco city supervisor Harvey Milk. As a biopic, "Milk" may not seem like a very innovative or eye- opening film; we've seen films about crusaders for Civil Rights before, where small groups of citizens ban together to fight a large oppressive force, even where the hero is killed in the end. But even still, with Gus Van Sant at the helm and a handful of talented actors young and old, you've never seen a film like "Milk."Harvey Milk is played by Sean Penn, who continues to amaze audiences everywhere with not only very deep and believable performances, but transformative ones. In his best role since his Oscar-winning performance in "Mystic River" and his most astounding since "I Am Sam," Penn is at surefire Oscar caliber. He captures everything from the hard-nosed politician side of Harvey Milk to the soft, effeminate side. He's so incredibly natural through every aspect that you don't often think about how good Sean Penn is: you're thinking about how interesting Harvey Milk is.But we've seen incredible performances like this in film's of this nature. What changes all that is Van Sant. Though it's been a decade since his landmark film "Good Will Hunting," you wouldn't know it after watching "Milk." His greatest strength is to bring characters their humanity, to make each scene and all the dialog appear so real and natural. His camera is an observer, not an interferer. He picks and chooses his unique shots very carefully to enhancing meaning and not create it.This also strengthens the amazing supporting cast. Emile Hirsch, who starred in Penn's "Into the Wild" last year, continues to make the case that he will indeed be a great actor like the film's star, in his role as activist and community organizer Cleve Jones. Josh Brolin even makes Dan White--the supervisor that clashes with Harvey and ultimate brings about his demise--a character worthy of our sympathies. Van Sant gets the most out of everyone in this film, because this picture to him is very clearly about the movement more than the man.More than anything else, "Milk" is a story about the gay rights movement in 1970 and how San Francisco became the center of it thanks to the larger-than-life attitude of Harvey Milk. In his first major credit, writer Dustin Lance Black impresses, though his script has trouble reconciling the Harvey's personal life and his political career, ironically much like Harvey himself does. The film's core lies in what Milk meant to the movement and what he accomplished, not as much in how an openly gay man struggles in both his personal life and in his career when he chooses to do something like this. It's definitely there, but it's second. Still, the writing sensitively weaves all the aspects of Harvey's life together."Milk" is an emotional film. It doesn't try to be politically sensitive--those who do not support homosexuality will not find fair treatment from Van Sant and the film as a whole: they are the enemy. By focusing on the people that poured their lives into this work, "Milk" has you quickly identifying with the struggle that gay activists and gays in general dealt with at the time and to an extent still very much do today. It seeks to open the audience's eyes to the gay rights movement's history, using a lot of actual 70s footage. If you love this film it's because you get swept up in the emotion of the movement and the characters that so naturally fight for it and care about it and nothing else. Black and Van Sant are careful, however, not to portray Milk as a martyr--there is no liberal Hollywood agenda against conservative Christianity. This is about what Milk accomplished while he was alive and what he meant to the movement he fought passionately for.
If you're an actor with any degree of prominence, you've probably asked your agent to get you into the next David O. Russell picture. Including "American Hustle," the dude has helped his actors to 11 Oscar nominations in his last three films, with a nod in every major acting category each of the last two years. That's unheard of. Needless to say, "American Hustle" is a tremendously acted film, perhaps the most well-acted con movie ever."Hustle" is the kind of film you'd expect from Martin Scorsese, not Russell, who has shown a distinct preference for family drama in his previous films, "The Fighter" and "Silver Linings Playbook." This is a story about deception, corruption, the American dream and love muddling up all of it.Set in the '70s, "Hustle" imagines the story behind the FBI's famous Abscam sting, in which the feds, with help from a convicted con-man, exposed several corrupt politicians by disguising an agent as a fake Arab sheik who offered them money for help with illegal activities. The con-man was Melvin Weinberg, the basis of the film's main character, Irving Rosenfeld.Christian Bale drastically transforms his appearance (yet again) to play Irving, this time putting on significant weight and giving himself a sophisticated comb-over. Watching him, you'll be in shock that this is the man who played Batman for three films. Irving is a businessman who owns a chain of dry cleaners as well as a con artist with a sharp mind and a big heart. So big, in fact, that after we learn how he fell in love with Sydney (Amy Adams), we discover he's a family man with a wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and a son.The script uses voiceovers for each of the main characters to provide some insight into who they are. Sydney, for example, has longed to be anyone but herself, so instead of ditching Irving when she finds out his main line of work, she takes on the persona of a British lady with banking connection in London. Together, they con desperate lowlifes who think they'll land $50,000 on a $5,000 investment.Everything changes when FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) catches them in the act. Knowing he has them by the throat, DiMaso leverages their haplessness into helping him set up sting operations. If they comply, he'll drop everything he has against them and let them walk. They start by setting New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) as their mark. As they develop and carry out Abscam, however, DiMaso's brazen behavior gets them all way over their heads.Every role in Russell and Eric Warren Singer's ("The International") screenplay gets ample material to work with, which is part of what makes "Hustle" such an incredible ensemble film. Even Lawrence, who plays the wild card character who has little to do with the actual plot, gets a few meaty scene-stealing moments. It might be her best performance yet in terms of proving just how diverse an actress she can be.Adams also does some of the best work of her career. An Academy darling with four nominations in six years, Sydney is her most worthy performance of any of them. The role effectively showcases her one-two punch of toughness and beauty in a way previous roles haven't. Sydney is independent-minded but hopelessly in love, dangerously seductive but morally conscious. Given her outfits, you'd make assumptions about here character, but you'd be wrong.Cooper's character is hot-headed comic relief as the FBI agent driven by dreams of catching the big fish. Richie controls the pace of the film and Cooper uses that to his advantage. He's another character with a distinct moral "direction," as sometimes he's a confident go-getter, sometimes he's a baby and sometimes he's everywhere in between. Renner's Mayor Polito is also complex; most con marks in a film are despicable scumbags, but he might be the most likable character in the film.Much of the dialogue was improvised, so that tells you how much of a character-driven film this really is  actors truly becoming their roles and bringing out instinctual emotion on screen. A version of this film could've been easily done in a way that focused entirely on the intricacies of the scam, setting up situational humor or melodrama as a result of strictly plot points. "American Hustle" takes on a life of its own with these actors/characters really playing off one another. Production pieces such as costumes and a killer '70s soundtrack set the stylistic tone more so than the direction or the screenplay.As much as the talent sets "American Hustle" apart from similar genre entries, it's a con film at heart, in which the satisfaction comes from a big twist and seeing who comes out on top when the smoke clears. Although this movie does push the message of people believing what they want to believe, Russell's previous films had more thematic and emotional weight to them. "American Hustle" is more entertaining, but less fulfilling  a fun con movie with phenomenal, praiseworthy acting.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
After tackling rats with chef skills and voiceless robots on journeys of self-discovery, leave it to Pixar to make the star of its latest film an elderly man and continue to defy Hollywood's long-held belief that animated films have to zero in on children and concepts that can be marketed into hats and toys and backpacks. Heck, in "Up" even animals talking are explained rather than simply taken for granted. But what sets it apart from other Pixar gems is that it's the animation studio's most inclusive for-the-whole family adventure to date.It's no surprise to anyone anymore that Pixar leads field in terms of computer-generated animation and while "Up" continues this tradition, that's not its specialty. "WALL*E" is still more of a spectacle and innovator. "Up" is Pixar's proof that they can combine beautiful, heart-filled storytelling with laughs for every age group and adventure and action to boot and *still* make a killing at the box office.On premise, most analysts wouldn't predict a film about 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen ballooning his house to South America to honor a promise to his late wife to be even close to a box office success in the genre of animated family films, but attach the name Pixar and anything is possible. Dogs with collars that turn their thoughts in words and the dynamic between a young boy scout named Russell who accidentally was on Fredricksen's porch when the house took off and an old man prove to be more than enough for great comedy and entertainment.Sure, the plot itself once they get to South America leaves something to be desired, and the feasibility of an old man who can't walk down his stairs being able to hold onto a dangling rope with a boy, a dog and a large bird on the other end will fail to suspend many adults' disbelief, but there is never a moment devoid of something clever or meaningful in the entire film. The fresh and humorous concept proves quite forgiving as does the touching motivation in the story of Carl doing this for his dead wife. The montage through their years together is incredibly powerful for happening so early in the film. Pete Docter and Bob Peterson do an excellent job, though obviously Pixar's constant success must be credited to John Lasseter. Next to "WALL*E" whose innovation, imagination and genius themes might never be repeated in animated film, "Up" is Pixar's best to date. There is honestly something for everyone: the elderly will relate to Carl's struggles with aging, loss and unfulfillment; children will find plenty of physical humor to enjoy between the hysterical dogs and Russell's slight lack of smarts; and the ages in between will find the story touching and the concepts and their execution nothing short of genius. And for once, Disney is even politically correct/inclusive in the diversity of characters.
Just because it happens to be a very good movie, calling "28 Days Later" more than a zombie flick is inaccurate: Gore and other general zombie fare that's turned these movies into a genre are still the film's main vehicle for delivering entertainment. What it does differently, however, is make you think a bit more, make you feel a bit more. The zombies might be mindless, but director Danny Boyle's film is far from it.The premise is one we've heard before: an uncontrollable outbreak of a disease turns people into raging zombies who lust for blood and violence. The location is London and the protagonist who doesn't get infected is Jim (Cillian Murphy), who wakes up from an accident 28 days after the breakout to find London abandoned. In his quest for survival, he meets other uninfected people and together they try to find others to begin life anew.The first thing worth mentioning is that if "28 Days Later" were just another zombie movie, it'd still be one of the best because of Boyle. The "Trainspotting" director's style is unique, striking and suspenseful. He gets multiple angles for many of the major scenes and edits them to fire off rapidly or slowly to give a sense that the characters are being watched. He places the camera in all kinds of intriguing places to get provocative shots and it gives the story its own special life.Alex Garland's screenplay is also special. In his second time working with Boyle, Garland creates a concept that doesn't merely serve for great suspense, but acts as a social metaphor for war and violence as indicated by the opening seconds of the film. The mere concept of "rage" spreading quickly like a disease is quite smart. It's not allegorical or driven all the way through the film, but it's there and it makes the film more respectable and interesting. Jim is also a great protagonist, being both innocent toward the beginning but willing to take risks and he evolves into quite the hero in the film's final act. Murphy is a definite talent: a subtle one, but very good.Then again, "28 Days Later" is also just a good suspenseful zombie movie with a very fine director who understands how to apply his style to a different genre effectively. Everything else is sort of like free dessert.
You can't really classify "Donnie Darko." It's not really a horror film though many parts are told that way. It's not really science-fiction although it is focused on time travel. It's also not really a drama because it has several humorous parts. All that considered, it's not surprising that the film fell under the radar and developed a cult-classic reputation. The reason being that whoever had the task of distributing this film would have a hard time figuring out how to advertise it. But for film lovers, that doesn't matter, because no matter how you identify "Donnie Darko," you're likely to at least deem it a good if not great film."Darko" takes place in the Maryland suburbs and centers around the life of its title character and his family. Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teen with a troubled past that only gets worse when he starts sleepwalking at the beg and call of a giant bunny named Frank who tells him the world will end in 28 days and leads him to commit a series of crimes. Along the way, Donnie finds himself learning about time travel, wrestling philosophically with his teachers and he becomes involved with a girl named Gretchen (Jena Malone from "Stepmom"). The film makes out to be a character study of Donnie but eventually becomes much more than that.Gyllenhaal is excellent as the intelligent but clearly off-kilter Donnie. The schizophrenia is portrayed all too well by the actor of course with the help of Richard Kelly, who really creates a believable distinction between normal and deranged Donnie. Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mother is also very good as is his sister, his also biological sister Maggie Gyllenhaal. Even Drew Barrymore as Donnie's English teacher stands out in this film.While the acting is good, this is clearly Richard Kelly's film. He has without question put an incredible amount of thought into this project and it really shows. While the time travel aspect of the plot is pretty out there, Donnie is definitely portrayed as a realistic teen in a realistic family with normal family issues. At no point do you feel forced to come to terms with the ridiculousness of the premise. You are pulled in by who and what Frank is and the film delivers on that end as well. Rarely do supernatural characters come down to earth like Frank does in the film. Kelly's juxtaposing sequences and fades make the film a very effective mood piece as well. At first you're expecting something more out of the horror genre, but eventually that simply becomes part of the many moods that makes "Donnie Darko" so unique.Perhaps the film's only true weakness is that thematically it feels a bit jumpy and cluttered. There is a lot going on and a lot to think about and it doesn't seem to feel connected from scene to scene. As the film ends you begin to think about the many different ideas raised and not one clear thing comes to mind. While it does make it rather rich for discussion, it's hard to come away with exactly what Kelly was trying to say. Perhaps the biggest idea is the very clearly established continuum that runs between extreme fear and extreme love. Those ideas echo throughout everything although sometimes clearer than others.Perhaps the genre that it is assigned (independent) serves "Donnie Darko" best, but the film clearly demonstrates in ability to cross lines and appeal to everyone, mostly through its intricacy. You can tell Kelly knew exactly what he wanted in every shot and what little hints and trivia he wanted to drop throughout the film. "Darko" goes to show that films about people at their core, regardless the genre "assigned" them can affect people and impact a wide audience.
One has to judge "Gentleman's Agreement" in the context in which it was made. This was a landmark film, one of the first socially responsible films in movie history that barely escaped the clutches of the government's inquisition of communism in Hollywood as well as numerous movie industry bigwigs who didn't want it made. Few films are true achievements in a socially relevant sense, even today, but "Gentleman's Agreement" managed to reach that level in a time when the movie industry almost always kept its nose out of real-world issues.The film's focus is anti-Semitism in the United States, which more Americans had become aware of due to the crimes of the Nazis during the Holocaust. Initially a novel by Laura Z. Hobson, the title refers to the unspoken agreement between members of a community to not allow Jews to live in their neighborhoods. It tells the story of an investigative reporter named Phil Green (Gregory Peck) who decides the best way to report on the issue is to experience it firsthand, so he tells everyone he knows that he's Jewish. Judaism is abstracted in Moss Hart's screenplay. Other than talking about anti-Semitism and John Garfield's role as Phil's Jewish friend David, there's no actually Judaism in the film. Conceptually, however, it looms over the entire picture. The actual portrayal of anti-Semitism is small at first and grows into a few blatant acts that finally add some drama to the film.Understandably, the film tries to be as equal parts a classic Elia Kazan romance with intimate and fragile characters the audience grows fond of quickly. In 1947, producers could never make a picture that dwelled entirely on an issue, let alone something as taboo and hush- hush as anti-Semitism. Romance was a must and "Gentleman's Agreement" delivers that entertainment value. Phil's romance with Kathy (Dorothy McGuire) is passionate and convincing, even if their arguments, spurred on by Phil's devotion to his "project," seem ticky-tacky.Kazan transfers the passion of their rocky love to the film's message of discrimination in the form of ignorance, not merely in outward verbal attacks or violence. Powerfully brought to light by Garfield's character, "Gentleman's Agreement" begins to introduce the concept of prejudice to the American people. That anti-Semitism can be as easily perpetuated by remaining silent as much as by acting out is something I would imagine the public needed to hear.The scripts construction comes off slightly amateur, but with intention to spell out the issue at hand. Things take some time to get rolling and the plot can be slow at times, trying to find conflict in the small anti-Semitic errors some of the characters make, but the cast really holds it all together, conveying the urgency of the problem so well to the audience. How much clearer does it get than having an Oscar winner in Anne Revere, who plays Phil's mother who has taken ill, deliver a passionate speech about wanting to live long enough to see a world in social harmony? If that doesn't get your attention, then you haven't quite found the true significance of "Gentleman's Agreement."~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Films like "Hotel Rwanda" are important. When it comes to genocide, the human race needs constant reminders that just because we've managed to stop it once before, it doesn't mean it won't happen again and isn't happening right now. The war between the Hutus and the Tutsis in Rwanda in the early '90s is just one example and it's portrayed in a meaningful and emotional light in Terry George's film."Hotel Rwanda" tells the courageous story of Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), a hotel manager who saves many lives, Tutsi and Hutu alike, by hiding refugees in his hotel and bribing Hutu military leaders to protect them. It's an up-and-down story of how one minute they feel safe with the UN there to help them and the next minute they've been abandoned and left for dead. Rusesabagina, however, is always trying his hardest to do what he feels is right. He is empowered and his leadership becomes invaluable.Though Don Cheadle had been around long before this film, this is without question his breakout role. A much deserved Oscar nomination for a performance that is winning of your heart and sympathies. He might not have the command or the intimidation factor of a Denzel Washington or Will Smith, but that's what makes him so right for this film--he is an unlikely hero of sorts.The story is excellent, focusing mostly on what happens to Paul and his family, placing some context to the fighting by adding in the audio of a propagandist Hutu radio show promoting hate at various intervals during the film. In general, the film doesn't address the conflict as much as focus on the individual story, so while you develop deep feeling for the characters, the impact of the conflict itself in the historical sense is not as strong. This is also not as violent of a movie as it would seem. Although George is not timid about showing you a body count, there is minimal blood and there are no really disturbing images. Some people might need to see it to really feel the impact, but in a sense it's commendable that such a strong and affecting story could be told without a "gross-out" factor. It also makes this a strong educational film that everyone can learn from.
Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon, you say? So another Bourne movie? Although those names combined with the trailer combined with Damon's character Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller going rogue combined with mention of a code name person/project that Damon's character wants answers about might indiscreetly imply the fast-paced action of renegade assassin Jason Bourne, "Green Zone" is entirely different. It's a politically-fueled historical fiction thriller that blends Operation Iraqi Freedom facts with a conventional but effective conspiracy plot.Miller is in charge of a unit investigating potential WMD sites, all of which have been fruitless to this point. With no confirmed discovery of WMD, Miller starts asking questions of the intel he's been receiving, questions which wrap him into an amoral vortex of war politics involving a government official named Clark Poundstone (Kinnear) trying to cover up the mysterious intel source called "Magellan" and a CIA man (Gleeson) who plans to use Miller to thwart Poundstone. Also in the mix is Amy Ryan as an American journalist looking for similar answers.The action of the film centers around Miller trying to track down the jack of clubs, aka one of Saddam Hussein's men who's on the Iraq's most wanted playing cards. In general, however, there is not a ton of action, at least not the kind of combat that one with Bourne-sized expectations would be looking for. The suspense and intensity comes from Greengrass' guerrilla-style filming. It's like the camera is documenting Miller as he goes on these fairly dangerous missions, much like an embedded journalist would.The downside to this gritty feel, which in present times can only be compared to "The Hurt Locker" despite the enormous differences between the films, is a bit of "Cloverfield" syndrome. Don't sit too close to the screen during this film -- after awhile the hand-held camera starts to unsettle even the least motion-sick of moviegoers. Without question Greengrass makes "Green Zone" a unique and much more intriguing film with this technique -- one to stand out among other Iraq war pictures -- but two hours without a single tripod is tedious."Green Zone" is a fairly conventional story adapted by Oscar-winner Brian Helgeland from the book by Rajiv Chandrasekaran. There aren't many surprises and at times it lapses into trite thriller dialogue, namely the poorly nurtured scenes between Ryan's journalist and Kinnear's prick-ish bigshot. One gets the sense that war thrillers that try to stick closely to historical accuracy are not Helgeland's ("L.A. Confidential," Mystic River") strength, but the film moves quickly and for much of the first hour feels rather genuine, taking Americans back to "shock and awe" and reminding us of how at first we truly felt going into Iraq was not only warranted but also right.Miller's skepticism of the intel reflects the views of most Americans back in 2003, that desire to hear the reason we were in Iraq when no WMD were found. For an action thriller that's kind of oddly political. The film's anti-war statement (did you see that one coming?) fights with the suspense for your brain's attention, but messages aside, "Green Zone" never gets to the point where it stops being entertaining or interesting. Greengrass might have stuck your retinas in a blender and kept it on high the whole time, but it doesn't undermine his strong ability to convey intensity on film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
I'd normally consider it a cop-out to label a film exactly like another and purposefully avoid direct comparison between two films, but "Due Date," starring Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis as polar-opposite travel buddies thrown together by unwelcome circumstances, bears more than just a resemblance to John Hughes' "Planes, Trains & Automobiles." In this case, 21st Century update is spot-on.The 1987 film with Steve Martin and John Candy was not so much a yuck-fest as a humorous story of two incompatible folks with different social attitudes who learn to get along. The same can be said of Todd Phillips ("The Hangover") new film. Few surprises exist in "Due Date," which sticks to a conventional "road trip that keeps getting worse" formula, but the dynamic between Downey Jr. and Galifianakis make it an enjoyable cross-country romp through familiar territory.Downey Jr. plays Peter, an expecting father heading home to Los Angeles in time for his wife's (Michelle Monaghan) planned C-section in a few days. While on the plane, fellow passenger Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis), a clueless and eccentric aspiring actor en route to "Hollywood," lands the two of them on the no-fly list after a "terrorism" mishap. The two must journey together (along with Ethan's dog Sonny who has a unique "talent" to put it mildly).Galifianakis plays a more fleshed-out version of his "Hangover" character. Ethan is slightly more eccentric and twice as naive/ignorant. One scene has them stuck at the Mexico border because he misread the "Mexico" sign as saying "Texaco." The stand-up comic certainly has a knack for the lovable idiot. His character is so dumb he's most certainly undeserving of sympathy, but Galifianakis earns that back. Downey Jr. plays his quick-tempered foil and the one whom we naturally identify with, just as we do with Martin in "Planes." Most of the mishaps are fairly run-of-the-mill. Ethan smokes marijuana for his "glaucoma," so check off pot jokes. You may also check off ignorant car accidents, the consumption of ashes, physical assault from unlikely assaulters and masturbation. Hard to ruin a movie with that typical of a list.Like "Planes, Trains & Automobiles," the journey of the two characters provides the heart of the story. Peter can't bring himself to totally screw over Ethan and ditch him despite the simplicity of such a feat due to Ethan's minuscule intelligence. Rather than being two warring personalities, their relationship remains dynamic through the entire film and keeps that storyline interesting enough to the point where the predictable gags don't run (or ruin) the show."Due Date" is certainly funny, but more so in moments and quotes than in the comedic situations. The acting earns laughs while the situational humor in the writing is hit or miss. Perhaps that's only because the film sticks to a tried and true formula as opposed to carefully manufactured and clever plotting as in "The Hangover." But while formula usually spells disappointment at the movies, "Due Date" is money and time well spent. There's a reason John Hughes films are timeless, and even if "Due Date" completely hijacks that quality, there are times when familiarity can be a good thing at the movies.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
"Julie & Julia" is not about food so much as it is about setting goals and creating opportunities for personal achievement. In this way, famous television chef Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and foodie blogger Julie Powell (Amy Adams) have more in common than a passion for cooking. Acclaimed romantic comedy filmmaker Nora Ephron juxtaposes both womens' stories to illustrate this in her film and though it's a conclusion that doesn't require two long hours to cook, the life-like ups and downs and feel good moments of "Julie & Julia" make it an affecting and personable film.Thriving on the performances of Adams and even more so Streep, Ephron's vision to interweave two equally interesting story lines works despite the extra minutes consequently tacked on. Objectively, this is Julie Powell's story as without her the story of Julia Child is irrelevant in this film, but Child is a compelling figure and Streep playing her makes it even more so. Powell is a recently married woman with a desk job who gets the idea to start a blog about cooking, specifically trying to cook more than 500 of Julia Child's recipes from her famous book "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," all in just one year. Ephron then takes pieces from Child's "My Life in France" and tells the story of how she came to be a cooking expert and publish what eventually became her French cooking tome. Ephron tames these equally magnetic stories, splicing them at great commercial break cliffhanger moments to keep our attention.I personally found the Julie story a bit more dynamic and interesting. There's some bias there as I'm also a blogger trying to establish myself as a writer, but I think anyone who feels or has ever felt bogged down by a job that they're not passionate about who needs to own something and find something to succeed at whether as a hobby or something more will find interest and certainly some comfort in Powell's story.On the other side of the coin is Streep's performance and Julia's relationship with her husband, Paul (Stanley Tucci). It's certainly not your average on-screen romance, but "Julie & Julia" is all the better for it. Finally a film where love does not factor in as much with the plot. Both these women were inspired or supported by their husbands and their relationships were an integral part of their success in this way. Streep and Tucci have a playful and adorable chemistry. They have fun together -- they're partners -- and that's all too often lost in cinematic romance.Streep as Julia, however, is the focal point of that whole side to the story. It's very much Streep being Julia more so than Julia. You notice that same sense of humor we've seen more recently from her in films such as "Mamma Mia!" but she takes it to Julia's level. It feels very natural yet it's also a complex portrayal. You can feel her fear and her fearlessness alike in Streep's performance and the way she responds to life in general including its challenges."Julie & Julia" is foremost a story of how when passion and dedication meet, wonderful things happen because no adversity lasts for long in the face of that combination. These women found their passion in cooking and stayed dedicated because of their personal relationships and both found lasting fulfillment from it.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Filming a play poses a great challenge. Filming "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" marks a whole other level of challenge, especially in the hands of a rookie director as Mike Nichols was at the time. But on the shoulders of stars and real life husband and wife Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, "Virginia Woolf" commands attention amid all its source material's unpleasantness.Edward Albee's play is a sickening portrait of American suburbia, of people feeling compelled to create illusions of themselves in the public domain because of a childish inability to cope with their faults or private disgraces. After a party, George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor) are one such couple who decide to trade jabs at each other after Martha invites a younger couple from the party over for a nightcap. Little do Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) know that they're to be an audience and then some for George and Martha's perverse "games."George and Martha are downright nasty, exposing each other's secrets, assaulting each other verbally and physically and coming off as absolutely detestable to the audience. Amazing, however, how that doesn't injure Taylor and Burton's performances. They're so impeccably good at being awful people. Taylor is something else as the childish and brash Martha. At first it's George we feel bad for because she's so immature, but then George begins to insult the guests and has a knack for exacting his revenge on Martha with verbal cunning.All four actors earned Academy Award nominations (two won) and unarguably, this does deserve to be one of the only films of all time to have its entire cast nominated. The mousy (as George accurate calls her) Dennis stands out in particular as the brandy-guzzling Honey, the innocent character who more or less gets spat on during the film.Nichols chooses a heck of a debut picture. Starting his career and a master comedian improviser, he started directing for the stage and clearly found no trouble adapting to film. He uses a very Hitchcockian approach to the film, carefully choosing very wide above shots and getting very close and even zooming in more tense moments. He certainly understood that capturing these performances and highlight the cast's strengths was priority number one."Virginia Woolf" has and will continue to rub first-timers the wrong way. It's a tough story to enjoy even with the moments of levity, but Nichols and the cast do Albee's work great justice and effectively pull off the mask for the audience as the playwright initially intended.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
An indistinctive stew of genres best describes Peter Jackson and Co.'s attempt at adapting the Alice Sebold novel "The Lovely Bones." Part murder mystery, part family drama and part Salvador Dali painting, the film suffers an epic identity crisis which it hopes to mask by drowning you in evocative symbolism.Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan of "Atonement") is a 14-year-old who is murdered by a neighbor and finds herself observing the ensuing events in her family's life from "The In- Between," a purgatory she is stuck in until both she and her family can learn to let go and move forward. Susie's lingering spiritual presence in the real world allows her to give her family some unfounded suspicions toward the man who killed her, Mr. Harvey (Stanley Tucci).When no legitimate reason exists for a character to behave a certain way other than some sixth sense they have, it's tough to buy "The Lovely Bones" as the solving of a murder. The first 30 minutes of the film have enough emotional pull that we want Mr. Harvey to get busted pretty badly, but it's terribly unrealistic.The fantasy element of Susie existing in the in-between where the climate/environment around her changes constantly is an over-reaching metaphor that you couldn't care less about. Jackson's team makes this world a lot more visually impressive than films such as "What Dreams May Come," but the foundation of the story lies in the real world, the hook and crux of it at least. The symbolism of the gazebo Susie stands on to watch her family and the cornfield present themselves quite obviously, but the script provides little motivation to analyze them. The rest of the Salmon family dealing with the aftermath on the real world plane is far more interesting.The existence of two worlds permits Jackson to intercut a lot of scenes of one world with that of the other. Some of these scenes impress, such as Susie's father (Mark Wahlberg) smashing his collection of bottled ships in anger at her death while Susie sees large bottled ships crashing and shattering on the shores of the In-Between. The scene where Susie is eventually killed lasts close to ten minutes as well as it's intercut with what her family is doing at the time. Like much of this film, sometimes the technique works beautifully, other times it's executed until tedium.The surrealism quality and dual nature of the film keep it from achieving its metaphoric and symbolic goals with regards to death and moving on. Despite superb direction and visual effects, the elements are not seamless enough, try as Jackson might to link scenes together constantly. Emotional symbolism can never fully replace logic and the In-Between is presented to us without any clarity of rules. "The Lovely Bones" should have been a moving family story, not a scattered piece of art with family elements.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Blind ferrets, IBS, base-jumping ... "Along Came Polly" is one of those situational humor comedies that takes a basic romantic comedy plot and surrounds it with the bizarre whether it's ridiculous situations or zany characters. Creator John Hamburg takes two likely comedy protagonists -- a risk-assessing neurotic type (Ben Stiller) and the free-spirited unpredictable type (Jennifer Aniston) who come together after Stiller's character's wife cheats on their honeymoon -- and puts them in outrageous situations and dealing with strange characters to amp up the humor. It's hit or miss, but the creative thought behind it keeps it laudable and interesting.These are two characters that Stiller and Aniston have proved more than capable of playing. As their unlikely relationship unfolds, it's more about how they handle the more extreme characters and situations. Philip Seymour Hoffman, for example, is Stiller's best friend is an "actor" who still tries to pretend as if a movie he did years ago gives him an excuse to be arrogant. Hank Azaria plays a french nudist scuba instructor as only he -- master of accents -- can. Alec Baldwin even plays the unethical, awkwardly buddy-buddy boss of Stiller's character. It's not so much Stiller's ability to do comedy as it is for him to react to these actors doing great character work.The situational comedy is also incredibly diverse and wildly unpredictable: whether it's the first date where Stiller's IBS kicks in after eating spicy food and he can't discretely use the restroom or the scene when he and Aniston get in a fight while on a sailboat plunging through a storm so that the entire scene they're getting thrown around the set. Nothing is that incredibly funny, but it's all about unique situations that you haven't seen in movies before that amuse you as you follow the story."Polly" is not refreshing or innovative, but it's creative takes using traditional comedy techniques and its killer supporting cast keep it very entertaining. You don't really care if Stiller and Aniston stay together in the end, you're more interested in what the other characters are going to say/do/influence them along the way.
Before now, Godzilla was a giant dino-lizard, a punchline, a D-list movie monster. Now, in Gareth Edwards' "Godzilla," he is a god, the alpha predator, a force of nature. Warner Bros.' has not only crafted an exhilarating "Godzilla" movie here, it has pulled an incredible P.R. move, transforming a brand last known for having Matthew Broderick as its spokesperson.David Callaham, writer of "The Expendables," and Max Borenstein have grounded this version of "Godzilla" in historical fiction. Nuclear tests in the '50s were not tests but an attempt to destroy Godzilla, a last remaining vestige of prehistoric times. They also ground the film in characters, taking a lengthy amount of time to tell the story of Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). These characters both humanize the story and get us in close to the main plot.First we are taken back to 1999. Joe and his wife (Juliette Binoche) work for a nuclear power plant in Japan. Increases in seismic activity worry Joe, yet his superiors refuse to shut the plant down. When a spike in these electromagnetic pulses causes a nuclear breach that eventually destroys the city, Joe loses his wife. In the present, Joe has become crazed attempting to find answers. Ford, his son, an explosives expert in the Navy, reconnects with him when he must leave his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and son to go bail his father out of jail. Joe eventually convinces his son to go back with him to their old Japanese town and discover what the governments of the world are hiding there. Turns out the pulses are happening again.What results this time is the release of a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism (MUTO) that begins to wreak havoc as it moves across the Pacific. As the military creates an action plan, a Japanese researcher (Ken Watanabe) and his assistant (Sally Hawkins) draw upon what they've learned from Joe and Ford and theorize that Godzilla could be their only hope, the alpha predator looking to restore order to the food chain.Painting Godzilla as an ambiguous "good guy" we know little about works to the film's advantage and suits Edwards' style quite well. Edwards' indie monster flick (titled "Monsters") expertly created mystery, fear and awe around its monsters and Edwards does the same for Godzilla and the MUTOs (that's right, there are two). He captures the same sense of scale that Guillermo del Toro did in last summer's "Pacific Rim" and there's little doubt the master monster-making filmmaker would praise this effort.Edwards works a nice balance of teasing us with the presence of these creatures and giving us solid glimpses, walking the line of monster blockbuster and monster art film. He prefers shots that keep the human characters involved or come from their perspective so we not only get a sense for just how big and terrifying the creatures are, but we also feed off the raw energy of the actors' performances. Taylor-Johnson has been a leading man before, but he gets a lot thrown at him in this movie and makes it all work. Somehow (conveniently) he constantly finds himself in the monsters' warpath and it keeps things interesting.Multiple monsters also proves essential to the entertainment factor of "Godzilla." Yes, monsters fighting is enormously more delightful than a single monster leveling buildings, but it also gives us something to watch for as an audience to keep the wheels turning. Ultimately, this drives our interest in the film; not what happens to the human characters, who serve as a moderately compelling excuse for us to "get in" on the action. The resulting effect is that we get a Godzilla who is not just the big scary monster terrorizing the city, but an elusive creature driven by biological impulse, an "X" factor and one that we can root for. That's how it should be. "Godzilla" doesn't have to belong in the horror-action genre; he can be part of a supernatural action thriller. Godzilla also doesn't have to be the entire focus of the movie. Joe and Ford's story centers around what's going on with the MUTO, and Godzilla just sort of jumps in.Urban carnage is the theme du jour for blockbusters, so what Warner Bros. and Edwards have done with this new "Godzilla" isn't trend-shattering, but they've taken great care to their approach with reinventing a giant monster movie for a modern audience. They also don't assume that the people most interested in seeing a giant monster movie lack the sophistication to appreciate a little artistic nuance and thoughtful storytelling.~Steven CThanks for reading!

There are the grand emotional courtroom dramas that immerse you in the ethical dilemmas that stem from from the case itself, filled with quotable speeches from venerable actors; then there's "The Lincoln Lawyer" starring Matthew McConaughey. Based on the Michael Connelly novel, the film plays more like a crime thriller set in the legal realm, one that intends to be equal parts slick and ethically challenging. Rather than an honorable protagonist who must do the right thing in the face of great adversity to combat a corrupt justice system, Mick Haller is an alcoholic with a moral compass that would make your intestines curl."The Lincoln Lawyer" embraces the idea that the legal system is an open air-market where deals are cut left and right "justice" is nothing more than a word that keeps it from crumbling. Mick Haller puts bad guys on the street and makes a living off the legal fees of some of the scummier creatures in Los Angeles, but he's also seen his fair share of state prosecutors using big hammer on a tiny nail  that's just how it goes. However, there comes a time when every person's true moral character is tested.Haller finds himself in a tough spot when he agrees to defend a wealthy real estate agent name Louis Roulet (Ryan Philippe) who's been charged with assaulting and raping a prostitute. If he's telling the truth, the case seems pretty open-and-close, but he's hiding a few secrets that twist the case in unimaginable ways.Although terrific talent lines this film inside and out, the acting merely helps bolster the impressiveness of the gripping story. Director Brad Furman has paced the film perfectly with the exception of the last 15 minutes; there are essentially no dull moments. Solid legal thrillers can wrap around your brain with the slightest of ease (why else would "Law & Order" still be on television?), but the true challenge lies in telling a unique story. No rival comes to mind to Haller's ethical quandary.McConaughey's swagger makes him perfect for a sleazy lawyer, but the emotionally troubled alcoholic side of the character  the part that can't sleep at night  doesn't lie outside of his acting boundaries. Although neither the script nor the direction ever tests him for too long in this regard, he embodies the role to the point that it does add something to the film. In my experience, McConaughey's never been better.Actors such as William H. Macy, a still-underrated Ryan Phillippe, Marisa Tomei, Josh Lucas, John Leguizamo and Bryan Cranston all provide excellent fits and stud out the cast, but the stars remain the thrills of the story and Furman's superb pacing.The film's ethical dilemmas and insights provide for some relatively strong chewing, but but "Lincoln Lawyer" rides suspense and engaging dialogue like a Lincoln Town Car into the sunset.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"The Meaning of Life" takes the Monty Python gang back to its sketch comedy roots--not that "Holy Grail" and "Life of Brian" weren't sketch-oriented, but they were sketches within a continuous plot line. "Meaning of Life" is tied together only with the thread that the sketches are all supposed to be about discovering the meaning of life. Not being loyal to a standard plot structure opens up a lot more possibility for the six comedians and the result is satire that comes across more clearly than any of their previous films. At the same time, there is a slight sacrifice of humor--specifically hysterics--but the brilliance of the social commentary wins out.Written in a series of parts, "Meaning of Life" travels along the life cycle (from birth to death) in search of reason for our existence. What the film discovers (and we find out), however, is that we've got a lot of meaningless crud in the way and we're too stupid and ignorant to understand life or appreciate its miraculousness.As a film built brick by brick using sketches would seem to, "Meaning of Life" is enjoyed scene by scene. Some will stick with you and make you laugh, others will twist and poke fun at your very understanding of reality. Most memorable are scenes like the musical romp "Every Sperm is Sacred" which is meant to show the benefits of being Protestant (you're allowed to put rubber on your John Thomas). Some are true to "Holy Grail" fashion, like a tiger in Africa, when a British general (John Cleese) during the conquest of Africa goes off in search of his main officer's legs to find Michael Palin and Eric Idle dressed in a tiger costume, attempting to deny such claims. The best satire of the film is when John Cleese shows his class of apathetic students a live demonstration of intercourse, a hysterical commentary on education, namely sex education.Other moments of satire that prod at the film's greater idea are scenes such as the two Americans on holiday in presumably Hawaii who go to a restaurant to order conversations off the menu, philosophy being one, for example. The point there is to highlight the meaningless chit chat over dinner that is often viewed as being important despite the obvious meaninglessness. Also, the Death scene with the grim reaper getting agitated by a few couples eating dinner together and treating him like anyone else makes a similar point about the phony ways people treat each other at times.Overall, the film constantly brings up the phrase "the meaning of life," but something always hinders it or distracts from it, or its significance goes unnoticed. Right from the start, the Birth scene where machines that go "bleep" are seen as more important than the birth itself, which is treated like a tourist attraction instead of a personal moment, Monty Python establishes its agenda.True, some scenes are total head-scratchers: the short film before the film involving old men accountants becoming business pirates and sailing their building in search of Americans to pillage, or the live organ donor scene. Not everything is poignant and certainly not everything is hysterical, but the fact that you can generally pick up on what they're trying to say makes it much more commendable.
In the east, specifically in China, war and fighting is art. To love many Chinese movies, you must have an open mind toward appreciating that idea, and to enjoy "Hero," you really have to be fond of it. The fight scenes are like paintings, the fighting choreography like ballet--if you can't take interest in that, well "Hero" can get a little boring or redundant at times, but overall, it's a film that attempts to uncover what truly makes a hero.The film stars martial arts master Jet Li as Nameless, a hero who comes to the king of Qin in China to bring him the weapons of three fallen would-be assassins, knowing their is a high reward for them. The king is more interested, however, in knowing how Nameless managed to bring down three of China's greatest warriors, so through a series of flashbacks, Nameless tells his story in effort to convince the king of his accomplishment and trustworthiness. With good reason, the king is wary of Nameless' intentions.It's not a surprise that Quentin Taratino has his name attached to "Hero" because of its similarities to "Kill Bill," at least in structure. There are various fights between Nameless and assassins Sky, Broken Sword and Flying Snow. Each fight seems to have some sort of visual theme to it. When he fights Sky in the earlier portion of the film, rain is the theme and various shots are meant to give the fight a completely unique look and feel from any fight you've ever seen before in film. One fight between Flying Snow and Moon, Broken Sword's servant played by Zhang Ziyi of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," takes place in a forest with pedals of dazzling bright colors blowing about. Color is a particular focus of director Yimou Zhang. In each series of flashbacks the costumes are a specific color as is the general color palette. It really adds some visual distinction to the film.Most surprising is how well the film manages to communicate the idea of what it means to be a hero. Is a hero one who avenges and uses a sword? Or is he something greater? In the historical context of pre-unified China and rival provinces, it's particularly interesting to consider.
The question "how far will you go for fame?" sounds like a tagline best suited for the movie poster for a dramatic thriller, but Martin Scorsese turns that idea into a satire of sorts in "The King of Comedy."Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is an aspiring comedian who worships late-night TV personality Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) and wants nothing in this world but stand-up spot on Jerry's show. After managing to finally meet his hero and receive a half-hearted promise to take a listen to Rupert's act, Rupert finds himself getting the runaround, but instead of backing down he continues to up his tacticsdrastically.The first big choice Scorsese makes (and ultimately what defines the quality of the film) is that we don't get to hear any of Rupert's stand-up. Given his desperation, lack of social graces and the fact that he lives with his mother at age 37 suggests he's a very persistent yet likely unfunny comic, but that's all we get. Scorsese wants to focus on a comedian's arduous climb out of obscurity, not whether or not Rupert is funny enough to deserve his big break. On the heels of his collaborations with Scorsese on "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull," De Niro gets to flex his comic muscles, or at least his quirky ones. Rupert is a bit out of his mind, but in the delusional sense, not the Travis Bickle sense. He's written with such ignorant charisma and the fact that he's nearly 40 suggests he has a few screws loose, as no one sane his age would have such determination despite Jerry and his people's clear indications that they want nothing to do with him.His crazy is only matched by Sandra Bernhard as Masha, a woman scarily obsessed with Jerry. She ratchets up the cuckoo to 11 whenever she steps into the frame and her presence is so shrill that you really start to feel for Jerry and other celebrities his character embodies. Neither the famous nor the not-famous are made out to be in the wrong here.The jumps Paul D. Zimmerman writes between reality and Rupert's imagination as well as Scorsese's choice to not provide any indication through editing that there's a switch from one to the other really puts you in the shoes of a dreamer. Anyone who's dreamed of being famous has imagined some big moment in their head, and in this case Rupert has pictured what it would be like to appear on the Jerry Langford Show thousands of times. Even if you don't identify with Rupert's tactics, you identify with his dream.Eventually, as an audience we get to the point where we start to withdraw from Rupert because we don't respect that he's not willing to work his way up like any artist trying to make it in entertainment. Even after a civil exchange between him and one of the show's producers in which she gives him some feedback, he still insists that Jerry will just put him on the show. It's not until Rupert gets desperate and puts his illegal plan to action that we begin to see the point of the film and respect Rupert more despite his crazy."The King of Comedy" is a smart and honest portrayal of what someone will do for fame, albeit an off-beat one. In the wake of two great Scorsese-De Niro collaborations, it unfortunately gets overlooked due to its simplicity. That might be so, but it doesn't make the message of following your dreams any less true.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out moviemusereviews.com
Blockbuster sequels were notoriously tough to pull off before the superhero movie renaissance of the 2000s, and "Spider-Man 2" in 2004 was the very best follow-up we'd probably ever seen, with a number of the critics praising it more than Sam Raimi's original. Personally, I prefer the first "Spider-Man," but there's no denying the sequel's many strengths.Ultimately, Peter Parker's (Tobey Maguire) personal journey elevates "Spider-Man 2" above everything that preceded it, unless of course you happen to have my personal attachment to the first film. Peter's struggle to reconcile himself and Spider-Man drives the core of the movie and it goes on quite the wild ride.Having come to the powerful realization that being Spider-Man comes with the cost of keeping distance between himself and the ones he loves, Peter finds his personal life in a downward spiral at the beginning of the film. He has been fired from his pizza delivery job and can't pay the rent, fallen behind on his schoolwork and his secret identity has caused a strain with his best friend, Harry (James Franco) who wants Spider-Man dead, as well as kept him from coming clean to his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) about his uncle's death.Then there's Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the love of his life, who has moved on thanks to his peculiar way of being around her. When he fails to arrive on time to see MJ's play thanks to a crime-fighting pit stop, he realizes he has no part of his act together. Even his superpowers have been slipping up.Peter has advice coming at him from every which way, even his physician. The most profound advice, however, comes from Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), whom Peter is writing a paper on. With Harry and Oscorp funding Octavius' fusion energy research, Peter gets to meet one of his idols. Octavius tells Peter that intelligence is a gift and not a privilege, and also drops some hints as to how important love and companionship are.But it's pride that causes things to go wrong with the doctor's experiment. When the energy becomes unstable, he refuses to shut it down and it results in his wife's death and the injury of others. He himself has four giant mechanical arms fused to his spine with no way to inhibit them from controlling his neural pathways. Dubbed Doctor Octopus, he becomes preoccupied with rebuilding his technology and fixing his ego, no matter the cost.Doc Ock presents a formidable challenge to Spider-Man and Molina does him justice, but the choice for Doctor Octopus seems arbitrary. His story never fully intertwines with Peter's, and his character development reduced to talking to himself. He simply could have been more of an example for Peter to learn from, but with the movie so focused on Peter's personal journey, not much else gets a fair shake, even if that character development is in fact what makes it so good.When Peter decides to stop being Spider-Man, it comes in the form of a second act when something that serious could've been a whole film. The script handles it well and Raimi truly brings us along with Peter's thought process, but it happens as an epiphany in the story and feels rushed. Consequently, Peter and MJ have so many changes in their feelings about each other throughout this movie that it could've been comical if not for the continued strength of Maguire and Dunst's performances.The romance wrenches as it did in the first film. The fact that these two can't find a way to be together absolutely kills and it drives up the emotional catharsis of the movie, playing a huge factor in why so many people love "Spider-Man 2."On the opposite side of things, the action is visually stunning, with props to the team behind Doc Ock's appendages. Even if the sequences don't have much of a role in driving the plot, they're fun to watch. Doctor Octopus' need to rebuild his machine drives all of them, which make his motives seem a little weak. The elevated subway train fight toward the end is the unquestioned highlight, but nothing necessitated a fight on a train. Still, it's an exhilarating sequence and the nice touch at its end involving Spider-Man's mask adds an extra something to the character development as well."Spider-Man 2" does an excellent job building off the first film's foundation, shooting the Peter Parker/Spider-Man character out of a canon now that we are familiar with him. The genius of the franchise to this point is that we're always on the same page with Peter's emotions and it doesn't change despite all the ups, downs and changes of heart that he endures in this installment.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Don Jon" has something to say. Joseph Gordon-Levitt very clearly saw something troubling in the way that pornography and sex in the media has impacted how people think about sex and relationships, and so he decided to write and direct a movie about it.Gordon-Levitt also stars as Jon, the epitome of a New Jersey stereotype, who cares about little else except family, friends, working out, his car and women women both real and on his computer screen. Jon can land just about any girl he wants, but in his mind, nothing can take the place of Internet pornography. He finally comes face to face with the notion that he has an addiction when he can't shake his need to watch porn despite it being his new girlfriend Barbra's (Scarlett Johansson) number one request.For those curious how what kind of approach the charming leading actor takes behind the camera, Gordon-Levitt loves playing with sequencing in this movie. Jon is a routine guy: go to the club with his guys, make eye contact with a girl, dance with her, take her home, go to church, confess, get road rage, eat with his family, go to the gym, etc. (with porn of course interspersed). Gordon-Levitt ropes us into that routine to best understand Jon and how his lifestyle feeds his addiction subconsciously.The curveball of the film is Julianne Moore's character, Esther. After Barbra coerces Jon into taking night classes, he meets Esther, who catches him watching porn on his phone and proceeds to engage him about it. Her role is meant to break Jon's routine, to challenge his thinking about love and sex. She's not merely a tool to these means  she has her own complexities  but she has a distinct purpose, as with all the characters. Take Brie Larson as Jon's sister, Monica. Every time we see Monica she's staring at her phone and completely unengaged. But an actress like Larson doesn't get cast a screen filler simply meant to show another form of addiction (phone attachment) that's a bit more rampant in society. She's a sleeper character, ready to make a meaningful contribution to the film when you least expect it.Everything is very planned in this movie. You can see the characters and scenes as pieces working together to teach us about the danger of having certain expectations about love and sex based on how it's portrayed in pornography, in romantic movies, the media, etc. You can clearly tell Gordon-Levitt's an intelligent guy and there's something satisfying in the way he so transparently makes a statement with his film.In doing this, however, the film loses its organic energy. The characters feel just a bit less real, the situations a bit contrived and the drama doesn't elicit a lot of emotion. The performances are excellent  good actors are needed to breathe life into characters who were created around ideas  but "Don Jon" doesn't hit you anywhere. It's the kind of film that will provoke discussion and appeal to those who enjoy analyzing film, but not necessarily win over folks looking for emotional escapism in their movies.Gordon-Levitt definitely has more directing in his future. He's learned a thing or two from folks like Rian Johnson ("Brick," "Looper") and Marc Webb ("500 Days of Summer") about edgy, contemporary filmmaking. He might be better off working from someone else's script, but there's nothing seriously wrong with this debut effort.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
"The Men Who Stare At Goats" is like a cleverly written essay only the writer never actually wrote a thesis. When it leaves you wondering "what just happened?" it's not because you don't understand it, but because you don't know what the point is. Included in the definition of art is purpose, and even if your purpose is to be purposeless, that is still a purpose. "Goats" is an unmemorable quirky war comedy that's strengths stop at great concept.The performances from a great cast in this story of "psychic soldiers" manage to keep this aimless film interesting. The film's final impression is one of bewilderment, but along the way you're convinced it's about something. It follows Bob, a reporter (McGregor) who goes to Iraq with something to prove and meets Lyn Casady (Clooney), who he once heard about from a source who told him a story about an army sect of soldiers training to use their minds as "weapons" and to psychically spy on enemies. Convinced there's some reality to this after all, Bob follows Lyn on a mission. Eventually they're kidnapped and other craziness -- the film also mixes in Bob's narration of the history of this group of soldiers.The movement, called the New Earth Army, was started by Mr. hippie himself, Jeff Bridges as Bill Django. The men called themselves "Jedi warriors," which as a Star Wars fan, makes the scene where McGregor asks about Jedi possibly the funniest in the film.Peter Straughan's screenplay, adapted by the Jon Ronson book, is where it starts going wrong. The jumping back to explain the New Earth Army mixed in with the modern plot starts to work at first, but when there's nothing all the exciting to reveal about the NWA, it stops increasing our interest in what's going on in the present. Director Grant Heslov is not the source of the problem technically speaking, but any lack of purpose in a film means the director is going to take some shots."Goats" is simply not what it's made out to be. The trailer does not take into account the chronological structure of the film and so it looks like a story being told about the NWA, not a reporter learning about it to no important end.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
There are only two schools of thought on "Borat" and its star Sacha Baren Cohen: You will either find him a comedic genius or an over-the-top, disgusting and truth-stretching con artist. A history major from Cambridge would suggest the former: an uncanny ability identify social stereotypes, generalizations and fears and exploit them for comedic purposes.Cohen, who made the Borat character mildly famous on his HBO program "Da Ali G Show" reaches his broadest audience by daring to make an entire movie, effectively posing as his character in real life situations and catching it on film along with the reactions of all those he has involved (or has duped, in other terms). The character Borat is a reporter for Kazakhstan's national television network who travels to America (the best country in the world, right?) to learn things that he can take back Kazakhstan. He is an embodiment of ignorance and prejudice (Borat is terrified of evil Jews and deplores womens' rights) posing as a foreigner who doesn't know any better. The results are genius and sometimes even sad in the pathetic way depending how you see it, but definitely over the boundaries of what we're used to. It's sort of an intentionally misleading documentary. Borat might be fake, but the reactions to him are real. Tying the plot together is Borat's discovery of "Baywatch" and adult film star Pamela Anderson and his decision to travel across the country to take her virginity. That is the through line, the rest of the film are scenes addressing all sorts of social and religious groups/classifications, or even just testing Americans' basic aversion to closeness with strangers in public or excessive nudity. "Borat" and Baren Cohen basically take all the things that we censor in America and put them right up front to see how we handle them.Truthfully, "Borat" is not a forgiving comedy, nor is it very mature on the surface. The male nudity is gratuitous, references to female genitalia are frequent, excrement is popular and anyone who doesn't immediately connect with the satirical purposes would find it racially and ethnically offensive in about every way possible. In other words, you have to be highly cognizant of Cohen's purpose or simply love all that stuff at face value to recognize "Borat" as one of the best and most original comedies in a long time.For the intelligent viewer, it's completely impossible to ignore all the genius put into this film. The film seems to be hardest on Jews, yet Cohen is Jewish and actually speaks in Hebrew frequently when he's ad-libbing in Kazakh. The Jewish couple he meets are the two cutest old people you'll ever see and he claims they've shifted shapes and throws money at them. In these scenes the humor comes from Borat's reaction, not the people he's 'duped' and the intention is to point out our blind prejudices. When Borat comes across a Gay Pride Parade in D.C. he says they're the nicest and friendliest people he's met in America -- because there's no fear of personal space invasion. On the other side, he gets some serious responses of bigotry from Americans just by prompting them in subtle ways that bring up homosexuality or the War on Terror. You can call Cohen un-American, but the British actor is only provoking and not stooping as to make the people in the film look bad by editing the film a certain way. Cohen and his incredible characterization talents far and away make "Borat" cutting edge and audacious comedy. Straight up ballsy. There might be debates elsewhere, but there's no question about how daring his comedy is. It also happens to be one of the most memorable and quotable comedies in recent years -- the scenes in this film will not leave you because this is such stand-out work.
A lot of crime and/or drug-related films about heavily-accented low lifes have come out of Scotland, Ireland and especially Great Britain and "Trainspotting" comes the closest of any of them to reaching a universality or something that everyone can relate to. Director Danny Boyle takes us along for the ride of what life is for desperate, lower middle class Scots and the strong and humorous script makes the film dare to shed some empathetic light on drug addiction, but it never quite takes us there."Trainspotting" follows the lives of a group of football-loving, heroine-shooting Scots, specifically Renton, played excellently by Ewan McGregor in the role that opened up the pathway for him to break into Hollywood. They deal with love, money and other things that young, single men deal with, but their first obligation is to heroine. Specifically through Renton do we see the struggle to fight addiction on physical, mental and even philosophical levels.The cast of characters are both humorous and believable. Even though some look and act quite ridiculous, they seem to capture the wild and erratic nature of a drug addict. McGregor shows all levels from the lowliest of actions to moments of civil and decent behavior and blends them quite believably.Boyle really makes the film interesting. His select use of wildly impossible and imaginative sequences and fresh angles on ordinary events make the film roll smoothly along for the first chunk of the film while providing a lot of entertainment. The way the narration and images work together in the screenplay and the great dialogue really make this work too and the soundtrack is unexpected but fitting in the style and genre choices. All this combines to scratch at what it is about why life for some people is drugs and how it plays a role in the lives of so many, particularly when the film focuses on Renton, but the latter portion seems to stray from that and go back to a focus on the rest of the ensemble and focus more on what happens to them. It's not nearly as reflective as the middle of the film gets at times."Trainspotting" nearly finds a way for these European English language films to be both true to genre and style while also reaching the next level in terms of meaning, but shies away from it in attempt to stick closer to the style elements. It's entertaining, but the untapped layer of meaning disappoints in a film that stresses contemplation in its use of a narrator, something films that use this often succeed at most easily.
Boxing, despite the sport's decline in popularity since the '80s, has managed to make for some of the best films. Starting with "Rocky" and then films such as "Raging Bull," boxing has is one of those things that seems to best represent life's journey and its struggles. There might not be a stronger visual metaphor than the glory and physical danger of someone with a goal laying it all on the line in the ring. "Million Dollar Baby" is the latest film to exploit this genre, and armed with great talents it manages to do so with a fresh point of view.Talent number one is Morgan Freeman. He could narrate what I did yesterday and it would be considered Oscar-worthy. There is no one better to impart wisdom to an audience and half of why "Million Dollar Baby" communicates its ideas and themes so clearly is because of him.Talent number two is Paul Haggis, producer and screenwriter. Haggis takes stories by F.X Toole and crafts something that boxing-movie lovers haven't seen before. It doesn't lean entirely on the exhausted underdog cliché ("Rocky") or the 'rise and fall of a star' one either ("Raging Bull"). This underdog, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), is more complex and more troubled. Knowing full well she's Southern white trash, she still spends whatever money she has to join the club owned by old-time boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood, who also directs) and tells the stubborn old grouch that she won't leave until he trains her. After taking a few tips from the club's assistant manager, a retired and half-blind former boxer named Scrap (Morgan Freeman), she captures his attention and he agrees to help her toward her dream of being a boxer."Million Dollar Baby" is about ambition, about establishing yourself as something and achieving in even the smallest way. Of all the boxing movies, its themes are the most universal. We all want to leave this life knowing we didn't waste it and "Million Dollar Baby" wrestles with this on levels both obvious and subtle through its central characters.The final talent is Mr. Oscar -- Eastwood. His film is very quiet, shadow-enveloped and contemplative. He lets the characters tell this story and our interest in them keeps our attention. The actors also fit their roles perfectly. Swank has proved she can do Southern American gender ambiguous in "Boys Don't Cry," Freeman has shown wise supporting role prowess in "Shawshank Redemption," and Clint Eastwood redefined tough for the silver screen in his career, making him perfect for the troubled role of Frankie.Everything comes together in this film effortlessly. That's what veteran filmmakers do. Though Haggis at this point was relatively unestablished, his storytelling is elegant and the veterans behind him make the script succeed in its every purpose. "Million Dollar Baby" is a sports drama, but not like you might think. Boxing is the vehicle for delivering a knock out punch of a greater sort, one that brings us unique characters and a terrific story.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Sure, the idea of the Star Trek crew going where several million men (and women) have gone before -- 1980s San Francisco -- is an amusing possibility. The futuristic technology and mindset of the Star Trek universe meeting current times is ripe with gag potential and in many cases, "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home" lives up to that concept's potential. At the same time, it might be one of the dumbest Star Trek, nay, movie plots ever conceived.In the 23rd Century, an alien probe wipes out every ship orbiting Earths' main power and begins to tear the planet apart. Admiral James T. Kirk (Shatner) and his crew, having just risked it all to find Spock, are on their way back to Earth in a Klingon ship when it all goes down. They analyze the probes signal and realize that there's only one creature in the universe that can communicate with it -- the humpback whale. Yes, you're reading that right. These creatures are of course extinct in the future and so the Enterprise crew must travel back in time to Earth to retrieve a humpback whale and bring it back to save humanity.Seriously? Is this the best story Leonard Nimoy and Harve Bennett could come up with? Humpback whales? The concept was clearly "we need a reason to send the crew back in time." How could it occur to anyone that "they have to retrieve whales" was the obvious answer? Clearly, someone had a "save the whales" agenda on board this project. I'm all for saving the whales, but that should not be a driving thematic force behind a Star Trek movie of all places.The best part of "The Voyage Home" is it gives Shatner and Nimoy a chance to flex their comedic chops. They definitely had to have been itching to use that skill and it's really amusing to see them work for laughs. Spock taking figures of speech literally is worth a few chuckles and watching Kirk make some moves on the whale lady (Catherine Hicks) -- who gets the pleasure of all the lines that try and help suspend our disbelief such "seriously, who are you guys?" -- it's a treat to get the comedic side of Star Trek. Even Scotty (James Coogan) and Chekov (Walter Koenig) get to be funny. That said, that's not really what Star Trek is about.Too few are the moments of Spock coming to terms with being half human and having feelings (and they're really irrelevant to the story). Too little is the sense of danger and adventure. Chekov getting injured and sent to the emergency room is not for suspense as much as the comedy of the Enterprise crew sneaking into the hospital and McCoy (DeForest Kelley) making snarky comments about how archaic '80s medicine is. McCoy, in fact, is the only character who gets what's really going on, though it was doubtfully intended that way. He tells Kirk, "You're proposing that we go backwards in time, find humpback whales, then bring them forward in time, drop 'em off, and hope to hell they tell this probe what to do with itself? ... that's crazy!" Yes McCoy, it is crazy. Too bad none of the real people on the set of this whole movie are smart enough to make that very observation. "The Voyage Home" is worth it for the sense of humor, but otherwise it's a complete joke in the other sense. As good of an idea as it might have been to bring the gang back to the present, it's rather insulting to think fans didn't need any kind of substance behind it. Sadly, considering the film's success, people proved them right.~Steven CVisit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com
"The Seventh Seal" is a very literary film, one weighted by philosophical dialogue and thought-churning imagery. Swedish director Ingmar Bergman bravely goes where few filmmakers have ever dared to go in their lifetimes: contemplating death and the existence of God. So few would feel comfortable meditating on such heavy subjects, but Bergman does it uniquely and without coming off as pretentious or preachy.Taking place in the Middle Ages, this black and white 1957 Swedish film follows the knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) on his way back from the Crusades in the height of Europe's Black Plague. There might not be a grimmer time in history for Bergman's story, perfect for bringing Death in as a character, depicted in his black robe with scythe in hand. Antonius, who sees Death coming for him, challenges him to a game of chess in attempt to prolong his life and get some answers about existence before he dies viewing life as a complete waste.The film's language is dense, though not quite Shakespearian. All the characters appear to play a critical role and there are many: Antonius' squire Jons, the happy family of traveling actors, Jof, Mia and their baby Mikael, another actor Jonas Skat and the Blacksmith Plog and his promiscuous wife Lisa. All of these characters' lives are in jeopardy from the plague and each brings something knew to the very fragile and contemplative Antonius. Much of the dialogue speaks directly about life, death and longing for knowledge of God -- there's definitely no surprise that Bergman made his story a play first.There are lots of Christian and Medieval Christian tones to the story, with the title coming from a revelation and flagellants whipping themselves in belief that the plague was sent as God's punishment. It's a bleak film with the exception of the young couple with their baby performing musical acts and expressing their love for each other. In Bergman's posed questions about why we exist, it's clear his own thoughts on the answer revolves around love and its mysterious power and eternal optimism.Light-hearted and comical at times as any good Shakespeare will do, "The Seventh Seal" offers multiple avenues for some serious and enthralling discussion. It definitely requires attentive eyes and ears, especially for those not fluent in Swedish, because at times it's nearly impossible to both watch Bergman work as a director and soak in the meaning of the words. It is quite easily one of film's more intellectually stimulating movies.
Some scenes are a bit too absurd, preposterous, but "The Big Lebowski" abides. That being so, the Coen brothers simply say to their critics, "such is life."Their film is about exactly that - the absurdity of life in that no matter how much we try and take things into our own hands, do justice or make people claim responsibility for their actions, that life will often sucker-punch us out of left field."Lebowski" is about a man of that name that goes by "The Dude." He's a completely miserable, low-life character played by Jeff Bridges that for some reason you care about. As the Coen brothers are notorious for, The Dude gets caught up with some bad people for no reason other than he shares the same exact name as someone who happens to have money. When two guys break into his home thinking he is the other Lebowski and one pees on his rug, it all goes down hill from there for The Dude.With a stellar supporting cast, led by John Goodman who is incredible in this film as The Dude's best bowling buddy and insane converted-Jewish Vietnam vet, "Lebowski" is original and deep-belly laughing funny. But not only that, the events of the film all say something important about when we choose to take action and when it might be best to let things be. The film's scenes are either funny and quotable, creepy and eerie or both. Usually both. All the gags, however, seem to have a point. If not in what their message is/how it contributes to the film, than at least in the way they grab your attention. Every scene in the film is effective in this way."Lebowski" is undeniable proof that comedy can have a purpose other than mere entertainment. It is a film with purpose beyond humor. It is both strange, funny and meaningful. While not nearly as recognized or critically acclaimed as "Fargo," per say, the effective combination that is so rare in film definitely warrants Coen brothers fans the rationale to say "Lebowski" is their best project.
Sidney Lumet is one of my favorite directors and to see him put out a film like "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" at age 82 is fascinating. But even the master himself can only do so much with a film. Though it's proof he's not even a drop less sharp with a camera than he was 50 years ago, this film doesn't deliver all you would hope and all that he puts into it. Though it's premise is classic tragedy--small time people getting caught in over their heads--it doesn't provide the catharsis of a tragedy. As good as this terrific cast is too, there is little connection with the characters and thus we feel little when tragedy befalls them.First-time screenwriter Kelly Masterson tells his original story about two brothers, Andy and Hank Hanson (Hoffman and Hawke respectively) who are strapped for cash and decide robbing their parents' jewelry store will get the job done without hurting anyone (since the shop is insured). Of course it all goes south quickly when Hank brings in an outside man with a gun to do the job and it turns out their mother is in the store at the time. During the robbery both are fatally wounded and the brothers can't seem to rid their hands of the mistake.Masterson tells his story using character flashback. Throughout the movie we go back in time to see snippets of both brothers from their perspective and what happened to led to the tragedy and eventually of the consequences they endure. Later on their enraged father (Finney) is also part of the perspectives. It's not confusing, but it doesn't leave time to establish the family at all. We see very clearly how troubled the characters are in their own ways and how it affects their actions, but we don't have a clear understanding of why and without the why we don't have our emotional connection to them. The closest we get to identifying with the story is with Hoffman's character. We see his poor relationship with his wife (Tomei), who is actually cheating on him (a role Tomei's quite used to) with his brother, we see his struggles at work despite his six-figure paycheck, and his life-consuming drug addiction. Lumet portrays him from high, distant angles and slow pans toward his face to create a pervasive feeling of loneliness and depression. We get him almost perfectly, but there isn't enough time for the other characters plus how they relate to each other. For example, because the father is introduced so late, we have no visual proof other than a conversation of Andy's poor relationship with his father, which ends up pivotal to the film's tragic end.Lumet does nothing but great work with this film, bringing as much insight into the struggles of these characters to make ends meet and feel good about themselves as he can, but there's something inherent in the story that prevents you from getting on board with it. Even this incredible ensemble cast can only do so much. There's great dialog and some good potential from Masterson as he continues to write, but this story makes for just a good/fair film.
After a foray into the blockbuster world, filmmaker Jon Favreau has settled back into his bread and butter (a bit literally), independent comedy. "Chef" is a feel-good movie that goes down easy, especially for any self-described "foodies" in the audience.Call it "food porn" if you will, but Favreau taps into contemporary society's obsession with food as an experience in this film, which also relies heavily on social media, particularly Twitter, as a means to propel the story forward. In fact, it might be the first film with a main plot conceit that hinges on social media (aside from "The Social Network," obviously).Carl Casper (Favreau) is a renowned chef working in a popular restaurant. When big-time food blogger Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) comes to review the restaurant, Carl puts aside his plans for an ambitious menu and sticks to his classics at the urging of his owner (Dustin Hoffman), only to get reamed by Michel. Newly introduced to Twitter by his young son, Percy (Emjay Anthony), Carl engages in a war of words with Michel and ultimately quits his job. At the urging of his ex-wife (Sofia Vergara), Carl returns to Miami, where he made his career, with his son in tow and starts a food truck serving Cuban sandwiches."Chef" serves up more fun and little conflict, but it has a certain road trip and nostalgia quality that Favreau can get away with it. Sequences of mouthwatering food prep shots also infuse that same entertainment value one gets from watching Food Network or a Bravo food show. Supporting roles from Favreau's "Iron Man 2" stars Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. don't hurt either, especially because the latter hasn't done anything small in the last six years.Although he's become more known for his directing in the last five years, Favreau gives his best performance in recent memory, perhaps ever. Carl is a snippy chef with an ego and an attitude problem who can work his sensitive side when he needs. Favreau really owns all his screen time despite a career of supporting performances.What really stands out about "Chef," however, is its modernity, or how in tune Favreau is our world in 2014 in terms of how we behave, what we like and how we communicate with each other. "Chef" is highly representative of the times, the kind of movie you might show to children in future generations to explain American culture in the 2010s. The way eating and food have evolved into something that connects people in a digital space is not lost on Favreau, and how prolific social media is in the film proves that it fascinates him too. What happens to Carl plays out the full spectrum of how social media can tear people's lives apart, yet also build them back up. That's a lot of power."Chef" has the exact kind of joie de vivre that you want in a summer indie, and is somewhat of an antidote for those who want feel-good independent films that don't completely focus on a young boy's coming of age. Carl's relationship with his son is important to the story, but it's mostly there to add heart.But no matter how you take to the story, don't sit down to watch "Chef" on an empty stomach  or at least be sure to have a delicious place in mind to go afterward.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

From start to finish, "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly" is a fascinating film. It is a captivating and emotional story shot impressively in first person for much of its duration to mimic the eyesight of its main character, French former Elle magazine editor Jean-Dominique Bauby, who suffers a terrible incident that leaves him paralyzed with the exception of his left eye.The premise alone is rich with potential commentary on the human condition. Add to that that this film is based on a book that was written by Bauby by blinking his thoughts to a scribe, and the story becomes all the more fascinating. The film begins when Bauby (Matthew Amalric) awakens after being in a coma for three weeks and follows his time in the hospital learning to live with his condition where he forges relationships with hospital staff and redefines new ones with friends and family.It's really easy to pity Bauby the entire time, but this film challenges you to see him as being just as flawed as any of us. Although the story hardly dwells in Bauby's past, choosing to focus more on how his accident complicates his life, you still get the sense that there are things not to like about him. Amalric mostly lends his talents as a narrator, vocalizing Bauby's thoughts, providing us cues about his character through mere inflection--an impressive feat.But nothing in the film can outshine the work that director Julian Schnabel has done. In tandem with the legendary Janusz Kaminski, "Diving Bell" is visually profound. When the film is in first person, you unquestionably believe that you are seeing things as Bauby sees them. The blur, coming in and out of focus, the movement--it's incredible how lifelike it is and so naturally you start to empathize with Bauby instantly. As the film progresses and you know more of who he is, there is more traditional third person work and we get a much more objective look at Bauby."Diving Bell" also does a great job of creating relationships. There's Bauby's relationship with the mother of his three children (whom he never married), his relationship with his very old father who he definitely had a rocky past with because of his father's infidelity and there are the couple of therapists and the scribe--three beautiful women that inspire him in their own way. Each is so unique, especially because of how Bauby's condition changes it or poses challenges to it. For example, the fact that he can be attracted to all these women but not feel it makes for a unique sexual tension.Thematically, the film is a bit difficult to understand, but so is Bauby. His imagination is his only salvation from his condition. He envisions being places and doing things as his only way of escaping depression, so his mind imagines some strange things that when interpreted from novel to film makes for equally strange images. But at film's end, while there's no true emotional climax, you feel you've gained a great deal of insight into both the story and even life in general. There's a somewhat uncomfortable but very real tone of optimism to the film, which makes it so unique. It is also an amazing example of an American film in a foreign language, one that still feels essentially French despite not being brought to life by French minds.
One would suppose if Sam Raimi really wanted to do a masterfully frightening horror film that he could easily do so -- but that would be too easy. "Drag Me to Hell" is like a thesis statement for why horror films should stop wasting their time with realism and trying to frighten people in the most "realistic" ways possible. Raimi possesses the ability to scare audiences in that way, but he doesn't see the point. Instead, the cult classic horror director of the Evil Dead trilogy continues to employ his masterful skills for the sake of audience misdirection, outrageous gore and hysterical thrills.This was my first Raimi horror film, so now I can understand why there was much clamor for him to set the Spider-Man work aside this past decade and go back to his roots. "Drag Me to Hell" is definitely a throwback to older horror movies and a shout out to Raimi's fans. With a classic score and even the 1980s Universal logo at the beginning, this is supposed to evoke a little nostalgia.The film follows Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), a young loan officer who gets cursed by an old gypsy woman when she denies her an extension on her mortgage payments, mainly because doing so will get her closer to a promotion and she's trying to wipe the slate clean of her redneck past. The curse causes a shadowy demon to torment her for three days and on the third he will come to take her soul into hell. That and the old woman keeps showing up in some form or another to attack her.Raimi has a fine understanding of suspense and how to get an audience on edge and prey on their expectations. Horror films have such a clear rise-and-fall scene structure and so many of the same techniques are utilized that an audience can predict a film's movement. Raimi uses that to his advantage rather than just using it period. Twisting it in this way allows him to create unexpected laughs and enhance the interest and entertainment level of the story, even if the plot is quite simple like "Drag Me to Hell."Some people, I imagine, don't appreciate the scary parts of films being diminished by laugh- out-loud gore such as an old lady vomiting maggots and other comedic surprises, but I think it serves more as a reminder that horror doesn't have to make you wet yourself and give you nightmares to be entertaining. In fact it really celebrates the subconscious pleasure we get from scary movies to use those nerve-racking techniques to lead us where we least expect yet find quite entertaining.When you look back at "Drag Me to Hell," you'd be crazy not to find it ridiculous and absurd, but it finds a wonderfully entertaining balance of horror, comedy and realism. Christine feels like a very real protagonist despite the outrageous things that happen to her. She has a boyfriend (Justin Long) who legitimately loves her and she wants a promotion like the rest of us and she has moral dilemmas like the rest of us. Even if the Raimi brothers negate that with bizarre scene climaxes, they've done their job to create a complete main character and we can't label anything with fully realized characters as pulp or trash. It seems dumb, but the intention is clear and anyone who checks their expectations imposed by the bad horror films of late will see that and enjoy "Hell."~Steven CVisit my site! http://moviemusereviews.com
The humor of "Wanderlust" and hippie communes share a similar mantra: embrace it or get the heck out. "Role Models" director David Wain and comedian Ken Marino have written a genuinely funny movie, only one that's kind of pasted together like a spontaneous collage of humorous characters and moments rather than strung together with any notion of a compelling story.In that sense, it's almost a miracle "Wanderlust" works at all. A chance encounter with a hippie bed and breakfast and an impulsive decision to live free of social constructs hardly qualifies for conflict-resolution storytelling, but several colorful characters and a pair of likable leads maintain our curiosity as to what might happen next.George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) have just purchased an apartment in New York City. Days later, George finds himself jobless thanks to an FBI investigation shutting down his company and Linda fails to successfully pitch her hard-hitting penguin documentary to HBO. They then head for Georgia to stay with George's successful brother (Ken Marino) and his family, but after a night's stay in "Elysium," they determine that a little detachment could be a good thing.Although rarely the source of humor, Aniston reminds us she's an effortless leading lady that can roll with any kind of comedy. Rudd offers the usual charms and some dynamite improv. A scene where he psychs himself up in the mirror could be considered one of his best ever. It certainly ranks as the film's most hysterical moment.As for the ensemble at large, Elysium teems with curious characters, including a nudist winemaker/aspiring author (Joe Lo Truglio), a spiritually virile classical guitar player that everyone adores (Justin Theroux) and a free-love yoga teacher (Malin Ackerman) among others. Rather than being pure stereotypes of hippies and eccentrics, the actors genuinely embody their characters. Not every bit is funny, but few lapse into unfunny territorythat is so long as Wain's mix of deadpan and obscene humor works for you.George and Linda's two-week trial run puts their marriage to the test of course, but little of that matters. In a way it works, because inserting straight scenes with the intent of drumming up the marital conflict would have marred the pacing, not to mention been remarkably unoriginal. On the other hand, it's tough to feel anything when the couple is at odds over whether they should have a sexually liberated marriage. So long as their attempt to do so yields comic results (and it sure does), who cares?Oddly enough, "Wanderlust" warrants numerous comparisons to the free-spirited lifestyle it both celebrates and pokes fun at. Although contemporary R-rated comedy techniques abound, (At what point will comedies decide to stop barraging audiences with flopping penises?) they seem less contrived in this movie. Everything feels more organic and care-free. Maybe it's as simple as the fact that nudists and hallucinogenics make more sense in a movie about hippies, but either way it works.But more than that, it's the choice to avoid the obvious contemporary jokes that sit right in front of our noses that earns "Wanderlust" kudos. Not one scene deals with either George or Linda getting frustrated over bad cell phone reception or saying or doing anything to debase or devalue the commune or the lifestyle there for the sake of humor. That fact will go under- appreciated by most viewers."Wanderlust" essentially lives and dies with its purposelessness. So many comedies self-inflict their wounds by trying to create and maintain too much of a logical plot, whereas this one spares us the trouble. At the same time, a noteworthy premiseexecuted well or notseizes the necessary attention for audiences to feel invested in a comedy.Like its title implies, this movie meanders spontaneously in search of only laughs. It's the kind of strategy that will likely divide audiences, but those like myself who feel Wain and company pulled it off will develop a sizable soft spot for this simple but quirky comedy.~Steven CThanks for reading!

In a world post-"Avatar" and "District 9," where lack of creativity can no longer be blamed on the limitations of special effects (if that was ever a scapegoat), the goal of the sci-fi movie has been to innovate. Filmmakers have completely abandoned the minefield of clichés that is the retro "Area 51" alien with a big green head and black ovular eyes. Now they're into alien design with insect-like features, especially multiple extremities. "Paul," on the other hand, dives right back into the old school. Our titular little green (greenish-blue?) man not only reinforces whatever stereotypes exist, but the reason is written into his back story in the form of a lighthearted but sentimental homage to the sci-fi films of yore, particularly Steven Spielberg's two infamous entries, "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "E.T."But above all else, "Paul" is a red-blooded on-the-run comedy that rejoices (quite innocently if you can believe it) in profanity with a self-irreverence that makes it hard for any honest geek/nerd/dork to dismiss.For starters, after a prologue of sorts, the film opens at Comic-Con. Clive (Nick Frost) and Graeme (Simon Pegg) are two British buddies, one a sci-fi writer and the other an illustrator. After the convention, they aim to travel the Southwest and visit all the alleged UFO landing/spotting sites. They get exactly what they bargained for when a car wreck reveals Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen), a scrawny bug-eyed alien wearing cargo shorts and flip-flops who's on the run from some feds. After Clive pisses his pants and Graeme is assured Paul won't anally probe him, they embark on a road trip with Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman) and his cronies (Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio) in pursuit.Say what you will about modern R-rated comedy, but "Paul" is a departure for "Superbad" and "Adventureland" filmmaker Greg Mottola. Although he manages at least some of the heart of those two films, "Paul" is foremost an exercise in goofy. Pegg and Frost wrote the script, so the comedy with an homage to another genre makes sense, but you'd expect a bit more sophistication from Mottola. Instead, he succeeds by recognizing the difference and playing to the strengths of the film, which is magnify the silliness and embrace the unoriginality. He uses melodramatic foreshadowing to cut the scenes from pursuer to pursued to compensate for the typical plot and he lets his actors take over with their own wit to keep them vibrant despite being one-dimensional.For Pegg and Frost, this is not akin to their films with Edgar Wright. There's the homage angle, but the satire is not as biting, nor is "Paul" an execution of homage before comedy but the other way around. "Paul" packs in references to sci-fi classics, but in a way that re-evokes the bright-eyed wonder that we first associated with the honored films when they came out. Music also plays heavily into this element of the film from the band at a local bar playing John Williams' "Cantina Band" to other Williams/Spielberg-inspired scores.You won't have to catch all the references to like "Paul" and appreciate what it is. Kristen Wiig helps drastically in this way by changing up the main character dynamic and playing what could only be described as a "born-again sinner." But there's no "Doubt" that those who like "Paul" the most will be the science-fiction fans it caters to; it does little to try and make first contact outside its target demographic. Given the premise, no one who presses play should be surprised by that, so don't expect any sympathy from this critic should you be.~Steven CCheck out my site, moviemusereviews.com
There are very few movies out there that will amp you up like "The Expendables." Maybe not so much for the ladies, but Sylvester Stallone's battle royal of action stars and other renowned muscle men from the last three decades will convince almost every man that lifting weights, eating a steak and potatoes dinner and cruising about looking to kick some ass is a great idea for the immediate future.But what "The Expendables" possesses in pure testosterone it lacks in just about everything else. The plot and subplots are entirely, well, expendable.Including cameos from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis, the cast Stallone assembles is simply grunt-tastic, maybe minus the absence of a Jean Claude Van Damme. Combining Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren among others makes the film impressive enough. If you think all those names plus others smells of gimmick and nothing else, you're wrong. Seeing these guys together is most if not all the magic of the film.Stallone leads this team of war vets and other skilled fighters turned assassins for hire who possess deadly gun and knife accuracy as well as fist-fighting skills. They take a job in Venezuela to depose a dictator who's the puppet of an ex-CIA man. There are a few other details, but again, pointless as far as what this movie aims to do. Successfully, however, this does allow for the explosions to commence.Every gun shot, every fiery blast, every punch and every knife jammed through some dude's throat (and that happens several more times than you'd think) gets amplified both visually and through sound effects. The action never loses excitement or intensity and that alone keeps "The Expendables" from journeying into simply bad movie territory. Stallone clearly understands that all can be forgiven (or we can at least be distracted long enough) when things go boom in creative ways. Stallone and Statham's sea plane escape and subsequent revenge on the Venezuelans on the dock makes for one of the most enjoyable action sequences of the year.It's amazing as an action-lover how quickly you can forget pointless cameos, unfunny attempts at levity and cliché action movie plot devices. One might find it easier to chastise Stallone for making a film that must pummel its audience into submission with gunfire and explosions, but I say success where most others fail; half the films of this ilk use the same technique and don't manage to keep critics from seeing through the fiery guise. "The Expendables," for the most part, does wow its audience enough to find enjoyment where there otherwise would be repetitiveness.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
There aren't many overcoming-the-odds stories quite like that of Christy Brown. Born with cerebral palsy in 1930s Dublin, his parents thought his handicap was mental as well as physical. Though eventually properly diagnosed, Brown, in a lower working-class family with nearly 20 children, had to push himself just to be appreciated by his family. Through the use of his only fully-functioning limb, his left leg, he taught himself to write and paint, both skills he developed expertly. But what makes the film version of Brown's autobiography "My Left Foot" such a great retelling is its humility. Both director/writer Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day-Lewis have managed to tell this story in a way that doesn't scream for attention and resort to melodrama. Cheesy struggles and scenes of frustration as well as glorious moments of minute victory are easy pitfalls of a story so miraculous, yet "My Left Foot" stays real and intrinsically inspired.Day-Lewis is the easiest to highlight. Playing anyone with such serious physical impairments has to be a demanding task. Not only does Day-Lewis give us a very complete picture of Christy, but he also manages to chronicle the growth, improvement and inner change of the character in different stages of his life. He plays Christy at 17 when he had limited language capability and was emotionally volatile just as crisply as he does the intellectually learned Christy who struggles to cope with why he can't find non-platonic love. The latter theme is the film's strongest and it would've been nice for Sheridan and co-adapter Shane Connaughton to really flesh that out. Regardless, Day-Lewis gets us to understand and sympathize with all those elements, giving a performance that's so believable you often don't have time to think "wow, he's such a great actor." Those are the most commendable performances.Equally important but through more subtle means is Sheridan's work on the film. This story is about day-to-day life and struggles. Although Christy has such a unique set of circumstances hampering his life, his struggles are not unlike our own and Sheridan grasps that concept completely. Christy struggles with love, parental attention, questions of self- worth and capability. His struggles are just more physically manifested (literally and figuratively) than ours. Sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the large Brown family and Christy's unique place in it. The drama evolves naturally when tensions are highest and the humor comes in much the same way. The dinner scene when Christy learns that his doctor/teacher -- the woman he loves -- is going to marry his brother Peter is the film's finest example of both Day-Lewis and Sheridan's efforts. It's built up to so well by Sheridan that it comes out when we're ready and Day-Lewis takes us from there with his stunning work.The other strong component of the film is Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown. I did not know she'd won the Oscar, but there was something about her performances as Christy's loving and wise mother that just screamed Oscar-worthy. Her love for Christy and constant fighting for him just seems so convincing and heartfelt and she earns a lot of sympathy given her situation.The emotional punch of the film given the story is surprisingly minimal. Perhaps that was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that feels organically human. The two should be reconcilable, but I imagine it's challenging to tell a story that feels true-to-life and one that provides enough dramatic moments to take our emotions on a roller coaster. The choice to downplay the latter was definitely the wise one for "My Left Foot." Brown's circumstances speak for themselves -- they don't need to be squeezed for weightier dramatic impact.~Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com for more
As you leave the theater, "Happy Feet" gives you exactly what its title offers. This movie is clearly intended to be nothing but fun and it delivers exactly that.Probably the most enjoyable part of the film is its uniqueness. It breaks much of the mold that every CGI film in the last few years has stuck to unflinchingly through song and dance that while not presented in a musical movie style still make the film incredibly fun. While the plot is ultimately insignificant to most of the movie, it is still engaging through the action and especially the characters. While some of the action sequences feel straight out of "Finding Nemo" or "Ice Age," the characters--namely the amigos, or a band of small penguins led by Robin Williams--are what saves this film. In fact, the film is nothing but cute until the amigos come along and add some personality and humor.The most impressive aspect, however, are the visual effects. The penguin fur is remarkable and one can only sit in awe at the realism of the penguins' breathing. The non-animal elements were also incredibly realistic, like the settings, as well as the incorporation of live action footage which was a much better choice than making the humans CGI. The visual choice here was a much better choice compared to some of the more cartoon-like computer animated films like "Madagascar."While the film is not better than those computer-animated films that have the formula down to a tee, its unique style makes it much better than the films that have merely tried to imitate with mediocrity rather than innovate, which "Happy Feet" truly does.
What a seemingly insurmountable task to adapt and execute the multiple story lines and brimming of Stieg Larsson's novel "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo." Despite all the slicing and dicing (yet still a two-and-half-hour run time), credit belongs to this Swedish filmmaking team for still managing to replicate the novel's extraordinary pacing. The sacrifice, unfortunately, is tone. In spite of the length, director Niels Arden Oplev makes the film into a full-on sprint. We never get a chance, with the exception of the magnetizing character that is Lisbeth Salander and Noomi Rapace's performance as her, of getting under the story's or characters' skin. We barely have enough time to really understand what kind of a character Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) is before he's engrossed in solving the film's core murder mystery. Yet despite all those complaints, would I or anyone be able to do any better without needing to make the film in two parts? I'd like to think there's a way, but I would not volunteer the man-hours necessary to carve it out."The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" tells the story of a business reporter named Mikael Blomqvist who ends up disgraced when he loses a libel suit thanks to faulty information used in an article trying to take down a billionaire. Needing to lay low, he receives a call from another rich businessman, Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taub), who offers Blomqvist ridiculous compensation to work on solving a 40-year-old mystery involving Vanger's missing niece, who he believes was murdered.Meanwhile, Lisbeth Salander (Rapace) is an information collector (aka hacker) with a troubled past and a number of tattoos and piercings who is doing her own research on Blomqvist and ultimately ends up getting wrapped up in solving the mystery as well.Although iffy on what it cuts from the book and what it alters, the adaptation succeeds at juxtaposing a lot of separate scenes in the novel into one sequence in the film. A common method for combining story lines and sub plots, this is particularly effective in picking up the suspense. As such, the film flows well and the key moments like the end and some pivotal events in the Salander subplot do not lack the impact or intensity that they require."Dragon Tattoo" moves at an entertaining clip, but never engulfs you like the novel and that will ultimately lead countless people to declare the books "so much better." The themes, tone and depth simply do not exist. I imagine some of the production elements such as cinematography and a better score come with a lack of budget too, so that doesn't help matters. Yet strong performances and entertainment value in this film do echo what made Larsson's book so wildly popular.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
When you watch "Braveheart" you can't help but feel like you've seen it before. That's because "Braveheart" did it first. James Horner's thematic bagpipe music that could make a grown man cry is nearly replicated in his score for "Titanic" (although "Titanic" won him the Oscar). The highly skilled love and revenge-fueled hero is all that is Maximus in "Gladiator." The list goes on, but the point is that "Braveheart" set formula for the modern day historical fiction war film. Watching this film today, you aren't exactly blown away by it, but it doesn't do anything wrong."Braveheart" is the story of William Wallace, the Scottish farmer-turned-warrior who sparked a rebellion that eventually earned Scotland independence from England. Mel Gibson (director and producer) plays Wallace and does so quite well. Gibson's performance is in his presence on screen. He doesn't do the nuances that well, but I would've gotten off my couch to fight for that guy. The other performances were all good, but no one stands out, though Angus Mcfayden really communicated the inner-conflict of Robert the Bruce quite well.You certainly don't put on "Braveheart" for acting lessons, however. This is a film about emotion, the human spirit, good triumphing over oppression and of course: brutally violent battle sequences. This is where "Braveheart" delivers. The script is just one little pearl of wisdom and motivation after another. If I was a coach of a sports team, I'd just quote this film before games, half time, after games--it's just full of great one liners and as much as you want to laugh and say "that's cheesy" it just never feels that way. The film is about one man that stood for freedom and never made an exception, which resulted in him killing a lot of people. The romance angle (for added emotional effect) is not as strong, but certainly balances out the mood of the film that's supposed to be about heart (though of course Wallace is a champion of using his head.) The combination of the two make for a film that is both entertaining and touching.At this day and age, "Braveheart" might seem a little stale. There's nothing revolutionary going on (well, cinematically speaking, not plot-wise). Unless you have a fond attachment to the film from when it first came out and was indeed revolutionary, you'll find "Braveheart" an entertaining and solid tale of heroism and belief in good winning out. It's hard to watch in an entirely secular light knowing the post-Passion of the Christ Gibson of today, but it will still make you feel good.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
You'd be hard-pressed to think of a film concept more socially relevant and relatable to 500 million people than a movie about the origins of Facebook. "The Social Network," however is not some insouciant attempt to capitalize on the world's most popular social networking site for revenue purposes. It is a loaded drama that unlike most based-on-true stories, is a bit unforgiving of its "protagonist" (or anyone else for that matter) and unafraid to handle the unflattering side of human nature. Check the idea of this being a "Facebook movie" aside; this is the story of what can happen in today's age when an arguably stolen idea can be born at a frat party and turn into a $25-billion-dollar property in fewer than 10 years.We learn right away that our quick-tongued smart-allick main character, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), is "special." After the opening scene finds him dumped by his girlfriend (Rooney Mara) for obsessing over winning social approval from the elite Harvard clubs and insulting her in the process, he goes back to his dorm, pounds a few beers and writes a website code for evaluating the comparative hotness of Harvard girls using the his best friend Eduardo Saverin's (Andrew Garfield) algorithm and pictures he hacked off the women's clubs' sites. We're then overwhelmed with techno-babble in this early scene that one can't help but realize not just anybody could've created Facebook.Although we're certainly not asked to like Zuckerberg, we never find him so deplorable that the film becomes intolerable. The first of many contentious actions in the story involves Zuckerberg using the idea of Harvard boys Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss as the springboard for creating Facebook. With the excitement of watching Facebook unfurl also comes the web of deceit. The script doesn't give Eisenberg many redeeming moments to work with, but the humanity comes through just as much as the jerky characterization in his performance.It doesn't take very long to get hooked into "The Social Network." The pacing of David Fincher's film is exquisite; the scenes are meticulously calculated and never let up on drama or intrigue with the lone exception being an overextended rowing scene/analogy toward the end. But the highlight is certainly "The West Wing" creator Aaron Sorkin's script: sharp, intelligent, thought-provoking and seamlessly telling two narratives at once as the film jumps between the story of Facebook's creation and the "present day" civil suits filed by Eduardo and the Winklevosses, separately. Throw Trent Reznor's cool mood-generating electronic score underneath and you have one of the better produced films in a while. "The Social Network" certainly has a share of live horses in the Oscar race.Anchoring it all are these young, blossoming actors. Fincher has a reputation for bringing along remarkable talents (just look at what he did with Brad Pitt) and Eisenberg and Garfield might be two of the best in their generation. Eisenberg will shed the Michael Cera comparisons with this performance, but Garfield (future Spider-Man) really impresses. It's possibly because his character earns the most sympathy, but his confrontation scene with Mark is powerful. If the best actor categories weren't such gentleman's clubs, these two would certainly be there.The strength of "The Social Network" lies in the ability to show the flaws in every character and to make us realize that in the shoes of Mark and Eduardo, we would have made just as many mistakes. When Justin Timberlake's character Sean (creator of Napster) enters the picture and starts trying to sell the boys on becoming billionaires, we begin to see how unforgiving the business world can be. Mark might have done some questionable things, but he kept himself afloat. Eduardo might have been cautious and pragmatic, but he got lost in the shuffle.So "The Social Network" is not "the film that defines our times." It's not about social networking, but a story of ambition and dreaming big and the harsh realities of the business world. That's a timeless motif, not a modern one. Sure, there are plenty of nuggets for those "fans of Facebook" who will enjoy the moment when Mark realizes to put relationship status on the site or when the Facebook wall is referenced, but that merely dresses the film up as "with the times." If anything, it shows how we live in a world today where there's a value on intellectual property and it's a high stakes competition to turn ideas into tremendous revenue. So how can you fault these "kids" for the mistakes they made? It's a lot for anyone to handle. "The Social Network" helps us recognize that admitting fault and making amends after the fact is sometimes the best you can do.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Pedro Almodovar's "Hable Con Ella" is a great film but one that's hard to diagnose. Foremost it's a love story, one that explores unreciprocated love in the sense that two women are in a coma and the film is about the men who love them. But it also explores that idea more figuratively because the characters are afraid to speak to each other when it comes to sharing expressions, thoughts or memories of deep love and emotion. Sometimes Almodovar's exploration is a bit unsettling, but that's part of what makes it a standout film and worthy of its Best Foreign Language Film Oscar."Hable" follows a few different characters. Marco (Dario Grandinetti) is a journalist who tries to land an interview with a famous woman bullfighter named Lydia (Rosario Flores) who captivates him and the two become somewhat involved before a bullfighting accident leaves Lydia in a coma. Benigno (Javier Camera) is a male nurse who takes care of Alicia (Leonor Watling) a young dancer in a coma, to whom he is deeply attached and in a slightly concerning way. We see the history of both those relationships, but it is that which develops between Marco and Benigno that is most interesting as they spend many days in the clinic together.The story takes us to many different points in time. We learn that Marco was having trouble getting over a past love when he met Lydia and they'd only discussed in hours before her accident. We also learn that Benigno was stalking Alicia before her accident and his nursing skills happened to put him in a fortunate position to be with her almost all the time. Sharing these stories and their passion for women who might never love them, the two form a bond.Almodovar's film is also big on art. Not only is Alicia a dancer, but the film opens and ends with the main characters attending a dance performance, there are bullfighting scenes (considered essentially to be an art form in Spain) and there is a peculiar silent film shown within the film. Different main characters cry when observing these events, mainly because they evoke in them an emotion they've yet to express, that they've bottled up inside.Though strange, the art in this film is pivotal. Almodovar seems to comment on how artistic moments, sometimes for the silliest of reasons, can provoke strong emotional responses. They communicate important ideas and emotions in a less explicit manner, acting almost as a substitute for direct communication between an artist and his or her audience.That's where the beauty of "Hable Con Ella" lies, although your attention will be focused on the peculiarity of these relationships and the strange ways in which Almodovar presents love and relationships to us -- plus of course how the events unfold. But it's really about communication as the title alludes to, how we use art among other things to wrap up a message that perhaps is best delivered directly, even if the other person might not understand, even if they cannot hear us at all.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"Be Kind Rewind" is far from a traditional comedy, and the name Michel Gondry should alert you to that. Those who know that name know "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," his breakthrough abstract love story which he had yet to follow up until "Be Kind." I don't think his fans expected it to be a comedy, but this isn't a true comedy. The studios tried to sell this film like that, but don't be fooled. Not to say that off-beat comedies can't be effective, but "Be Kind" is completely indecisive as to how it wants to deliver itself to the audience and that's because there's more to the plot than the trailers let on. Gondry's script is very clever and creative, but his genius is clearly at odds with traditional comedy elements and the result feels scattered and rough.Here's your mainstream plot: Mike and Jerry (Mos Def and Jack Black) are friends living in an old New Jersey neighborhood. Mike works for Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover) at the Be Kind Rewind video store and Jerry is basically a lunatic living in a trailer. Jerry does something that makes him magnetized and when he goes in the video store one day, he wipes out all the tapes when Mr. Fletcher is on vacation. Desperate, they recreate their own 20-minute versions of the films in their store. That's a solid, mainstream, premise, but here's what you don't know: the building the store is in is not up to code and a local condominium place wants it and if BKR makes no money, it will never be able to afford the repairs to pass code. Also a famous jazz musician named Fats Waller supposedly used to live there.What you have here is a studio saying the comedy should be 105 minutes max, like all comedies, when what a film this clever necessitates to be good is over 2 hours. The film feels rushed. You don't get a feel for who the characters are before the plot is in full drive and the quick turn of events makes the preposterous plot actually feel preposterous. You can't suspend disbelief very easily with this film when you should. No one would actually consider re-making the films as a solution to the problem, but a well-structured film would at least convince you to go along with it. Add this dilemma to Gondry's off-beat sense of humor (magnetic pee?) and it just compounds the strangeness.As the film goes on, it also turns from a comedy to a feel-good community film. It goes way beyond what you expect and turns into something that could be meaningful, if only it had enough time to play out that way in an effective manner. There are some interesting but simple characters that don't get a chance to develop either, which hurts that feel-good vibe in the end.For a comedy billing, the film isn't all that funny with the exception of Jack Black. Mos Def is really forgettable in this film and nobody else is supposed to be that funny anyway. The acting here is more about feeling natural. If there's anything that deserves a tip of the hat it's that this film and cast have a refreshingly human, natural feel to them. It doesn't feel like a Hollywood formula film that's gone through a processor twelve times. You honestly forget these are actors in a film making a film and that's a credit to Gondry's skill, a skill that simply gets lost here in all the plot movement.
It might forever be known as Tim Burton's most "normal" film, but that doesn't mean "Ed Wood" is your traditional biography. Burton's obsession with giving things other-worldly qualities simply takes on a different form as it tells the story of acclaimed "worst director of all time," Edward D. Wood Jr., played by Burton favorite Johnny Depp.Wood was a forgettable B-movie director until his naming as the worst of all time a couple years after his death in the '70s gave him a cult following. Burton tells his story in a fitting black and white form that uses both B-movie and classic techniques (in addition to a score with some classic themes by Howard Shore) as an appropriate ode to the director. It's partly fascinating because you want to know why Wood was the worst and how someone who is the worst is motivated to make movies.For the first time in Depp's career, he gets to really show what he's capable of in a leading role. Depp brings this naive charisma and desperation to make motion pictures however the heck he wants to Wood, who clearly had to have had a few screws loose to make the movies he made. Since Wood also took pleasure in dressing up in womens' clothes, particularly angora sweaters, this adds another quirky dimension to the film that most would recognize as more up Burton's alley. Depp plays those scenes with a silly modesty.But the dimension that really makes this one of Burton's best films, if not the best, is the brilliant subplot of the relationship between Wood and horror icon Bela Lugosi played marvelously by Martin Landau. Lugosi was aging, getting senile and addicted to morphine when he met Wood and so Landau's performance is the most hysterical and touching of all the roles in the film. He's self-centered and curses a lot, but you can tell that making movies was his life too and how his time out of the spotlight crushed him emotionally. An Oscar much deserved.With the feel of an old-time movie yet the insight of a modern one, "Ed Wood" is as unique a film as they come. Not quite comedy and not quite drama, it is both a satire of Hollywood and light-hearted examination of the business while also getting at what it takes to make movies and why people are so impassioned to do it. In a way, it's Burton's justification of his bizarre style of film-making, though in my opinion he need none.
Leonardo DiCaprio's done better. Russell Crowe's done better. Without a doubt, Ridley Scott has done better. Still, "Body of Lies" is an entertaining spy thriller that enjoys blowing stuff up and gunning down keffiyeh-wearing terrorists on location in the Middle East. It's good, it's just not the tour de force one might expect from the director of "Black Hawk Down," the writer of "The Departed" and two stars with six Oscar noms between them.DiCaprio and Crowe star as two guys working for the CIA: the first an undercover field agent and the second his Southern-drawled superior who operates from Langley. DiCaprio gets sent to Jordan where he's trying to track down a major terrorist leader with the cooperation of Jordan's intelligence agency led by Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Disconnect between the two men leaves a lot of people dead and injured and mistrust between many sides leads to greater conflict.Like most other films set in the Middle East these days such as "The Kingdom" and "Syriana," "Body of Lies" is thriller and action-oriented, not a drama. With numerous action genre credits to his name, Scott makes it look good, there's no denying that. There's just no "it" factor to make the film stand out. There's nothing so original or no twist so unforeseeable that could make this movie memorable.DiCaprio and Crowe are excellent, but these roles are small stuff for them. DiCaprio's character Roger Ferris, a tough and courageous bigmouth, isn't that short of his "The Departed" character and Crowe's newly grown potbelly, white hair and overuse of ending phrases with "buddy" might be different but don't exactly constitute a challenge for the guy who played the vengeful gladiator Maximus and the brilliant but haunted mathematician John Nash. These characters' spiteful and reckless working relationship is humorous but nothing all that inspiring."Body of Lies" is fast-paced, full of talent and Will Monahan's script easy to follow for the most part, but movies like this need to be able to boast something that other films of the genre don't have, and in the case of "Body of Lies," having one of the greatest action/thriller directors ever and two of the best actors of their generation is not enough to make the film go from entertaining to something special.
Summertime  there's no season more influential in a young person's coming of age. Being out of school means a chance for a new experiences and self-discovery, and spending that time in a new location always feels like a fresh start. In "The Way Way Back," Nat Faxon and Jim Rash ("The Descendants") portray the "life-changing summer" in a sincere way, but they also capture the nostalgia and fairy tale-like qualities with which we often remember these times in our lives.It starts and ends with Duncan (Liam James). Too many characters in independent films are written like Duncan, the socially challenged kid who discovers himself with the help of some quirky role models and a beautiful girl, but James actually looks and acts the part, compared to the many protagonists we usually see in these films. He's quiet, closed off and doesn't stick up for himself, but he's more than the product of a the unlikable supporting characters jerking him around and most importantly, James is actually close to the same age as Duncan (a 16-year-old playing a 14-year-old), which so many coming-of-age characters aren't.Duncan is going for a long summer vacation to the Massachusetts shore with his mom (Toni Collette) and her serious boyfriend (Steve Carell), Trent, who tries to impose rules on him while taking shots at his self-confidence. Along with Trent's superficial and self-absorbed daughter, Steph (Zoe Levin), they stay at Trent's beach house, which clearly is meant to be a getaway for Trent and Duncan's mom, who spend their days and nights there drinking and socializing with Trent's neighbors (Allison Janney, Amanda Peet and Rob Corddry). Clearly miserable, Duncan endeavors to get away, and in doing so discovers Water Wizz water park and its carefree owner/operator, Owen (Sam Rockwell).Water Wizz is like an entirely different world, a Neverland of sorts where growing up doesn't require growing pains, where life's unfairness doesn't apply; a place where Duncan can find himself in the middle of a break dancing circle and earn the nickname "Pop-'n-Lock." There's a huge difference between the way the script treats scenes at the beach house, where Duncan can't be himself, and scenes at the water park. Rockwell's Owen is by no means a paragon of self-made success, but there's something about his attitude toward life and that of the other park employees played by Maya Rudolph, Rash and Faxon that's infectious.The family drama away from Duncan's chlorinated safe haven, on the other hand, can get heavy and real. It is full of unhappy characters trying to force themselves into happiness and being inauthentic with themselves and each other. That's why Duncan can't stand it, especially when it becomes clear that Trent and his mother don't have the healthiest of relationships. As the story unfolds, the divide between Duncan's worlds grows so large that he can't straddle them any longer.And what would this story be without a little romance? Janney's Betty, who lives next to Trent's beach house, has a teenage daughter named Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb) who takes a curious shining to Duncan, presumably because her friends, which include Trent's daughter Steph, are also superficial. Of course Susanna is the kind of knockout that guys like Duncan dream about landing but rarely do, so their relationship is part of that nostalgic coming-of- age fantasy. Faxon and Rash clearly aren't aiming for 100 percent realism, just 100 percent genuineness of emotion. Something about "The Way Way Back" so easily provokes the fond recollection of summers past. It taps into the feelings, emotions and nerve endings of those formative experiences and the role models that profoundly impact our lives. It has to be the honest, reflective writing and the telling of a story that has a lot of universal touch-points and therefore really resonates.Casting actors who have perfected the dance between drama and comedy proves immensely important as well. Carell, Collette, Janney (practically a poster woman for independent comedy), Rockwell  they know how to operate in these stories and they know how to make humorous dialogue feel true to their characters. The script pushes for humor in spots, so talents like these help keep everything real.Everyone should be able to find some kind of connection to "The Way Way Back," and that will keep it from getting lost in coming-of-age indie comedy obscurity. Faxon and Rash are two- for-two and whatever they've got in store next has to be considered a must-watch.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
We all knew he could do it, but Paul Rudd proves his leading man status in "I Love You, Man," perhaps the first successful Judd Apatow movie not produced by Judd Apatow. Taking actors like Rudd and Jason Segel ("Forgetting Sarah Marshall") and mixing in R-rated humor and plenty of improv, even the triumvirate of Ivan Reitman, the director of "Along Came Polly" and the writer behind the Dr. Doolittle films can put together Apatow's formula and score a good trendy comedy.While the Apatow regulars aren't there, the cast is fluffed with comedians from all corners of the comedic world: JK Simmons (Jason Reitman films), Andy Samberg and Jane Curtin (SNL of two different eras), Jon Favreau (usually in tandem with Vince Vaughn) and even Jay Chandrasehkar ("Broken Lizard" comedies) makes an appearance. These are all familiar faces, but never before have they all been in the same film. It's true comedic hodge-podge, though the big laughs still come from the improvisational talents of Rudd and Segel.The film is a "bromantic comedy," meaning that instead of a girl coming into the picture and screwing up two best guy friends' relationship, "I Love You, Man" is about Peter Klaven, a man whose relationship with a new best guy friend comes in between his seemingly perfect engagement to Zooey (Rashida Jones). Peter, who has always been the perfect boyfriend, has never had a successful friendship with a guy. Even his gay brother Robbie (Samberg) is more masculine and better at talking to straight guys. Rudd perfectly plays up the softie who dares to be a dude and fails miserably, coming up with nonsensical catch phrases and nicknames as he tries to fit in with his new friend, Sydney (Segel).The plot is a fresh twist off an old formula, this time playing into the recent pop culture idea of guys being "bros." Rudd perfectly fits this mold: he has always been able to fit whatever role he wants, and now as a leading man, he gets a chance to show off his flexibility. Only he, too, can make saying "slappin' the bass" funny the 15th time. Different from his Apatow films, however, "I Love You, Man" is more the sentimental type, leaning more toward the romance side of comedy. It stays away from the extreme dirtiness that have given Apatow comedies the "Apatow" label. That only makes sense though coming from director John Hamburg, most known for writing the PG-13 "Meet the Parents" films and Barry Levin (writer behind "Dr. Doolittle" and its sequel)."I Love You, Man" is the best comedy of 2009 so far, a great date movie in that it amply makes fun of both sexes and has ways of appealing to both as well. It's not without some weak spots, however. Instead of just being weird, for example, the characters acknowledge that they're being weird (Paul Rudd says "Did I just say that?" or "What does that mean?" a lot) and the humor loses some of its effect. There are also one too many musical tributes to the band Rush. In general, "I Love You, Man" is good, but it does expose that behind this decade's best comedies is a simple formula that's bound to get rusty soon.
Carter and Lee, the famously diverse detective duo are back, and this time it's more pointless than ever. "Rush Hour 3" hopes that six years after the second film that viewers will be ready to jump back in with those quirky characters without any promise of bringing something new to the table. Not only does it settle for the same action gags and obnoxious jokes, but it seems to care even less about delivering them with any creative tact. It's like a mildly entertaining TV show episode.The plot, something else not quite new, involves an assassination attempt on the life of Chinese Ambassador Han, which results in Carter and Lee traveling to France simply for a change of scenery because the US and China have already been done in the last two films. There in Paris, they are out to find and protect a girl with a secret list of names.It's not that all of a sudden Chris Tucker got unfunny, but for the money they are paying him, they ought to try and improve his gag. He still treats women inappropriately and has blatant disregard for political correct speech except this time he just forces it at awkward moments. It sounded like writer Jeff Nathanson and director Brett Ratner were just hoping that because Tucker and Chan are black and Chinese respectively, that they were free from criticism of prejudice. It's not offensive, but "Rush Hour 3" walks a fine line with some of the dialogue.The fight sequences are respectable as always, but even some of the action gags have been seen before. Nothing jumps out as particularly cool. Somehow there's always falling off a tall building in these movies and so this one follows suit with no good reason. Even the film's ending blooper reel feels remarkably like "Rush Hour 2's"The appeal has simply worn off on this 10-year franchise. There was no indication that a third film would be successful 9 years after the first, but Ratner and the producers just decided to give it another go and hope the cash would follow anyway. Considering the movie barely grossed the estimated budget, I would say there will be substantial improvements if we are to see Tucker and Chan dance to "War" a fourth time. Even then, will anybody care?
Admitably, there's something innately satisfying about watching the hypothetical demise of the entire planet by means of natural disaster/earth crust displacement. There might even be something profound science fiction-wise lurking about in the concept of the Mayan apocalypse and the end of the world as we know it. For better or worse, "2012" is a little more interested in humanity's gross interest in its own near-extinction aka stuff crumbles. Who better to envision such a disaster than "The Day After Tomorrow" director Roland Emmerich, also the thrills genius behind "Independence Day," a fact that gets mentioned in every trailer for his subsequent movies as if no film has come close to the "gold standard" set forth by that 15-year-old antiquated alien invasion movie adored because of an infamous movie speech.To his credit though, Emmerich doesn't make boring movies. "2012" is long, but it's not all that dull. It just takes about a half hour for hell to break loose -- literally, if hell is indeed underground, it tears it loose in California. Before the offensively unrealistic escape scenes though, we get our set up that an Indian scientist has confirmed that the Mayan apocalypse will indeed happen on 12-21-12 and it leads to an operation organized by world leaders to build massive refuge boats. It's kept entirely secret, however, to avoid unnecessary mass hysteria. Reasonable considering almost the entire world population is going to be wiped out anyway.To relate to this disaster through people we get Jackson Curtis (Cusack) who is divorced but trying to mend his relationship with his kids when disaster strikes. On a trip to Yellowstone with the kids, he meets Woody Harrelson who has been following the conspiracy and possesses maps to the ships, a helpful tidbit when all of LA starts to go underwater. Fortunately, his ex's (Peet) boyfriend has taken flying lessons and they manage to procure the maps and escape certain death when Yellowstone becomes the world's biggest erupting volcano.If there had been any attempt by Emmerich to make the escape realistic, it might have saved his movie for me, but it's too implausible to ignore. Once they get out of the United States and time marches on it becomes less of a sore spot, but it certain cuts into one's enjoyment of the film. I like to be entertained on a base level, but I don't like to be insulted in my make- believe either.The visual effects are strong and certainly watching things just disintegrate is among the most enjoyable aspects of the movie. Then there's also that little thrill you get from disaster flicks when people who suck die painful deaths. Emmerich is certainly all about killing off characters that violate his moral principles; this script does hit on the idea of our world leaders being selfish and thinking they would be the most vital to start the human race over again, but other than one impassioned speech, ignores themes in general.In this trend of apocalypse movies, there is certainly a chance for a film to come along and provide that sick thrill of seeing destruction yet also raise some important questions about human nature. "2012" is not that film, but it does highlight the possibility for that film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Japan, international capital of anime, video games, flashy signs and wacky game shows now plays backdrop in "Lost In Translation" a nuanced and independently spirited film written and directed Sofia Coppola, daughter of -- yeah, that guy. Never before has Tokyo been portrayed as a playground for Western indie antics, but that's what this film is about: two essentially boring but likable characters at different crisis points in their lives finding each other half way around the world. Tokyo isn't celebrated here as much as it's meant to be a flashy gargantuan metaphor for everything Westerners like in their little independent dramas.The film stars Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, two actors clearly representative of an age gap, which adds a nice touch to the film. Murray recognizes he can't play the same parts he used to and continues to portray older men with a dry sense of humor, out-or-work actor Bob Harris here being no exception. Bob is in Tokyo filming a commercial for a Japanese whiskey brand that will earn him $2 million. Johansson plays Charlotte, a young married woman accompanying her photographer husband who isn't sure if she's made the right choice. Both characters are troubled by their predicament in Japan and want out, but that changes when they meet each other.Their unlikely friendship borders on the non-platonic and Coppola wants your formula- drugged Western mind to go there as she plays up the tension: one way of maintaining your interest in an otherwise uneventful film.It's not that "Lost In Translation" is boring, it's just subtle in its themes and asks too much of the viewer in terms of how much work must be done to get something meaningful out of it, at least for the bulk of the film. A long wide shot of Murray playing golf by himself with a Japanese mountain in the background has a lot of meaning when you internalize it for a bit, but it doesn't engage the viewer quite like a good dialog. The movie is so quiet sometimes, yet when it speaks it has great things to say -- it just needs to be saying them a bit more."Lost In Translation" futzes around indeed, but in its uneventful glory, it comes across as one of the more honest depictions of a relationship, especially of one between two people at such different places on the age continuum. With the exception of a few overtly bland lines too many when trying to get across the monotony of Bob's relationship with his wife, everything feels substantially more real. Murray pulls this off surprisingly well and Johansson, well, she's a gem. Knowing her now as Woody Allen's 21st Century muse, I've no doubt that this performance got her those parts.So Japan just becomes a lost character in a sense, a way to compound the frustrations of a horrifically Western lifestyle with its eccentric citizens and obvious language hurdles. It's not one of the most brilliant inclusions of a setting as a character, but it provides a rich new way to tell a twist on the different age but similar life destinations story.
To use a completely irrelevant but title-appropriate expression, when it comes to comedy, women tend to be the bridesmaids and never the bride. Prior to "Bridesmaids," the only mainstream comedy driven by females that I can recall (at least in the Judd Apatow era) is Tina Fey's "Baby Mama" back in 2008. Comedies preceded by a "romantic-" given the nature of their intended demographic, don't count, at least not in the eyes of the general public. Fittingly produced by Apatow, "Bridesmaids" fights all these assumptions and historical tendencies better than you'd expect.Star and writer Kristen Wiig and co-writer Annie Mumolo pick a fight with the biggest and most relentless rom-com formula at the party: the wedding story. It's not exactly the easiest way to challenge the general perspective on women-centered comedies, but if successfully avant-garde enough, has the greatest potential for turning the genre on its head a bit while still appealing to the women who still prefer to indulge in these repetitive story lines.Some of "Bridesmaids" most effective marketing came from a critic who called it "'The Hangover' for women." The only things the two films have in common is that a wedding sets in the events in motion and they both expressed a desire to push R-rated boundaries. "Bridesmaids" has a much more traditional comedy structure and heavy doses of romance.Annie (Wiig) has hit a mid-30s crisis: her dream of opening a bakery came true but got cut down thanks to the recession, she has a crappy living situation and she keeps going back to a guy (Jon Hamm) who's rich and good-looking but doesn't care about her. Her one rock has been her life-long best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph). When Lillian gets engaged, Annie assumes the duty of Maid of Honor, but the tremendously pretty and rich Helen, another bridesmaid, seems intent to steal that out from under her, which pushes Annie over the edge.The script puts a particular emphasis on developing Annie's character to the fullest, which hurts the comedic rhythm of the film a bit, but ultimately makes "Bridesmaids" a stronger film. The movie doesn't quite live up to being billed as hysterical with exception of a few boundary-pushing scenes and takes awhile to get going, but the emotional parts don't set off a chain reaction of eye-rolling, which alone puts "Bridesmaids" in a higher tier as far as rom-coms go. A montage scene toward the beginning when Annie bakes herself a singular ornate cupcake and then eats it for lack of a better idea drastically slows the film down, but might contain more intelligence in those two minutes than most romantic comedies can fit in two hours. Most of the heart comes from a terrific and believable relationship between Annie and Lillian. Their scenes drag on a bit as these are two talented improvisers volleying the humor back and forth. They carry on like any two best girlfriends but with a touch only true comedians can offer. "Bridesmaids" mostly showcases Wiig's off-beat awkward humor. Annie comes across as a lady-like Larry David character, someone you pity to death and care about but who can be completely nuts and usually causes all her own problems by reacting poorly to adversity.Outside of the cat-fighting between Annie and Helen, the rest of the bridesmaids get short- changed (another reason to separate this from "The Hangover") except for Melissa McCarthy as Megan, a character so multi-dimensional that you never know just what to expect from her. As much as this will feel like speaking poison, she could warrant her own spin-off."Bridesmaids" doesn't break the mold and completely usurp female comedy conventions, but some of the film's best characteristics do offer proof that women can be funny in a mainstream way, at least when the characters receive thoughtful treatment. The R-rated gross-out humor could have backfired, but it was treated in such a way that it effectively enhanced the story and fit the characters, something most rom-coms that try similar tactics fail to achieve.Hopefully Wiig keeps churning out films and can train some other hopeful lady comics to follow in her footsteps so that romantic comedies can truly be enjoyed by everyone again.~Steven CCheck out my site, moviemusereviews.com!
The eternal question of "what happens after we die?" is about as enigmatic as the kind of film Clint Eastwood's latest, "Hereafter," tries to be. Supernatural? Thriller? Relationship drama? The film will likely defy most audience expectations, so to be helpful, the answer is all of the above, but mostly "c.) relationship drama," final answer. Eastwood tries his hand at intertwining three separate stories about death/the afterlife that as one might predict, converge in the end. It's a common and often successful film structure -- if you're Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Eastwood is not as adept at this as the plot-weaving master/director of "Amores Perros," "21 Grams" and "Babel," but he finds some touching moments with these characters as he so often does, and he also provides a solid list of interesting, albeit scattered, questions and discussion points.The story is an unconventional choice for both Eastwood and for screenwriter Peter Morgan, who is known for British historical fiction ("The Queen," "Frost/Nixon"). Eastwood's strength in this stage of his career has been the human factor, so that stands out as the film's strength too. His second collaboration with Matt Damon proves to be successful yet again in that regard. Damon's story captivates more than the other two; he plays a psychic medium trying to "quit" because he sees his ability as a curse. He shares a juicy scene with Bryce Dallas Howard that has nothing to do with death, but Eastwood captures the tension perfectly. "Hereafter" has any number of highlights such as this, but the cohesiveness lacks.Of the two other stories, one follows a wealthy French newscaster (Cecile de France) whose life course changes drastically when she survives a tsunami and has a near-death experience in which she briefly "crosses over" to what she describes as the titular "hereafter." The other follows a young English boy who loses his twin brother in an accident and his search for answers. The setup for these different plot lines drags and sometimes the film becomes flat- out boring, but again, certain scenes are strong in the way one would expect from Eastwood or Morgan.The script provides a high doses of insight despite the clunky pacing. The focus stays on the way that death affects the living, specifically the impact it has on the other elements of one's life such as the ability to forge relationships with others, career aspirations and forming one's own identity. It's an exploration or a case study on the impact of death and how it alters the way we move forward -- it's just little more than that.In one scene, the young boy, Marcus, turns to Google for answers in a quick brilliant clip. He types "what happens when we die?" into the search bar and then clicks on several different YouTube videos of religious figures explaining their views such as "all will be okay if you believe in Jesus Christ." The brief scene offers a fantastic commentary about where we go for answers these days that could generate a day-long conversation , but in the context of the whole film, it doesn't fit the tone.Continuity acts as the biggest obstacle for multi-story films and its especially formidable in "Hereafter." The films that get over the hump, such as some of Inarritu's films, "Crash," "City of God" and more garner heaps of critical praise, but the ones that don't make it over the top usually roll all the way back down. But with "Hereafter," Eastwood finds enough tender moments and makes enough interesting observations about the characters that the film, as messy as it is, never entirely falters.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
It's time to suit up, because the comic film genre has a new face bringing it back to life and it's a shiny one. "Iron Man" delivers everything you want in a comic book-based film and is probably the best thing to happen to Marvel Studios since Spider-Man 2--that's nearly 4 years of a lot of money with disappointing delivery. A good start for the first film fully produced by the studio with no additional funding.Iron Man is not the most well-loved of Marvel characters, but at this point in the Marvel film universe, he feels like next logical step to give the comic company a boost in the right direction. The man is Tony Stark (Downey Jr.), a millionaire playboy in the arms dealing business. On a routine demonstration trip in Afghanistan (updated to the modern era), Stark is captured and held hostage by a rebel band of Afghanis who demand he build them one of his best missiles. Instead, Stark devises a plan to build a suit of armor so he can escape.A victim of the very weapons he created, Stark's uniqueness in comparison to other Marvel heroes Stan Lee has created is that he learns the error of his ways, his ignorance to the evil his industry produces, and the experience changes his perspective. It's not a vengeance story, it's one of personal redemption. Downey Jr. carries this film. Not entirely, but the film focuses more on his discovery and creation of Iron Man than it does on him being on Iron Man and fighting evil, a wonderful choice by the writers. Downey Jr.'s standard witty comedic acting fits this perfectly as finally there is a superhero with a sense of humor. "Iron Man" could be the funniest of all superhero films, or at least it certainly beats the awkward attempts of "Spider-Man 3." Marvel was way overdue for introducing a new character after the 3rd installments of the "X- Men" and "Spider-Man" franchises. An origin story, the reason why those other franchises took off, was in order. Those films were fantastic in many ways, but failed because they tried to do too much and "Iron Man" doesn't. The plot is straightforward. Now there have been other Marvel origin films "Hulk" and "Daredevil" for example, that fail as well. "Iron Man" is better than those films because it is so focused on Stark's character. This is interesting and fascinating because of the visual effects and the sheer creativity of those behind the concept of what his suit could actually do. A lot of scenes are test scenes and while not much is going on, they're really cool and captivating. There's no law that superheroes have to spend most of their time as the hero and fighting. "Iron Man" doesn't do that--it reserves that for the climax of the film and doesn't dwell there any longer than it must. You want more, but what you do get isn't bad.The supporting cast really helps too. Bridges in his first truly evil role as Stark's adviser turned-bad, Obadiah Stane, is great, Paltrow provides a nice change of pace as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts and even Terrence Howard is likable as Stark's friend and military ally, Jim Rhodes.The only thing to complain about "Iron Man" is that there wasn't enough. So much time, though rightly so, was spent on Stark's development of "Iron Man" that there wasn't enough room for more awesome action sequences in the suit and most disappointing of all, further thematic development, which is what made Spider-Man revolutionary. It's all there, but it doesn't get as much attention as it should. A second viewing might bring those themes home more.Jon Favreau should get incredible applause for outdoing the skepticism he unjustly received when it was first revealed he would be at the helm. There are plenty of treats for the comic book fans in this film and there's just a lot of great realism to this film than previous films too focused on great one-liners and the like, which is what someone like Favreau of the "dude romantic comedy" persuasion can bring to a genre in so much need of that normal/ human touch.
"Return of the Jedi" loves the Star Wars franchise so much, it even decided to bring the Death Star back for a second go-around. That's how much Episode VI is truly a smörgåsbord of all things Star Wars. We get new spaceships in the rebel fleet, a slew of new and bizarre creature/characters, better special effects and the climax of our hero, Luke Skywalker, on his journey toward his destiny.In the third installment, a new-look demi-jedi Luke and the crew save Han from Jabba the Hutt and then offer their services to the rebellion's plan to stop the construction of the second Death Star. All this time, Luke is aware he will have to confront Darth Vader, his father.Luke's maturity reaches an apex in "Jedi" that we got a sense of at the end of "The Empire Strikes Back." Only this time, he's not only confident, but got the skills to prove it. He becomes the true hero of the series, taking that cool guy spotlight away from Han Solo entirely. This is a film about him above all else and the way it unfolds does his story justice. The idea that we are to identify and transform as Luke does in the trilogy unfolds beautifully in the final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor.Visually, "Jedi" blows away the previous two films. The space scenes in particular are much more stunning. Other than that, there's not much of a difference. "Jedi" prides itself on continuing to add to and expand the Star Wars universe as well as your imagination.Whether "Jedi" is the best Star Wars film is simply a matter of which part of the saga resonates most with you. A lot of it will depend on your opinion of Ewoks, the fuzzy midget bear creatures that inhabit the moon of Endor. If you find them cute and entertaining, "Jedi" is probably your favorite of the saga. If you find them annoying and just a bunch of small, furry jokes for characters, "Empire" is probably your favorite film.A lot of it is also about what aspect of Star Wars lore appeals to you. If you're more into the Han and Leia subplot, "Empire" is better. If you're about the evolution of Luke and are riveted by his confrontation with the Dark Side, "Jedi" is about as good as it gets. Either way, you can't really complain with "Jedi" because it offers a lot to be entertained by.
The mystery of making a great comedy sequel has been solved. The catch? Now that it's been done, it can never be done again."22 Jump Street" is on par with its predecessor. What it loses in freshness it makes up for with sheer wit. The first movie was a genre sendup nothing short of genius, and Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill, who whipped up the first film's story, have gone all in on the sequel: no, not bigger and crazier, but more tongue-in-cheek and self-aware.If directors Christopher Miller and Phil Lord ("21 Jump Street," "The LEGO Movie," "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs") hadn't earned carte blanche already, making one of the only good comedy sequels of all time will. This feat is so hard to achieve, it arguably warrants "22 Jump Street" a perfect rating. But the reality is that the film is more of the same, it just knows it, and the filmmakers package it exceptionally well.In fact, in the first self-aware scene, Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are debriefed by Dep. Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman)  in and of itself a replica of a scene in the first film  who tells them how their first mission was a big success, and no one expected it, so now the department is throwing more money at them in hopes of a bigger success, and he encourages them to do "the exact same thing." This becomes a motif of the movie, so it knowingly replicates itself. By and large this works (both actually and in the meta sense) though there are slow parts in the beginning.Essentially, as promised at the end of the first movie, Schmidt and Jenko have to go undercover at a college to find yet another new synthetic drug. They find it a little more challenging to accomplish than last time, but ultimately they both connect with students who are connected to their only lead: Schmidt falls for an art major (Amber Stevens) while Jenko meets his twin (personality-wise) in Wyatt Russell's character, a quarterback and frat boy.Of course with any comedy sequel, doing "the exact same thing" puts the movie at risk for getting stale. "The Hangover: Part 2" is a prime example of trotting out the same exact formula and failing miserably. "22 Jump Street" counters this problem by laughing at itself a lot and going over the top with the repetitive, familiar scenes, such as whenever Schmidt and Jenko fight with each other and go off on their own. It also stays fresh just by the extent to which it copies stuff from the first movie and does so while winking at the camera.In order for this to really work, however, the foundation still has to be solid and Hill and Tatum provide that effortlessly. Their chemistry maintains interest in the story even though the story has no interest in taking itself seriously. Tatum was a secret weapon the first time around, as no one had seen him do comedy like this, but he still pulls off the meat-headed pretty boy man- child while Hill does his improvisation thing and proves why he's the class of the Judd Apatow prodigies. The supporting cast doesn't add much (Ice Cube is what you'd expect) though Jillian Bell's dry deadpan evokes some Kristen Wiig before she became a star.So why can't this type of comedy sequel be replicated ever again? Not every would-be comedy franchise can just make fun of itself in this meta way and poke fun at sequels in general. And the truth is that doing so was the difference-maker. Without an action scene, for example, in which the main characters are trying to outrun drug dealers in a football helmet golf cart and avoiding hitting stuff because too much wreckage will "cost the department too much money," it's just a dumb chase scene. "22 Jump Street" would've surprised and impressed very few people without these twists. And now that the meta card has been played, it's hard to envision a third "Jump Street" as good as the first two. You can't just play another and surprise anyone. Perhaps that's why we get a highly amusing credits sequence at the end.How nice, however, to tell that a sequel really tried to be better and conveyed that to the audience. Rather than just throw something together to take advantage of the comedy sequel cash cow, Bacall, Hill, Lord, Miller and the other screenwriters really put some intelligence into making "22 Jump Street" and the genre is better for it.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Having seen the terrific "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun," I felt like there was very little "need" to make "Hot Shots!," a spoof of "Top Gun" and other military and non-military movies. Its predecessors targeted entire genres that deserved to be made fun of: disaster movies ("Airplane!") and cop movies/TV shows ("The Naked Gun"). "Hot Shots!" takes aim at too broad a spectrum and despite a few good performances is really just that same old subtle and literal humor from two of the writers of those previous fantastic spoof movies, Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft.The plot is incredibly immaterial in "Hot Shots!" Anyone used to watching one of the spoof movies from these writers is trained by now to look for the jokes hidden throughout. In "Hot Shots!" more of those jokes are forced in and don't tie in to the plot that they completely detract from it. I can't say I gave the film a concerted effort, but I don't remember what it was about other than ace pilot Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) being afraid to fly because of the death of his father.Sheen, although not bad, is also not the type of comedian to best handle this kind of material. He's no Leslie Nielsen in "The Naked Gun" and not even really a Robert Hays ("Airplane!") who might not be as good an actor in general, but knew how to play this kind of humor. Part of this could be that his character is written to be a hot shot, but either way it just doesn't make "Hot Shots!" lovable.Still good for those one-time laughs when you catch a clever or ridiculous joke, "Hot Shots!" is not a failure by any means, just same old, same old. Topper cooking breakfast on Valeria Golino's midriff instead of a sex scene is remarkably crazy and hilarious and being from the Midwest, I appreciated that the Native American language consisted mostly of towns in Wisconsin. Any film attributed to Abrahams, Proft or the Zuckers is always going to have its gems, but "Hot Shots!" as an overall film doesn't work as well as the classics they churned out in the '80s.
Some will say "Jaws" and other will say "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," but the 1982 "Poltergeist" offers the Exhibit B for of the longevity of Steven Spielberg's magic. Written and produced by the legendary filmmaker, this supernatural horror film evokes the imagination, despite the thin layer of cheese and the now-dated special effects. Standing unfairly in Spielberg's shadow is "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" director Tobe Hooper, who makes "Poltergeist" eerie and suspenseful enough to keep the film engaging when the special effects are full-blown and the lid has been popped off in terms of realism. The subtle and effective camera movements at various moments will keep you on edge, some technique that draws slightly upon Hitchcock (as well as Spielberg, who undoubtedly had a hand or two in much of the production seeing as he was on set most of the time)."Poltergeist" tells the story of a young family in California living in a development who experiences supernatural activity in its house starting with the youngest daughter hearing voices in the TV set and continuing with moving kitchen furniture. At first it seems like some fascinating paranormal activity, but soon it becomes anything but subtle.Despite the film's full-on embrace of the supernatural instead of sticking with minute suspense, there's still a strong curiosity factor that makes the ghostly mayhem intriguing rather than scattered and unnecessarily chaotic. Much of the events happen before we have any true sense of what's going on, which draws us in to figuring out what the events might signify and of course how they'll be resolved. In this sense, "Poltergeist" remains suspenseful throughout, making it effective through the excessive use of strobe lights and wind machines.The cast also possesses an anonymity which keeps the focus on what's happening in the house and suggests that this could "happen to anyone." Horror films started casting unknowns mostly to keep costs down, but the tradition certainly has value in films such as this because big-name stars would draw too much attention to the performances and not to the events. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams as Steven and Diane are a fairly simplistic couple and they don't overcompensate when it all goes down by freaking out any more than they have to freak out.Haunted house films have always had some old-era Victorian feel to them, but "Poltergeist" brought the classic concept into the modern era by brilliantly crossing something as ordinary as a house with something as extraordinary as a supernatural terror.~Steven CThanks for Reading!

After "The Bourne Ultimatum" became the most successful and critically praised film of a trilogy considered the consummate modern spy series, it was only a matter of time before the saga continued. With that film's director, Paul Greengrass, interested in pursuing other projects, and star Matt Damon uninterested in returning without Greengrass, Universal has been forced to expand the "Bourne" universe, and the result is "The Bourne Legacy."For those up in arms over the continuing of the franchise without Damon front and center, fast-rising action star Jeremy Renner assumes the new face of of the series without skipping a beat as Aaron Cross, the product of another CIA program offshoot of Treadstone called Outcome. Backed by the talents of Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton  and co-written and directed by longtime series scribe Tony Gilroy  "The Bourne Legacy" keeps tonally with the original trilogy and generates the same degree of respect.In terms of the "Bourne" consistency, "Legacy" maintains the back-and-forth structure of the skilled spy on the loose vs. the CIA division trying to track him down. The film takes place at the same time as "Ultimatum." When Jason Bourne becomes a media story as seen in that film, the CIA senses a public relations nightmare is about to unfold, and Norton's Eric Byer  the man behind most of the agency's black ops programs  has to clean up the mess.Byer finds damning evidence connecting Blackbriar to Outcome, a program involving nine agents who have received physical and mental genetic enhancements and assist in top-secret military reconnaissance. Given the Bourne fiasco, he determines the best way to save the body is amputate the limb, and Cross and all "participants" in the Outcome program are targeted.Given the advanced science involved in Outcome, the CIA employed a top-flight science facility to regularly check in with those agents and test new genetic drugs. Weisz's Dr. Marta Shearing soon finds her life in jeopardy and her name in the headlines, and after Cross survives an attempt to wipe him off the map, he connects with her and the two go on the run.This story really opens the door up to the potential of the series going forward. At one point we learn just how many secret black ops programs the CIA has commissioned, which will surely capture the imagination of series fans who have steeped themselves in the world of "Bourne."As its own film, however, "Legacy" is missing some key pieces. Especially at the beginning, Gilroy focuses extensively on connecting the original trilogy to this new part of the "Bourne" universe. One of his and Universal's primary concerns appears to be providing just cause for continuing the franchise rather than delivering a complete spy action/thriller. Even the opening shot of "Legacy" directly mirrors the closing shot of "Ultimatum."Mostly, it's the conclusion that doesn't do the build-up justice. The script appropriately takes its time with the construction of Cross and Marta and clearly sets up their motivations, except that they are motivations out of necessity rather than desire, which ultimately takes a toll on the emotional payoff. "Legacy" just doesn't arrive anywhere, content instead to be the start of something new.Sticking to the series formula gives "Legacy" a certain level of comfort. There's no lack of "Bourne"-patented clever solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems, exotic locales or impressive enemy takedowns. If anything, it's a little too reliant on what worked in the past, unwilling to take big risks and consequently unable to strike any new notes.More exposition also means less time for action. The trailer spoils most of the best action moments in the film, and in general "Legacy" doesn't aspire to reach the bar set by previous entries. Gilroy proves an adequate director in this regard, possessing Greengrass' eye for frenetic action but without the same degree of editing prowess."The Bourne Legacy" amounts to a stepping stone to what can be for this franchise rather than exploding out of the gate as the start of something special. As has been the case with the filmmaking choices in key reboots this year, namely "The Amazing Spider-Man," there has been a willingness to make sacrifices in the first "new" entry so that future installments can run off the leash. In theory, Aaron Cross isn't tied to anything. He could even team up with Jason Bourne in the future and take it once more to Langley's doorstep.There's legitimate promise in the future of all things "Bourne," so at the worst, "Legacy" comes out as one of the lesser entries of an otherwise exceptional series. There are much, much uglier blemishes on the records of Hollywood's biggest and best franchises. If anything, "Legacy" should end up a tiny, even glamorous scar in the service of something great.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
Anyone who has to direct another movie after his first feature film won him a Best Director Oscar, has to be scared out of his mind. How do you top that? Seriously. Although "Road to Perdition" is an impassioned story (based on a graphic novel) of an Irish mobster and his son trying to stay alive, its screenplay is not the opus that "American Beauty" was. So, how do you approach your next directorial project when the bar is absurdly high? Whatever Sam Mendes did, it worked, because "Perdition" is just as beautiful and poetic.The posthumous Oscar for cinematographer Conrad L. Hall is much deserved. "Perdition" is a story that takes death rather lightly with a very high body count and as seen in "American Beauty," Mendes will settle for nothing but the most visually memorable and poetic of tragic climaxes and deaths. These two make quite a team, inflating what's just a good but not great script into a rich and striking film. They milk everything they can out of the film's most poignant moments and convince you of that feeling that you're watching incredible, meaningful cinema when it's just a very good/interesting story at best.Taking place in 1930s Illinois and Chicago, "Perdition" is about Michael Sullivan, a hit man (Hanks) with two young boys working for an Irish mob boss John Rooney (Newman) -- loosely based on real gangster John Looney -- who gave him everything he's ever had. When a curious Michael Jr. wants to know what his father does, he accidentally witnesses a hit gone wrong, which puts Sullivan in bad standing with his mob family. Rooney then has his son, Connor (Daniel Craig), off Sullivan's family. Sullivan and Michael Jr. manage to survive and flee to Chicago, where they are still wanted dead. Soon, father and son must be honest with each other in order to survive and Sullivan will do anything to get his revenge yet still keep his son away from it all.The cast is great, but an actor with Tom Hanks' versatile talent has no business playing a hit man of few words. Perhaps the notion of a audiences thinking it's "just another mob film" scared Mendes and other producers into getting a marquee name, but all you have to do is say Paul New-- and the old people start flocking. Newman gets a supporting Oscar nod for nothing but the respect he commands of the camera and on the screen. A mob boss is such an intriguing role for a then mostly retired famous actor and it definitely gives "Perdition" something give it that instant classic feel."Perdition" avoids telling us all the mob stuff we already know from watching "The Godfather" and "Goodfellas" in terms of organized crime life being about loyalty, respect and family, etc. It jumps right into the fresh angle it's taking: the relationship between a hit man and his son. It's a story of guarding innocence in the face of harsh, immoral reality.Most of the film is just a thriller with Sullivan finding ways to get his revenge while avoiding the man hired to whack him (Jude Law). There's a lot of killing and the general rule has always been the more killing, the less meaningful death becomes and the more silly and less serious a film is (theoretically why action movies don't get taken seriously). But Mendes and Hall take exception, making sure these deaths will give you enough chills to forget that you're tired of seeing people get shot. Lots of films have you guessing who will die -- "Perdition" has you guessing what order.The script is good, just a little deliberate. It's not shy about letting you know what it's about and what its themes are, which is always good for some viewers and souring for others. But in the end its the thoughtful and artistic eye of Mendes that wins out as the film closes with a thrilling, beautiful and near-perfect climax. Mob movies might have gotten old for some people already, but it would be inadvisable to skip out on such great film-making for that reason.
"A New Hope" opened us up to a galaxy of possibilities. "The Empires Strikes Back" begins to show us just how large that scope really is. Not only that, but there is a definite sense that "Star Wars" has grown up a little bit in Episode V, including taking a much darker tone.After the destruction of the Death Star, the war between the Rebellion and the Empire is on. "Empire" takes us first to the icy tundra of Hoth, then to the jungles of Degobah and lastly the futuristic Bespin aka Cloud City. Immediately our imaginations begin to expand. In terms of characters, we are introduced to Yoda, the ancient Jedi master who begins training Luke. There is also Boba Fett, the cool-looking bounty hunter in the awesome ship and Lando Calrissian, the handsome new friend to the original gang. The film doesn't settle with what we are familiar with from Episode 4 and keeps pushing our imagination further.Most importantly, the characters that we fell in love with previously seem a lot more viable than they once were, not merely vessels for the exchange of brash remarks and one-liners. Princess Leia (now sporting a more femme fatal look as suits her true character) and Han Solo begin to carve out a relationship that is essential to the greatness of this film. Luke's maturity is just as important. We're blown away by the famous ending scene with Luke and Vader because of how far Luke has come since his days on a desert farm. He no longer sounds like an idiot every time he opens his mouth. Last but far from least, even Vader, the enigma, becomes more complicated in this film. The character development is really what makes this film considered the best of the entire saga by many, many fans. So many times, nearly all the time, do middle films in a trilogy fail in comparison to the films on either side of them, but "Empire" doesn't. Most of the time it can end up as just a bridge with no ability to stand on its own, but it stands on its own. It borrows just enough from "Hope" and sets things in motion just enough that it does its job as a transitioning film, but the climax is kind of thrilling in its own way, not just as in we can't wait to see what happens next. It has plenty of its own, new elements to keep it fresh and like an expansion of the original as opposed to a mere continuation of it.
Murder mysteries don't often indulge their audience's intellectual capacity. They generally believe they can get by on suspense, intrigue and our inherent and insatiable need to find out 'whodunit.' But "Se7en" is a philosophical thriller that addresses a much bigger part of our nature - the age old question of whether or not humans are inherently evil. As gripping as it is the way it turns gears in your head in search of any way to get mentally one step ahead of the plot, "Se7en" is a first-rate crime thriller because of the ideas fueling the story and a director in David Fincher who perfectly understands them.More than a story of two detectives on the trail of a serial killer committing murders based on the seven deadly sins, "Se7en" wants to be something bigger. It wants you to take a breather from figuring it out and chew on something a little more sophisticated, like say, human nature. The contemplative script by Andrew Kevin Walker gives us plenty of time for this as retiring Lt. Somerset (Freeman) and Det. Mills (Pitt) bicker over the killer's motives together or even have dinner at Mills' apartment. It's not just about the mystery and what psychology or ideals drive the killer -- those ideas echo throughout the film and even in these basic conversational scenes.None of that would be communicated well, however, without Fincher ("Alien 3"). "Se7en" takes place in an unnamed rundown city, presumably in modern day, and that locational flexibility allows Fincher and whoever scouted locations the ability to film the movie in places that would better tell this story about human nature. The murder scenes take place in seedy, decrepit apartments -- all usually dark -- in attempt to tell a story of humanity in its darkest place, at it's very worst. Constant use of on-screen lights (e.g characters holding flashlights, red lamps, etc) give the film its signature while also extending the metaphor. It's the work of a director who understands the script through and through and has command of his vision.The characters are also extremely sophisticated and believable as are the performances of the actors playing them. Freeman comes fresh off his Oscar-winning performance in "The Shawshank Redemption" and absolutely dominates the pacing of the film. We take our cues on when to relax, when to get more curious and when to get passionate from his performance. On the verge of retirement, we see perfectly how this one life-changing case challenges his hardened world view.Even Pitt's Mills, in his impatience, naivety and quick-tempered rebellious perspective, goes quickly from characteristics that feel a little forced to monumentally epiphanic near the climax. Pitt's taken on numerous roles in his career where we think we're getting the shells of a character role but we end up getting something meaningful after all.That's sort of the way "Se7en" works on the whole. Before you can even realize it, you suddenly realize you've been watching a thoughtful two-hour sermon about mankind's true nature and its inclination toward evil with a large order of murder mystery on the side. Few thrillers give us the pleasure of meditating on such important ideas, in this case a question at the center of philosophy for hundreds if not thousands of years. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Everything that can be said about an actual date night (namely predictable) can be said about "Date Night." No denying that stars Steve Carell and Tina Fey possess the most universal and multi-generational comic chops of any two comedians working today, but they certainly have to work to chew "Date Night" into something palatable.Contrived best describes Josh Klausner's script, but a film this processed comes into being at the top of the chain in Hollywood. In the eyes of a producer, "Date Night" attempts to combine the enduring appeal of action films with the relatability of a husband-wife comedy. In other words, plenty of wise-cracks about "the kids" in the midst of unfriendly gunfire. Fortunately, Fey and Carell manage to rise above it a majority of the time and not just comically speaking.The two play Phil and Claire Foster, a middle-aged married couple with two kids who try to make an effort to spend more time together and be intimate but fail given their jobs and roles as parents. After their friends (cameos by Kristen Wiig and Mark Ruffalo) mention they're getting divorced, they realize it's time to do something special and head to Manhattan for a night out at an overpriced seafood restaurant. Without a reservation, they have no luck, but they take the reservation of the Tripplehorns to get in anyway, only the Tripplehorns are apparently wanted by some bad folk. The date night turns into a fight for their lives as they become tangled in a web of NYC corruption -- not exactly easy to deal with for a couple from New Jersey.Carell's performance generally sticks with straight-laced husband, which makes his occasional jumps into typical wackiness more effective. Weird to say that it's good he's less himself and more a typical character, but it fits. Fey seems a bit out of a place in a wife-y role (as far as the comedy), but she works her charms impressively. Masters of improvising, the two have a lot of apparent fun, but more impressively they effectively work the odd pauses during the action for sincere/touching husband and wife redefining their relationship moments. These scenes would completely derail most films with lesser stars, but "Date Night" never once goes under with them at the helm.So while little praise can be heaped on this attempt to exploit the date night market in an anything but subtle way, few films of this ilk can actually back up the claim that they're entertaining and likable like "Date Night" does despite the myriad of shortcomings.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Love is timeless, of course, but relationships look different in every era. Drake Doremus has struck a nerve with "Like Crazy," which might eventually be seen as the seminal romance for the as-of-yet unnamed generation who grew up with the Internet.The story focuses on a long-distance relationship, which while not a novel concept, takes an entirely different shape in an age of text messages and instant communication halfway around the world. That's particularly important in "Like Crazy," which must establish conflict between a character in Los Angeles and one in England.Jacob (Anton Yelchin) and Anna (Felicity Jones) meet at school in L.A. and fall in love. After graduating, when Anna's visa is about to expire she makes the decision to violate it and stay longer in the States. When she makes a trip back home and then returns to the U.S., she gets denied entry into the country. The two must then reconcile their future and their relationship."Like Crazy" keeps a consistently organic and genuine tone, so it's no surprise that Yelchin and Jones improvised most of their dialogue based on a general plot outline. Both actors, especially Jones, communicate powerfully with non-verbals to build the authenticity of their chemistry and the story in general.Time moves in interesting ways as a result of this premise. Doremus and and co-writer Ben York Jones decide to focus on the blossoming moments of Anna and Jacob's relationship in a concise fashion, putting a lot of pressure on the believability and chemistry of their relationship. It works, but even more commendable is how they do it without depicting their first kiss or when they have sex for the first time, something that a Hollywood film wouldn't even think to do. Doremus seems much more interested in capturing Jacob and Anna's affection and longing for one another and in doing so we relate to the film better. Few people have Hollywood-style sex or the perfect first kiss.With their relationship paramount to the plot, Doremus and York Jones have to press certain buttons and place obstacles in their path in order to generate a substantial amount of conflict, especially when Anna and Jacob are not in the same country. You can't blame them for forcing it, but they use some sledge hammer symbolism that could've at least been toned down. This occurs in the moments when you least like the film, namely when Jacob and Anna start exploring other people played by Jennifer Lawrence and Charlie Bewley, but it's the kind of dislike that occurs because the film is doing its job.The jarring way in which Doremus and York Jones shoehorn conflict into the film or what they believe are subtle messages conveying how the characters feel and whether they're meant to be together is really the only big problem with "Like Crazy." It's noticeable, but will be easily forgiven by those that connect to the story and identify with the characters and their problem. Probability is extremely high that you've experienced something they endure or an emotion one of the characters deals with.With so much human interaction occurring on cell phones these days, you'd have to imagine it pretty tough to capture that on film in a natural way, but Doremus nails it. If you're younger, you've had text message conversations with people exactly like they do, and on an even more nuanced level, you've had the same conflict of emotions they experience while doing it: typing a response and deleting it, ignoring the text or responding and feeling guilty. Also noteworthy, Doremus borrows a lot of techniques from music videos to help communicate the change in time. When Anna and Jacob are in the throes of love, for example, he treats us to a rapid snapshot montage of them cuddling or sleeping in various positions and with varying degrees of clothing. Nothing groundbreaking there, but it gets the point across and the job done while also being visually memorable, which the best romance films find a way to be.The ambiguous ending and the turmoil that precedes it in the last 40 minutes of the movie will likely split opinion, but based on the bulk of the movie, you can tell that a fairy tale ending isn't what's in store. It could be that way while also being satisfying, but it doesn't tarnish the success "Like Crazy" has portraying 21st Century love in such a real way.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Few of us can truly grasp the economic fundamentals of the 2008 stock market crashhow it happened, why it happened. Most of what we understand are the after effects, the human consequences. Rookie filmmaker J.C. Chandor's "Margin Call" attempts to merge those two understandings: the economics and the executive-level decision-making with the real-life impact and gravity of the situation on those with the power to make big choices. "Margin Call" is not as sophisticated as you might think. For one, on at least three occasions a character requests that someone explain something to them in laymen's terms. Normally, such convenient and patronizing dialog would be disastrous, but as the film progresses and we continue to observe how the decisions of few affect the lives of many, the choice begins to make sense: you don't need to be a math and science wiz to call the shots.The film opens with layoffs at an investment firm in 2008. Stanley Tucci's character is among the victims of a rather succinct and soulless dismissal, but on his way out of the building, he hands a young analyst named Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) a disc drive with the verbal addendum "be careful." Sullivan tinkers with the information late that night when he discovers a pattern suggesting disastrous losses for the firm in the coming days. Chandor's script follows the journey of this piece of information as it climbs the ranks of the company and more and more decision-makers enter the process of determining what to do with it. It goes from Sullivan and his co-worker (Penn Badgley) to a trader on Sullivan's floor (Paul Bettany), then to the trading head on the floor (Kevin Spacey) and then to a pair of senior-level executives (Simon Baker and Demi Moore) before reaching the CEO (Jeremy Irons). Each assesses and reassesses the situation before making a decision with ripple effects down the chain of command and then passing it to the next highest official.The message is clear: the few in power outweigh the many. The bigger the problem gets, the harsher the decisions. Spacey's character appears to be the stubborn bad guy toward the beginning, but he transforms into someone we pity by the end because of the way the higher-ups handle the situation. These changes in our character perception come swiftly and without making much of a peep, and in the control of some stellar actors, it's more than a new filmmaker could ask for.The trouble with "Margin Call" comes from an inability to connect with a wide, everyman audience. By and large, the problems and dire situations of the film are white-collar dilemmas: rich people trying to figure out how to stay rich. Without some other kind of connection to the material, which could be as simple as an interest in markets and investments, it becomes hard to care about the characters or the problems they're dealing with. In spite of all the dialogue for dummies, much of what exactly is happening remains esoteric.The human connection comes too little too late for "Margin Call," though not in every sense. We do not see the impact of the film's events on the everyman until late in the game, when the realization hits that the traders of the firm must respond to orders from the top that will have a very trivial impact on their careers, and at the same time even more folks are at risk of losing their jobs. However, the conflict on screen is person-to-person, and the characters wrestle with all kinds of issues regarding their livelihood, the greater good and the welfare of the company. The film doesn't lack for humanity, it just lacks for gravity.Quinto, Bettany, Spacey, Tucci, Baker, Moore and Irons assure a certain standard for "Margin Call." They help put strong faces on talking heads arguing about issues far beyond the common person's understanding. It's not indecipherable gibberish or anything, but we can't learn and understand the logic at the rate at which it's explained, which means we can't process the emotions that come with it. Regardless, the actors crucially help us to realize the impact of the circumstances and consequently the language we struggle to understand."Margin Call" offers a rare experience, a peek into the cold truth of the financial world that forgoes the imposition of your usual characterizations for businesspeople: cutthroat execs, poor obedient peons, etc. The short time frame of the film's events helps give it a documentary feel minus a hand-held camera or any found footage labels. The portrait is genuine, but debatably accessible.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out my site, moviemusereviews.com
"The Hours" is not typical Hollywood dramatic fare. Its storytelling is much more literary--it has the silent, deeply dramatic quality of both a stage play and a novel, putting aside that it's based on the Michael Cunningham novel of the same title. Still, the way this film is edited to intertwine the three major plot lines and the way these talented actresses play their characters almost entirely in their faces at times makes it just as strong as a movie as it would be anything else.Three story lines connected to the book "Mrs. Dalloway" by Virginia Woolf are the focus of "The Hours." The first is of Woolf herself, played by Nicole Kidman, wrestling with the insanity that ultimately amounts in her death by suicide. The second is of a 1950s housewife (Julianne Moore) who is reading the book as she deals with her own feelings of unhappiness, and the third is a woman (Streep) in 2001 who is trying to throw a party for her former lover (Ed Harris) who is an author dying from AIDS that lovingly refers to her as the book's titular character.The most satisfying thing about this film is that it features some of the most unique and best work by quality actors who have never given such performances before in their careers. Kidman, in her Oscar-winning part as Virginia Woolf, simply transforms herself in a way we've never seen, even as remarkable as she was in "Moulin Rouge!" Tackling a character whose head you can really never truly get into the way she did, communicating as well as she was able to and bringing difficult dialog to a level that all could understand are some of the reasons she deserved her win. Moore is also incredible: her inner-monologue has you understanding her character and her struggles from start to finish. Harris also shows he can do versatility playing as distinct a character as the dying Richard. Streep is quite good too, but this is nothing we haven't seen her do before and even better.The story, though very introspective and lacking in action much of the time, is fascinating in the way that all three plots are entirely different but draw on the same ideas. Each, for example, addresses a homosexual impulse and each deals with attempts or thoughts of suicide. Naturally they all become inherently similar, and the way the film is edited to flash from one to other as early as the beginning credits suggests that they are all unified in some way. Director Stephen Daldry ("Billy Elliot") keeps the film easy to understand despite jumping back and forth, with due credit also to screenwriter David Hare.This is a film that despite looking at life from a difficult and depressing standpoint, is about dealing with a mundane, dissatisfying life and searching for an answer to it--a way out, a way to happiness. It dares to understand why we make the choice to live and why, sometimes, we make the choice to die. Once again, a difficult subject, but one that this film offers profound perspective on. Perhaps it's non-traditional in that all the plots take place in a one day span and a lot of the "action" is dialog, but its ability to work and weave all three women's lives is film-making at its finest.
Sometimes all it takes to make a movie is a good story with a director and a cast capable of seeing it for what it is. "The Blind Side" is an excellent example of why our interest continues to peak at the tagline "based on a true story" in movie trailers. You get the sense that Warner Bros, John Lee Hancock and star Sandra Bullock understand that the story they're telling is real, it's positive and it's heart-warming."The Blind Side" is the story of real-life football player Michael Oher, currently a left guard with the Baltimore Ravens who went from homeless to a first-round NFL pick with them help of the Tuohy family, who took him in and gave him the confidence to succeed at football and life. Although the details of the story have been stretched to make the film more dramatic, the essence of the story and the values it preaches are the same and they're what count most.Hancock has taken necessary liberties with the story. To be truthful, there's not a lot of bad or a lot of conflict and the film might have been too fluffy without exaggerations. The Tuohy's took Michael, a boy from a bad neighborhood who was enrolled in their school with some convincing from the football coach, and they helped him attain the grades to not only stay eligible in high school but also earn a scholarship to play football in college. Hancock resorts to a lot of dramatic conventions to keep the story engaging and the audience feeling sympathy for Michael but also excited to see him succeed. They all work, even if they're a bit cheap at times.The cast, however, really brings it all together. Everyone in this film natural and relatable. No one is written as or behaves like a stereotype or fit a specific mold -- at least none of the main characters. They realize they're playing real people leading normal lives. Only Jae Head as the little brother, S.J., tries hard to create humor where it doesn't come naturally but he gets away with being cute. The standout example of this is the hiring of all the real-life coaches to act as if they were in their former jobs and recruiting Michael. It seems gimmicky, but it's fun and it shows the effort to honor the truth of the story.As for Bullock, I've finally seen a film where she has really impressed me. I'm not sure about the Oscar talk, but I can't say a bad thing about her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy. She creates such definitive portrait of Leigh Anne as tough, loving, selfless and even a bit abrasive. She plays her as sensitive and well-meaning where she could have just gone overboard with southern bell housewife stereotypes (considering we all know she's done plenty of over-the-top characters), but she realizes this is a real woman she's playing and gives Leigh Anne the dimension she deserves. Most importantly, she is naturally funny and doesn't shove humor down our throats like in her ditzy romantic comedy roles."The Blind Side" is a likable film, one way more about family and achieving ones goals than it is about football. This is not a cheesy, football-focused sports drama with typical sports themes and dramatizations of football games. Hancock understands the importance here is not football. This does make Bullock's bookend narration about how former football pro Lawrence Taylor changed the game of football for left tackles a bit irrelevant, but it serves as another reminder of how Michael Oher's story is real and it's an interesting and important one.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Like every movie thus far in the Harry Potter series based on J.K Rowling's novels, "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" (book no. 6) cuts a lot of corners. Those who regard Rowling's tome as a bible are sure to have complaints at scenes added (the attack on the Weasley's burrow) and scenes taken away (the battle in Hogwarts), but as a film -- not a book -- second-time director David Yates and longtime Potter adapter Steve Kloves have made the most visually purposeful, emotional and character-driven Potter movie so far.The previous film "Order of the Phonenix" (Yates' first) introduced the inevitable dark direction of the series and therefore movies, as Harry (Radcliffe) embraces that he alone can defeat the evil Lord Voldemort (Fiennes, who's absent from this movie), who has come back to power and is now an immediate and dangerous threat. In order for Harry to succeed, he must learn a crucial piece of information, one that belongs in the memory of retired professor Horace Slughorn, played brilliantly by Jim Broadbent, who Harry and his mentor Albus Dumbledore (Gambon) have convinced to come back to Hogwarts.Meanwhile, Harry has a suspicion that his long-time schoolyard nemesis Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is up to something evil, possibly in service of Voldemort, and we frequently see him spending time alone in the castle. In addition to that, Harry also has to juggle his own new feelings for his best friend Ron's (Grint) sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright) and the rocky relationship between Ron and their other friend Hermione (Watson) who clearly has some feelings of her own.If you think Harry has a lot to juggle, imagine the responsibility of screenwriter Kloves. Like a surgeon with only a scalpel, Kloves takes carefully to Rowling's novel, omitting scenes but sneaking them into brilliant visual details, adding new parts where necessary and sewing up the most important plot lines into a narrative thread that remains coherent. He also weaves in graceful transitions that Yates can execute beautifully with his dark and mysterious vision for the film. And to top that, he adds an endearing sense of humor that the series has never seen before, and it brings a deeper love for the characters. Broadbent and Gambon, quirky as they are, add nicely here too.And despite what you might think, Kloves' greatest sins to the Potter fundamentalists out there aren't solely his fault. The greatest blemish on this otherwise beautiful adaptation can be blamed on one thing: a PG rating. Intending to be PG, whereas the last two films were PG-13, strips the film of delivering all the weight of the best climax Rowling wrote in the Harry Potter series. The inability to show some sort of violence rips the battle at Hogwarts out of the film and deprives it of some much needed adrenaline; all for a measly PG rating. It's a mistake that deprives this movie of a tenth star out of ten. To compensate, Kloves adds the attack on the Burrow halfway through, but it stands out as the most frivolous in the film.As these films come to an end, they are clearly in the right hands with Yates. "Half-Blood Prince" is wildly imaginative, edgy and suspenseful, with terrific foreshadow technique and chilling transitions. With these last few books being on such a grand scale in the Harry Potter universe, it's key that someone be in charge who has a specific vision. Yates (with Kloves) has that vision and that's what makes this a great film and not a flat one that's too complex and overloaded with details from the book. If you want the latter, read the book again. Choices were made, and despite a less climactic ending, they were brilliant ones. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/
Rarely does a socially progressive film receive the accolades it deserves immediately following its release like "In the Heat of the Night" did. Most are re-examined decades later and deemed "ahead of their time." Norman Jewison's film, however, is so complex and earnest in its portrait of race relations in the 1960s that audiences were stirred by it then as much as we commend it now.What makes "In the Heat of the Night" as effective now as it was in 1967 has to be the approach. Neither the script nor the direction tackle racism head-on in an explicit manner; the film slowly builds racial tension by feeding off viewer assumptions and creating racist undertones in the characters and their actions.When we first meet Detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier), he's being arrested on suspicion for murder. He doesn't say so much as a word and the clear implication is that he's being arrested because he's black, but the characters and situations are composed in such a way that the racism doesn't feel blatant or entirely addressed. The dialogue does not confront the topic in explicit terms either. Instead, we have an unsettled and discomforting mood.We also never get a real beat on Police Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger). Both the character and Steiger's performance possess real depth and complexity. Few characters in cinema history (and none that I can think of at present) have characteristics that include deeply rooted prejudice and great understanding. Steiger so perfectly communicates Gillespie's conundrum of reconciling what he believes and the evidence that rests before his eyes, both in the murder investigation and the way he treats Tibbs.Tibbs is a Philadelphia detective with a strong forensics background who finds himself in Sparta, Mississippi assisting with a homicide case. Given that Civil Rights was a relatively new concept in America at the time, the racist attitudes and suspicious glares of the other small- town cops cast a heavy shadow over Tibbs' work. Poitier gives Tibbs this humble courageousness for much of the film but occasionally gives in to the anger the viewer will surely feel for the way his character is treated."In the Heat of the Night" truly portrays the sorry state of the South in the wake of Jim Crow laws, a time when long-standing attitudes struggled to adjust and frankly, some never did. Steiger's Chief Gillespie represents the crux of this change as he begins to admit the errors of his judgement both in judging Tibbs and in doing his job. As equally powerful as the film's statement on race is its statement on the flaws of the justice system in certain parts of the country. Without Tibbs' help, two innocent men would have been tried and likely convicted of the murder thanks to the old Western sense of justice, that being "someone has to pay."There are some head-shaking and jaw-dropping moments in the film, but "In the Heat of the Night" mostly succeeds in being subtle and displaying racism through tension more so than action. The truth is that while the frightening tales of hate crimes are much more compelling for the screen, this form of racism is what truly abounds, even today. With a couple knockout performances, the ideas of racism and justice in the film become much more than  pardon the pun  black and white.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
If you really want to shake up the mold for the indie family drama, why not insert a beaver puppet? Writer Kyle Killen's hook for "The Beaver" clearly caught the attention of Jodi Foster, who directs and co-stars, and trailers showing Mel Gibson making a fool out of himself talking in a thick British accent with a beaver on his hand couldn't hurt the intrigue factor either.It sounds like a comical approach, but "The Beaver" plays out consistently like a drama. The beaver puppet in the film serves as a deeply depressed, suicidal man's last-ditch effort to keep himself alive, and what this means for his family isn't exactly ripe for slapstick.Gibson plays Walter Black, a toy company CEO who from the onset we learn (through Beaver voice over) has become almost catatonically depressed. After moving out and trying to take his own life, Walter starts talking to himself in the form a beaver puppet in order to turn his life around. He tells his wife, Meredith (Foster), that his psychiatrist recommended it as therapy and she plays along in hopes of getting back the man she once loved.Walter instantly gains new confidence and energy. He forms a new bond with his younger son, Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart), rekindles some romance with Meredith and infuses his company with fresh ideas, including one for a beaver tool set. Only his older son, Porter (Anton Yelchin), refuses to accept the Beaver outright, unable to see anything but the man he deeply fears becoming.Killen's script takes a rather realistic approach. The characters respond to Walter and the Beaver in ways you could consider both over and under-reacting. Young Henry reacts as a young child would to a puppet, teenage Porter sees it as a ploy of some kind and Meredith sees that this "therapy" could in fact be good for her husband. Everyone at the company is just glad things are stabilizing and moving in the right direction. As an audience, we can at least understand how channeling his better qualities into a separate personality could allow him to function on a day to day basis and even succeed.The rest of the film plays out the results of Walter's experiment. No new obstacles enter the picture, it's just a matter of whether Walter can reconcile both his family and the Beaver before any irreparable harm is done to either party. The results materialize rather quickly, almost too quickly given that in theory, Walter and his family could have probably lived for years with the Beaver in their lives, even if someone cracking was an inevitability no matter how long the experiment lasted.The only real comedy in "The Beaver" comes most interestingly from Foster's direction and Gibson's performance. Foster's directing choices, especially the way she shoots Walter and the Beaver together, not trying to point your eye to either Gibson or the puppet, capture the reality of this strange scenario while retaining most of its quirkiness. At some point, no matter how realistic the approach to the story, you have to acknowledge it's about a man who talks through a beaver puppet, and Foster does that.Who better, really, to play a totally broken man being laughed at by everyone in the country (at one point Walter's story gets national exposure) than Gibson? Public perception of Gibson is so negative at this point that there almost is this magical quality about the Beaver and the way Gibson voices him in such a humorous, jovial manner. He also creates an impressive distinction between Walter and Walter being the Beaver that proves crucial to buying into the film's entire concept. The portions of the film that work well owe a lot of credit to his performance.Lost in the shuffle is the main side plot, the budding relationship between Porter and the valedictorian at his high school, Norah (Jennifer Lawrence). Porter has a side job writing papers for his fellow students and Norah is nervous about giving the graduation speech. Their relationship draws certain parallels to what's going on with Walter, but the thematic connection doesn't erase how disparate these stories are."The Beaver" presents a lot of big but simple ideas about living with the various awful circumstances that life throws our way, about understanding the past's effect on the present and consequently our outlook on the future. Exactly what does it take for us to move on from the darkness of our past? "The Beaver" makes its case in a fashion that's a bit too tidy, but the approach is sincere and the film ends up better than expected.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
It's about living free, love, making it big and most of all, it's about the music. That's 1970 for you and that's "Almost Famous." Coupled with some great acting, this is an easy-to-love, care-free drama that embodies the time period it captures quite excellently."Almost Famous" is about a 15-year-old high school senior named William Miller (Patrick Fugit) who gains an affinity for the rock and pop music of the 60s when his sister leaves him her entire record collection when he's 11. He dreams of being a music journalist and gets an opportunity to write for a magazine by covering Black Sabbath. When he goes to interview the band, he gets sucked into the whirlwind of the roadie lifestyle with a band called Stillwater. He meets and becomes close with the band's guitarist Russell (Billy Crudup) and a "Band-aid" who goes by Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). Of course at the same time he is losing his innocence and he must battle an over-protective mother (Frances McDormand).This is a great cast and writer/director Cameron Crowe has given them great characters. This is easily the best role of Kate Hudson's career so far. She needs to go back to this genre and avoid the terrible romantic comedies. She plays a free-spirited. lovable but deeply troubled groupie and gets your attention in every scene. McDormand is probably the best as the fierce, stern, but loving mother, if not Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a magazine editor giving William advice. Crudup is good too--I've always felt he is one of the more underrated talents in Hollywood, but it seems he has intentionally limited his credits.Crowe most easily accomplishes the 70s look in this film. This movie would not have been as good without it. The soundtrack, the characters, the costumes--it creates a free-loving vibe that is really easy to watch. He takes you on this road trip with the characters in that sense, though the film is not really focused on the music, with very limited footage of them playing shows. Instead this is more about music behind the scenes, especially because it follows William as he tries to get a story from these guys. A lot of what the film goes for is the image of rock stars as opposed to who they really are and whether or not those two things are the same.It doesn't quite reach the level of penetration into the dynamic of a rock band as much as it would seem to and the love subplot between Hudson and Crudup is a little watered down, but it's straightforward at least and gives you a lot of entertaining material. The themes just don't go deep enough and that's really okay--I'd gladly be spared another drug-induced music biopic just for some lack of depth and "Almost Famous" is for sure not one of those: there is no demonstration (only mention) of drug use in the entire film. Basically it prides itself on catching that 70s mentality and sucking you into it.
Directors don't become synonymous with genres as often as they used to in Hollywood's Golden Age, but play the word association game with "David Fincher" and you're bound to get "thriller" back as a response. There's little doubt that if you're producing an intense, dark, mystery-driven film, Fincher's your first choice, and he proves it yet again in bringing another popular book to the silver screen in "Gone Girl." For those who know nothing about the novel (as I did), Fincher's involvement should be your first clue that this is beyond run-of-the-mill mystery stuff, that somewhere in this story of what appears to be a "did-he-or-didn't-he" murder case lurks a sinister and sadistic turn.Based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, "Gone Girl" stars Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne, a writer/professor and co-owner of a bar living in the heart of Missouri, whose marriage to Amy (Rosamund Pike) has been rocky of late. When Amy disappears, the search to find her becomes a media circus, and before long, all eyes turn to Nick as her most likely killer.Under Fincher's direction, the entire film is covered by an unsettling fog, with a good portion of the credit belonging to his collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who scored "The Social Network" for Fincher and won an Oscar. He creates a bleak portrait of what most would consider a quaint Midwestern setting and creates doubt and intrigue at every turn, while also satirizing Middle America and mainstream media.With its crystal clear premise, "Gone Girl" holds its audience captive, inviting you to see if you can figure out what really happened, confirming a few of your suspicions here and there until suddenly you have no idea what happened to the movie you had bought a ticket to see. It's not a radical or misleading transformation from the first act to the second, but one that will remind audiences that the truth isn't exactly black and white in the way most movies would have you believe.It's weird to call Affleck perfectly cast in this movie, but he has just the right balance of sympathy-worthy leading man qualities and totally unlikable smugness. Normally George Clooney is your guy in this case, but Clooney would be too lovable and handsome to play Nick. Affleck's reputation, having gone from pretty-boy movie star to tabloid fodder to esteemed director, definitely works for him in this film. You see bits of the "Argo" actor you really enjoyed rooting for, and bits of "Daredevil" and the cocky, dumb Kevin Smith roles. "Gone Girl" wants you to question and scrutinize Nick yet also feel like there's no way he could be a murderer.On the other side, few people will forget who Rosamund Pike is after seeing this movie. Although she's been in a fair number of films and always been a good actress, "Gone Girl" showcases the true extent of her range, and is finally the perfect storm of a film to elevate her profile. Carrie Coon as Nick's twin sister, Margo, is another great casting find; the Chicago-based actress will surely see more big-time supporting work in the future.With Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris rounding out the supporting cast, it's safe to say this is one of the more unusual ensemble casts for a big adaptation in recent years.When it comes to differences between the book and the movie, only so much criticism can be leveled against Hollywood as this is a very (very) rare case in which Flynn  on her own  adapted her book for the screen. Obviously she doesn't have final cut, but most of how the story plays out on screen can be attributed to her. Given the movie is totally enthralling, she obviously has screen writing chops. You could argue that it's a bit long, but otherwise, the movie never feels hindered in the way that overly loyal adaptations tend to do.Most thrillers operate using a formula that ends with a twist or an epiphany that ultimately satisfies the viewer. "Gone Girl" doesn't work that way, which is both a great strength and a great weakness. On one hand, it will simply be too weird and dark for many people; on the other, it uses conventions to highlight issues and ideas that go well beyond the scope of what other films in the genre ever dream to accomplish. More than a great thriller, "Gone Girl" speaks to the challenges of the modern marriage, issues of the victimization of women, the media's tendency to sensationalize stories and more. It's a trade-off that makes "Gone Girl" pretty unforgettable, regardless of personal opinion.~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit my Movie Muse Reviews site for more
It seems like Pixar is the only company producing outside-the-box animated adventures these days, but don't discredit "Coraline," Laika Entertainment's second stop-motion feature after Tim Burton's "The Corpse Bride." Based on the Neil Gaiman book, "Coraline" is one of the more creative stories and executions of family entertainment to have come out in awhile and almost unquestionably one of the best stop-motion films ever made.Although "Coraline" is certainly not for kids under 7 years old who are easily susceptible to nightmares, that doesn't change the quality of craftsmanship. Director Henry Selick, easily one of the best stop-motion directors next to Nick Park of the "Wallace & Gromit" series and maybe the more creative and daring between the two, brings a creepy surrealism and an abstract design to a story that begs for it."Coraline" is about a girl of the same name who moves into a new house with her apathetic parents that don't seem interested in her needs at all. She finds a small door in her new house that leads to an alternate reality with seemingly perfect parents -- only they have button eyes. But things aren't as rosy as they seem and Coraline soon finds herself in trouble.Immediately, "Coraline" charms you with the creative imagining of its world. I'm unfamiliar with the book, but I believe it's without pictures, making Selick and his creative team's vision a true accomplishment. Not unlike Selick's work in "The Nightmare before Christmas," the figures have abstract shapes and exaggerated bodies whether it's Coraline's dad's slightly long neck or the neighbor Mr. Bobinsky's tiny appendages but ball-shaped midsection. Even the slight tilt in Coraline's head adds something to her character that peaks your curiosity in a way that a more traditional CGI animation might not necessarily do.The beauty of the story is that Coraline learns a very fine lesson in reality versus idealism, that reality can be deceiving in both good and bad ways and that our parents, even if they're not always the nicest and best and giving us what we like, are the best thing we've got as a child. It's a perfect fit for stop-motion -- the subtle (and not so subtle) distortions between reality and alternate but ultimately fictitious reality -- and Selick really uses that to his and ultimately our advantage. ~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
It's easy to forget that "An Education" takes place nearly a half century ago. The coming-of- age of a 16-year-old girl is one thing, but in the context of the 1960s, it's a whole other ordeal. The way women's roles have changed in society over the years is staggering and "An Education" is a reminder of just how bad it was. Women had little choice: be educated at a higher level or not be educated; Be a school teacher or a housewife. As the young Jenny studies vigilantly to attend Oxford, it's hard not to be swept away as she is by her gentleman friend when he offers her a life of art, culture and extravagance that her sheltered existence never affords.Jenny (Carey Mulligan) is far from naive, but between her father's (Alfred Molina) wishes and her studies, she's hardly been able to explore her hobbies beyond cello and listening to a singular French record as she longs to experience all that she's head and read about. When a gentleman nearly twice her age (Peter Sarsgaard) pulls up in a sports car and kindly extends her invitations to concerts and jazz clubs with his wealthy young friends, she cannot resist and begins to teeter between her carved-out path and these whirlwind adventures.The film stays intriguing by means of slight mystery: is David well-intentioned? What exactly does he do that permits him to spend the money he does? For Jenny it's all exciting and Mulligan endears us with wide-eyed wonder and surprising sophistication, but anyone who's come of age already knows social escapades and prestigious schools going hand in hand is too good to be true.Outside of the complex performances, Nick Hornby's script is what makes "An Education" a terrific film. Not only is Jenny's journey complicated for even the most seasoned of viewers, but also the other characters all represent significant examples of where their life choices have taken them -- especially the women. There is the teacher and headmistress that discourage Jenny's behavior, Helen (Rosamund Pike) whose gorgeous looks and clothes too easily make Jenny forget how uneducated she sounds and of course her mother who doesn't say much at all but encourages Jenny's interests. Undoubtedly meeting David is maturing Jenny rapidly and she's confronted with the two life choices that are available to her.Hornby also makes sure to remind us that there are only two, because this is the 1960s. As Jenny converses with the headmistress (a lovely cameo from Emma Thompson), she questions her about what it's all for. Should she be educated and do nothing but focus on her studies so she can end up like her? But as she learns, an education is much more. There is opportunity for a middle ground.I suppose that many will have trouble with the multi-faceted Jenny. She's supposed to be 16 but her interests are that of a more sophisticated person. She appears to be rational and morally grounded yet she seems to skate with David and his friends regardless of their questionability. There is a bit of head-scratching here, but the points of the film outweigh suspect character construction. Her journey is far more important.Director Lone Scherfig gives us an elegant film that is just as much escapism as it is dramatic and, well, educational. Coming-of-age stories are always ripe with new perspective, but "An Eductation" is particularly unique in its context as well as its focus on a female main character. The female perspective on growing up is often neglected and skewed or puffed up with some juicy romance. "An Education" is much more subtle and graceful yet it delivers the same impact.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
"Kinsey" isn't just a biopic on the life of Alfred Kinsey, the groundbreaking researcher that popped the bubble that kept Americans from confronting the topic of sex. It's a conversation starter, it's an eye-opening and enlightening experience of film.Bill Condon has written and directed a film that unlike most biopics seems to take its biographical character and use him as simply the best example of the subject matter at hand: sex. Kinsey appears as simply another one of the people that he studies, as eluded to by the narrative set up scene that appears mostly in the beginning and then is scattered throughout.Liam Neeson gives us a lot of depth. Kinsey is odd, peculiar and fascinating. His wife is played by Laura Linney who is probably one of the most genuine, life-like actresses on the screen today. The other supporting characters were also very strong.Perhaps Condon's greatest strength in the telling of this film is that he makes it a point to make the viewer feel uncomfortable with the subject too. He takes on the subject of sex very directly and handles it in a way that any viewer would feel at least a bit unsettled. This in turn makes the themes, the goal and true magic of Kinsey's work, easier to access for the viewer. One will undoubtedly see the way society has and in ways still does treat the discussion of sexuality.The only fault of the film is that there is a bit too much going on and one can't help but feel only the surface is being scratched. Kinsey and his research are both so fascinating that the film seems too busy and is never quite able to take that next step into something truly remarkable in the world of movies. However, the way it handles and facilitates the subject and themes revolving around sex and human connections is worthy of high praise.
Time travel is one of the more hit-or-miss story conceits in film; it's certain to get people's attention, but almost as certain to expose the film to a barrage of criticism related to logic and the butterfly effect. In the hands of filmmaker Richard Curtis, however, today's finest purveyor of charming little films ("Love, Actually," "Pirate Radio" among other notable writing credits), time travel gets personal.Whereas so many movies use time travel for exploitative comedic purposes ("Hot Tub Time Machine"), "About Time" more accurately represents what someone would actually use time travel for in their personal life. Time travel doesn't completely take hold of the story; it's simply the key player in main character Tim's (Domhnall Gleeson) quest for romance.Like the best of us, Tim has a penchant for fudging things up the first time. So when his father (Billy Nighy) reveals the men in their family can time travel to different points throughout their lifetime (except the yet-lived future), he takes advantage of correcting a number of social missteps, such as kissing a girl a New Year's Eve party. When the jaw- dropping gorgeous Charlotte (Margot Robbie) stays at their Cornwall home for the summer, Tim soon learns that time travel only goes so far in swaying someone's feelings. He moves to London to pursue law in the fall, where he endeavors to at last find a girlfriend, and he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams). If it doesn't sound like "About Time" has a compelling plot, that's because it doesn't. Yet it doesn't suck either. That's how brilliant a writer Curtis is, slapping dumb-looking smiles and movie-watchers' faces with clever dialogue, humorous scenarios and compelling romance. McAdams, unquestionably one of the best the romance genre has ever seen, runs away with this material, which she simply couldn't do in films such as, quite appropriately, "The Time Traveler's Wife." Gleeson also fits perfectly with Curtis' style; he's humorous, awkward and charming all at the same time.Unlike many who watch this film will be lead to believe, the movie is not about Tim's pursuit of Mary. It's not a two-hour version of the sequence in "Groundhog Day" in which Bill Murray's Phil Connors attempts to use "time travel" to perfectly woo Andie MacDowell's Rita through a series of corrected screw-ups. The narrative scope of "About Time" is much larger in terms of chronology, spanning the entirety of Tim's young adulthood. In fact, three- quarters of the way in, it's not even about Tim and Mary's romance at all.Eventually, "About Time" becomes about the challenges of living life, enduring the bad and appreciating the good, and what the ability to time travel would really teach us about living day to day and treasuring the present. An expected theme and conclusion indeed, but this final section gets a little long and tiresome without any riveting conflict. Still, Curtis has crafted characters we connect with strongly enough to hold up this last leg of his film.All that said, it's easy to poke holes in the logic of the time travel in "About Time," but the concept makes enough sense that it's not too distracting and you can still enjoy the characters, the romance and the lessons learned. Curtis might not be one of the greatest filmmakers working, but he understands what it takes to elevate a romantic comedy from the rest of the cheesy pack, and that takes tremendous skill.~Steven CThanks for reading!

A great piece of music -- and this is especially true of works for piano -- conveys a mood or sometimes many moods; it is incredibly affective. While listening you might feel comfortable and at ease at one point and then suddenly chaotic and unsettled at another. This is certainly true of Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 3 in D minor, the challenging piece that "Shine" main character David Helfgott aspires to master. The piece plays a pivotal role in Helfgott's story and as such, this film based on him brilliantly reflects its beauty and turbulence."Shine" is not a typical biopic in this way: there are no scenes written or dragged out solely to open your tear ducts. If that happens at all, it's purely incidental. The only thing that's truly reminiscent of a standard biopic is the first half of the film telling the story of Helfgott's childhood and rocky relationship with his father.The beginning is chronological as one would expect, moving logically from scene to scene, showing Helfgott's talents and his father's refusal to let him become his own person. Armin Mueller-Stahl is excellent as the father. He manages to take what we first associate as merely stubborn, stern and demanding and make us really understand that it's not black and white. Though he beats David on two occasions, he doesn't simply become the "abusive father" you get in many biopics: he is clearly struggling with David's success and and blind to the fact that he's become possessive and is living vicariously through him. He might indeed be unfairly manipulative, but we clearly see the world view (Holocaust survivor immigrated to Australia) behind it. When Helfgott finally escapes to London to learn at the Royal School of Music, attempts Rachmaninoff for a recital and suffers a breakdown at the conclusion of the piece, suddenly the film becomes a series of clips: scenes that appear to be in order but lack clear objective and purpose with exception of David's piano skills returning bit by bit.This recital/Helfgott's breakdown scene is the best in the movie. It's the first act climax that takes the story out of childhood and into David's struggle to become himself again as seen through the incredible Geoffrey Rush. The Rachmaninoff starts off easy, comforting and grows in intensity. Suddenly there's great suspense to the film and we see David sweating profusely, cut-ins of his father listening to a recording and then silence and blurred camera-work. In the moment, director Scott Hicks' work here might feel over-dramatic, but as the story continues and we never fully get an explanation of what happened (such as why Helfgott needed shock treatments) it becomes emblematic of the struggle Helfgott went through.The end feels disjointed and its pacing frantic. The expectation is that David will make this miraculous comeback and in truth he does, it's just not with the surge of a full string orchestra playing in the background -- it's with the subtlety of Liszt, Rimsky-Korsakov, Schumann or Chopin. It's a bit devoid of feeling or satisfaction but it's justified by the way Jan Sardi has "composed" the film. The story is happy being focused on the upbringing and less so with Helfgott's rehab despite Rush's Raymond Babbitt-quality performance. The lack of a cookie-cutter emotional climax and crying and hugging scenes will rub some average viewers the wrong way, but "Shine" deserves a good deal of admiration.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
For fans of the Nicolas Winding Refn-Ryan Gosling duo, "Only God Forgives" throws a left hook. Although both this film and "Drive" have their silent, slow-building moments that give way to shocking, powerful violence, "Drive" at least provides a bit more context and story development, whereas "Only God Forgives" is like a visual revenge poem.The film takes place in Thailand and centers on the repercussions of a murder and a swift retaliation in the name of justice. Julian (Gosling) deals drugs behind the veil of a Muay Thai boxing ring. When his older brother, Billy (Tom Burke), murders an underage prostitute, retired detective Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) allows the prostitute's father to have his vengeance by letting him kill Billy, but cuts off his arm to even things out. Learning what Billy did, Julian decides not to take the father's life when he has a chance, but when his mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) arrives in Thailand, it gets complicated.The above plot summary is not easy to surmise on one's own. The film moves slowly and distorts what's reality with what's in Julian's head. It takes a few minutes to realize that a scene is actually happening and isn't part of Julian's imagination. Refn leans a lot on cinematography to grab audience interest. The neons prevalent in Asian settings and the light shining through ornate oriental wall carvings definitely sets a tone for the film, but it can't be seen as a substitute for the staples of good storytelling. Refn's captivation with the setting of his film doesn't translate with so much utter confusion going on.Symbolism, then, becomes the primary lens for exploring the film's many warped senses of justice. Arms reaching out, hands turning from open palms to clenched fists  in a simple metaphor Refn, captures the capacity of man to do both good and bad. The biggest challenge in appreciating that notion is that the founding incident of the entire movie is a horrific crime and the main characters want their vengeance for a justice that has already been served. Obviously, it will not end well for Julian and his overbearing, cruel mother, who overlook what the audience can so plainly see. At least Julian struggles with it.Gosling has proved countless times he can act without saying a word, which is why he's Refn's muse, but Julian is missing something. There are a lot of forces acting upon and influencing his character, especially his mother, but he doesn't get much of a chance to express himself. He makes a couple crucial decisions that impact that course of the film, but he's a weak, inaccessible protagonist. The supporting characters are no more accessible but definitely contribute to film's impact. Thomas is just despicable, belittling Julian in front of his girlfriend and using downright Freudian tactics to leverage him for her revenge. Pansringarm represents the old-school notion of honor, though he takes himself very seriously. He would make for an interesting character study if Refn was as interested in helping us understand him as he was in fitting him perfectly in the frame.Still, "Only God Forgives" is chilling and contemplative. Refn is nothing if not affecting as a filmmaker. He knows how to evoke a strong emotional response in the audience with both imagery and violence. The question always comes down to whether someone watching his film can find some meaning in his graphic yet tacit approach. In this film, it's a bit more shock than awe. Unsurprisingly, that makes "Only God Forgives" a love it or hate it kind of film  moments of both ebb in and out.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
There are a lot of iconic film characters who have single handedly launched franchises: James Bond, Rocky, Indiana Jones, etc. but none are as gracefully done as Inspector Harry Callahan. Other than his .45 Magnum and a little spiel for the criminals that get in his way, there aren't any other gimmicks. Who you see is who you get -- a cop with a moral compass that doesn't let the law set its bearing. He's fast-talking, hard-nosed and merciless -- the cop that everyone wishes they could be but few have the balls to be. He's the model for how a singular character can drive a film.The first step is Clint Eastwood. Known mostly at the time for his Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, Eastwood is a proved one-liner machine gun. He's the got the looks, the poise and the verbal delivery of a certified rebel, a man capable of anything. He makes "Dirty Harry" tick. All icons are made by their actors and Eastwood was born to do iconic.Part of what makes "Dirty Harry" a classic is that it's a vicarious movie-going experience. Everyone wishes they could just take justice into their own hands just like Callahan. The plot provides that same experience. Harry is a San Francisco detective on the trail of the "Scorpio Killer," a concept ripped straight from the San Francisco Chronicle headlines in the late '60s revolving around the mysterious Zodiac Killer who was on the loose. In a sense, Harry was born out of the country's frustration with the ineptitude of law enforcement in bringing that killer to justice. Harry does to the Scorpio Killer what we all wish we could've done to the Zodiac -- let him have it.An iconic character is also nothing without his lines and a clearly defined set of convictions as indicated in the script. Maybe one of his best lines (of many) is when he describes to some other police how he knew that a man chasing a woman in the street was intent to rape. It perfectly sums up that Harry is a man who doesn't wait to let the law define what's right and wrong. This vision for Harry is guided with strength by Don Siegel. Siegel carefully plans out his critical shots: a long distance zoom-out from the football field as Harry executes his version of justice and a wide shot of Harry above the bridge as he plans to intercept a school bus hijacked by the killer. Siegel creates iconic moments for his truly memorable character and it makes "Dirty Harry" a more unforgettable film.
They just don't make 'em like they used to--80s cop flicks starring a rebel protagonist with a smart mouth. It's sort of its own classic genre and it's epitomized by "Beverly Hills Cop." The movie is nothing near sensational, especially considering how the genre has transformed simply by virtue of technology, but it has a niche near and dear to the hearts of many.Eddie Murphy stars as Axel Foley, a detective for the Detroit PD with a knack for doing things the theatrical and brash way. After getting an earful from his boss, a friend is killed and Foley decides to investigate his friends' case (despite warnings from his boss), which will take him to Beverly Hills where he gets caught up in some drug pushing. He also has a couple of LAPD guys on his tail making sure he stays out of trouble, which of course he doesn't. In fact, he ropes the two of them into it.Murphy is far and away the best part the movie. His lines are well written as he plays this foul-mouthed troublemaker that always keeps the moment awkward with a tone of voice and jokes that completely don't fit the situation. The rest of the cast is pretty much garbage. A few good roles here and there, but the acting is mostly forgettable.The story isn't too important. It just sets up situations for Foley to be the rule-breaking, crazy cop who never learns but always comes out on top. It also sets up some neat chase/action sequences, which consists of the film crew driving trucks like wrecking balls down a street full of cars and bashing everything in sight.The film also makes itself a very clear tribute to the grooves of the 80s, many times when those songs are completely out of place. The film's iconic synthesized theme works, but the rest of the song choices add too much of a playful, not-serious tone for a film that does try to be a crime drama in ways."Beverly Hills Cop" is certainly the antidote for a case of "haven't seen enough 80s action movies lately," but other than that it's just a plain cop drama with an interesting main character.
If I were to pitch you a movie about two police officers who are partners on patrol in South Central Los Angeles, one of your first inclinations might be "not another buddy copy comedy." While "End of Watch" is often funny, the newest film from "Training Day" writer David Ayer, is no comedy.Ayer, who spent a lot of time in South Central, takes the found footage approach to his latest film featuring the LAPD in the spirit of modern trends and perhaps the show "Cops."It's hard to tell if Ayer's exaggerating, but a lot of dangerous stuff happens to Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pena) despite being beat cops. So much so that they get involved with the wrong Mexican gang, and their attempts to go above and beyond to protect and serve put them in the line of fire.Gyllenhaal and Pena have incredible chemistry as two cops who are best friends as well as partners. They epitomize the modern "bromance" in a number of ways, joking around, giving each other a hard time, offering love/dating advice with hyper-masculine sarcasm, etc. Ayer takes time to show these men out of their blues frequently to humanize them in a critical way. On the job, they are often cocky, proud and reckless, pushing the line of appropriate police behavior and protocol. They jump back and forth between making laudable, responsible choices and borderline police brutality.The portrait that this paints of law enforcement feels so much more authentic than we're normally treated to in cop films and police procedurals on television. They are heroes and good, honorable men, but that doesn't make them beacons of morality. No matter how much you believe in the quickly escalating plot of "End of Watch," there's no disagreement to be had over the authenticity of the characters and the environment they operate in. Although we do get independent "episodes" in which Taylor and Zavala respond to calls and find more than they bargained for, there's a through-line involving a powerful Mexican drug cartel and the gang that enforces it. Ayer glamorizes these thugs a little bit, but it makes them formidable villains in the story. As things come to a boil, the realism of the film really unravels in favor of a more compelling, heart-pounding finale.Ayer takes certain liberties with the found footage style as well. The premise involves Taylor filming everything for a school project or something. He has a hand-held camera but also cameras positioned in the squad car, and ones that clip onto their uniforms. The gangs also carry cameras around to film their violent escapades. At times, however, we can't tell who is supposed to be holding the camera  like when Taylor starts making out with his girlfriend, Janet (Anna Kendrick). Neither is holding the camera, so that's a bit strange.Still, that filmmaking style does more good than harm to the film. Say what you will about the found footage trend, but this is an appropriate example that really works. The extra layer of realism and authenticity that the technique gives to a film really goes miles in favor of "End of Watch." Humor is an unexpected benefit of this film as well. Michael Pena has failed to be funny in films including "Tower Heist" and "30 Minutes or Less," but he succeeds in territory that blends it with the dramatic in this very organic way. It would be impressive if most of the dialogue in this film, at least between him and Gyllenhaal, weren't improvised given how natural it flows. It sounds like a stretch to consider this one of the better acted films of the year, but Gyllenhaal and Pena should've been considered for awards contention. The nature of found footage detracts from what we tend to associate with/look for in an Oscar-worthy performance. We expect authenticity from found footage and only comment when it goes poorly, not when it's done exceptionally well. Having seen enough films made in the found footage style, no other two actors have done better in this genre."End of Watch" offers an intense look at the life of L.A.'s finest and a harrowing portrait of life in the barrios and gang-ridden parts of L.A. Although exaggerated at crucial points, it shows what can happen when officers try and step out of their clearance level. At the least, it's one of the best films found footage has given us to date.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
Bertram Pincus D.D.S. sees dead people in this comedy from writer and director David Koepp. "Ghost Town" is a perfect Hollywood churn-out as far as premises go, but the "X" factor in play is "Extras" and British "The Office" star Ricky Gervais in his first starring role.Gervais' eccentric prick routine works well in the role of pathetic middle-aged rom-com leading man. You have to imagine that the studio couldn't afford Steve Carell's price tag and went for the more exotic pick in the British comedian. He certainly keeps things interesting in an otherwise predictable story.Pincus is a self-centered dentist who discovers he can see and communicate with dead people after briefly dying and being resuscitated during a colonoscopy. He's immediately hounded by several ghosts looking for favors in regards to unsettled business, including Frank (Greg Kinnear), who learns where Pincus lives because it's in the same building as his widow, Gwen (Tea Leoni). Frank manages to strong-arm Pincus into keeping Gwen from remarrying a guy he doesn't like, and Pincus decides courting her is the way to do it.It's a pretty shallow plan that makes both Pincus and Frank rather unlikable. Plus, in the scheming stage of the plot, you can already start to piece together the formula for how the whole thing will turn out. But the tone stays rather light through most of the movie, or at least never gives the impression that it takes itself too seriously.Gervais keeps the whole thing fresh, tagging on little nuances to the ends of the written dialogue (or so it comes off) and bumbling about for our amusement. None of the other actors are essential to their roles, which isn't so much a fault of theirs as it is Koepp's. He and co-writer John Kamps seem a bit content with their distinct and silly premise to craft characters that aren't cookie-cutter.The relationship between cookie-cutter Gwen and Pincus really drags the character down, though in fairness it's through his odd sense of humor that she starts to let him in. The closer they become, however, the more their relationship veers into eye-rolling rom-com territory. It even starts to get away from the seeing dead people concept that's really the entire hook of the movie. It's not nearly as clever as it should be.Hollow and predictable though it might be, "Ghost Town" manages to avoid any really damaging mistakes as it cruises along thanks to Gervais' style. He's certainly capable of being funnier, but he helps turn something bargain-bin into something watchable.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
The French film that "Dinner for Schmucks" draws its inspiration from,  "Le Diner de Cons," was successful because it made us seriously ponder  who the real idiot was -- the up-and- coming businessman or the dolt he  must invite to a business dinner. With "Schmucks," you seriously ponder  if the real idiot has been you for watching the thing in the first  place. Good news is if you can make it through the bumbling first half,  "Schmucks" turns itself around in almost redeeming fashion.  Paul Rudd plays Tim and Steve Carell plays Barry. The former works at  an Equity Firm and seeks a big promotion; the latter works for the IRS  and makes dioramas featuring dead mice dressed as people. Their paths  cross because after hitting Barry with his car, Tim realizes he's a  perfect fit for the "idiot dinner" that his boss has invited him to,  one that he learns will have implications for his future at the firm.  Unfortunately, Barry is a bit of a leech, and what Tim expects to be a  brief dinner that he can forget about later turns into 48 hours of  mind- numbing stupidity.  Not until Tim gets stuck deep in the shenanigans does any real humor  come out of "Schmucks." At first, writers Michael Handelman and David  Guion (co-writers of the barely seen comedy "The Ex" starring Jason  Bateman and Zach Braff) determine that Barry's idiocy justifies him  instigating the film's events with any absurd action they deem helpful  to the story. While we learn eventually just how clueless Barry really  is, his character had not been established as so socially inconsiderate  as to instant message with Tim's stalker Darla (Lucy Punch), the event  that sets everything into motion. Once that snowball gets rolling, the  situational comedy that ends up working does come out of it, but that  singular action was weakly constructed, topping the long and bad  highlight reel of the first act.  The moment that turns around "Dinner for Schmucks" completely comes at  an important business meeting between Tim and a Swiss billionaire  looking to invest with the firm. Tim's expecting a letdown because his  girlfriend, Julie (Stephanie Szostak), who was supposed to attend with  him to talk art with the investor's wife, has walked out on Tim,  partially thanks to Barry. In hopes of saving the day, Barry recruits  Darla the psycho to pose as Julie without telling Tim about it. Barry  and Darla join the meeting, which doesn't go quite how you'd expect.  Although spurred by the recurring "accidental cell phone switch" gag,  the key is that the scene gets you to think "wow, Barry really is a  total idiot!" and the whole thing will likely crumble beneath Tim,  including his job and relationship. Finally, Carell's Barry starts to  feel like a real character. Although not a cure-all for the film's  ills, that establishment works wonders on your ability to merely enjoy  it at all.  We've known for a while that Carell can do the idiot thing. From  "Anchorman" to seven seasons of "The Office" on NBC, no one does the  clueless guy better or to greater comic effect. He churns Barry into a  fairly likable numbskull, but the character operates as Michael Scott  on "The Office" and Brick Tamland from "Anchorman" combined into one  schizophrenic person. At one moment he's sweetly screwing everything  up, the next he's laughing at a chimpanzee on television. Given the  writing, it's not entirely evident just how stupid (or what kind of  stupid) Barry is supposed to be. Only toward the end does it take  shape. Director Jay Roach ("Meet the Parents," "Austin Powers") also  finds his groove here too.  "Schmucks" loosely follows the French film, the big change being the  actual dinner itself, which never happens in the original. Here, it  serves as the last-ditch effort for laughs by introducing bizarre  peripheral characters in the form of the other idiot guests, the  highlight being a woman who acts as a psychic medium for dead animals.  Some of the components of this finale are meant to serve the individual  subplots for Barry and Tim, which along with a few laughs make it  worthwhile. We learn, for example, that Barry's wife left him because,  as he puts it, "he lost the clitoris." Jokes aside, it's part of what  allows Tim to see Barry's humanity and puts a nice touch on their  relationship, which is the heart of the story and what made "Le Diner  de Cons" so terrific.  Ultimately, however, the setup does the payoff no justice and  "Schmucks" never fully washes out that first lengthy bad taste. So for  different reasons, the question of true idiocy remains unanswered -- or  simply that we're all idiots, including Hollywood.  ~Steven C
Sometimes in cinema, being clever and silly can hide a movie's obvious flaws, or at least make you forget about them. "Stardust" fits right into that category with its colorful cast of characters and witty little British sense of humor. This is not a fantasy film of "Lord of the Rings" proportions and it doesn't try to be (except for an overabundance of transition scenes laden with grandiose music), instead coming more out of "The Princess Bride" vein, only with not as talented acting and not as well-developed characters. Basically, it's enough to wet a fantasy lover's whistle, providing just over two hours of engaging, swashbuckling entertainment."Stardust" is classic fantasy plot, delivered to us by well-known fantasy writer Neil Gaman. A boy living in a re-imagined England that is surrounded by fantasy lands is infatuated with a girl and promises her a piece of a fallen shooting star as his commitment to her, only to find an unfathomable adventure waiting for him as he sets out to find it. In fact, he finds stars are actually people and this one is a young woman (Claire Danes) with a bit of an attitude. After this fantasy world is established with a few side plots, one including Michelle Pfiefer as a witch seeking the star to restore her youth, the plot becomes rather predictable.The dialogue, to be honest, is atrocious in most of this film. The comedic scenes work better, but the ones where the film actually takes the plot seriously are no good and the acting doesn't help out. As much as Pfieffer looks the part, she's not much of an actress, coming across as a laughable villain. Claire Danes gets better as the film progresses, but she just feels like a poor woman's Gwenyth Paltrow and nothing more. Stealing the show, however, in his limited opportunity to do so, is easily Robert DeNiro as a lightning-harvesting sky pirate named Cpt. Shakespeare to whom there is more than meets the eye. He is fantastic and comes at a critical point to save this film from being plain old boring. There are a few other great cameos as well thrown in the mix to cover the otherwise unmemorable acting and half- developed characters.While "Stardust" bounces in and out of being a film that takes itself seriously as an adventure flick and one that tries to be silly and completely not serious, the overall tone that encompasses both is still plain old "fun." Fun doesn't have to be well-executed or perfectly scripted, it just has to make you smile and forget about that kind of stuff that would normally matter in a serious movie-going experience. In that sense, all the kudos to Matthew Vaughn and this giddy little project of his. If only it had gotten better advertising.
By the film's definition, inception is the process of entering someone's mind through his dreams and planting an idea so deep within the subconscious that when he wakes up, the idea feels organic and natural. I would like to know who broke into Christopher Nolan's dream space and dropped the seed that would become the idea for this film, because whoever it is, "it" is an indisputable genius.Nolan's previous efforts from his debut feature "Following" to his breakthrough film, "Memento," have always toyed with the mind, but "Inception" takes the filmmaker's mind- bending tendencies to a literal degree. As far as elaborate high-concept stories go, "Inception" blows away his earlier films and possibly every film ever made. The painstaking plot and contextual detail of a world where dreams can be shared and people can enter the minds of others and exist with their own free will creates a "wow" factor that has no comparison. If it does, then none of them pull it off half as well as Inception. Sheer wonder and fascination at the magnitude of what Nolan's own mind has constructed will carry nearly everyone's interest throughout the entire film.In this world, a group of "dream thieves" led by a man named Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) specialize in an advanced form of corporate espionage -- the stealing of ideas from within the mind. When they find themselves in a spot of trouble after botching a job, their subject (Ken Watanabe) turns around and offers them a shot at redemption. It would entail inception -- a near-impossible feat. Cobb is a fugitive of the United States and if he succeeds, he would get the papers he needs to get through customs and finally see his kids again.Nolan has literally assembled a "dream team" of up-and-comers and rock solid veterans. The cast combines some of his regulars and past collaborators (Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe) as well as some of the most respected young talents working today (Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy). Regrettably, the plot complexity of "Inception" shortchanges most of these characters due to the amount of time the script must spend on explaining itself and its world. Only Cobb, who blames himself for his wife's (Cotillard) death, receives a complex psychological profile, but it provides just enough humanity to make Inception go beyond thrills. In addition, the poise and maturity of a Page and a Gordon-Levitt give the illusion of multi-dimensional characters which further suggests that Nolan's made more than a fun science-fiction romp, even if maybe that's the bulk of what makes the film great."Inception" also possesses the visual scope of a summer blockbuster despite being such a heady thriller. Nolan uses the film's concept of "dream architecture" (this is the role that Page's character plays in the process) as a chance to create some fascinating locales and film some incomparable action sequences necessary to bump the film up to a more epic status. Conveniently, the inception job involves taking the subject (Murphy) into three dream stages (dreams within dreams ... yea, it gets that intense) which provides three exciting backdrops for the action. No doubt that Nolan took great pleasure in running a locomotive down a city street. The fight scene in a rotating hotel room set stands out as the action highlight and the snowy ski chases on the mountain hospital set could well be Nolan's audition to direct a future James Bond film. So many diverse sets, yet longtime Nolan cinematographer Wally Pfister captures them all just right and gives the dream ones a lucid feel that is nice and subtle.Complex barely begins to describe this monumental undertaking. Nolan must have spent months if not years fleshing out the details and drawing up plans for this idea to make it all work. The script pushes the quote that "ideas are like viruses," growing exponentially, and this film does just that, creating more vast a concept than any moviegoer, casual or junkie, could ever imagine and rapidly so. Not surprisingly, this labyrinthine story is responsible for the film's weaknesses just as much as its strengths, but Nolan has outfitted the film with only the best actors and production members and does not allow confusion or holes in logic to overshadow how immensely entertaining it is. Despite public perception, "Inception" will not be heralded as an entertaining film that has the goods to garner a slew of Oscar nominations for its dramatic content, but instead as one of the most imaginative and brilliant concepts ever executed on the scale of a big-budget blockbuster. Films like this one are almost never born as major studio tentpoles. They often come from intelligent amateur/independent filmmakers with no budget and just a big dream for a unique film. Nolan, however, has refused to cave in to making pictures that aren't in that spirit and with his success from "The Dark Knight," he is part of the privileged few who can execute this type of film -- one that studios would normally be afraid to back -- on a budget in the hundred millions. If "Inception" becomes the financial success expected of it, a new and long-awaited dawn of studios funding complicated high-concept movies could be upon us. Now that's an idea.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The most effective comedies tend to be the ones you swear you've seen before yet you can't name any other just like it. "We're the Millers" has lots of familiar pieces but puts them together in a new-ish package. Often funny, sometimes hilarious and always amusing, "Millers" doesn't raise the bar for R-rated comedy, but it works the formula in all the right ways.The movie plays like a Farrelly brothers comedy, only it doesn't live and die by its jokes. There are some situational jokes involving awkward sexual situations, nudity and comedic violence, but what's more funny is the relationship dynamic between this "family."Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Will Poulter and Emma Roberts are the Millers, as well as a pot dealer, stripper, awkward loner and homeless runaway, respectively. After David (Sudeikis) gets rolled by some thugs, he owes his old college friend and wealthy employer, Brad (Helms), a ton of money. He can square up with Brad, but only if he goes into Mexico and smuggles in a shipment of pot for him. To do so inconspicuously, David recruits a "family" of equally desperate individuals and they set out for a Fourth of July "RV trip" in Mexico. Of course what starts easy ends up going south (no pun intended) in a hurry.These four actors are a pretty unusual group to begin with, though Aniston and Sudeikis both starred in "Horrible Bosses." Considering they all play degenerates of a sort who don't actually like each other, it makes their whole charade quite entertaining. The script could've played this premise out in really predictable fashion by sticking to typical family tropes, but Bob Faber and Steve Fisher ("Wedding Crashers") along with Sean Anders and John Morris ("Hot Tub Time Machine") take things a step further, crafting a lovable yet totally awful group of misfits who struggle to balance their personal motives with the idea of family spirit. "Millers" doesn't completely steer clear of cliché territory and it sometimes plays off of homophobia for a few laughs, but it doesn't giggle at dirty humor and exploit its R rating in a way that seems fake like so many bad comedies do. The story acknowledges its outlandish premise early on and then just has fun with it, calling upon techniques used in road trip comedies, drug comedies, dysfunctional family comedies and more. Again, it's the idea of taking old tropes and building them into something more unique.The actors all really fit their parts. Aniston's move toward raunchier films still has her playing a type, but even though "Millers" exploits her for her sex appeal, she gets moments of ownership in the script, which doesn't paint her into a stereotype of a stripper character. Sudeikis does his thing and does it well with a bit more license to utilize his different strengths.Roberts does a good job changing perception of her character throughout the film, who sucks more than the others at the beginning, while Poulter is both lovable and hilarious as the clueless Kenny. Talents that are unusual and different like his (he doesn't fit a clear mold) can really take a typical comedy up a notch and he certainly adds something to this movie. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn also provide top-notch supporting characters as a fellow RV couple.Despite their illegal purpose and somewhat self-centered motivations, it's pretty impressive how easy it is to like the Millers the family, not to mention the film as a whole. The script does a great job of clearly showing how all four of them desire something good in their lives; they each demonstrate a desire to live better lives and be better people. That helps make things interesting when they're thrown into your typical raunchy comedy tumult. "We're the Millers" gets a lot of the small things right, and some of the credit needs to go to director Rawson Marshall Thurber ("Dodgeball") who knows how to avoid the eye-rolling moments and to find some heart in spite of all the predictable comedic setup, in spite of knowing that even though they are doing this for money, the Millers will become somewhat of a family, or at least care about each other in the end. There are so many times in "We're the Millers" when it could've lapsed into same-old same- old R-rated, drug-related, sexual, foul-mouthed humor, and arguably it does, but the premise and the attention give to the characters helps it avoid the falls of so many similar comedies.~Steven CThanks for reading!

While the Harry Potter series gets progressively darker and more mature from the first to last book, the transition from "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" to "Prince Caspian" is much more instantaneous. The result is that the film adaptation follows suit, which is good to know for fans of the books. At the same time, as classic as the C.S. Lewis world of Narnia is, it's still largely unfamiliar to moviegoers, unlike the world of Harry Potter, which provides about four installments before taking a dark turn. In "Prince Caspian," we're thrust into the middle of a dark, rising conflict before the land of Narnia has yet to fully bloom in our imaginations. So as beautifully as director Andrew Adamson and crew have imagined it for us, the film centers a lot on battle plans and fights, not creating intimacy with the breadth of creatures that inhabit it as they fight to get their land back. It's been awhile since I read "Prince Caspian," so I can't say if this is a fault of adaptation or direction, but in this 150 minute epic film there's a distinct lack of heartfelt magic.The story brings the Pevensie children back to Narnia with much haste, because in Narnia years, ages have gone by and the land has been taken over by the Telmarines, evil and murderous humans. Prince Caspian, heir to the Telmar throne, is attacked by his uncle, so Caspian flees and calls the Pevensies (once great kings and queens of Narnia) back in hopes to reunite both lands in peace. Of course Caspian can't reclaim the throne without a fight, and much battle ensues.Narnia is more vividly imagine than ever. Of all the recent fantasy novel adaptations, the world Adamson has created is by far second only to Lord of the Rings (Disney and Walden Media are likely much of the reason, but still). The film has a truly epic feel to it. The scenes of Telmar are grim and blue and the scenes near Aslan's tomb where the Narnian's hide out are crisp and golden.The plot of the film marches forward without pause, wasting no time anywhere, which may bode well for book fans because they could pack more in, but not for people looking for something more. It is a total sacrifice of character development. The script tries to make up for it in jokes, namely in the form of a courageous, swash-buckling mouse, but nearly all the humor falls flat in such a serious plot that is hard enough to follow at times that you can't enjoy much else. Also, while none of the acting is bad, it doesn't particularly stand out either and no big names are around to drawn you in except the lended voice of Liam Neeson once again as Aslan.Dark it is, but it's not that much less family-friendly than the first film. It is for a bit older of an audience, not too much, and is definitely geared more for boys with the fighting, but if you stick with it, the values of faith, courage, mercy, etc. are all there. It's a warm movie, it's just not a particularly "magical" one. You're not swept up in the lore of Narnia and loving everything you see and hear, feeling that so much is culminating in this battle. Adaptations of books like these are always a tricky business and while all the pieces might not be in place to get it all right, "Prince Caspian" did some important things well, especially in visually bringing this darker Narnia to life in a very watchable film that is certainly not a let down from the first film.
Steven Soderbergh and a movie about male dancers are two things most commonly found on opposite sides of a video store (or completely different categories on your Netflix recommendations, if we're being modern), but behold "Magic Mike," a film that is both, and a film that works surprisingly well.To start, the "Magic Mike" script achieves a level of genuine reality more convincing than any "reality" television on MTV. The entire film is so sincere  even modest  in its approach, so much so that at times you might suspect Soderbergh's shooting a documentary. Mike (Channing Tatum) is the headliner at an all-male dance revue in Tampa Bay, but he considers himself an entrepreneur as he is saving up to start his own custom furniture business. At one of his day jobs installing roof tile, he eyes a 19-year-old (Alex Pettyfer) named Adam and takes him under his wing, introducing him to the male stripper world.As Mike and Adam bond and we're treated to a behind-the-scenes look at the art of the striptease and the men who perform it, "Magic Mike" gets by on this fresh, transparent approach. Soderbergh knows the stripping part has our attention, so he's unafraid to linger a bit longer in scenes in which not much is happening except that we're getting to know the characters. As conflict starts to build, we then feel immersed in the challenges in Mike and Adam's lives to some extent, though the drama never gets quite tense enough.Regardless of what works in terms of story, Tatum gives the best performance of his career to date. He seems as though he's just being himself on camera, which may in part be true as the Reid Carolin's script is loosely based on Tatum's experiences as a male stage dancer. Nonetheless, he's so smooth and natural, especially when his character is asked to joke around, but even when the more weighty material arrives at the end.None of the other characters gets that full range of character development, even Pettyfer's Adam. The character isn't written to really struggle with his huge life transition from college dropout to exotic dancer, but rather to complicate Mike's relationship to stripping as Mike's asked by Adam's older sister, the straight-laced Brooke (Cody Horn), to look after him. Pettyfer hits the more timid notes really well at the beginning, but as his character unravels his performance goes with it.The more things heat up in terms of plot, the more the flaws of "Magic Mike" come exposed, even though the entire film engages from start to finish. Someone not as sharp and creative as Soderbergh would've likely delivered the material in a flat, uninspired way given the amount of plain dialogue, but there's no critiquing what didn't happen. Instead, we get everything from wider angles and longer takes to different perspectives and colors that create mood and tension in an otherwise true-to-life and potentially boring story.The relationship between Mike and Brooke, or rather their sexual tension that doesn't amount to anything until it's basically too late, is probably its weakest subplot. A medical assistant, Brooke has little respect for what Mike does, but only so that Carolin's script can preach a little bit about how we shouldn't make assumptions about people who strip to make money. The two don't really belong together, but the script is very into the idea that the fun-loving stripper guy and the stiff nurse-in-training should fall for one another.Yet there's a lot to enjoy about "Magic Mike," which you could say ends up better than a film practically pandering to women ought to be. One of the less apparent strengths is how well Soderbergh captures the power of the striptease as explained to us by Matthew McConaughey's Dallas, the club owner. The dance sequences aren't used purely for sex appeal; between the actors dancing and the extras going wild over them, you can start to understand how self-empowering dancing up on a stage can be and you might actually start to envy the confidence they exude while performing. The film treats exotic dancing with a degree of reverence; it's not a gimmick purely meant to sell tickets  not in this film.Although it swings and misses on the payoff, "Magic Mike" depicts honest characters in honest situations behaving as people actually do, creating a unique and never-before-seen context for a drama that boils down to a story of soul searching, about choosing between the easier road or the harder, more fulfilling one when it comes to being the person you want to be.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The height of Akira Kurosawa's career as a masterful Japanese filmmaker might have been in the '50s with "Roshomon" and the epic "Seven Samurai," but "Ran" represents a consummation of sorts in the director's career and lifetime. At age 75, Kurosawa puts his own style into Shakespeare's "King Lear," the descent of a once great king into utter senility, and the result is a deeply personal and tragic film of great beauty and wisdom.His second Shakespeare samurai adaptation, (after "Throne of Blood" in 1957, which drew on "MacBeth") Kurosawa tells the story of Lord Hidetora Ichimonji a famous, revered and aging ruler in feudal Japan who after a bad dream is stirred into abdicating his throne to his sons, Taro, Jiro and Saburo. He gives full control to his eldest, Taro, though his youngest, Saburo, tells him it's a horrible idea and as a result gets banished. Sure enough, Hidetora is denied the respect of Taro when he takes power and wanders off in search of the son he exiled to seek redemption as the elder brothers shred apart his kingdom in attempt to have it all to themselves."Ran" is a beautiful film despite the Shakespearian tragedy. Filmed in Kurosawa's style of three simultaneously rolling stationary cameras, it rarely gets in close to the scene and appears to have the style of much older films, save the color. Kurosawa, who's known for painting his story boards, brings this contemporary abstract color to the film by using the three primary colors (yellow, red and blue) to represent the three sons (their respective armies all wear those colors.) The colors are bright and show the division between the brothers -- each distinct yet capable of mixing. Even the blood is bright red paint as opposed to anything more realistic, suggesting how unnecessary the bloodshed is.The film borrows a lot of Japanese tradition in telling a Western story, which in the past always seems to work well. Borrowing on traditions of Noh theatre, allusions to animals like the treacherous fox and the make-up on Hidetora (frequent Kurosawa collaborator Tatsuya Nakadai) is suggestive of Noh techniques that resemble iconic masks that represent characters with certain qualities. Nakadai excellently uses the facial expressions so crucial to Japanese theatre in his incredible portrayal of Hidetora as he goes from confident and powerful to completely lost.It's a meaningful story for Kurosawa to tell at this point in his career, having much of his films in the '60s and '70s pass by unnoticed and in that time attempt to take his own life. Kurosawa takes his bleak look at human nature with "Ran," using weather like always to show the coming storm of bloodshed and tragedy. "I am lost ..." Hidetora says as they wander about, and Kyoami the fool replies "such is the human condition." It's apparent where the story will go and Kurosawa delivers it as only a master can.
Everything about "Whip It" screams sports movie clichés. Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) lives in small-town Texas and lies to her parents, namely her mother who has stuck her in beauty pageants her whole life, and sneaks off at night to Austin where she's becoming a roller derby phenom. She even meets a cute boy during her rule-breaking excursions and she may well betray her best friend in the process.Yet despite the way Shauna Cross has pumped her story full of these overused story component, she does so with the intention of giving them the middle finger by the end of the film. Drew Barrymore also adds a sensitive touch in her directorial debut, along with some gravity to the story. That and it's about roller derby -- not football or basketball -- which helps tremendously.With the exception of a few wisecracks and a quick shot of her chugging a gallon of milk, Page has created a character much different from her title roll in the hit "Juno." With her looks and style of comedy, it's easy to get thrown into a Michael Cera-type corner, but she plays Bliss with an appropriate sense of high school naiveté in addition to strong inner- willpower. She skates between cliché: the extremes of the girl who gets picked on who proves everyone wrong and the one-girl wrecking ball that leaves destruction in her path in terms of personal relationships.At the same time, "Whip It" unravels like a sports movie through and through. It's warranted considering most people have no idea what roller derby is, but it doesn't change the dynamic of the those scenes showing action and then cutting to the scoreboard along with some kind of personality (Jimmy Fallon) giving commentary. Fallon, by the way, manages to keep all the laughs for himself. Other than the derby names the women have (Rosa Sparks, Bloody Holly, Smashley Simpson -- and Bliss is Babe Ruthless), that's the extent to which "Whip It" is laugh-out-loud funny. Otherwise it's just cute laughs because of the relatable nature of the story.Structurally, "Whip It" imitates countless films before it, but the compensation comes from the story's ultimate resistance to that structure. Barrymore, though I can't say all of her angles are well thought-out in certain basic scenes, provides some nice touches. When Bliss and her best friend Pash ("Arrested Development's" Alia Shawkat) are in a fight, instead of the expected shot of her running out to help her with some trash she's throwing away at work, Barrymore cuts to her dumping the trash and when it's in, we see Bliss on the other side. Same message, no cheesy running-to-help shot. It's minimal, but these things get noticed when similar films usually don't bother with them.Cross and Barrymore serve the end without cheese too, but still promote the positive themes and messages than run beneath every true sports and finding-yourself movie. "Whip It" feels stale but tastes impressively more genuine than it is thanks to the talented ladies on all sides of the camera.~Steven CVisit my site, moviesmusereviews.com
When a film labels itself an existential comedy and comes right out of the gate posing questions and musing about such philosophy, you expect something profound. Existentialism asks some of life's toughest questions and the greatest films ever made are the ones that enlighten us to some of those answers, so it's not unreasonable to think that "I Heart Huckabees" aims to do that through use of humor. What personally addressing those questions requires, however, is the right state of mind, and similarly to embrace "Huckabees" you have to be open to it as a film and as a way of thinking."Huckabees" bills itself like an independent film, which it basically is, putting nearly its entire cast on the marquee though in reality it pretty much stars Jason Schwartzman ("Rushmore") as Albert, an environment-loving poet who is seeking a greater understanding of existence. In doing so, he turns to Bernard (Hoffman) and Vivian (Tomlin), a couple who call themselves existential detectives who Albert pays to help him better understand his life through treatments and just observing him 24/7. They believe that all things are essentially of the same "cloth" (or blanket, as they put it) so all of life is really connected.Other clients of Bernard and Vivian become entangled in the story like Brad (Law) and his wife Dawn (Watts), employees of the Huckabees Corporation who directly contribute to Albert's misery. There is also Tommy (Wahlberg), a skeptic of the whole philosophy who has adopted the rival attitude that all things are not connected and life is essentially random and meaningless. While the variety of characters keeps things fresh, with such a complex subject matter, it would be easier to focus on one or two characters.David O. Russell's ("Three Kings") film is essentially a dialog or a pondering of these greater questions and all the characters, the plot, merely seem to exist as a vehicle for this discussion. While all the actors really give top-notch performances, it all seems lost in the shadow of these questions like "how am I not myself?" and the like. As for the comedy aspect, the film is certainly easy-going, never trying to bear down on the viewer with its philosophy, yet a comedy can hardly be traditional in the midst of it, so "Huckabees" must rely on the charms of off-beat and quirkiness to tickle the funny bone. Sometimes it works and sometimes it's, well, strange. Following into the latter category would be a Schwartzman baby sucking at the nipple of a cross-dressed Jude Law.As with most strange movies, you give yourself time to adjust and hope that the characters will win over your interest or that the director's reasoning will be made clear. The characters come out great, but the film doesn't illuminate any sense of purpose to some of the strange directorial choices, namely the odd animations and that nipple-sucking image."Huckabees" is a textbook definition of a film you have to be in the mood to watch. Even the most open-minded of individuals will have trouble digesting it, especially on first viewing. If you can gel with the film's way of posing questions and addressing them, my guess is you'll find the film somewhat illuminating, but the average viewer is going to see something strange or simply be distracted by the myriad of characters and trying to see how they all fit together. Basically, while really good films aid you toward catharsis, "Huckabees" requires a lot more participation from the viewer to achieve the same effect and that is going to depend on the viewer.
Before Woody Allen's string of self-examining romantic dramas in the late 70s came "Sleeper," a straight up slapstick satire about a man who is frozen in 1973 and awoken 200 years later. It's Allen's signature side note banter only in "Sleeper" it is applied almost strictly for comedic purposes.Taking a Distopian premise from the likes of George Orwell's "1984," Allen uses a hypothetical future to humorously comment on society's neurotic beliefs and practices in 1970 and where they might head if extrapolated (and exaggerated) into the future. Using "Keystone Cop" or Chaplin-esquire physical comedy sequences set to ragtime music, "Sleeper" becomes quite a lively, amusing and unique comedy. It's sort of Woody Allen's take on Chaplin's "Modern Times," applying similar theatricality to make a similar point about society. One of the first tactics Allen uses is to establish that fats and tobacco are incredibly healthy in this society, contrary to what research in our time tells us.In the film, Allen plays Miles Munroe who was New York clarinetist that ran a health food store in the 1970s. In 2173, he is illegally woken and thrust into the beginnings of a revolution in which the Underground wishes to overtake The Leader and his fascist regime that promotes "frigidity" as Diane Keaton's character Luna would call it. People in this world turn to shiny silver balls for a drug-induced state and Orgasmitrons to satisfy sexual desires. Not only does Allen humorously work these things into the film, but they do simultaneously speak to a potential future.What makes the film really funny is Allen being Allen, because the premise really gives him a lot to work with. One scene has a man showing Miles pictures of famous people from our time because the man knows nothing about them. Miles lies about every one of them, using the educationally opportunity to really call it as he sees it and say what he really thinks about our society back then. He also goes for all out hilarity at times--in one scene Keaton and another member of the Underground try and reenact memories of his past by pretending they're his old Jewish relatives at a family dinner, to which he responds by launching into a Blanche DuBois monologue. It interrupts what the film is doing but it doesn't hurt the pacing and certainly provides a lot of great laughs.Though it rarely seems like the film's focus, the love story underneath the plot between Miles and Luna is particularly important to the film and to Allen. While his next few works will really establish his quest for understanding love, he purposefully wants to show how a relationship still has problems even 200 years into the future and how love is still just as much a mystery."Sleeper," however, will and should be remembered for some great comedic fodder. We'll have to see 200 years from now if that's true.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
With the number of mainstream movies centered around a future human dependency on robots, it would be incredibly stupid if we actually let that happen. "Surrogates" is the latest of these concepts and surprisingly one of the more well thought-out ones. Based on the graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele, "Surrogates" imagines a world where humans interact with the world solely through robot versions of themselves called surrogates. They don't have to leave their homes and are impervious to danger.Writers Michael Ferris and John D. Brancato, who previously collaborated with director Jonathan Mostow on "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" and sadly also wrote the Halle Berry "Catwoman," do their best work with this script, which is of course not saying much. The positive here is that they truly embrace and explored the possibilities of a word where people don't interact with people -- just the robot versions of themselves. It's the saving grace of the film. Bruce Willis stars as a homicide detective assigned to the very first case on record where the actual human operator of a surrogate died when the surrogate was killed. With nearly all of the planet using surrogates, any knowledge of danger would throw the world into panic. Willis -- Det. Greer -- must track down the weapon that did the damage. When his surrogate is destroyed, Greer begins to re-examine life through non-virtual eyes.Without question, however, the concept and the setting are far more clever than the script. Ironically like robots, when you boil down the exterior of "Surrogates," it's composed of overused clichés and recycled components of Isaac Asimov and Philip K. Dick stories. The simple premise and thoroughly conceived world of "Surrogates" manages to override some lousy story lines and character development, but I'm not sure that most viewers who come to "Surrogates" looking for more action and less high-concept science fiction will be able to say the same.The subplots and back stories given to Greer and other characters are throw-away. At 89 minutes long, "Surrogates" offers just enough in terms of story development to be a glorified TV detective show set in the future. The twists are foreseeable and the character motivations barely scratched at, but it keeps your attention and stays focused enough on the central story that you never have to actually dwell on the more hollow elements of the film. The venerable James Cromwell, who plays the disgruntled inventor of surrogates, has never looked more shallow in a role, but it's hardly of any consequence.Sci-fi epiphany? None here, but a well-calculated exploration of a possible new technology - - yes. "Surrogates" is not mindless fun, but it's not artistic science fiction perfected to a tee either. It does just enough to intrigue the future-curious mind with a different cut from the same robot mold.~Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com
Movies don't get much more straightforward than giant robots battling giant monsters from another dimension. The giant monster movie is a classic genre, so in this age of all Hollywood blockbusters feeling pressured to earn their stripes by leveling a major world city, a return to these roots was inevitable. "Pacific Rim" delivers that old-school feel with the added pleasure of outstanding contemporary visual effects, and it results in a towering heap of giddy entertainment. When you look at the entire film catalog of giant monster movies, more than a majority would be classified as B-movies. "Pacific Rim" doesn't count under "so bad it's good," but director and co-writer Guillermo del Toro has no intention of allowing audiences to believe that the film takes itself too seriously, at least never for very long. As much as moviegoers' appreciation for mentally stimulating "smart" blockbusters has grown, that's not what this production went for by any stretch.That essentially means "Pacific Rim" gives your brain permission to turn off and instead soak in the scale and wonder of giant robots fighting giant monsters. In truth, the script is total garbage. Travis Beacham, who wrote the film (with help from del Toro), also credits 2010's "Clash of the Titans" to his name, so that tells you del Toro and his uncanny imagination play the biggest role in "Pacific Rim's" success. Namely it's the dialogue that's atrocious, but the characters are poorly developed, with each assigned a single past trauma that completely defines them. The salvation of it all(which understandably may not be salvation for all viewers), comes again from that all-important lack of self-seriousness. It will remind a lot of people of some of the first big special effects blockbusters of the '90s, in which wonder and excitement take the driver's seat and help you smile through all the dumb supporting characters and subplots.The film begins seven years after the Kaiju first began to emerge from a portal deep within the Pacific ocean. Our hero, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) explains that to limit the planes and tanks it took to bring the beasts down, world leaders worked together to build Jaegers, giant robots piloted by two skilled soldiers connected by a neural bridge. The way all this works is somewhat fascinating, so Beacham deserves props for that much.When a battle with a Kaiju off the Alaskan coast ends badly for Raleigh, five more years go by and the world is starting to lose the war against the Kaiju, who have begun to adapt and dispatch Jaegers with ease. When all hope appears to be lost, Raleigh's old boss, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), commander of the Jaeger operation, recruits Raleigh to pilot his old Jaeger in a last-ditch effort. Together, with the world's few remaining Jaegers and their pilots, a rookie pilot (Rinko Kikuchi) and two nutty researchers (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman), they are the last stand for humanity.The design of both bots and creatures is outstanding, and you'd expect nothing less from del Toro. A much younger version of myself would be captivated enough to buy a Jaeger toy or two, for sure. And not only that, but del Toro captures the sheer size of these things in ways that Michael Bay never has with the "Transformers" films. That sense of scale proves pivotal to being drawn into this film. Without that huge epic scope and some imaginative visual effects, all "Pacific Rim" has going for it is a neat concept.And oh, the action sequences. The film's penultimate battle would be grand finale material in 90 percent of other blockbusters. The fact that it comes earlier, however, makes the final sequence much more surprising. The plot appears to lay all the cards out on the table in this second-to-last sequence, making the ending a total mystery.How del Toro can take something as big and clunky as this film and turn it into a total thrill is mystifying. He should teach a class on how to make big movies that look and feel dumb but somehow slap a stupid smile on your face and all Hollywood studios should force their blockbuster filmmakers to enroll before they set out to make the next big and dumb but also un-watchable movie.Not every other component besides the visual one stinks. Kikuchi's Mako is a slightly more complicated character, Day's role and Ron Perlman's cameo are stupid funny but funny and the acting is solid enough across the board to make us believe that these characters do indeed care about each other, which in turn helps us care about them more than we might otherwise be inclined.For all those that complain about critics being cold and unable to appreciate a fun, mindless blockbuster, check out the Rotten Tomatoes score on this one. There are ways to make a good mindless blockbuster and there are ways to make a bad one. "Pacific Rim" is a nearly textbook example of the former. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

Rarely do foreign films receive the notoriety of "Run Lola Run" and turn out to be funny and entertaining rather than dramatic and difficult. Tom Tykwer's film works for all audiences in part because it sets up a simple premise: Lola must help her boyfriend Manni come up with 100,000 Deutsch marks in 20 minutes or his "employer" will kill him. With our eyes not transfixed on subtitles, "Run Lola Run" works in some crazy visual aesthetics and suddenly, Tykwer's breaking all the rules much to our delight."Run Lola Run" doesn't quite start out that way: a scene out of a Fellini movie with wandering people and a narrator posing existential questions doesn't exactly set the tone for the thriller (mostly) that will follow, but when combined with the other radical visual choices, when the story does violate expectations (and reality), the audiences is already on board. Tykwer invites his audience to jump the ship of convention and we couldn't line up any faster.In truth, Tykwer's film is an existential love story slathered in bright and fun distractions. There's a definite contradiction between the ideas he wants to convey and the film's breakneck pacing. Interestingly, the high-speed plot actually enhances the effectiveness of the occasional slow and dialogue-heavy scenes and draws our attention to them. Two scenes in particular are single takes of Lola (Franka Potente) and Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) lying in bed questioning each other's love. They're completely different in tone than the adrenaline-filled scenes of Lola trying to get to Manni with money in time before he holds up a grocery store, but in a strange way they color the characters with surprising depth and humanity.If you can avoid getting caught up in the extensive coincidences and video game-like plot and can focus on more traditional aspects of the film such as character motivation, "Run Lola Run" starts to reveal itself. We barely get to know Lola before she takes off down the streets of Berlin in hopes that she can come up with a ridiculous amount of money within the course of 20 minutes. Clearly she can't imagine life without Manni and is willing to risk it all as she does in the film's three "trials." Contrast that pure devotion to the scenes where Lola and Manni can't seem to communicate their love and that says it all about true love.Tykwer simply relishes the chance to make his film blow our minds. Every single moment of "the run" that he constructs has been carefully thought out like any good thriller, only he sends the story into radically unexpected directions. Despite a repeating pattern, you never know what's going to come next and the occasional atypical camera movement or surrealist choice  or Lola's "superpower" that allows her to shriek and shatter glass  amplifies that intensity.Although on the whole the film aims for satisfaction over complete understanding or true closure with the purpose for Tykwer's madness, the effectiveness of the whole experience is unparalleled by most films that break from convention.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Three of the brightest stars in the golden years of cinema converge in "The Philadelphia Story," a romantic comedy of great wit and sophistication. Although it would be unfair to say that the talent makes this film, Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn and James Stewart are far and away its best feature."Philadelphia Story"" was adapted from the stage production of the same name by Philip Barry. The play was written with the intention of reviving Hepburn's stage career. It was brought to the screen with the help of Hepburn's boyfriend Howard Hughes who purchased the rights for her as a gift.Full of fast-talking highbrow humor, the material is unquestionably aimed at an upper-class audience, but not only in terms of taste, but also thematically. Created during the latter half of the Great Depression, "Philadelphia Story" makes the statement that class is insignificant, that it's a non-existent social framework that purports itself as an indication of character. We obsess over class, something that couldn't have been more true during the depression, and it's a theme all the more impressive considering the film's popularity and story of celebrity gossip and intrigue.Hepburn stars as rich socialite Tracy Lord, who is about to marry working-class hero George Kittredge (John Howard), only her wealthy ex-husband, the wealthy and fantastically-named C.K. Dexter Haven (Grant) plans on spoiling the big day by sneaking in a tabloid writer (Stewart) and photographer (Ruth Hussey). The jig is up pretty quickly, but not without making things dreadfully difficult on Tracy.Stewart might have won the Oscar, but this is Hepburn's film. I'd agree with what Stewart once said: that the statuette was "deferred payment" for losing out in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," an undeniably superior role. Hepburn should have seen the glory for this film for her magnetizing and moving performance. Whether its her distinct and powerful voice or her variety of facial expressions, she's got us tied on a string and she just plays with us throughout the ups and downs of her character. Tracy is not unlike Hepburn herself as a major public figure that feels worshipped more than truly loved or appreciated.Stewart and Grant, however, deserve their due. Stewart pilots the best scene of the film when he pays a drunken visit to C.K.'s place late at night. Grant works his charms in a more subdued way as C.K. is more the subtle mastermind than the flashy performer of his schemes. Also worthy of mention is the dry and snide humor of Hussey's character. She adds a really nice touch to the cast and keeps it balanced.Although a bit sharper, more sophisticated and dialogue-heavy than most romantic comedies, "Philadelphia Story" is still a classic and it makes its class argument through those weaknesses in ways, making it a terrific film. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
At first glance, the most refreshing thing about "Eastern Promises" is that it doesn't involve the mafia. It is about the Russian mob in England, not Italians in America. What results when director David Cronenberg ("A History of Violence") tells this story is something familiar, but fresh and interesting."Promises" shows how the life of nurse/midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) collides with the Russian mob when she uncovers the indecent diary of a dead Russian patient. Viggo Mortensen is in the employ of this major crime family whose untamed and immature son Kiril (Vincent Cassel of "Ocean's Twelve" fame) is looking to take control of the operations.What makes the film stand out is the way the world with which we can identify (Watts' character's story) and the world of which we are afraid (Russian mob) interact with each other. There is nothing glitzy, no mob glorification. It is all very real, like it could happen next door and you'd never know it. Cronenberg shows a generally modern London that is not too overtly dark or corrupt, but dark enough to convey the feeling that something goes on there behind the scenes where you don't expect.Mortensen, Cassel and Watts excel in their roles, though the two definitely not Russian actors could have been stronger in their accents and believability. Still, personality wise Mortensen is the standout. His tall, silent, dark hero persona makes him very enjoyable to watch."Promises" is a film about coming to terms with the sometimes all too dark truth of people and sometimes ourselves in particular and through it all trying to find the hope that keeps us going. It might be told in a chilling way, but the whole idea is to feel uncomfortable with it. It may not rivet you, but it will leave an impression.
"Double Indemnity" in a modern context seems remarkably unoriginal. An unhappy but wealthy housewife and her insurance salesman lover plot to scam and murder her husband to collect $100,000 on a double indemnity clause in his life insurance. But the film is a darkly lit, chain-smoking bona-fide film noir thriller, an execution of incredible suspense and style with dialog and narration that you just don't hear in film anymore. It's unflinchingly nostalgic, like an ageless perfume -- often mimicked, but still distinct. The structure of the story offers more of its originality. It opens with the main character, insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), confessing a murder into the voice recording cylinder of his boss. It's a murder mystery told in hindsight, flaunting its mastery by managing to be suspenseful in Neff's retelling despite having revealed the end result. Though it takes awhile to get rolling, the film has you hooked and dying to know how it all went down.Neff's narrative gives the film its noir tone. Previously a romantic comedy actor, MacMurray absolutely nails the persona and voice of "it was a dark and stormy night." His ability to light matches with one hand is a party trick that even today's ardent opposers of secondhand smoke would kill to know. His transition from slick, smooth-talking salesman to paranoid killer is the film's strongest plot arc.Billy Wilder writes and directs a film that flows surprisingly well. It's very clear what's going on and each scene takes time to set itself up and set a specific mood that he echoes with lighting. Scenes in front of windows or in doorways are a favorite of his in the film."Double Indemnity" is one of the earliest examples of movies depicting the downfall of the small-time criminal who can't easily look past or forgive his/her own actions. 65 years later, this message has been diluted by many more films that echo it in more complex and intriguing ways. If you don't absolutely love this film, you probably love a film that borrows at least some element from this richly rooted classic.
After about 15 minutes of "The Incredible Hulk," I easily tossed aside and deserted all thoughts and pre-existing connections to Ang Lee's 2003 "Hulk" and willingly accepted this film's complete makeover--that's how much better this film is than Hulk's first cut on the big screen. Writer Zak Penn and director Louis Leterrier's depiction of the green giant makes for a much more exciting action film and is way more believable. "The Incredible Hulk" epitomizes summer blockbuster while staying comic-friendly and not being completely devoid of audience empathy."Incredible Hulk" picks off where 2003's Hulk left off, but basically rewrites everything up to that point. Banner is in hiding from the U.S. military, trying to find ways of controlling his anger/heart rate so he never becomes the Hulk, and in the meantime communicating secretly with a scientist who might be able to help him cure his condition. When General Ross (Hurt), who wants Banner for his blood to make it into a weapon, finds where Banner is hiding, the fun begins.The plot is rather cyclical in that Ross tries to hunt down Banner three different times and then the Hulk gets away. Each time is a bit different, mostly because one decorated military soldier (Tim Roth) begins taking Ross' "supersoldier" serum in effort to bring the Hulk down and eventually his lust for strength turns him into the Abomination. It's not a great plot, but it's straightforward, really easy and exciting to follow, very comic-like, and we can identify with Banner's need to find a cure for the uncontrollable beast inside him.Norton is infinitely better than Bana as Bruce Banner. The writing for his character is so much better to begin with--you actually get the sense that he's fighting the Hulk and you see the connection between Banner and this alter ego. They don't feel completely separate from one another, which is something "Hulk" of 2003 never did. Ang Lee gave us more introspective Hulk, but Leterrier gives us some of that in addition to a Hulk that is more fierce, visceral and untamed. The CGI is more realistic and Leterrier does a much better job at showing how inadvertently destructive the Hulk really is and why Banner wants it to go away.The action in this film is top notch in both live action and CGI. Especially at the beginning it feels like a mix between superhero films and the "Bourne" movies. Marvel made a bold move bringing in "Transporter 2" director Leterrier, but Leterrier's command of action makes this film great in at least that aspect alone. The action is brutal and relentless, never going soft which is exactly what you want from a movie about an uncontrollable green monster, especially one who fights an even crazier monster at the end. This kind of action is incomparable to any superhero film I've seen and that's a credit to Leterrier.The script only scratches the surface thematically in terms of Bruce's struggle, but it's enough to like and care about his character and let the action do the rest. You really get to know Norton's Banner and that's what matters. My other beefs with the film (Liv Tyler's mediocrity, Roth's dialogue, Abomination talking too much) are not significant enough to knock the film from its solid action superhero film status. Ultimately, this film is very satisfying--the direction, the creative hands that the Hulk franchise is in (should it continue) is an extremely gratifying one.
There's one problem with television: You can't say &#*%, or $@&%, or #^&@%$. So what did Trey Parker and Matt Stone -- the creators of the hit mature animated series "South Park" -- turn? The movies, where anything goes (just about). Although the idea for a "South Park" movie probably came about before the idea to exploit the MPAA's more flexible ratings system for the TV show's impeccable satire, it's no less the perfect choice to bring the little Colorado mountain town and its foul-mouthed children to the big screen in "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut."Using the movies, Parker and Stone immediately come out singing (yes, this is a movie musical) that the movies are responsible for society's cultural education. The third graders Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny all go to see the new Terrence & Philip movie, based on the show's fictional hit Canadian TV show about two farting roommates, mirroring the experience of the likely underaged crowd going to see the "South Park" movie, and there you have the brilliance of "South Park" and this film.The Terrence & Philip movie introduces the kids to a whole world of swears and insults they never knew before (because they couldn't use them on TV) and they start using it in talking back to teachers and their parents. As usual, the parents of South Park take things too seriously and point the finger for their children's bad behavior at well, Canada, who else? Single-handedly, Parker and Stone introduce the Canada joke to Americans.The film doesn't crusade for allowing bad language, but rather shows how silly it is to take language so seriously, particularly when Mothers Against Canada invokes a war with our neighbors to the north.Parker and Stone should take their act to Broadway with the quality of the music in this movie, from the Oscar-nominated "Blame Canada" to "What Would Brian Boitano Do?" They do enlist the help of the talented Tony winner Marc Shaiman, but the show has always been known for its musical prowess. The songs are memorable, fun and break up the film well considering its structured like a long television special.Fans of the show get exactly what they'd expect from "South Park" including some extra goodies and appearances from all the most liked characters. The language of course is off the charts, but the childish ignorance of adult content (Stan seeks the clitoris after Chef tells him that's how you keep a girl around) is there too. By film's end it's not the sharpest satire that the show has ever delivered, but it was obviously the perfect plot choice for making "South Park" into a movie, not just picking some random story line, but maximizing the satire potential of the new medium. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Pedophilia doesn't seem the likely subject of a film made in the early '60s, but there's almost a power in the censorship of "Lolita." Undoubtedly, the finished product did not represent the initial vision of neither director Stanley Kubrick nor Vladimir Nabokov, who penned the adaptation of his own novel, but the result is a film no less challenging.The fact that "Lolita" had to rely on implied sexuality because anything that so much as visually suggested illegal sexual relations could not be filmed, actually makes the film stronger in ways. It puts a lot more weight on the shoulders of James Mason as Humbert Humbert, the professor inappropriately smitten with his landlady's daughter, to convey his lust without conveying his lust, but it also refocuses the story to the psychological profiles of both Humbert and Lolita (Sue Lyon) rather than what they did or didn't do. Dolores "Lolita" Haze is the driving force both at times overtly and implicitly throughout the entire story. She lives with her widowed mother Charlotte (Shelley Winters) in the small town of Ramsdale, New Hampshire, where Humbert Humbert intends to spend the summer writing before he begins work as a professor. Looking for a place to rent, he finds the Hazes and agrees to stay after he sees Lolita, who's just 15 but completely physically mature. He's infatuated with the girl instantly and deals with her mother's sexual advances just to stay near her. Upset and implicitly jealous of Lolita, Mrs. Haze sends her away to summer camp. Faced with the possibility of never seeing Lolita again, Humbert marries Mrs. Haze.Lolita seems like an average gum-chewing teenager, but she understands the power she has as an attractive young woman. Even before we first see her, Kubrick's camera-work is restless and frenetic as Charlotte tries to sell Humbert on staying at their home. When they both finally go out back where it happens that Lolita is out sunning in a bikini, the camera stays still on her (no ogling, of course) and everything changes.Humbert's inappropriate motivations regarding Lolita are the most obvious, but even Mrs. Haze lets Lolita get to her. Much like Snow White and the Evil Queen, Charlotte is driven by jealousy because Lolita has her whole life ahead of her and she's young and beautiful, whereas Charlotte feels desperate and unloved in these seven years after her husband's death. Then there's Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers). The film opens with Humbert shooting him to death, with regards to Lolita, and goes back four years earlier to tell the story from the beginning. Quilty appears throughout the story and the implied romantic link between he and Lolita grows stronger as the film goes on, although he remains on the periphery. Not too much, however, because Kubrick devotes a lot of attention to Sellers' performance. He's brilliant (and clearly the inspiration for Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove," which would reunited the two a few years later), but his comedy does at times drastically change the tone of the film to humor and detract from the central characters' story.Sellers gets to have all the fun, but the challenge belongs mostly to Mason. He must ride a fine line between open lust and hidden obsession, which makes watching his character a torturous experience. He ultimately gets it right, however, because we actually manage a bit of inexplicable sympathy for the creep. Even as his character turns into a possessive parent figure bent on preserving Lolita's innocence for his own selfish reasons, we still agree with bits of his ideology enough to care about him, sadly. The censorship of the film lends a helping hand here because we never literally see Humbert evolve into the disgusting pedophile we're meant to believe him to be."Lolita" has to be a rare instance where a film reaps benefits from censorship. To some extent we don't ever fully understand Lolita or Humbert because we're never offered proof of the consummation of their feelings. Without so much as a subtle suggestion being tolerated outside of Lolita whispering to Humbert in the hotel room about a "game" she learned from the one boy at camp, the rest is left to imagination and so we can never truly understand why they are making certain crazed decisions. But that lack of tangible evidence does help us realize the power of Lolita, lust and desire as we see in the other characters. The raw tension that Kubrick creates in this subtlety does much to suggest the madness caused by these feelings and emotions. Ultimately, it is great direction that can turn a likely weakness into a commanding strength.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" is the definitive fantasy series, deserving of the very best adaptation that the movie industry can muster. Ambitiously shooting all three chapters at one time, director Peter Jackson and crew embarked on a filmmaking journey fittingly analogous to Frodo and the Fellowship's quest to return the One Ring to the fires whence it came. In any case, the story, the film and the analogy all deserve highest praise.The passion that Jackson and crew had for this project shows in every ounce of the this first film, "The Fellowship of the Ring." There's an obvious love of the source material and a fierce commitment to telling the story in the most authentic way possible. It's not only evident in the handling of the script, but also down to the tiny details of the props, costumes and sets. It might be the single greatest example of how tremendous care and effort in terms of production value can impact the rest of a production, even down to the performances.The production value stars with the glorious New Zealand landscapes serving as Middle Earth. Jackson takes the extra second to show the Fellowship traversing the mountains or just to linger on the skyline. It makes this adventure and this place of pure fantasy feel so totally real, and all fantasy films work when they feel real.After a prologue explaining how the Rings work and how the One Ring came to be, "Fellowship" begins in a way that will please fans of Tolkien's, focusing on Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) and painting a portrait on how the Ring and his entire adventure (as chronicled in "The Hobbit") impacted him, before the attention shifts to his young nephew, Frodo (Elijah Wood), who has no idea the task that he's inherited.It is the performance of Ian McKellen as the great wizard Gandalf, however, that anchors the beginning of the film. He's the chief example of how the series has cast some of the best and most venerable actors, especially in terms of voice, who lend such power to words that on a page read like silly fantasy speak. We hang on Gandalf's every word, as do all the actors playing the characters he speaks to in each scene. Casting choices in Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett in similar roles prove crucial, as they make exposition sound like Shakespeare.But what all the actors do so well involves the integrity of their characters. Sean Astin, as Frodo's best friend Samwise, commits to fully to the emotions of his scared but fiercely loyal character. We ride the emotional highs and lows of Frodo's journey through Wood's eyes and facial expressions. Everyone remains so committed to their characters that even the underdeveloped ones trigger in us some emotional response. Seemingly unafraid of a long runtime, the film also delves into peripheral characters. Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn gets the majority of subplot attention."Fellowship" has a nice flow throughout, with a lot of suspense and foreboding to make up for the lack of bigger action sequences (this is, after all, the first movie). The action picks up after the forming of the Fellowship at Rivendell with the highlight being the sequences in the Mines of Moria, but prior to that, Frodo and the hobbits trying to dodge the Ringwraiths with the help of Aragorn keeps things intense.But the most brilliant stroke of the adaptation by far is the way both the script and Jackson give the Ring such a powerful and haunting energy. We are teased early and often about its power to tempt and corrupt, and this ends up driving the entire narrative of "Fellowship" as well as guiding most of Jackson's visual choices. He treats the Ring as its own character and has us captivated and troubled by it in equal measure. He captures the Ring from all angles and it wields a cinematic power that perfectly conveys its power in the story.As the first leg in a long and arduous journey, "Fellowship" asks all the right questions and hits the appropriate thematic notes. Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens' script doesn't presume our complete emotional investment in the story and instead focuses on themes of strength of character and responsibility. Does Frodo have what it takes to make this journey? Can he trust anyone? He is forced to make some big decisions by the end of this film and we turn inward to assess how we would handle the same predicament.To some extent we do identify emotionally with the characters in the final third of this film, though Jackson could spare us slow-mo every single time something shocking or emotional happens in the film. It really is the characters who have committed to the emotions of these characters that we have no choice but to accept them as real, and that makes the emotional ending of this one work despite no real conclusion having been reached.Whether the film's intended catharsis works for you or not, there's no disputing the towering production quality. The visuals of the film are so commanding and engulfing that's there's no escaping a total immersion in this Middle Earth. There are plenty of digital effects being utilized, but the detail and the uniform aesthetic in the costumes, make up and physical sets has no equal. This is the kind of effort and attention deserving of Tolkien's masterful story.
"The Jacket" if nothing else, sets the Hollywood record for most British actors speaking English in a feature film. Thank god they're talented.It's an interesting movie, but "The Jacket" really succeeds more as a drama than a sci-fi time travel thriller. Its strengths are Adrien Brody, Keira Knightley and Daniel Craig among others. They bring some convincing characters that are rather interesting, but it only partially saves a plot that isn't very gripping like a good sci-fi film ought to do. The characters wouldn't be worth caring about either if it weren't for the talent. Brody gets a lot of pity and Knightley surprisingly does despite playing a chain-smoking, emotional head case. The credit goes to them and not so much John Maybury or the writers. The film doesn't seem to know its most prized possessions are its actors. Without them, not only would the Jacket never have caught anyone's interest, but wouldn't be too good. Instead, the directing style lends itself more to sci-fi, trying to be trippy with flashes of images of past events that are more a headache than anything else. It's not horrible, but it's not all that terrific.
A thriller on the Trans-Siberian railway is not an everyday film premise and that is in part what makes "Transsiberian" interesting. It's not typical in any way unless you count the connection between murder and trains. That, and its cast is quality without seeking out big- hitting names and its director, Brad Anderson ("The Machinist") is a fairly understated one. The story of a married couple onboard the railway and encountering something over their heads is not full of devious twists and turns, but it's attention-getting.Emily Mortimer and Woody Harrleson star as two married travelers who after going to China to do volunteer work through their church, decide to travel through Russia by train to make their trip a bid more adventurous. After all, we wouldn't have much of a film without them deciding to take the train. On board, they meet Carlos and Abby, a young couple whom they bond with, but who appear more and more suspicious as the film inches toward its first big event.Not much more can be said without giving away large chunks of the suspenseful elements of the film. It's not bland, but the intrigue of this film is summed up into just a handful of moments. Ben Kingsley, however, has a dynamite supporting role as a Russian homicide/narcotics detective. His performance is crucial to the movie's entertainment value.I would suspect a lot of people would be less than enamored with "Transsiberian" because it floats between suspenseful thriller and a drama about keeping secrets, telling lies and guilt. It's not pure entertainment, nor is profound with regards to the human condition. Expectation for one or the other is a recipe for not having much of a feeling about this film.I, however, found the subtlety of Anderson's film a delightful change of pace and the characters played by Mortimer and Harrelson (and the performances they give) easy to sympathize with and unique. Anderson doesn't use any familiar clichés in creating suspense with his film. It just builds toward its few moments and with the help of what I felt was an equally effective score from Spanish composer Alfonso Vilallonga. "Transsiberian" is effective in rhythm and mood, not in plot twists and profundity.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
A harrowing portrait of a teenager forced to be an adult out in the Ozarks, the epicenter of crystal meth activity, "Winter's Bone" feels more harsh and real than anything that brief summary evokes. Debra Granik's film seems unequivocally true, so while I'm sure Daniel Woodrell's novel paints an extremely accurate portrait of these white rural communities devastated by drug trafficking, there's no question that Granik's turned his story into something truly lifelike, not "Hollywood" lifelike.Nothing in "Winter's Bone" gets over-dramatized. Even the film's most jarring events have a modesty about them. Granik prefers to let the characters and the gravity of their situations brood rather than add some extra suspense to get our blood pumping. Throw everything you know about poor white trash drug films out the window as there's nothing even resembling shock and disgust tactics. We are simply meant to watch Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) struggle against a number of common and uncommon forces and observe the mostly cold demeanor of those around her whose lives have presumably been battered by drug abuse and peddling.Jennifer Lawrence makes as big a splash as a 19-year-old possibly could here. She exudes Ree's confident and responsible attitude. Although Ree possesses a definite naivety, it comes wrapped in a determination and willingness to accept the consequences. She's in a desperate situation having to take care of her ill and incompetent mother and her two younger siblings, yet she remains self-assured. The film follows Ree's mission to find her father at risk of losing her house and being left homeless with her dependent family. Her father has been in and out of prison and has been missing the last few weeks. The sheriff informs her that if he doesn't make his court date they'll take the house to pay bond. The only way she knows to track him is to stick her nose into some dangerous places and she nearly loses it.Yet "Winter's Bone" does not uncover the horrors of crystal meth cooking in Central Missouri. The story focuses on Ree and causes us to wonder about those she seeks out in search of her father. We don't see them engaging in drug use or behaving all that recklessly, but there's an unspoken seriousness in all of them and consequently fear pervades the film.Granik beautifully creates a barren, isolated, cold and uncomfortable mood as suggested by the title. The colors of the film are faded and bleak and the performances introspective. One might lament that John Hawkes, who plays Ree's uncle, never gets to fully flex his dramatic chops despite the underlying tension that could justify an over-the-top scene, but his performance remains powerfully understated. Forced to blend together tones of anger, fear, responsibility and love, Hawkes stirs it up just right as the film slowly plods on.Those who can appreciate a film that aims mainly to be a character-centered mood piece will find so many beautiful things in "Winter's Bone" albeit things hard to digest. There's also nothing completely tragic or gut-wrenching about the film and some might wait the entire time for the lid to burst and never be fully satisfied. Yet there's no doubt that some wonderful talents assembled this troublesome film and created a mood that will somehow settle with you even if its plot points go forgotten.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
It's almost unfair to write this review in 2009, a shocking 20 years since this film was put into production, where the future that James Cameron imagined is much closer than before and the effects he did with computers are now standard action techniques. Kids growing up from here on out watching "Terminator 2: Judgement Day" won't even have a sense of ground this film broke, and consequently their overall enjoyment of the film will be a bit less. I give this film 8/10 when it's deserving of more in the right context -- these kids might go lower.But even the lowest of budgets can be better than a digital spectacle with a better story. "T2" has that story, brilliantly taking its iconic villain, The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) from the first film, and bringing him back as a good guy. Genius. This time he is sent back in time to protect a 10-year-old John Connor (Edward Furlong), son of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and leader of the humans in the future when the machines they create turn on them -- not kill him. That job is left to T-1000 (Robert Patrick), who is made of shape-shifting liquid metal. Today, that's nothing, but 20 years ago, T-1000 joined the ranks of Darth Vader on the villains list and there he still stays in the minds of many.Much like 1984's "The Terminator," one guy from the future is good, the other bad, and both are engaged in the life of a human who is pivotal to the future. Wherever one goes, the other follows. The difference is that James Cameron has turned the weapons and explosives scale up to a 15 on a scale of 10. Hamilton, once an '80s party girl, is now an angry and muscular 35-year-old who goes crazy on people; Schwarzenegger's shotgun is now on the puny end of his arsenal.James Cameron wows with the action. It sort of erases his attempt to tell a story about the differences between humans and robots through the relationship between John and the Terminator, but just about everything with a motor or a computer chip in it meets some sort of spark-flying combustible end. Plus, it all looks better than the first. Cameron has much better models of Schwarzenegger to beat up and he weaves them in more cleverly. The make-up is also superior. Talk about a visual marvel for its time -- all the Oscars for various effects and make-up are certainly well- deserved. Cameron decides that an action movie about the future isn't worth making unless it breaks ground. It's hard to disagree with the man.The acting could still be better, but believe it or not, I don't mean Schwarzenegger. He's actually much better now that he's got the English thing down -- or at least intelligible. Hamilton's Sarah is just too angry and a withered shell of her former self, which makes sense in the context of the story but makes her not too likable. Furlong, as young John, is kind of a whiny and obnoxious turd who desperately needs his voice to drop. Neither matter too much, however, because Terminator is super easy to root for ... and they're fighting to save the human race in the future, which is cool.Nowadays it's sadly easy to shake-off explosions and action stunts in movies like it's been- there-done-that, but also in the age of the move to 3D and miraculous CGI, it shouldn't be hard for the movie-goer who appreciates today's groundbreaking technology to consider the same for a movie made 20 years ago.
When we think of science fiction, we so often think about the future. We expect it to stretch our imaginations in ways we never thought possible with groundbreaking concepts beyond our current understanding. "John Carter" appears to aspire to that level. Yet in spite of the film's hefty price tag, use of latest in motion-capture technology, 3D conversion and all the other tell-tale signs of an ambitious blockbuster, "John Carter" is classic, old-school sci fi/fantasy at heart.And that's the way it should be. After all, the source material comes from Edgar Rice Burroughs' "A Princess of Mars," a pulp story nearly 100 years old. Rather than give us a "John Carter" for the 21st Century, director Andrew Stanton gives us "John Carter" as made possible by the technological advancements of the 21st Century.It starts with a vision, and that's what Stanton (and all Pixar disciples) brings to the table. One can imagine the concept art he used to sell this movie to Disney didn't change much from inception to the film canister. Anyone with unadulterated love for science fiction will be captivated by the "John Carter's" production design. Especially in terms of costume and the big set pieces, the film has that Roman-inspired sci-fi look reminiscent of "Flash Gordon" and in some cases "Star Wars."As with most classical science fiction, the story deals almost exclusively in archetypes. Captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is a Civil War veteran who at the story's beginning is dead. He has willed and entrusted his journal to his nephew, a fictionalized version of Burroughs (Sabara), the contents of which explain all that's happened to him over the years, including how he ended up on Mars. Transported there mysteriously while prospecting for gold in Arizona, Carter becomes a near-prophetic hero to the planet's race of green creatures called Tharks, but also saves a "red" woman named Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins), who is a princess that begs of his help to end a brutal war.The story and script maintains its composure throughout, something at which science-fiction films often fail. It starts like pulp and ends like pulp rather than aspiring to be above the material. Consequently, "John Carter" does little to appeal to anyone but a true sci-fi nerd; it asks us to embrace this fantastical world on Mars (or I should say Barsoom), just as Carter the character works his way through his interplanetary transplant rather than freaking out about it. Stanton and co-writers Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon (the novelist) spare us all the inane dialogue about how weird everything is on this planet. Carter just accepts it, and fans of this film will be the ones who follow his example.The scope and scale of the film feels quite close to "Avatar," as both were about visual wonder and stuck to basic storytelling. "John Carter" only loses points in terms of the quantity and intensity of the action sequences and the depth of character. Kitsch and Collins make for likable leads and you believe the emotions they feel, but they're undeniably cookie-cutter.Some of the side characters, including Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and Sola (Samantha Morton) show potential for some emotional pull, but it's all short-lived as the story is constantly on the move to the next locale or sequence. The personal moments between characters are reserved for exposition and expanding the lore of Barsoom. Again, great for geeks, but I can't imagine it will please much of anyone else.Simply, "John Carter" is for nostalgists. Instead of being your modern science-based science fiction, this is the kind steeped in fantasy. It will make many recall the first time they experienced "Star Wars" or any similar film or television show that crafted its own world or universe. Stanton provides no shortage of things to marvel at, a variety of people, places and vehicles bound to capture the imaginations of younger moviegoers and gratify those who used to be those younger moviegoers.There was a time when "John Carter" would have been a major hit and blown the minds of everyone who saw it. Science fiction has just evolved to the point that this kind of a story captures a specific time in our storytelling history rather than opening our eyes to the possibility of the future. That's the difference between "John Carter" and "Avatar," for one thing. So as much as Stanton and Disney have used the advances in special effects to tell this story in a way that it never could before and does so quite well, "John Carter" offers a very specific type of entertainment best for a niche audience.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Oblivion" is so visually crisp and clean that you could actually brush your teeth with it. Director Joseph Kosinski, who pieced together the aesthetically immaculate "Tron: Legacy" takes a similar approach in adapting his graphic novel for the big screen, and with some solid screen writing help, "Oblivion" feels especially worth of the "science-fiction" label."Oblivion" moves beyond post-apocalyptic fiction clichés by borrowing some from "2001: A Space Odyssey" and the sci-fi indie "Moon." It fixes squarely on its main character, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), which is simultaneously a strength and a point of weakness, but most importantly prevents it from getting too emotionally hollow.The key is that "Oblivion" successfully deceives its audience and keeps things mysterious and exciting for two hours, even if its very nature demands a lot of skeptical questions.Harper is a drone repairman in 2077, 60 years after Earth was ravaged due to an alien attack on the moon. Drones keep an eye out for stranded aliens attempting to spoil humanity's last-ditch effort to harvest ocean water so life can continue on one of Saturn's moons. Jack lives with his partner in life and work, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), but he dreams of another woman (Olga Kurylenko) and the past in New York City, which he cannot understand because that was before he was born. When he discovers the woman in his dreams in a crash-landed pod on Earth's surface, it unleashes a whole set of questions.Buying into the film and this story turns out to be pretty easy thanks to Kosinski's pristine direction, and the poetic voice-over narration throughout ups this film to above-average sci-fi movie intelligence. A strong artistic vision and an intriguing story are pivotal in any movie that's part of a genre so steeped in suspension of disbelief; "Oblivion" has those hooks firmly in place.Any sci-fi film involving a comprehensive context/backstory will draw plot hole or logic skeptics like a wake of hungry buzzards, and "Oblivion" compounds those issues with its plot twists and an ending that seems far more simple than the rest of the film. The satisfaction of the result doesn't have to be connected to the excitement of watching it unfold and there's a definite difference in this instance.The actual issue is that all the time spent on exposition, explanation and Jack's character doesn't leave too much room for the rest of the cast. Morgan Freeman's role as a leader of a group of survivors doesn't have as much weight as the script would like to believe it does and his right hand, played by Nickolaj Coaster-Waldau amounts to nothing more than a moment of "whoa, it's Jaime Lannister!" The script doesn't satisfy our curiosity to understand them and learn more about them. We care way more about what happens to Jack.A few shallower areas, however, are no indicator of a hollow core. "Oblivion" is far more than just visual flair and a pulsing contemporary score. It has a discernible heartbeat and does some original and exciting things within the sci-fi genre, which is never easy.
If you're familiar with Charlie Kaufman's work, then you understand that "Synecdoche, New York" is going to tell a story that's abstract, that feels normal but is completely out of the ordinary, and rarely feel like it's making sense. Now that he's directing his own film this time, Kaufman, the brilliant but challenging writer behind "Being John Malkovich" and "Adaptation," has creative control to create yet another layer of bizarre, making this film even harder to understand in one sitting. The truth is that "Synecdoche" is a fascinating movie for the small (and ever-shrinking) club of people who like watching movies they don't understand so that they can try and understand them. Anyone who tries hard enough can begin to break down the ideas generating this story, but it's not a film for the passive viewer who wants a traditional story told in a conventional way.The film is about the life of Caden Cotard (Hoffman), an apparently ill middle-aged director who is married and has a six-year-old child that leave him. Feeling lonely and believing he's dying, he receives a grant to work on a play and giant warehouse to stage it in, and he decides he is going to create something that will attempt to make sense of life, namely his, as well as love and death. The combination of his own delusions and the absurdity of that feat -- to create the ultimate work of art accurately reflecting life -- is a good portion of what makes this film so unfathomable yet so fascinating.Left emotionally blindsided by his wife (Catherine Keener), Caden is surrounded by the temptations of the other women he works with (there's not but one male supporting actor) such as the box office secretary who has always loved him (Samantha Morton) and the star of his last production (Michelle Williams), Caden can't make sense of his feelings and uses his art to do it. He does so for years upon years, time jumping forward at strange intervals, revealing more of who Caden really is.Kaufman is all about the visual manifestation of thoughts and ideas, which make his film so abstract. As a director, he does a very nice job of making the film seem like it happens in a natural way despite its absurdities. His scenes are very short and move quickly and there's no map guiding you or leash to pull you along. It's frustrating and deprives you of ever having a truly deep and satisfactory "aha" moment, but it also gives you free reign to take from it what you will, even if some parts left you dumbstruck."Synecdoche" is a film about the life of a man trying to make a play of his life of him making a play of his life -- to give you a sense of what you're up against watching this film. In that way it is both astute and ultimately meaningless, but unquestionably heartfelt and honest. Kaufman doesn't do this to win creativity points, he does it to find unique ways of exploring and understanding the traditional themes of love and mortality in the hopes of coming across something truly profound. It's exactly what Caden tries to do. Making complete sense of life is futile, but making a concerted effort is art. ~Steven CVisit my site: http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Twisting history can be amusing and in some cases even insightful. Seth Grahame-Smith aimed for both with his book, "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," but his film version doesn't exactly achieve the balancing act. Understandably, history takes a back seat in "Vampire Hunter," but rather than go with a Gothic action approach to the vampire side of things, 20th Century Fox hired Timur Bekmambetov, who employs his hyper-stylized technique, which renders the film into a truly schizophrenic affair. It's a gritty revenge tale mixed with campy horror and philosophical undertones about freedom.Newcomer Benjamin Walker was an excellent choice to play Lincoln, and had he been cast in a non-fiction biopic, he would've excelled. He makes a downright convincing older Lincoln, the president/man we know him as, but obviously, that's not the focal point of "Vampire Hunter." Still, Walker's not so bad with an axe. He will remind many of Liam Neeson, an actor capable of both action and drama, who had this been 15-20 years ago, would've been a great fit for the part.The core of this version of Lincoln is defined by the death of Lincoln's parents at the hand of vampires. After saving his childhood friend (Anthony Mackie) from abuse, Lincoln unknowingly got his dad mixed up with a vampire. When that vampire claims his parents' lives, he grows up seeking revenge but knows not what he is getting himself into. With the help of another vampire hunter named Henry (Dominic Cooper), Abe trains himself with an axe to become a vampire hunter and dedicates himself to the profession despite being purely motivated by revenge.Lincoln would rather moonlight as a slayer of the undead, however, and can't help but fall for a local girl in Springfield named Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and pursue other ambitions, namely studying to be a lawyer and flirting with the idea of politics. But delivering rousing speeches and slaying vampires is a tough balancing act that costs him dearly.And that problem is mirrored by the film. With its priorities on telling the vampire side of Lincoln's life, it glazes over everything else in terms of motivation and ambition. We are to go entirely off of what we know about Lincoln from the real books, which ends up to be a big mistake on Grahame-Smith's part in his screenplay. Although he is mindful of the real Lincoln and cleverly twists the real timeline to fit his vampire mythology, when the film fast-forwards to older Lincoln in the final act, we have no real sense of the character and how he has internally been able to reconcile his public and private lives.It sounds like that's asking too much of a film called "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," and in a sense that's true. As he did with "Wanted," Bekmambetov delivers action and gore that will smack a stupid grin on your face whether you like it or not. It would just be nice if there was a little more effort put into linking the different element of the story in a more cohesive manner. Doing so would've at least enhanced the stakes of the plot, which won't elicit any kind of emotion."Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" doesn't take itself too seriously, but it overestimates how much its audience will appreciate its rhetoric as found in the narration. The idea of how history remembers events a specific way and leaves out certain details about the sacrifice involved is quite valid, but amidst the slow-motion baton twirling of an axe, it only has so much of an impact.Bekmambetov's reliance on digital effects also ruins how effective the movie can be, as much as it does make it "cool" at times. Films set in the 1800s usually don't have this problem, but it is here. The style of the action is clearly valued over the style that would best suit the film as a whole. Even then, the budget allows for only a mediocre use of CGI at best, or at least that's the impressive some of the effects shots give off. In today's blockbuster market, you ca't ever afford to look cheap, and "Vampire Hunter" includes too many cheap-looking effects shots. Some sequences benefit from a cartoony quality, but most don't.Butchering history (even literally) shouldn't automatically discredit how seriously a film should be taken, but the decision to take factual liberties should at least be based in some creative justification. The mere concept of "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" seems like enough to warrant creative freedom, but the film just doesn't capture that spirit the way you hope something so absurd-sounding would.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Few classic era film directors did comedy better than Frank Capra, if any. The over-the-top ridiculous dark comedy farce "Arsenic and Old Lace" is not the three-time Oscar winner's usual cup of tea (there's an inherent lack of romance), but he captures the adaptation of the play with a sense of humor that's critical for a story so ridiculous.Having seen the play myself, admittedly the comic twists and sheer outrageousness of some of the characters was less effective upon a second viewing, but it doesn't detract from comprehending the comic genius of Joseph Kesselring's original script. The moral of the story is that everyone's crazy. Period."Arsenic" takes place in one afternoon and night in Brooklyn, where esteemed theatre critic and self-proclaimed marriage-hater Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) has taken refuge with his dear old aunts before taking off on his honeymoon with Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane), a fact he's publicly ashamed of. Not long into his stay, however, he discovers both sweet Aunt Abby (Josephine Hull) and Aunt Martha (Jean Adair) are in fact mercy killers who poison lonely old men without families and homes and bury them in the basement with the aid of Mortimer's delusional brother, Teddy, who believes he's Teddy Roosevelt. In an effort to sort it all out, Mortimer drives himself practically insane.I've never had a bad thing to say about him, but this is a fine piece of total overacting by Grant. Part of it is the charm story and Capra's vision to acknowledge its absurdity, but from his first discovery of the body in the window seat, Grant is up and over-the-top. It takes a bit away from the momentum, neglecting a steady accumulation of craziness, even if that's not the film's intention. Grant is much better in charming romantic roles and not as an all- out comedian, but he has some quality moments.Capra's creativity was no doubt limited by the confines of the story. It almost entirely takes place inside the Brewster home (convenient for the play, just not the movie). The Epsteins' adaptation takes some liberties where possible, but it's merely wiggle-room. The director leaves his mark in moments when the story hits a peak in terms of the physical humor. He also films some comically dark scenes when Mortimer's loony brother Jonathan (Raymond Massey) returns with his accomplice Dr. Einstein (wonderful character actor Peter Lorre). Those two actors add more dimension to their performances which helps the film be taken a tad more seriously.Amidst the chaos, however, "Arsenic and Old Lace" has a truthful ring to it. Sanity is a relative attribute and we should be so lucky as to possess it in the slightest bit. "Arsenic" doesn't feel like some of the '30s and '40s classics before it, but it's great fun and a real laugh. Who says every film has to be totally sane and by-the-book?~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
You might never suspect a relationship between horror and comedy  which means you've never seen a Sam Raimi horror film. Although some of us have drawn a line in the sand between the two genres, those who haven't will appreciate if not love "The Evil Dead." Raimi recognizes that horror is kind of an absurd genre in itself and that our capacity to fear and to laugh exist on the same spectrum. If you let yourself experience both on the wacky 85- minute ride that is "Evil Dead," you're bound to appreciate the way he plays with both.Undoubtedly inspired by "Night of the Living Dead," the film centers on five young adults who decide to stay at a cabin (arguably a shack) for a weekend in the middle of nowhere Tennessee. After experiencing some strange activity they come upon a book and a recording of a man reading incantations from it. These incantations awaken flesh-possessing spirits that live in the woods.Rather than an "us against them" horror film where a group of people have to avoid getting picked off one by one at the hands of something(s), the film takes more of the zombie angle with characters "turning" into evil undead creatures. The cast is also small, so the events are character-focuses and more intense. Bruce Campbell leads the way as Ash. There's no real way to describe Ash, except he's more of a softie for a leading character.Part of the great/annoying part about "Evil Dead" is how the main characters never act like you want them to. You want to scream at them to hurry up and grab something that can be used as a weapon and pound the crap out of the possessed undead people. Because the characters are a bit hollow and we've been exposed to films like this before, we have no sympathy when a good character turns. They need to die and die fast, but the characters remain hesitant because technically these possessed gnarly creatures are their friends. Consequently, Ash is a dumb sucker that probably deserves to die with everyone else in the cabin.That said, there's an odd pleasure in that kind of psychological toying with our minds. Raimi executes horror with strong build up and off-the-wall payoff. We writhe until the last second and then the zombie guts hit the fan time and time again. And he never completely lets go of the leash; everything goes back down to an eerie calm and builds back up again until the climactic scene. Although for all intents and purpose "Evil Dead" is a camp-fest, that technique suggests Raimi's interest lies in keeping us spooked.All things considered, any film that can depict a woman being "raped by the woods" (yes, the collective entity of "the woods") that still manages to leave a good lasting impression deserves its cult-classic status.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
It's hard to remember that "The Wrestler" isn't actually about Mickey Rourke. Not only is that testament to the performance that Rourke gives, but to his perfect casting in the part. Someone looking to resurrect his career, Rourke is the best choice for Randy "The Ram" Robinson, a former pro-wrestling star whose decides to end his washed up career and find life outside of wrestling. So it's not so coincidental when Randy tells Marissa Tomei's character that "the 90s sucked." It couldn't be truer for Rourke. Creator Darren Aronofsky was right to argue for him--this film would have been a footnote in independent film-making with Nicholas Cage in the lead. Instead, "The Wrestler" achieves an incredibly life-like, documentary style status that speaks way more to one man's personal journey through the eyes of Rourke.The film is not so foreign in nature--it's a story about an aging once-famous professional wrestler and how age and reality catches up to him. We've seen this story in other forms, but it takes on a visceral and often times gruesome reality in the form of a pro wrestler. We all come to grips with sacrificing part of what it is we do, but for someone that routinely takes steroids and beats himself up, it's much more extreme and provides a unique visual storytelling opportunity.Aronofsky ("Requiem for a Dream") shows that his domain is not just the abstract and doing visually interesting things with a camera. The film's documentary shooting style is so convincing that you often times forget there was a lot of creative energy going into the story. Aronofsky carefully plans how to make his shots not look too carefully planned. It seems pretty simple, but in reality I can't imagine it was easy to ignore the impulse to do certain traditional shots and instead find a way to film the scene in a less Hollywood-like fashion.Rourke really helps sell the documentary style. His performance is not over-dramatic at all. With the exception of one critical turning point scene in the film, his acting is reserved and completely convincing. You never once see a man trying to be a wrestler, you see a wrestler. It's easy to mistake that kind of performance for being just okay when in reality it's amazing. Rourke will likely never play a better role in his life and it comes just when he needs it.Supporting actresses Tomei, Randy's stripper love interest, and Evan Rachel Wood, Randy's daughter that he tries to reconnect with, are also strong. Maybe Tomei has finally reached the apex of portraying promiscuous or a-moral characters. I think this role shows that she can hold her own even with her clothes on. Wood ("Across the Universe") has me convinced that she will be a top actress of her generation. She's just a big role or two away."The Wrester" resonates as a movie exactly about what the title suggests. It's a simple but elegant story of how a wrestler, well, wrestles with retirement and what happens when someone creates an identity like that, that strong of a false persona, and tries to redefine it after twenty-some years. Much like its film-making, "The Wrester" is a simple, effective and amazingly realistic film. While Aronofsky didn't get the Oscar credit, his resume certainly would lead anyone to believe that he will get his due if he chooses the right project.
Documentaries have always been most closely linked with investigative journalism, in seeking truth through the lens of a camera. "Man on Wire" seeks a greater a truth by telling a story so miraculous yet so simple that the mind is captivated by it. The sheer will of French tightrope walker Philippe Petit to walk the Twin Towers in 1974 is a feat that awakens the possibilities in all of us.Filmmaker James Marsh has found not only a thrilling subject for a documentary, but a terrific character to focus on. The language and story-telling ability of Petit (in a second language, no less) is fantastic. He is vivid in his word choices and provides these great almost literary details that Marsh is able to use to film some excellent recreations of the event, specifically Petit and his crew sneaking into the World Trade Center.Petit has such great perspective on himself and his actions and desires. He speaks of knowing dreams before they were even realities, of the line between the possible and impossible. He decorates this story in ways most outsiders might not think about it. Through his insights, the amazement of his work shines through.The life and death and the thrill of the tightrope walk scares us but intrigues us and the effect was hundred-fold for Petit. There were no questions of feasibility, only try and try harder, and it's impressive that he inspired so many of his friends and other strangers to get behind him regardless the risks.This was a crime of passion, not in the sense that he passionately committed crime, but that his passion happened to be a crime. Petit shows us that art and achieving a moment of greatness has more authority than the laws of society. Few will ever compare the highs of their lifetime to the highs (both literal and figurative) of Philippe Petit's. "Man on Wire" is a celebration of the human spirit and the power of dreams, insisting that true happiness is found from within. The story here really tells itself and Marsh just glues all this old footage, re-creations and interviews together to make it happen. Petit is fascinating and his story will make you think differently in at least one way
The martial arts showcase movie, completely pure and unapologetic, has become a lost genre it seems. If nothing else, director Gareth Evans uses "The Raid: Redemption" to bring pencak silat to audiences all over the world in this manner, but he also manages to create an action movie that satisfyingly merges B-movie violence with a true physical art form.The story of "The Raid" is neatly packed and delivered in a way that puts the emphasis on the characters and the action. A SWAT team is ordered to take out a crime/drug lord (Ray Sahetapy) in his 15-plus story building filled with dangerous and skilled men who are fiercely loyal to him. When they become trapped on the seventh floor, it becomes a fight for survival. One rookie cop in particular (Iko Uwais) must try to escape to return home to his wife and unborn child.Some twists reveal themselves along the way, but because of the contained nature of this story, they're pleasant surprises rather than forced and obvious. Boiled down, "The Raid" is a glorified arcade game premise. The finished product turns out to be bloody mayhem on screen.Evans somehow manages to strike a balance between fearful realism and over-the-top video- game violence. Larger action sequences take the shape of the latter, but the film takes numerous occasions to slow down and work the suspense so that the bigger, ultra- choreographed action feels like a culmination or climax. A scene where our hero, Rama, hides with his injured comrade in an apartment wall is of particular note on the more suspenseful side of things. The script recognizes that too much of one kind of action will kill the effectiveness of the entire product.The fight scenes are more creative toward the front of the film and sort of unravel into pure pencak silat choreography toward the end, namely because all the weapons have run out of ammo and all the knives buried into peoples' chests, necks, knees, etc. Perpetuating the video game analogy, much of the fights feel like stages/missions as well as mini-bosses, etc. If you enjoy that structure in gaming, "The Raid" will hit that same spot in a satisfying way.But what really makes "The Raid" work, or at least go beyond a lifeless and gory demonstration of Indonesian martial arts, is how the script works in subplots. Some characters are given moral ambiguity, some pure motivation ... basically, effort was taken with the writing to up the stakes of the mayhem. It might not be great writing or even that original, but it will motivate most people to root for Rama and against a myriad of thugs and other characters.It might be tough for Evans to replicate the success of the film with future outings now that pencak silat has more exposure and will consequently feel less novel, but "The Raid" offers a pleasant martial arts throwback mixed with a more contemporary violent action style that will work for anyone who identifies as an old-school action purist.~Steven CThanks for reading!

His last British film before making the jump to Hollywood, the great Alfred Hitchcock's "The Lady Vanishes" captures much of what made the filmmaker so iconic, yet it doesn't hold up as well against his best films of the '40s and '50s.Suspense in "The Lady Vanishes" should be a term used loosely. The story's main conceit is classic Hitchcock paranoia, but in its most simplistic form. Margaret Lockwood stars as Iris, a young woman who boards a train home from the fictional European country of Bandrika. She's tended to by a woman in her car named Miss Froy (Dame May Witty), but after a long nap wakes to find that she has disappeared and everyone on the train denies having ever seen her.It takes a good 30 minutes, however, before this all plays out, as the story begins in a Bandrika hotel so as to introduce its many characters in superfluous fashion. This beginning turns out to be somewhat comical, which isn't Hitchcock's strong suit. Trains, however, are his wheelhouse, and "The Lady Vanishes" gets substantially better at that point, even if it never takes on a darker, more menacing tone.Lockwood and costar Michael Redgrave help sell the whole mystery. Redgrave plays Gilbert, the cheeky musician Iris had a most disagreeable meeting with the night before in the hotel. Gilbert takes to believing that Iris isn't seeing things, though largely because he fancies her. Together they endeavor to figure out what's happened to Miss Froy and in doing so contend with all kinds of unusual circumstances.Yet the mystery won't have many people second guessing themselves. After all, when Iris first questions the many folks on the train, both the adulterous "Mrs." Todhunter (Linden Travers) and friends Caldicott (Naunton Wayne) and Charters (Basil Radford) lie about having seen her, the former to hide her affair and the latter to make sure they make it on time for a cricket match. There's a little social commentary there, but the script never pushes it.So unlike other Hitchcock protagonists, we don't empathize with the main character's paranoia so much as simply observe it. Nevertheless, other than a few obvious clues that point us in the right direction, we're playing Sherlock and Watson right along with Iris and Gilbert.The reveal is also a little less-than-satisfying, as it happens in such a matter-of-fact way and with plenty of time left in the film. Rather than keep us guessing to the end, the story puts all but one card down with 20-30 minutes left and then leans on putting the main characters in peril as its primary entertainment device. It all culminates in a less-than-stellar shootout and the film's final reveal, which is somewhat anti-climactic.It feels as though Hitchcock could have done more to put his stamp on the film. He has a couple sudden shots of disembodied hands coming from out of nowhere to up the action as well as one truly trademark sequence in which Iris imagines everyone in her train car as Miss Froy. They're all such creepy-looking folks to boot, so that amplifies the effect. Still, taking place on a train ends up the prime indicator that it's a Hitchcock film.There should be little question, however, that the little Hitchcock does do elevates "The Lady Vanishes" to classic status. Given the complexity of his later thrillers and other contemporary entries, it loses a bit of luster, but "The Lady Vanishes" still represents textbook filmmaking technique for the genre.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"The Two Towers" continues J.R.R. Tolkien's epic as interpreted by Peter Jackson, and though it lacks the same degree of suspense as "The Fellowship of the Ring," it delivers when it matters in the first culminating battle sequence of the series.In "The Two Towers," the Fellowship has been disbanded following the death of Boromir (Sean Bean). Having bent the great wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) toward his will, Sauron now has armies in both Mordor and at Isengard (the two towers). Saruman's army of Uruk Hai have turned their attention to the kingdom of Rohan, where Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) venture. Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) set out for Mordor on their own, though they quickly find themselves with another companion, the creature Gollum, who lusts after the Ring that once was his.The script for this middle installment involves a lot of setup and building toward the climax: the Battle of Helm's Deep. Given the rich texture and detail of Jackson's Middle Earth, we are swept up and intrigued by the new characters and locations rather than bogged down by them. The subplot of the catatonic King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and the treacherous Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) makes for great theater though it complicates matters, as does all the focus on Theoden's niece, Eowyn (Miranda Otto), who becomes quite fond of Aragorn despite knowing his heart belongs to another.With the Fellowship divided, the narrative must bounce around and entire characters become left out for what seem like hours. The one weak limb of the story that we come back to time and time again that really sticks out in a negative way is the subplot with Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who have been rescued from a band of Uruk Hai by the great Treebeard, leader of the Ents. The film cuts back numerous times to the two hobbits riding on Treebeard's back as he slowly delivers exposition and back story, and the scenes are few and far between, so they really make the length of the film stand out in a negative way.All is cured, however, at Helm's Deep. This is the major action payoff we've been waiting for since the opening prologue in "Fellowship," the first major arrival point in the series, one that the script foreshadows hours before the battle begins. The people of Rohan have retreated to their refuge hoping that the fortress's high walls will allow their few hundred to pull off a miracle against the thousands of Uruk Hai. It's a classic Greek mythology setup and the payoff makes Helm's Deep the most rewarding sequence in the series thus far.But what makes "Two Towers" great is not just the spectacle in the end; we also get even deeper into our cast of characters. The film really explores the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen (Liv Tyler) and their likely ill-fated romance. Although they're mostly comic relief, we become closer with Gimli and Legolas through greater use of humorous dialogue.The acting standouts of the film, however, are once again Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf the White, given a renewed life for the purpose of saving Middle Earth, and Andy Serkis as the motion-captured schizophrenic creature, Gollum/Smeagol. McKellen continues to draw so much attention to his character and the 100 percent pure gravitas he brings to the role cannot be over-appreciated. Adorned in white and given greater power this time around, he literally sparkles.Gollum is a curious character who carves out a pivotal role in the series in just a few hours after hints at his relationship with the Ring. The character's voice and mannerisms could drive a viewer insane, but he's such a technological breakthrough and Serkis gives the pitiable and ugly thing legitimate complexity. Whether Frodo and Sam can trust him becomes a huge piece of this movie, and ultimately it becomes about whether or not we trust him. Frodo believes that Gollum is capable of doing the right thing and that he's their only chance to make it to Mordor, whereas Sam is ever the skeptic. This thread of doubt runs through the entire Frodo- Sam-Gollum subplot. In the end, once again the script uses such moving dialogue delivered by actors so fiercely committed to their characters' emotions to really cap off "The Two Towers" in a way that will have you forgetting how long it took to get to this point and eagerly awaiting the final chapter. Sam's speech to Frodo in the end is nothing short of inspiring, capturing where the narrative is from an emotional and thematic standpoint. All the characters by the end of "Two Towers" have passed the point of no return; they've stared down certain annihilation and come to the conclusion that they are too far committed to their responsibilities to not be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. The notion that the "storm is coming" foreshadows the Battle of Helm's Deep, but it's really about what lies beyond. Hope is the unspoken theme in play  they all have to believe in it.Bridging the first and last chapters makes "Two Towers" the weakest of the series, but it's also among the most memorable for its stirring conclusion and rousing segue into "The Return of the King." Having had first exposure to this incredible cinematic vision for Middle Earth, it can be easy to forget the incredible production value, but that has to be noted and assures this second "Lord of the Rings" film a certain baseline of absolute excellence.~Steven CThanks for reading!

When a film series or trilogy receives as impeccable a treatment a J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings," its nearly impossible for its grand finale to falter. Such is the case of "The Return of the King," an absolutely colossal conclusion to Peter Jackson's epic vision.Considering a majority of "Return of the King" is payoff for being patient in the previous two chapters, the film is the most fun of the three and the biggest crowd pleaser. If you loved the previous films, you can't not love this one more. It's not necessarily that the film is better. Rather, it's so tonally and structurally consistent with the other films that by virtue of being the end, it stands out as an incredible experience, hence its winning of the Oscar for Best Picture.After the Battle of Helm's Deep and the defeat of Isengard, the armies of Mordor move on Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith. With King Theoden (Bernard Hill) of Rohan wary of giving all his muscle to the men of Gondor, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) ride there to convince the steward of Gondor, Denethor (John Noble), the mourning father of Boromir, to extend his hand to Rohan and in effect, to Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) heir to the throne and rightful king of Gondor, a title the ranger struggles with.The War of the Ring is something to behold, even though it's interrupted by Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam's (Sean Astin) quest to cast the Ring back into the fires of Mt. Doom. Rather than having the forces of Sauron and the armies of Gondor and Rohan clash in a tense battle in which the victor remains unclear, the story sets the battle up to have two extreme sides, namely that we spend a majority of the battle scenes watching Minas Tirith get torn to pieces wondering how good can possibly triumph.On the other end, we know that Gollum (Andy Serkis) has plans to betray Frodo and Sam in order to repossess his one and only Precious. The debate between the two hobbits on whether Gollum can be trusted reaches its zenith in a heartbreaking way seeing as we are aware of Gollum's intentions, and by this point, with the Ring reaching Mordor, it calls out for its master and consequently has a horrible effect on Frodo.The story pushes certain failure to the brink in both the War of the Ring and in Frodo and Sam's quest to destroy the Ring, and it's easy enough to buy every ounce of it despite knowing it can't possibly end in a horrible way. That's testament to the power of the storytelling going on here.How "Return of the King" really one ups "The Two Towers" is that it doesn't feel as though its bouncing around nearly as much between the different story lines even though it is. The momentum of the impending battle and Frodo and Sam inching closer and closer to Mt. Doom keep things on edge and driving forward at all times. No scene feels obligatory or like its stalling, and even some creative scene juxtaposition such as Pippin singing to Denethor as Faramir charges into battle only makes the script appear even stronger.From an action and visual spectacle standpoint, "Return of the King" completely outdoes the previous chapters. A battle sequence in which Legolas (Orlando Bloom) takes down an entire oliphant on his own sums up the quality of the film in the most basic entertainment sense. Even with all the doom and gloom, there's still plenty of humor in this one as well.The resolution of the many subplots also helps to improve the overall quality of "Two Towers" in the context of the trilogy just by providing payoff to all the story lines that film built yet to which it gave no resolution. Everything that Eowyn (Miranda Otto) does in "Two Towers" feel for naught by the end of that film, but she gets her shining moment in "Return of the King" that brings her character full circle. "Return of the King" works well on its own, but it also proves that "The Lord of the Rings" was meant to be watched together as a trilogy, as lots of small details in the first two films pay bigger dividends in the finale. Jackson certainly proved why the entire trilogy needed to be filmed together as a complete entity; you couldn't just hold off on the rest of the series if "The Fellowship of the Ring" didn't pan out financially.The emotional payoff of the film is testament to the work on all ends of production, for everything from the script to the on-screen talent to the set decorators to the sound designers creates the aura of authenticity that makes this fantasy feel so real and convincing, while also pulling us along on an emotional journey in which we feel so heavily invested by the time Frodo and Sam reach the summit of Mt. Doom. As with their journey in the story, once you've gone this far as a viewer, you're incredibly committed to the outcome, and what an outcome. Bravo.~Steven CThanks for reading!

As sports fans, we always consider the degree to which we support or dedicate ourselves to the team. "Big Fan" is a character study of a man who has formed his identity and life around the New York Giants. The film preys on our expectation that every fan has a clear line when it's time to stop being a fan and start being your own person. That's not true of Paul Aufiero (Patton Oswalt).The concept of building a film around this type of character allows "Big Fan" to explore the notion of sports psychosis. Writer, director and former Onion editor-in-chief Robert D. Siegel clearly understands that sports films haven't gone in this direction and he already demonstrated the chops to handle unique sports-devoted characters in creating Randy "The Ram" Robinson of Darren Aronofsky's "The Wrestler." In "Fan," his directorial debut, too much of good film convention is sacrificed to create Paul's psychological profile.The best way to describe Siegel's error with the film is that it never goes straight down the path carved out by the set-up. Paul works a job as a parking lot attendant, but off the clock (and back home with his mother) he calls in regularly to his favorite nighttime sports radio program to defend the Giants and talk smack about the Philadelphia Eagles. His favorite player is a defensive lineman named Quantrell Bishop, so instinctively when glimpsing Bishop at a gas station, Paul and his best friend follow him. He ends up at a nightclub and when Bishop suspects him of stalking, he pummels him within an inch of his life.The expectation is that the film will skyrocket from there. The press are sure to be busting down his door, the police will be on his case, etc. The aftermath is much tamer. The press apparently don't even have his name and on three separate occasions, a detective comes to question him only for Paul to say he "doesn't remember" when the truth is he wants Bishop back on the field so that the Giants can continue pursuing the division championship. The movie never really picks up in pace and disappoints in that regard.It's also hard to cozy up to Paul's mindset. Most people wouldn't let even their sports hero walk away if he nearly killed them, at least not without some kind of apology or settlement. He just wants to go back to being an average Giants fan. That's all he wants in this film. He doesn't want to live on his own, get a real job or make millions in a personal injury suit that his brother wants him to file. There's not having traditional values and denouncing the life that your family wants you to lead, but then there's Paul -- an intriguing but fallible concept.The biggest sin of Siegel's story is how it veers away from being about either rectification of the assault or how Paul's life is being forced in a direction he can't cope with as a result. Instead it's about getting back at the Eagles fan (Michael Rapaport) who calls in to Paul's favorite show and trash-talks. Sure, Siegel's point is to show how Paul wants to be a devoted fan above anything else in his life, but in route to telling us that, a lot of basic storytelling principles are violated and for a plot of this magnitude, "Big Fan" is strangely quiet.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Pulp flicks can sometimes get a bit too ahead of themselves. Sometimes all you need is a hobo, a shotgun and a twisted sense of justice.Rutger Hauer stars in "Hobo with a Shotgun," the second film after "Machete" to be derived from a fake trailer created for the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino double-feature "Grindhouse." Although the Hobo and that dangerous Mexican share revenge from the same cold plate, Jason Eisener does decidedly more with decidedly less.Beneath the bulky jacket and hobo stench lies something somehow untainted. When most exploitation flicks get down to the dramatic side  if they ever get that far  usually flop. Most viewers would prefer the Hobo waste no time getting to that shotgun, but Hauer hints at a depth to that vigilante justice. No matter how hypocritical he might actually be, he's darn convincing and dare I say poignant.The film takes place in what was once called Hope Town but has since become "F*** Town." The streets are full of bums, druggies, prostitutes and corruption of all kinds. The Hobo hops off the train to find the town in this state and cannot sit idly by. After trying to intervene with the mistreatment of a whore (Molly Dunsworth), the Hobo learns the hard way that a mob boss named "The Drake" (Brian Downey) runs things in this town with his two dopey and perverted sons.Credit to Eisener and co-writers John Davies and Rob Cotterill for taking their time building the proper motivation, which feels odd to say as screen writing almost never warrants praise in a film of this kind. Yet when our Hobo must choose between purchasing a lawn mower to start his landscaping business or pulling that shotgun off the shelf to help "clean" the streets, the decision makes sense  kill or be killed. The Hobo metes justice "one shell at a time" and to the delight of gore fans everywhere.The blood flows here as sure as the one-liners do, which makes "Hobo" a true child of the neo-grindhouse movement. Most admirably, the gore goes unexpected places; our heroes, for example, see their fair share of personal injury and beyond the extent to which most protagonists must stare down fate. Plus, despite the mercilessly foul lines delivered prior to most executions, there's actually some strangely thoughtful dialogue, such as the Hobo's little monologue to the newborns in the maternity ward of the local hospital. It's funny, but it's also kind of got a point  even hobos were innocent little babies once."Hobo with a Shotgun" adds just enough bite to its bark, whereas most of its brothers and sisters simply make noise. Somehow Eisener manages to weave all the cliché exploitation elements into something all too easy to enjoy.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
No man is an island -- but no film is either. The proverbial happy bachelor who is set in his ways is bound to succumb to the temptations of togetherness and love as he does in every film. "About a Boy" does not defy this classic character profile, but neither does it slosh around in clichéd fashion. Hugh Grant's charms and his surrounding cast of unusuals played by fine actors add just enough color to Nick Hornby's touching family story to appear fresh and even revelatory.Grant plays Will, a ladies' man living off royalties from his father's one hit Christmas song who decides to up his game by pretending to be a single parent and going after lonely, confused single moms. This leads him by a stroke of fate to Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), a pre- pubescent boy whose mother attempts suicide their very first day acquainted with each other. Marcus has surprising amount of self-determination for his age and Hoult gives him maturity beyond his years. Before long (but not without some persistence from Marcus), the two form an odd friendship. Marcus needs a distraction from his emotionally shaky home life and Will find unintentionally that Marcus gives him some purpose and direction.The two will redefine relationships for anyone viewing this film. The proper classification for them would be ambiguous. Will is a father figure to Marcus, but he's also the closest thing Marcus has to a friend as the kids at school have shunned him socially because he's odd, small and breaks out into song unbeknownst to himself on occasion. That said, Will doesn't do any actual things for Marcus, but his presence and attention does wonders.Will's destiny is set from here on out. It's only a matter to what extent he will discover the need for human connection in life, or as Marcus puts in in voice over, having more than just one other person. The script poignantly explores the notion of fulfilling self needs versus fulfilling those of others, while also carefully pointing out that these needs are intricately interconnected.The film is an impressive departure for brothers Paul and Chris Weitz, who co-wrote "The Nutty Professor II" and directed "American Pie." Teamed with "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" scribe Peter Hedges, the adaptation takes shape nicely. Perhaps they're light on building Grant's character into a truly independent person, but it's easier to like him this way. Better he not be a jerk, which would hurt the plausibility of Marcus looking up to him.As is true of Hornby's work, music is central, and it's especially prominent in "Boy." The key turning point revolved around a performance of Roberta Flack's "Killing Me Softly" and the soundtrack from Badly Drawn Boy creates a distinct mood. The power of song as self- expression is equally important, as music creates connections between people that are intangible.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
In the wake of World War II, Alfred Hitchcock brought audiences "Notorious," a romantic thriller with political undertones. To audiences of the era, I'm sure it was slightly scandalous. Not only in its dealing with Germans living in Brazil post-WWII and handling uranium, but also with its co-stars Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman kissing on and off for an extremely long take. It's safe to say that was particularly sensual for film in 1946, but for modern viewers, their love affair seems almost childish and unfounded. The one aspect of this film that has not withered over the last 60-some years, however, is the immaculate direction of Sir Alfred Hitchcock.Hitchcock is not only a master of suspense in "Notorious," but also of grace and creativity. His every directorial choice is inspired and brilliant, creating every emotion and audience reaction he could've possibly intended. From his elegant zoom-ins on a memorable key to his object-focused transitions such as bottles of wine, Hitchcock is what makes this film truly great. Writer Ben Hecht has certainly crafted a screenplay of carefully placed tension and brilliant turns of events, but it's Hitchcock telling this story through the details that makes it a classic. Grant and Bergman star as two people with a mission who fall for each other. He's a government agent in charge of persuading her, the daughter of a German-born traitor who's just been imprisoned, to go undercover in Rio. She must use her womanly wiles to gain access to the house of one of her father's old acquaintances who has always had feelings for her. Tension between the two lovers rises when she marries him for the sake of the operation.The romantic aspect of the film is definitely weak by modern standards. It's got a juicy old- world feel that when things get tough for them, acts like it's a whole lot more intense than it is. Grant and Bergman, however, do their part to charm the audience into going with it. Once you get over the hump that they've starting taking themselves way to seriously too soon, it becomes an intriguing part of the film.As a thriller, after the first 45 minutes the film starts to pick up. Hecht and Hitchcock hold the film's only secret over your head for as long as they can to keep your attention and it pays off. There's something just classically suspenseful about our heroes trying to gain access to the restricted cellar at a party, but if the party runs out of champagne, they'll get caught. Hitchcock keeps showing the number of bottles in the cooler diminishing and the tension builds. Classic technique and there's nothing stale about it.The political edge has also kind of worn down on this film. I can imagine that would feel like a bigger deal right after WWII, but today the undertones are too subtle to come across the viewer completely. Hecht's storytelling, however, premise aside, is superb. Ultimately, even if the romance is a bit out there and the magnitude of the situation diminished over the years Hitchcock and "Notorious" have you hooked, as always, on what will happen next.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Sometimes a film is just so strange that you've only got an inkling of the filmmaker's intention and you have to trust that it's somehow woven together in genius fashion. That's where "Pi" lies, somewhere between the random and the perfectly calculated. Creator Darren Aronofsky appears to have run rampant in his feature debut, but one can easily argue that he's thought everything out meticulously. As a result, "Pi," will satisfy the tastes of some and completely fool others.The main character is Max Cohen, a mathematical genius with some serious issues that lead to pill-popping. He believes in the power of math as a universal language -- nature's language and that there are patterns to everything. With the help of his supercomputer, he embarks on a task to determine a pattern governing the stock market, only what he's on to - - a 216-digit strand of the numerical value of Pi -- has a lot at stake for Wall Street and even a sect of Cabalistic Hasidic Jews who believe it holds Messianic clues.If a word could describe "Pi" in both plot and it's film-making, "obsession" would be the best choice. Aronofsky's shot sequences, with repetition and attaching the camera to his actors and the choppiness of the film suggest just how crazy this matter is to both Max and those transfixed on numbers. As Max immerses himself further in the mystery, things only get more chaotic. You get the sense that Aronofsky knew exactly what he was doing, but because it's so abstract and difficult to grasp, you're not totally sure if it all works. The fact that it's filmed in black and white might also suggest the same "random pattern" idea of the film. What seems to be so clear cut is really more maddening."Pi" might just be one of those "second viewing required" films. It's a cerebral thriller and relentless at that, clearly meant for the tastes of abstract movie watchers. Nevertheless, Aronofsky demonstrates some impressive skills, ones that no doubt led to his success in cult hit "Requiem for a Dream" years later.
Not many studios around today would take a risk on a 3-hour and 45-minute epic tale taking place in a desert, and that's part of what makes "Lawrence of Arabia" such a remarkable classic. As long as it is, there's a sense of greatness as one watches the film: the camera sweeping across the desert and its majestic soundtrack pouring into your ears. There's no denying that as drawn out as the plot is, there's something powerful in every scene, whether its the beauty of the sun as it's caught on camera or the look on Peter O'Toole's face as he comes to yet another epiphany on his journey across the wilderness.O'Toole stars as TE Lawrence, a somewhat flamboyant but ambitious British soldier during World War I who is sent to Arabia where the Arabs are hoping to receive aid from the British in order to defeat parts of the Ottoman Empire. He ends up leading them successfully in a series of raids and battles and begins to suffer a conflict of allegiance between his British superiors and his Arab allies like Prince Feisal (Alec Guiness) and Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif).The film is of Lawrence's journey. He undergoes many transformations and learns many sobering lessons along the way, like the guilt of killing and even the lust for killing in addition to the fact that although he fights for Arabs, he himself is about as white as one can get. Clearly seeing that personal journey is what makes O'Toole's performance one of the all- time greatest. Most of the film is plot and its dialog either plot-oriented or intended to be quotable tidbits of wisdom. Lawrence is our only emotional access into the film and O'Toole just nails the part. The look in his soft blue eyes whether of anger, sadness or gaiety is utterly convincing. Without him this film would be flat and lifeless, no matter how exceptionally well made it is.And exceptional is one way to put it. Director David Lean chooses to keep the camera on the outside as much as possible, opting for the wide scene-setting shot whenever possible, only getting close-up if it's O'Toole's face illustrating an important point in his character's journey of understanding. It also lets the lavish sets and breathtaking locales become an important part of the story. His goal appears at times to simply overwhelm you with the majesty of the desert, much like Lawrence found it captivating despite being far from anything like home. It's not about creating an intimacy with the film; Lean wants to create awe for members of the audience and that's what big far-away pans and a long thematic score achieve.Every line of dialog in the film seems to have a poignancy. Almost like Shakespeare, there's wisdom and insight into the conflict being dropped in every line, with scenes ending on revealing and thematic ideas. Whether it's dialog building the complex portrait of Lawrence or the nature of the Middle East conflict, something of value is present nearly the entire film. The only thing missing is that women are virtually absent from the film, which in essence adds a whole other layer to it.Movies like "Lawrence" don't really get made anymore. While the occasional lengthy biopic comes up, the newer, fast-paced Hollywood simply can't handle too many of them or afford to budget over a year of on-location shooting for something so weighty. That's why "Lawrence of Arabia" is such an untouchable classic.
Four different accounts of the same story. Who to believe? No one? Everyone? The audience becomes the interrogator in Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon," a film that explores the true nature of man through his subjectivity. So simple is this concept, yet few could match Kurosawa's delivery and craft it into a masterwork like he's done.In the pouring rain, a priest and woodcutter use the remainder of a damaged gatehouse to take shelter as they reflect on a rape and murder they had just testified regarding that happened merely three days before. Another man finds their shelter and asks to hear the story so long as the rain affords them the time. The priest had seen the murdered Samurai and his wife at one point and the woodcutter found the body. At the interrogation, they heard three testimonies from those involved: a bandit named Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) who confesses to the rape and killing, the rape victim (Machiko Kyo) and the murder victim (Masayuki Mori) as heard through a medium. Although all agree that the Samurai was bound as his wife was raped and that he indeed was killed, all three of their stories differ as to how it all happened.As each testimony builds on the next, we adjust what we feel is the truth accordingly, which ultimately leaves us with a story in which truth cannot be deciphered from lies. It becomes apparently rather quickly that the meat of the story lies elsewhere and that no right answer solves the riddle.What Kurosawa does with the story, other than put the audience in the seat of having to sort out the "facts," comes out in the tone. Although the events themselves have a black-and- white nature, he thickens their haziness with an almost fairy tale-like tone. The performances of the actors, namely Mifune and Kyo, echo more traditional Japanese theatre storytelling with exaggerations and heavy (and sometimes irritating) emotions. Mifune's cackling and Kyo's wailing have a profound impact on our perception of the events despite the fact that every character's story lacks in veracity.The key to the whole thing comes later from the woodcutter, who reveals he too has a testimony he was afraid to share. Suddenly he provides a clarity (although not necessarily a truth) to the events and Eastern themes such as the protecting of one's honor seem to factor prominently in what seems likely to be made up or closer to the truth.As the priest and woodcutter wrestle with their faith in mankind in rather blunt terms, so do we attempt to insert our own views on human nature. What sets "Rashomon" apart in this eternal dialogue of man's inherent goor or evil is the component of selfishness and looking out for one's interests. It would be unfair to say that the difference in each testimony was caused by calculated lies on behalf of the person giving it. Instead, self-interest can subconsciously warp our perspective and the way we interpret what we see and experience.Kurosawa infuses this tale with an intensity few could match, striking visuals that make you feel as if you're not seeing the same story three different times with slight variations, but three completely different takes.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Brutal, savage and animalistic, George Miller's "The Road Warrior" is a much more fully developed imagining of a post-apocalyptic Australia where gasoline equals power than its predecessor, "Mad Max" a much sloppier science-fiction experiment. Seeing how it takes a big step ahead of that film, it's no surprise the studios preferred a new title and placed "Mad Max 2" more in the shadow.At the same time, however, the Mad Max series is not a fully-realized science-fiction concept. I don't think that any film that paints a picture of a bleak future for humankind can possibly do that with great meaning and understanding for the viewer in under 100 minutes, which both films are. I'm not surprised these were made 2 years apart because they rely on each other yet neither is strong enough to stand on its own ("Road Warrior" provides prologue even).Instead, "The Road Warrior" is more a stylized, gritty, vehicular action film centered around a science-fiction idea. It's an artistic imagining that shies away instead of aggressively taking on the ideas its concept suggests about mankind.The prologue summarizes that Mel Gibson is Mad Max, a former cop in a world dependent on gasoline who loses his only loved ones due to gangs involved with excessive road violence. He takes his revenge and lives a lonesome scavenger of fuel until he finds and offers help to a colony of people who are antagonized by similar gangs. Max is a mysterious character, but his coolness and complete lack of character depth is more annoying than it does to show how he's not the man he once was.I simply can't be anything more than slightly entertained by a film whose characters are hollow shells and uses minimal dialogue that does nothing but move the plot. The rest of the cast is forgettable and not worthy of mention. If Miller was trying to make a point with any of this, it doesn't work. "Road Warrior" only wins some of my approval because Miller gives it a very unique flavor. His vision is one of recycled materials and modified cars, bikes and the like that turn into demolition machines with costumes made of football pads and hockey masks (let's not forget ass-less chaps and other creepy uses of leather in the film). No film could ever really borrow any of those ideas without it being an homage to this series.I wouldn't call the action the best, but it is highly engaging and definitely unlike any car chase and explosions movie you've ever seen. The violence is much, much better than "Mad Max" and this really helps the film be serious. When people get shot a lot and die and there's no blood to show for it, nothing really sinks in. Gladly, "Road Warrior" doesn't do that. The last scene is really well shot and definitely memorable. Miller puts modern explosion master Michael Bay to shame in terms of inventive ways of exploding stuff and exaggeration of such stunts."Road Warrior" will be likable for those that can take their science-fiction dishes served cold, with unique and imaginative action. For those who need substance, "Road Warrior" does not indulge enough despite the possibilities.
Films take on an extra power when they show us something we can't seem to believe. Such is Charlize Theron's performance as "America's first female serial killer," Aileen Wuornos, in "Monster." Transformation blows us away, and to see a blond Australian bombshell become a homely bisexual prostitute-turned-murderer reminds us of the power that a performance can have on a film. Patty Jenkins' drama shouldn't come across as a character study as much as it does, but when your lead performance sucks in such an overwhelming amount of attention, it becomes all about how awestricken the audience is at that transformative turn. At the same time, Theron's performance also inflates the film a great deal, covering up some pacing weaknesses and a love story that never quite makes sense.It's hard, however, not to be distracted by Aileen, the completely disheartening yet fascinating character Jenkins and Theron have crafted. A hooker ever since she was physically able, Aileen is especially self-sufficient and  even if misguidedly  self-confident. She's unafraid to speak her mind and surprisingly smart on her feet when her brashness lands her in trouble.But things get extremely complicated when Aileen meets Selby (Christina Ricci), a lesbian loner who takes a liking to Aileen's somewhat masculine demeanor. When Aileen starts to reciprocate those feelings, her life begins to change, and it does even more so when she's forced to kill a man who picked her up and attempted to rape her. Jenkins provides a number of intriguing psychological insights into Aileen. As she discovers the added benefits of killing the men she solicits sex to (revenge, a sense of fulfillment, money and the ability to try and forge a future for herself and Selby), we get an even greater sense of who she was, and more importantly, what motivated her. It's enough to understand exactly why she did it, even though her actions are nearly impossible to condone.The construction of this psychological profile takes a good deal away from the journey of Aileen and Selby's relationship, which should come across more as the core of the story considering how big of a role it plays in forcing Aileen into this spiral that she can't undo despite her conscience. A lot of that comes from Selby's end, as the attention on Aileen makes it harder to understand Selby's motivations for climbing in with Aileen as deep as she does. Ricci gives an honest and likable performance; we believe that she's just naive enough to run away with Aileen but smart enough to know she needs to be a bit cautious. As things hit the fan for Aileen, however, we seem to lose that access to Selby, which is the character we are expected to identify with more.With Theron, the complete disguise of the makeup job certainly inflates the extent to which we believe she is giving us an incredible performance, but as you start to adjust to the brown contacts, nasty teeth and 30 extra pounds, you see Theron's brilliance comes from within. She shows a true commitment to the psychological disaster that her character had to have been in order to do what she did. Although the character is written brilliantly, this is not the kind of Oscar-winning performance in which the role won the award instead of the actor. Not just anyone could've done it.As a whole, "Monster" gets a bit dicey. The scene writing is quite powerful. Given the nature of Aileen as a character and Theron's execution of it, you feel as if at any moment something of serious dramatic consequence might occur and it usually does. Jenkins really captures the emotions of each scene too, whether its love, fear, hate, etc. The struggle comes from the whole, as "Monster" drags at times. There's a "Thelma & Louise" nature to the story, yet constantly we come across reminders that the action of the story is static. These women aren't actually on the run  they're just hiding frantically. The plot kind of goes in cycles with each new cycle bringing us closer and closer to their likely demise. We feel those stakes and Aileen and Selby have natural (albeit agitating) reactions to when things go awry, but it's tough to stay engaged when their actions will have such obvious consequences.But that's kind of the point. There's never a concerted effort on Aileen's end to lie or get away with anything. She is nothing if not honest, and we respect the hell out of her for it. We want to scream at her when she says that she never had a choice to become who she became, but we understand why she feels so powerless, and that unlikely sense of empathy makes "Monster" a strong film.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Exit Through the Gift Shop" might be the only documentary where the documentarian is more fascinating than the film  and the film is quite fascinating. A documentary about street art and the shadowy enigmatic figures that create it sounds interesting; a documentary about street art made by one of those shadowy figures sounds captivating.British street artist Banksy, whose work has become world-renowned (and expensive) in the last 5-10 years, has composed this documentary using hours upon hours of footage taken by a man named Thierry Guetta, a French-born American who beginning in 1999 began to follow several of the world's most prolific street artists, including Shepard Fairey (the Obama "Hope" poster) and Banksy, with the idea of making his own street art documentary. When Guetta finally finished his documentary, Banksy determined it was crap and took the reigns from Guetta, pushing him to follow his own artistic passion. In the film, this is when Banksy turns the camera on Guetta, who builds his own street art identity, Mr. Brain-Wash, from basically nothing.The result is a sort of two-sided documentary and one that many believe to be partially fabricated. Considering Banksy is one of the most elusive and mysterious artists in the world, it's hard not to consider that his documentary might be just that  art. To explain, when Thierry Guetta starts to work on his own Mr. Brain-Wash art, he hires an extensive team of artists, graphic designers, sculptors and more to help bring his vision to life, so basically he buys his talent. Then, he uses his connections with Fairey and Banksy to score major endorsements and hype his show and his reputation as the next big thing. When his show becomes a runaway hit, we're left wondering: what really constitutes an artist?As such, the theory lingers out there as to whether Banksy, Fairey and Guetta were all collaborators on the aptly named "Mr. Brain-Wash" in order to shed a new light on the public perception of art and street art in particular. Doing so would boost the profile of the art form while also making people think twice about what they value as art both internally and with their wallets. However, if Banksy's film contains no contrivances, it nevertheless gives more credence to him and Fairey as true artists.Either way, the events could not be staged, especially all of Guetta's footage in the first portion of the film. As for the second part, if Guetta truly created this persona with the genuine purpose of making his own art, people still flocked to see and buy his celebrity- themed Andy Warhol knock-offs, which turns out to be the take-home point of this part of the film. If anything, you could consider it a bit of a social experiment, just one where we as viewers are not allowed on the other side of the glass.The film succeeds as both street art documentary and a character study on Guetta, though a distinct feeling that certain things worthy of explanation are left out pervades the film. Just that faint notion of viewer deception prevents "Gift Shop" from being an truly elite documentary. Because Banksy directed, you never get a sense of who is really behind the camera conducting interviews with him, Fairey and Guetta toward the end of the film. Traditional documentary filmmakers have that kind of "presence" in their films that legitimize the work they're doing because we clearly sense the intention, but Banksy being the figure he is, clouds up our sight of his intention. Fascinating, yes, but the film leaves you confused in several places."Exit Through the Gift Shop" pushes the boundaries for what a documentary is and can be, which makes it one of the most unique films ever made. The lack of clarity and the question of authenticity, as distracting and bothersome as it may be, makes the film all the more intriguing. In the end, Banksy's core question of who can be an artist and what constitutes an artist or art, rings loud and clear. That conversation will always be inextricably tied to all art forms forever.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
The man beat out Francis Ford Coppolla. Yes, Bob Fosse, most known for his work on Broadway in regards to dance, beat out Coppolla and "The Godfather" for the Oscar for best director in 1973. That has to mean something and upon watching this film, it definitely does. Fosse has captured the off-beat underground of the Cabaret and paralleled it beautifully to Germany at the time of the rise of the Nazi regime."Cabaret" tells the story of Sally (Liza Minnelli) an American trying to make it beg in Berlin by working at the Kit Kat Club and sleeping with all the right people (at least she believes) so that she might one day be a film star. She meets Brian, who is trying to make a living teaching English in Germany and the two hit it off in a very awkward way and their lives are spun into a crazy sexual chaos because what is practical and what is instinctive don't line up. This effects all characters in the film in some way. Of course, sprinkled throughout are scenes and numbers from the Kit Kat Club, where the master of ceremonies (Joel Grey) is sure to put on a lively and raunchy show each night.The brilliance is that the viewer, much like the audience is being entertained so that they can lighten up and forget about the difficult times. For the viewer, that is the drama of the film and for the audience that is the rise of the Nazis. Joel Grey's role is therefore ever so pivotal to keep you amused and he is simply commanding in his Oscar-winning role. Minnelli is also strong in that she embodies both sides of life: the amusing and the difficult.Fosse contributes to this with various effects, one being the distorted mirrors image that he uses both in the beginning and the end and the other more apparently so in the way he stages and shows the musical numbers at the cabaret. Grey and the dancers are raunchy and strange, yet captivating, and despite the fact that these women are not attractive and alluring, you're still very entertained by the whole show. It's the very reason this film is successful, otherwise it would be boring. It already feels too long for a musical at 2 hours where the drama is most exclusively between Brian, Sally and their friend Maximillion.The impact of the Nazis is not really felt in this film because most of the conflict is superficial in nature between Brian and Sally (their problems can't compete with the problems of Germany and the Nazis at the time) and this was probably the only thing keeping "Cabaret" from topping "The Godfather" for best picture.
In a time when TV is dominated by shows about morally twisted main characters you can't help but root for, "Dallas Buyers Club" fits right in, plus it adds a layer of historical relevance and social responsibility those shows usually lack. Matthew McConaughey, another rising trend unto himself, stars as Texan Ron Woodruff, electrician and rodeo bull-rider whose loose ways with drugs and women lead him to contract HIV. By the time he discovers he has it, it's full-blown AIDS, and the doctors give him 30 days to live. Both outraged and desperate to prolong his life, he researches the disease and discovers AZT, a drug currently in trials, is the only medication available in the United States. Unable to scrounge some up with any consistency, Woodruff heads to Mexico and smuggles in unapproved drugs, enough to sell them to others who have HIV/AIDS. He establishes a "buyers club" so that he isn't selling drugs to clients (illegal), but instead selling a membership to a club that gives clients access to drugs.If McConaughey has reached an apex with his string of independent roles in the last few years, this film is it. In "Dallas Buyers Club," he works his "alright alright alright" machismo into a complex character who undergoes a major transformation from the story's start to its end. Considering AIDS was largely known as a problem in the gay community at the time, Woodruff was incensed at the notion that he could have it. Eventually, however, through getting to know a number of LGBT individuals including Rayon (Jared Leto), his transgender business partner, he comes to love and defend them. McConaughey makes this real and sincere, with help from Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack's screenplay.The story jumps forward often to show the highlights and lowlights of Woodruff's operation. Woodruff, it seems, is both the film's protagonist and antagonist. More often than not, his reckless handling of untested drugs is what lands him in trouble, whether in the hospital or the hands of the FDA. His cyclical behavior pattern provides the ups and downs of the plot, and allows him to build relationships with the supporting players including Leto and Jennifer Garner, who plays a doctor at Woodruff's near-most hospital."Dallas Buyers Club" is McConaughey's show, but Leto in particular does a nice job winning the audience over. Rayon has some challenging, eye-opening scenes as well as some intense personal moments, and Leto becomes her with a certain subtlety. There's no question the bulk of his praise comes unwarranted from simple-minded audiences who believe it's impressive and brave for a straight man to play a transgender character, but he does a lot of things well in the role that the attention isn't completely misguided.Nothing that director Jean-Marc Vallee ("The Young Victoria") does is especially noteworthy, but "Dallas Buyers Club" is a tight and well-told package of a film that utilizes strong storytelling technique and editing and provides some insight into a period of all-too-recent history. It runs clean start to finish without any notable blemishes, which is of course an achievement unto itself.McConaughey's performance will be forever remembered as the memorable achievement of "Dallas Buyers Club," but it's a pristine piece of filmmaking that does the little things right from the script to the editing to the makeup. It doesn't reach the echelon of great modern period pieces, but it deserves the label of a great film.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
"Blade Runner" is a film very much like the androids that are in it: innovative creations that appear one way on the outside but are another on the inside. "Blade Runner' has the facade of an action sci-fi epic, but is more a futuristic drama that poses questions about humanity and questions the future.Forget that it's Ridley Scott, epic action filmmaker. Forget that its Harrison Ford, 80s action film extraordinaire. "Blade Runner" is not even close to those genres--it is science-fiction, but with a focus on the purpose, not on the technology. While "Blade Runner" offers some stunning visual effects (for 1982) and some terrific art direction, it's only meant to create the sci-fi aura needed to make the ideas hit harder.Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a Blade Runner in Los Angeles in 2019. A Blade Runner is a cop in charge of hunting down Nexus 6 androids that were banned from Earth under punishment of extermination because they exceeded human strength and knowledge. When 4 of these "Replicants" hijack a ship and find their way to Earth (they are supposed to remain in Earth's off-planet colonies), Deckard is put in charge of taking them down, and he goes around trying to do just that."Blade Runner" moves rather slowly, taking a lot of time with its scenes. Especially when the sci-fi leads you to expect action, it can get really slow. It's the images and the use of darkness and light that make this film good and interesting. While confusing, you start to get the film towards the end.While not Ford's best role because it doesn't call on him to do much, he still continues to be the best protagonist to get his butt handed to him in every film. He's always the most realistic of any hero because he never does it without help or without getting something for his grief.Once you get what the film says about humans and emotions and what truly is human, then you appreciate how the film goes about getting there. An action film simply wouldn't do that. Once again, the sci-fi is simply to establish and set the tone for future L.A., it is not an integral part of the film. Expect some more thought-provoking sci-fi along the lines of an Assimov, Wells or Orwell and "Blade Runner' will surely give you something you enjoy munching on.
Unlikely friendships are often the focus of great film and literature as far back as Huck Finn and Jim. Luc Besson's film "The Professional" gives unlikelihood a whole new meaning as its focus is on a professional hit-man and a troubled, 12-year-old girl. Naturally there's a lot these two can learn from each other and probably a lot they shouldn't, but it all makes for interesting and compelling material.Leon, played by Jean Reno, is a highly skilled, elusive hit-man who works for an Italian mob leader. He's also an immigrant with no means of being completely self-sufficient (he can't read or write and doesn't keep his own finances). He also lives in a run-down NYC apartment next to a family with an abusive, dope-dealing father. When the father gets into trouble, a psychotic and corrupt cop (Oldman) has his whole family taken out. Only Mathilda (Portman), the youngest daughter, survives. With nowhere to go when she's supposed to be dead, she turns to Leon.Leon and Mathilda form a unique bond. Both Reno and Portman are perfect in their roles. Leon is a creature of habit whose sensitive side comes out in caring for this young girl and Portman portrays both the beauty and innocence of a 12-year-old girl who at the same time is highly motivated by vengeance and a sense of inescapable maturity. You can certainly see why Portman was destined to be a successful actress. Mathilda's persistence to learn Leon's craft and his acceptance eventually is a bit disturbing and hard to grasp at first, but the more time they spend together, the more you love their relationship. You get a sense for how sweet Mathilda is and how good-hearted Leon, an assassin, can be. Besson also focuses on both actors' strongest trait: their eyes, which are highly communicative of these ideas.The complications that arise when Mathilda tries to seek her own vengeance against Oldman's character further complicates the nature of this unlikely friendship, exposing it for how dangerous it is, but also testing its merit--showing us how strong it can be. The action scenes that arise from this plot are also sure to satisfy those who want "The Professional" to deliver on that end, even if it's far from the focus. It's really about this friendship and to be honest, there could have been even more from the two of them: it was almost as if (and it may be the case) the American release was stripped in places by producers to emphasize the action pieces for fear the film couldn't thrive on the relationship element.Oldman is another piece that shouldn't go unmentioned. Though his character isn't given much depth to warrant high acclaim, Oldman is quite terrifying in his own way. It certainly offers explanation for his slew of villain roles in the 90s.Besson has really given all of us gun-toting-movie lovers something to chew on here, which is really the film's greatest achievement. While countless crime dramas, thrillers and action films glorify the gun, Besson shows it for how terrifying it is, even if he does have to use Hollywood elements at times to keep the film's pace up. "The Professional" really has it's own special place in the wide array of assassin films.
If given the choice, I don't think many filmmakers would choose prison dramas as their area of expertise, but Frank Darabont seems to have no problem with it and neither should we; he has directed arguably the two greatest prison films ever made in his highly selective career. Both "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile" are weighty but moving period pieces with impeccable characters and an epic quality considering the literal confines of the story. "The Green Mile" puts a supernatural twist on the genre and though it lacks the inspirational kick that allowed "Shawshank" to win the hearts of nearly all who've seen it, it holds its own among the many great dramas of the 1990s.Based on the Stephen King novel, "The Green Mile" is a Depression-era film that takes place in a Southern prison on the cell block that houses the criminals awaiting death and "Old Sparky" (the electric chair). The ensemble consists of a few of these prisoners and the guards that watch them, led by Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks). The story is partially narrated by the elder version of Edgecomb as he reflects on the strange and life-changing events that occurred in that prison when a large man with mysterious healing abilities named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrived.Darabont's adaptation is meaty with smooth and effective story arcs and full-bodied characters who feel 100 percent authentic. Just like in "Shawshank," Darabont separates the good guys from the bad guys quickly and they tug at our emotions right away. Doug Hutchison plays the mean-spirited and snotty Percy Wetmore, the one prison guard who's aunt is the governor's wife and tries to use that privilege to behave however he likes. All the other guards (a strong ensemble cast including David Morse and Barry Pepper) treat the prisoners with some humanity, but Percy treats them as if they're the scum of the earth, which easily rattles us. Darabont asks for a small leap of faith in that we're supposed to pity the prisoners, but considering the flaws of the criminal justice system at the time and excessive and unnecessary use of the death penalty, this is not too difficult. In general, Darabont has the uncanny ability to influence his audience and it's everywhere in "The Green Mile," namely with characters. The introduction of Sam Rockwell's "Wild Bill" to the prison is the finest example. He acts catatonic until he gets to the prison and then attacks the guards. From there on out, his subplot is a roller coaster. When he finally gets what he deserves (solitary confinement a couple times) its cathartic for the viewer, but then he's right back at his usual hi-jinx.Character mastery is the strength of the film, but its weakness is the supernatural element. Considering it takes a long while to enter the picture and everything else feels like authentic historical fiction, John Coffey's healing abilities feel out of place even though they drive the latter half of the film. They're intriguing and add a layer of mystery that certainly complicates matters and when it's used it usually has an impact on the more powerful events of the story (one involving a wonderful little mouse named Mr. Jangles). Yet there's still a continuity issue that just kind of snaps the illusion of the film for a brief moment."The Green Mile" is often considered one of the greatest "tearjerkers" of all-time and it certainly warrants that notion whether you cry or not. Rarely does a film pull at your insides like this one, just as it did with "Shawshank," and rarely does a three-hour movie manage to never get boring or talk-heavy. Darabont's excellent script carefully places the turning points of the story to ensure just that.Here is a film that will radically influence your perceptions of justice. The line between good and evil in this movie is so thick as if suggesting for every definitive good there is in this world there is its equal. Normally we're introduced in film to characters who suggest every person has the capacity for both, but "The Green Mile" argues that's not always the case. "The Green Mile," which refers to the green floor of the cell block, symbolizes the path before one is ultimately judged as being one or the other. A tough idea, a powerful idea and one that suits the weighty impact of this film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The most famous conspiracy of all time gets the big-screen treatment and boy, what a treatment it is. Famed and controversial filmmaker Oliver Stone appeared to be in way over his head with "JFK," pouring what probably amounts to decades of investigation and research into three-plus hours of screen time, enough to convince even the most stringent of government sympathizers that Lee Harvey Oswald could not have possibly assassinated President John F. Kennedy.Even if you're not a fan of historical conspiracy, if you appreciate film you'll be blown away by the technical precision of Stone's effort. The conspiracy itself does guide much of the film's run time (that's not to detract from its powerful ideological arguments between characters), so it can be weighty for those who don't enjoy the learning aspect. However, the masterful blend of contemporary scenes and archive footage give "JFK" an unparalleled documentary-like feel.The use of various cameras, lenses and film stock makes a lot of the film's footage appear to be archive footage, so naturally it's hard to distinguish fact from fiction, but the result is more fascinating than confusing. Whole sections of the film belong to two monologues: Jim Garrison's (Kevin Costner) closing argument to the jury at the film's end and the mysterious source "X" (Donald Sutherland) explaining to Garrison how the Department of Defense, FBI and CIA all could have collaborated to carry out the assassination. Without mixing in compelling visuals, these scenes would consist only of talking heads. Not only do these visuals work, but they also make sense. It's no wonder cinematography and editing were the two victories "JFK" scored at the Academy Awards.Although Stone's focus is the material itself, the characters are still compelling. The story centers around New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who three years after the assassination has an epiphany and opens the first investigation of the president's murder, finding it impossible to believe that Oswald (Gary Oldman) alone could have fired three shots from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository and been successful.The film delves a bit into Garrison's family life, which shows how his "obsession" with the case has hurt his family and upset his wife. Sounds pretty typical, but the writing from Stone and Zachary Sklar creates such deep empathy that you understand exactly where each character comes from. The same happens in the other dramatic scenes between Garrison and the people he questions or Garrison and members of his investigative team that begin to question the whole thing. Costner is downright believable and you're with him and behind him every step of the way.The rest of the cast is flooring. There are a number of cameos and small parts filmed by huge names. There's everyone from the tandem of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (not together however) to Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon and Sissy Spacek to John Candy. When you watch a film that has so many excellent faces appear for brief minutes, you get the sense that the film is important. Any script that draws in that many names must be special and "JFK" is. The film occasionally loses itself in all the conspiracy exposition, but anyone who finds it interesting will discover the seemingly insurmountable run time much easier to handle than expected. The choice, however, makes "JFK" a non-traditional film. It's a unique breed of historical fiction, a textbook in story form. But to top it all off, it speaks profoundly about themes regarding people and their government, the fear-power dynamic and of course fighting for the fundamental right to truth.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
It doesn't seem like a stretch to suggest that America might now be ready to embrace films in the style of India's Bollywood films. While "Slumdog Millionaire" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here."Slumdog Millionaire" is a drama exposing the tragic effects of poverty in gigantic Indian cities like Mumbai that is also fused with a modern day Indian fairytale. Jamal Malik is a young man on India's "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire" and is a question away from one million dollars when he's arrested on suspicion of cheating. Because Jamal is from the slums of India and has no educational background, it seems entirely improbable if not impossible that Jamal could make it this far, but each question is connected with distinct and sometimes painful memories for Jamal. It's as if he is destined to win, even though he only went on the show to impress a girl he has loved his whole life, Latika.Danny Boyle ("28 Days Later," "Sunshine") takes us from memory to memory as Jamal advances question by question toward the million dollars. These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.While the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as "Slumdog Millionaire" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one. His great success with making this film intense, eye-opening and full of heart all at the same time prove that he's also an incredible one. "Slumdog" is just the beginning for Boyle who might be one of the most progressive and talented directors working today.It's hard to be completely blown away by a film whose core message is about destiny and leans on the fact that Jamal is simply fated to do this well in explaining what has unfolded, but like any good film ought to, Boyle makes you a fan of the characters and not care as much about the logistics as you might normally do. The fact that this film starts out so dramatic and real makes it hard to embrace the fairytale it blossoms into, but it's the great visual storytelling along the way that makes it so enjoyable. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com/
In "City Island," Raymond De Felitta goes to the source that got him a nomination for Best Short Film -- the Bronx. His clever script takes a dysfunctional New York family to the next echelon of ridiculousness, concocting farcical events that the Rizzo family brings upon itself because they simply are afraid to tell each other the truth.Vince Rizzo (Andy Garcia) was born and raised on City Island and that locale, though it bears no relevance to the events of the story, is clearly of utmost importance to De Felitta. Rizzo works as a correctional officer (prison guard) and one day discovers that a new inmate is actual the son he abandoned 20-some years ago before he was married. He decides to bring Tony, now paroled, home to live with him for maybe a month but decides to not tell him or the other Rizzos the truth about their connection.But everyone is hiding something in the Rizzo family. Kept secrets are a major focus of the family tension and humor. Vince goes to an acting class at night and tells his wife, Joyce (Julianna Margulies) he's playing poker because he's ashamed. Joyce feels neglected physically but won't say anything and assumes Vince is having an affair. Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido), the eldest daughter, hasn't told her parents she lost her scholarship and has started stripping to pay for school. Vince Jr. (Ezra Miller), high school age, has a compulsive fat fetish.Roll them up together and you have one of the more dysfunctional families ever written for the screen, but only because they can't be honest with one another. The characters shout obnoxiously and at times they're so despicable you want to knock them all upside the head and reveal all their secrets. That's where Tony (Steven Strait) comes in. Imprisoned for boosting cars and pushing coke, he seems normal compared to the family and comically he's the one that learns of all their secrets except the one that applies to him of course.Although the characters feel more messed up for the sake of being messed up than real, Garcia and Margulies among others provide the realism more so than the writing. Emily Mortimer, who plays Andy's friend from acting class, gives the most interesting and quirky performance as a woman with her own secret, but she's so peripheral to the events of the story and serves mostly as Vince's consultant. As events unfold and truths are revealed, De Felitta's film comes off as more comedy than drama, which helps define exactly what he was going for. Certainly he aimed for some sincerity in the characters aspirations and secrets, but the goal becomes to laugh at these pathetic people who all deserve what comes to them. The epiphanies of the characters are not nearly as strong as the comedic plotting. De Felitta's style strikes me as someone who would write a great Showtime or HBO serial comedy and as such few will find themselves not enjoying "City Island."~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
While the reason "Blood Diamond" feels like a thrill ride is indeed because of the persistent anarchy and chaos during the Sierra Leone civil war, you can't help but admit this film is downright entertaining. But that's not to say this film is not without a sensitive, humanitarian side, because the truth is it does both very well. Acclaimed producer/director Edward Zwick ("The Last Samurai" (2003), "Glory" (1989)) has a knack for finding historically significant (but not overdone) stories and turning them into entertaining films without diluting the meaningful content. Any film that can do both well deserves higher praise than one that does only one of them well. Zwick has done that with "Blood Diamond," this time painting a picture of war-torn Africa and its corruption from the diamond industry.The film's true protagonist is Solomon Vandy, played by Djimon Honsou, who is absolutely sensational in his role as a fisherman who is separated from his family by rebel forces in Sierra Leone. While what you've seen about this film in its publicity would lead you to believe Leonardo DiCaprio is the leading man, this is not his story--in fact I would go as far as to criticize those in charge of promoting it that way. We should not be so arrogant as to identify the white, American actors as the main characters in this story. Not to take away from DiCaprio, who really proves his versatility as one of the world's best actors in this film playing a greedy, South African diamond smuggler named Danny Archer. His character is likable but corrupt and it makes him very interesting.Zwick does a tremendous job opening our eyes to the true nature of the violence in Africa, showing us how kids are turned into heartless killers and how human life there seems to have no value--it's all about who has the most weapons. Jennifer Connelly's role as a journalist trying to make a difference simply feels like a way for writer Charles Leavitt to explain and question that nature of the corruption in the diamond industry, but toss that aside and you have a strong, interesting character nevertheless because Connelly gives that without fail in everything she does.The film keeps a strong pace while still taking the time to show the historical context and Zwick deserves a lot of that credit though Leavitt should get his due. His script never lags or feels unnatural and he takes his characters on a variety of emotional tears. The way the action weaves itself in does feel a little forced, but it's entertaining and keeps you on edge."Blood Diamond" is full of talent. From Zwick to Honsou and DiCaprio and to the incredible editing team that keeps everything in the destructive, semi-automatic gunfire action sequences from getting out of control. As far as great films go, this falls into the category of excellent action films. Not every film is going to be deeply moving, but for the amount of action that fills up the running time of this film, it's particularly eye-opening and meaningful.
Before you ever see the first shot of "Youth in Revolt," you know what's going on. A repetitive motion sound is heard as well as the flipping of pages. Nick Twisp (Cera) is masturbating and almost everyone in the theater knows it. Now that's testament to how far the R-rated comedy sexual revolution has come over the last decade, so it's not surprising to see a film so unabashed about teenage sex let alone one whose entire plot is driven by a teenager's zealous appetite to shed his virginity.The always soft-spoken and awkwardly verbose Cera plays yet another character that fits his mold in Twisp, a teenager with divorced parents who loves Fellini films and vintage vinyl and really, really wants to get laid. It's a semi-romantic aspiration as well, but the depths to which he'll let his hormones take him is at times even implausibly absurd. On vacation with his mother (Jean Smart) and her lover Jerry (Zach Galifianakis of "The Hangover"), Nick meets a perfect match in the daughter of two devout Christian trailer park folks named Sheeni Saunders and the two have an awkward but adorable summer fling. Newcomer Portia Doubleday makes an impression in this early portion of the film as Sheeni, teasing Nick and viewers with her poise and charm. When Nick has to go, he realizes their relationship (and his ascent to manhood) is at risk. He devises a scheme to get his father to move to Sheeni's town and his mother to get mad enough to send him to live there. The only problem, is that for it to work, sweet and innocent Nicky will have to be bad.Nick invents an alternate persona for himself, one based on Sheeni's ideal man. He's a blue- eyed mustached, chain-smoking Frenchman named Francois Dillinger and he's Nick without hesitation or reservation. Cera does wisely in agreeing to be in this film because of this alter- ego aspect. Having to be Francois pushes Cera out of that same old wimpy character box and has him being frank -- and really dirty -- for once. If Cera doesn't want to flame out in the near future, he'll need more parts like this.From here on out, "Youth in Revolt" sort of tumbles into a teenage daydream of all the insane things any good, normal kid would do for love and sex -- if it were all fiction. The creation of Francois doesn't exactly justify the ridiculous decisions Nick makes like burning down half of Berkeley, California, for example. It's fun, but not all that memorable. I've never read the C.D. Payne novel, but you can tell it was much more extensive and that Gustin Nash had a hard time with the adaptation. All the events feel compressed, especially in the middle and last acts. Nothing builds gradually, it just gets stuck in. Some characters such as Sheeni's drug-endorsing older brother (Justin Long) who's snuck in toward the end, feel important to the story in an intangible way, but don't leave any particular impression. Nash's adaptation, despite having the comedic dialog down, lacks a clear interpretation of Payne's story by which to tailor itself. In other words, deciding on one of the book's messages to craft the adaptation around might've helped eliminate certain parts of the story and alleviate the cramming. Director Miguel Arteta picks up on some subtler ideas such as how the many side characters act as insight on or inspire rebellious behavior, but they mostly get lost in the love story and Nick's sexual coming-of-age."Youth In Revolt" is an explicit teenage Rated-R comedy, but not a raunchy one, which ultimately makes it more respectable than more than half the genre off-the-bat. Much respect to The Weinstein Co. and Dimension Films for not trying to taper back for a PG-13 considering R closes the film off to half its intended audience. At the same time, it's not as unique or genre-changing as Areta's indie stylings try and make it out to be. Once again, audiences have grown accustomed to an assortment of male genital references and open discussion about sex. But there are some good performances from young actors and clever dialog in "Youth in Revolt" and it deserves a viewing.~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.com
Anyone with a love or soft spot for creature-driven sci-fi/fantasy can appreciate what the writing trio led by Len Wiseman attempted to do when they conceived "Underworld." Creating a world where vampires and werewolves (Lycans) live amongst humans and are engaged in a secret thousand-year-old war is at the least interesting and respectable for fans of the like and so conceptually, "Underworld" at least has something to work with. Putting their vision on the big screen? Not as easy. The film is riddled with bad dialogue, bad acting and scenes that seem to lack any kind of contextual clues--not to mention bullets, lots of bullets."Underworld" stars Kate Beckinsale as a "death dealer," named Selene--you know, that troubled, martial arts-savvy vampire charged with the responsibility to perpetuate the violence between vampires and lycans by killing lycans and never questions it until, of course, the film is about twenty minutes in. The rich history the writers have concocted makes it a bit more interesting, but it would be nicer to see it than have characters waste time telling us about it through dialogue with other characters. Selene begins to question these things when she catches on to a vampire/lycan conspiracy hundreds of years in the making and tries to uncover the mystery and how a human being hunted by lycans named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) is tied to it all.The film foremost but least obviously dodges the obstacle of explaining how vampires and lycans can wage their war without humans knowing. It gives no time (assumed the future, but who knows) or place explanation. In fact, daylight never happens in the film, it's all about the vampires and lycans. There is also nothing done to really get the viewer to grasp the conflict. You start to pick sides in your head as to who is right or wrong, but you never once feel the conflict through any of the characters and Selene seems to be a very odd and unmotivated heroine. All you get is one scene highly reminiscent of "Silence of the Lambs" of her telling her story to Michael and at that point it's too late for it to make a serious impact on the movie.The acting is mostly bland, but that could be more due to a horrible script. The script wouldn't have been half as bad if it spent less time explaining. Bill Nighy is the exception to the poor acting as vampire lord Viktor who Selene awakens in a desperate attempt to figure out what's going on. Nighy brings some actual character to his role and some serious evil. His performance was no doubt that which landed him his role as Davy Jones in the "Pirates of the Caribbean" films.The directing and art direction does offer this film a visual saving grace. Wiseman does some really cool transitions and some strange, but cool-looking action sequences. The film does seem to not-so-obviously cover its budget constraints in this manner, however, in that the best visual effects are in short snippets. Also, either they were steering away from anything that was going to garner an R-rating or they simply didn't have the money to show most of the violence, something that would have made the film feel a bit more real. Lycans go to maul people and Wiseman cuts away, leaving you doubting if the person actually got mauled.Basically, if I weren't a sucker for films with a mythology placed in a futuristic sci-fi setting with similar art direction, this film would have been horrendous. Viewers with a genuine interest in story like that and sci-fi action sequences are sure to at least get a bit of entertainment out of "Underworld," but that's about all this film has to offer.
There aren't really any shocking twists or deceptive mind games in "Ocean's Thirteen," but it's cool, it's clever, it's fun and it's way better than "Ocean's Twelve."The all-star cast needs no mentioning other than the loss of Julia Roberts and the addition of another Italian casino bigwig in Al Pacino. I suppose we can look forward to Robert DeNiro in "Ocean's Fourteen."This time, the gang is motivated by revenge for Pacino's character William Bank screwing over Elliot Gould's character (one of the thirteen) and causing him a near-death experience. The idea is simply to get even with Bank by making his casino a huge loser. The plot has no extra meat and it's swift and to the point. From the very beginning it's all about the plan, which it seems the new writers realized is the heart and soul of this "franchise." You get your money's worth in conning, hacking and machine rigging to say the least.Outside of the solid, interesting but otherwise simple plot, director Steven Soderbergh decides to really seize more creative freedom in this film. There are a variety of interesting techniques used and the montage-style scenes have a very 1970s Las Vegas feel, which of course hinges more on the success of the original remake. You feel like you're watching an "Ocean's" film just because of the distinct style. It's a fun, cool feel and the cast looks like it's having a blast on set. Bottom line is "Ocean's Thirteen" is quality entertainment that really rights the ship with the series by bringing its groove back. It solidifies the unique stamp that the series has on Hollywood that will scarcely be touched.
Queens are not just characters is period romances. Or fantasy stories. "The Queen" is a fascinating look at a monarch of not only historical fact, but also of a modern world. Played with grace and poise by the great Helen Mirren, Queen Elizabeth II becomes a specimen for our the moviegoer's microscope rather than remaining that elusive royal figure locked up in Buckingham Palace.In many ways, this is what the film is about: a woman grounded in one of the deepest traditions there is in terms of the British monarchy, who realizes that she too must change, must make herself known again to her people and become a more meaningful part of their lives.The film begins with Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) being elected to office, but focuses on the week that shook the world when Princess Diana died tragically in a car accident in France. Diana was on poor terms with the former Princess of Wales, but her death struck a chord with her entire country and the world. The people and press demanded something from The Queen, who wanted to keep it quiet. It was a PR strategy that nearly threatened the monarchy's existence.The crux of Mirren's performance is not her ability to create an incredibly royal aura about herself, which she does with ease. Rather, it's her ability to externalize The Queen's internal struggle of coming to terms with the need to change without being emotional or even slightly melodramatic. She must deal with this PR nightmare as well as the emotional trauma Di's death has caused her grandchildren while staying composed as a queen of 50 years would. She simply nails it. Despite staying collected, no one can come close to classifying Mirren's performance as stoic.Peter Morgan ("The Last King of Scotland") has chosen a perfect one-week period in his subject's life to forge this biopic. Diana's death is a moment everyone in the audience old enough to remember it will never forget. Even if we know nothing about Queen Elizabeth II, there's our perfect window into her life and the state of affairs of Britain. His script makes up what it lacks in external up-and-down conflict with conflict based on the stubbornness and internal battles of his characters. It's not only The Queen who must change, but Prince Philip (James Cromwell), Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) and the Queen Mother. The conflict is a raw tension between the sweeping tidal wave of current events/the press and the Royal Family's indecision and resistance. Mediating is Sheen as a youthful and idealistic Tony Blair."The Queen" is a thought-provoking film about great change and how our best leaders are the ones that learn to embrace it, that ride ahead of its waves, no matter how uncomfortable it might be.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
What makes "Heat" a good film is what separates it from other thrillers. While divorcing the surprise endings, plot twists, and master thievery planning and execution and deciding to make a three hour "cat and mouse" crime drama may be a choice that turns away fans of the genre, writer/director Michael Mann deserves applause for the bold step because it really pays off in the end."Heat" stars two of the greatest actors ever in Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro. Pacino is the LAPD major crimes detective and DeNiro the master thief. As the movie goes on, not only do you learn about how their professions and how their utter dedication to them affects their personal lives, but you watch as they slowly come closer to one another in what is a great payoff for all the minutes of anticipation.What's great about Mann's film, and most of his films for that matter, is that the criminals are more than just criminals and the cops more than just cops: they get extensive backgrounds painted for them and so the action ends up being about more than just who is capable of being the coolest and kicking the most ass, but about understanding the actions that both take and what's at stake.Pacino and DeNiro give great performances as always. The movies they've been in since the 90s began are a little more on the suspect side, but that shouldn't take away from the fact that they truly are still talented. Nobody else in the film, actor-wise, really stole any attention. Maybe Diane Venora as Pacino's wife comes closest."Heat" is a very drawn out, character driven cop-chasing-criminal thriller and that's really the best way to describe it. It definitely drags at points, but if you can focus on the details Mann has put into his characters and the use of lights and color in terms of aesthetic and symbolic value in the film, "Heat" instantly becomes one of the most respectable thrillers ever made even if it falls short of the most entertaining.
Before "X2: X-Men United," there was always this dreaded fear of sequels. Finally we see how follow-up films can really outdo the original.There was nothing that wrong with "X-Men," in fact it was a great imagining of the comic by Bryan Singer and it brought our attention to the importance of character development in a film with so many to follow. "X2," however is more explosive, has slightly more characters and the plot blows the first film out of the water. The reason is story.The first film was a pathetic plot to turn world leaders into mutants by X-Men nemesis Magneto, (Ian McKellen) who believes in mutant supremacy. This installment is a brilliantly conceived plot that successfully interweaves various story lines like Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) mysterious past and Jean Grey's (Famke Janssen) suddenly irritable powers into the main plot. While some of the subplots--not unlike the first movie--are under-developed, the ones that matter the most work fluidly.In "X2," the president of the United States is attacked by a teleporting mutant, later to be revealed as famed comic character Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming). From the first scene you can tell the special effects budget is going to yield a film more visually awesome than the first. Nightcrawler evaporates into puffs of purple smoke and reappears to stylishly kick butt. First film shape-shifter baddie Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) also gets more CGI attention as does flame-thrower Pyro (Aaron Stanford). The attack puts the country on high alert and the president authorizes a man by the name of William Stryker (Brian Cox) to raid the X-Men Academy. Of course Stryker is a little more intimately tied to the mutant controversy than anyone realizes, soon forcing both evil mutants and good mutants to team up to defeat him. It would be shameful to spoil any more of Stryker's plan, but it's brilliantly drawn up by the writing team that includes director Bryan Singer.Singer brings the same style to this film as he did the first and the bigger budget just gives him more room to deliver great action in addition to character-driven story. He's really a great director for the franchise--not too over-the-top but capable of filming in that action movie style.Another great choice by Singer and story writers Zak Penn and David Hayter was not to go overboard with new mutants. Nightcrawler is the only substantial addition to the X-Men and Pyro and Iceman (Sean Ashmore), who made appearances in the first film, get further development. On the villain side, Magneto has no cronies other than Mystique, to account for Stryker and his deadly assistant Deathstrike (Yuriko Oyama). This basically allows the script to dig further into the existing characters, even if some of them (Halle Berry's Storm and James Marsden's Cyclops) still get glazed over."X2" is just more exciting and clever than its predecessor. Knowing that "X-Men" was a hit but not a critical success, it seems the producers decided to be careful even with the film getting fasttracked by the studio. It definitely paid off.
The best thing to say about "Terminator Salvation" is at least they tried. Between the homage paid to the original films, the non-stop action and a myriad of different writers brought in to make the script as strong as possible, the producers really aspired to reinvigorate the Terminator franchise. "Salvation" was not meant to be a cheap attempt to capitalize on the Terminator brand. But not everyone will see it that way because the results stop at "entertaining." Despite the thematic cries of why humans will always be better than machines, there isn't heart written into the characters. The new vision is uninspired and flat."Salvation" takes place in the future -- those scenes we only got brief glimpses of during "Terminator" and "T2: Judgement Day." John Connor (Bale) is the leader of the human resistance living in the post-apocalyptic desert of the Death Valley area. He knows from his mother's tapes that he is to at some point send his father, Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) back in time to protect his mother (and ensure his birth and the survival of humanity), but we're far from that. Reese is a teenager at the moment and he's just met Marcus (Sam Worthington) who was sentenced to death in 2003 and is mysteriously alive. They're hoping to meet up with Connor and the resistance, who have just discovered a signal that shuts down the machines and they're hoping to use it on the SkyNet HQ.This information is enough to generate good action sequences, but it clearly lacks a singular focal character as well as an identifiable antagonist. In the first film it was Arnold and in the second it was T-1000 -- in "Salvation" it's just the machines in general. The dynamic of cat and mouse is gone and replaced with mostly mice running from the idea of a cat.Then there's the fact that this is the first film taking place in the future. Not a bad idea, per se, but McG's strengths lie in action film-making, not envisioning the world Cameron gave us just a taste of in the original films. That world was dark, lonely and no one could be trusted. This film toys around with trust and brings it up only when convenient for suspense purposes. It just throws all the characters in the desert because it looks like a wasteland. It just takes for granted the fact that so many films before it have established what the end of the world might look like ("Mad Max" the prime example) that it doesn't establish its own rules.McG's "Terminator" is action-packed and constantly moving toward a fairly redeemable climax. The references to the previous films will please die-hard fans of the Terminator universe. The punch is simply not there -- the reason to care about any of the characters other than you knew them once when they were played by different actors and under the direction of a sci-fi genius. It is not an offensive robot-crunching atrocity, but it could use a bit more depth and heart.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
From an outside perspective, two counts of unoriginality can be charged to "The Crazies." One: it's a remake of a George Romero film from the '70s; Two: it adds another quarantined disease zombie movie to the pile that proliferated this past decade. Yet Breck Eisner's version does so many little things right. He keeps "The Crazies" suspenseful and elicits our sympathies for the main characters. Next to "28 Days Later," and its sequel as well as "I Am Legend," no zombie disease flick of late has done it better."The Crazies" does offer some unique trappings to the genre. The story takes place in the small Iowa town of Ogden Marsh where the Sheriff Dave Dutten (Timothy Olyphant) has had a few cases of people going catatonic and then becoming violent. He soon discovers that a plane has crash-landed in the marsh in a location that feeds into the town's water supply. But before he can do anything about it, the military invades Ogden Marsh and begins to quarantine the local citizens and killing anyone who doesn't comply.So in addition to fighting off unstably violent diseased people, Dutten must avoid contact with the military for fear of being killed or separated from his pregnant wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell). Mitchell and Olyphant succeed as likable leads for a horror film. Olyphant ("Live Free or Die Hard") performs better in the take-charge sheriff role and MItchell, since her starring role in sci-fi/horror flick "Pitch Black," has always proved she has more of a knack for the frightened protagonist/heroine than the average actress.Although not abundantly scary, Eisner keeps the film suspenseful and ominous with patience and strong shot composition. Most noticeably, his "crazies" don't act like most zombies; they're quiet and almost methodical and you can tell that they're succumbing to some uncontrollable impulse. It makes you take them much more seriously as an audience rather than simply enjoy the gory fun. The "scary" scenes also flow naturally and keep you guessing rather than constantly delaying an inevitable "boo!" moment.When the truth about the government plane and the substance on board gets out, the originality of the "Crazies" story comes through. Suddenly Dave and Judy are out there fighting to survive against the man as much as some diseased lunatics. The film doesn't resonate much more beyond that, but unlike much of this sub-genre, nothing poor can be said about the filmmaking.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Everything that makes high school an evil, evil place comes to the forefront in "Carrie," or at least all the worst possible combinations of things that could literally make high school hell. Brian De Palma brings Stephen King's first novel to life as part coming-of-age drama, part obnoxious high school movie and part horror film in a way that's at times messy, but visually lasting and highly memorable.Unexpectedly, the film's title sequence takes place in a girls locker room where we get a barrage of full-frontal nudity followed by star Sissy Spacek erotically soaping herself in the shower and discovering that she's bleeding for the first time. The sudden change in tone sets the expectation for the shock factor that pervades the rest of the film, and De Palma portrays Carrie's consequent freak out and the subsequent bullying she endures from her peers with a certain surreal turbulence that will also make repeat appearance.Carrie has it rough. In addition to being bullied at school, her mother (Piper Laurie) is a religious nut who abuses her regularly, forcing her into a "prayer closet" for sins she hasn't committed. To complicate matters, she's started to develop telekinetic abilities. All this starts to set the perfect storm in motion for Carrie to completely lose it.Amazing, then, that despite all the foreboding, De Palma convinces us at times that things are looking up for Carrie. When one of the girls who bullied Carrie in the shower, Sue (Amy Irving), has a change of heart and convinces her prom date, Tommy (William Katt) to take Carrie to the prom instead, it seems like misguided and disingenuous help, but over time we come to believe Tommy sees Carrie in a new light. Suddenly things are looking up, even though we know that Chris (Nancy Allen), the girl still bitter about being punished for tormenting Carrie, has a nasty surprise in store for her that will quickly change things.In the script, we lose Carrie at times for these lesser supporting roles, including Chris' boy toy played by John Travolta right before "Saturday Night Fever" launched him to fame. Carrie is prime for a cinematic character study, but the film doesn't go in that direction nearly enough. As such, Carrie becomes the object of pity instead of empathy. And her mother simply acts like a zealot, so by the time we finally start to understand her, it's too late.It's a stretch to call "Carrie" a horror film; most of it is an exercise in effective foreshadow because we know all these circumstances will lead to something bad, but not until the end does it get a bit gruesome (though not nearly gruesome enough). Even so, the images are more creepy than terrifying. De Palma doesn't scare us so much as shock us with images we won't soon forget. There's a reason that to this day, everyone talks about the prom scene in "Carrie."Spacek also has an important role to play in the memorability of the film. Her performance certainly works as a sheltered girl dominated by her mother and shunned by her peers, but her looks contribute immensely to the story. With bug eyes and prominent cheekbones, she looks a little strange and plenty weird, but as she transforms herself for prom, she pulls a 180 that makes the final act's flip of the switch eerily effective.The whirlwind ending to the film will leave a sour taste for some viewers looking for more answers or definitive resolution. There's a religious connection implied in these final scenes that distracts a bit from what King did well with "Carrie," and that's serve as a cautionary tale. At the least, you might think twice before picking on the loner, or at least regret whenever you did.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
Late-summer Civil Rights dramas don't come around much. In fact, late-summer dramas don't come around much period, but "The Help" has just the right pinches of humor and bright colors to keep it from becoming a weighty affair more suited for the winter awards contenders. Don't assume, however, that come the turn of seasons that anyone will have forgotten "The Help" come awards time.Tate Taylor adapts and directs Kathryn Stockett's best-selling novel about African-American maids living in Jackson, Miss. in the Jim Crow era. Viola Davis plays Aibileen, a woman who has been raising the children of wealthy Southern white families for decades. When college grad Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan (Emma Stone) returns home with aspirations of becoming a journalist, she tries to convince Aibileen and fellow maid Minnie (Octavia Spencer) to tell their stories in hopes of getting their perspective heard. Although the women fear their identities being discovered, the prejudicial attitudes of Miss Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her initiative to force homes with maids to provide a separate bathroom for The Help provokes them to courageously speak up."The Help" puts out a massive ensemble effort glowing with talent. Never has a female- dominated cast of this size given such strong performances across the board. Aibileen provides the narrative voice, but Skeeter, Minnie and others each get their stories told in full depth and the supporting roles from the likes of Allison Janney as Skeeter's mother and Sissy Spacek as Hilly's mother are priceless.If a standout has to be chosen for Oscar consideration, it has to be Davis. There's that constant look in her eyes suggesting that she's always carrying every single thing her character has ever been through into every scene. She's penetratingly real; she is everyone's mother. She also brings the film's wide range of emotions, though the comedy would be Spencer's forte.Spencer, a long-time small-role character actor, follows Taylor from his first feature-length film "Pretty Ugly People." She makes the film a true delight with a hold-nothing-back attitude. Minnie embodies some racial stereotypes, but the script gives her such incredible depth that we associate those things with who she truly is, not as a vehicle for humor.Perhaps  oddly enough  too many characters feel multi-dimensional and "The Help" lacks a true focus for a film running nearly two and a half hours, but the acting is so sharp at all levels that it never feels boring or hollow. The characters and the many situations and problems they deal with feel unmistakably real, namely because those problems break the mold for Southern Civil Rights drama.The film avoids being another example of how terrible things once were and how poorly blacks were treated. It asks us to feel sorry for everyone, not just the African-American characters and scratch our heads at how life was ever like that anywhere in this country. Ultimately, "The Help" tells a story of courage in one of its unlikeliest forms  telling the truth, making sure all side are heard. It uses such a diverse tool set of characters to get that point across.Taylor's much more concerned about working with these actresses to create compelling portraits of characters and relationships in a place and time full of unique issues than he is with creating gripping drama. Considering the film is no less poignant and maybe all the more likable for it, he made the right choice.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The life of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has almost too much good material. It's one thing to grow up selling moonshine, buy up some strip clubs and launch one of the most explicit pornography magazines ever created. It's another to also be a one-time born-again Christian, bipolar painkiller addict and the unsuspecting bastion of First Amendment liberties. As such, watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is like watching at least three different movies: You have the rise of the boundary-pushing magazine editor, the drug-addled romance and the courtroom drama. So many events in Flynt's life and facets to his personality warrant a deeper look, yet there's just no time. Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography.At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious.Then there's Courtney Love. Playing Flynt's stripper girlfriend-turned-wife, Althea, Love gives Foreman more than he bargained for. Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day. She's frighteningly real as Althea at some points, especially once she starts mooching off Flynt's painkillers after the assassination attempt.Some of the most compelling drama in the film comes in the courtroom scenes. Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from "The People vs. Larry Flynt," especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen ("Everyone Says I Love You") at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights."The People vs. Larry Flynt" touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that "a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face" is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture.The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the "Wizard of Oz." Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters. At that point you start to identify with Norton's character instead, as he's the only one who understands the balance between defending free speech and making a complete mockery of the judicial system.You'll want this film to be more of everything, particularly of Flynt as the unorthodox crusader for free speech and the magazine publisher who works the line between genius and insanity. The individual moments or scenes of such captivate, but get lost on the whole. The challenge of boiling a fascinating man's life down to a series of striking moments can sometimes be too immense for even the best of filmmakers.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Total Recall" might not be timeless as far as filmmaking goes, but it's certainly a hard movie to forget. "RoboCop" director Paul Verhoeven's take on the Phillip K. Dick story "We Can Remember it For You Wholesale" serves as the perfect snapshot of what late '80s America thought the future would look like -- a "Mad Max" society on Mars and lots of communicating video screens. Part of this memorability comes from cheap methods such as gross-out visual effects and three-breasted prostitutes, but credit also belongs to a story full of roller coaster twists.Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Douglas Quaid, a man with a seemingly loving wife (Sharon Stone), who has vivid dreams about Mars, a planet that has been colonized by America and is at the center of a military controversy. Quaid becomes intrigued by a service that offers the implantation of vacation memories so that one can recall having been somewhere and experienced something without having to take the time to go through it. But instead of getting a nice vacation, the process goes wrong for Quaid and suddenly his friend at work and his wife are not who he thought they were -- and neither is he.Turns out Quaid was a skilled operative who had his memory tampered with previously and his "former self" sent him a message to go back to Mars because he has memories that hold the key to the undoing of the evil General Cohaagen who is oppressing those living on Mars.Mars is a circus sideshow in Las Vegas in this film. There's prostitution and horrendously scarred individuals. Oh, and dwarfs. Needless to say, the vision Verhoeven has for the future is not a very politically correct one and a bit excessive on vice and strangeness only for the sake of being just so. The meat of "Total Recall" lies not in the sci-fi future world the story takes place in, but more in the mystery of who Quaid (or Hauser) actually is.Schwarzenegger is still best suited for playing a machine or straight-up action hero not to be taken seriously, so "Total Recall" might not be the best fit, but he's probably better than most would give him credit for. He doesn't really hurt the film in any way.It seems like "Total Recall" was Verhoeven's attempt to make a visual effects spectacle because he simply had the money thanks to Arnold's star power. Although the story intrigues beyond a doubt, this is not the sci-fi thinker that "Blade Runner' was. Why else would there be so many special effects shots of people's faces puffing up in the vacuum of space? "Total Recall" would easily land on my list of decent films that could be remade and done better, particularly in terms of themes and social relevancy. In the late '80s, these effects were all the rage. Now that cinema has grown up and the average filmmaker with a bit of cash could make the effects of the film happen, it could actually survive as more than a thriller. Hard to blame a film 20 years outside of its context for doing something like that, so I think it just shows the potential for Dick's story to endure as a film.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
While the title and publicized images may pass "Swingers" off as a gimmicky comedy, the film is a lot more down to earth than one might expect.The film stars Jon Favreau, who plays a struggling comedian in L.A. named Mike that has just ended a serious relationship of six years. He turns to his buddies--the most important two of which are played by Vince Vaughn and Ron Livingston--to help him get back on his feet again.Favreau, who makes his debut as a writer and producer with the film, delivers a performance and screenplay that are very natural and realistic. While there is no gut-wrenching humor in the script nor in any one actor's performance, (though we see the roots of Vaughn's now thriving over-the-top comedic success in the film) it is clever through the painful reality of a single man who is clearly having troubles moving on with other women. We laugh at Favreau's struggle, but ultimately it is a result of identification with the social unease his character feels. Most comedies have you laughing at other characters, but many times in "Swingers" we find we're really laughing at ourselves, something that does not happen often in comedy, which allows for enough serious conversation to enter the film while at the same time not feeling overbearing like a drama might. Though Vaughn's advice and Favreau's pick-up skills are clearly laughable, there is a reality to them that strikes a chord.It is easy to want "Swingers" to be over-the-top and full of belly laughs, but it must be looked at as something else. The film could have done with a few bigger laughs and still managed to keep the overall down-to-earth tone, but the truth is it is more about the comedy of real life, which while not as entertaining, is much more honorable in many ways. As a result, it may not ever be known as a great 90s comedy, but it will not go completely overlooked.
"Broadway Danny Rose," other than featuring Woody Allen as a neurotic character attached to the entertainment industry in some fashion, has a much wider appeal than much of Allen's other work. Instead of targeting the upper-middle class with societal rants and characters more concerned with their personal and social lives than anything else, "Danny Rose" is for the working-class folk, a story that aims to humble the Hollywood or Broadway ego that believes that you have to be self-serving to be in show business.The story of the film is told by a bunch of entertainers at the Carnegie Deli in Manhattan, reminiscing about Rose (Allen), an agent for the most obscure acts in New York back in the '50s and '60s. One of them claims to have the best Danny Rose story and his telling serves as narration to the film.The story revolves around Rose and his biggest talent, Lou Canova (Nick Apollo Forte), an old-fashioned Italian crooner doing covers of Sinatra and all kinds of classic tunes from what back then was considered a "bygone era," but Lou is having a resurgence. Problem is he's an alcoholic and a womanizer. He insists on having the woman he's having an affair with attend his big performance at the Waldorf (that could get him a national gig). Other problem is, this Tina (Mia Farrow) was told Lou was cheating on her, so now she's run off to her Italian mob family and through strange circumstances, the mob wants to knock Danny off.There are elements of classic comedy here, which is why the black and white works for "Danny Rose." At the same time, it's a nostalgic film (the early '80s was full of that for Allen) and an intimate one.Without spoiling too much, the key to "Danny Rose" relies in the conflict between self- interest and dependency on others. In a way, it's Allen's way of saying thank you or perhaps apologizing to those that have been part of his personal journey. No one does it alone, especially not Danny Rose, a character whose living is dependent on the talents and aspirations of others and who lives solely by the advice he remembers from deceased relatives. Then there's Lou, who can't perform unless Tina is there but loves his wife dearly, and then Tina, who can't make any major decision without consulting a psychic elderly woman."Danny Rose" has some memorable Woody Allen quotes and classically comical situations such as he and Farrow's Tina "wriggling" their way out of some ropes tying them together as a former escape artist client of Danny's used to say, or when they're chased into the Macy's Day Parade balloon warehouse.The film is simplistic but truthful and it's nice to see Allen make a point that's so universal instead of one about affluent people solving their life crises.
Although any film with the word "Prada" in the title might seem like a chick flick red flag for men and people that don't enjoy romantic comedies, "The Devil Wears Prada" is a surprisingly un-cliché film that is really quite far from a romantic comedy--it's simply a fashion-focused spin on the classic "what happens when you sacrifice your personal life for your career" theme. The film, based on the popular novel, stars Anne Hathaway as Andy, an aspiring journalist who looking for a foot in the door in the Big Apple takes a job as an assistant to Miranda Priestly (played by Meryl Streep, who really steals the film), editor-in-chief of Runway magazine and queen of the fashion industry. Andy, however, doesn't care much for fashion, and Miranda is notorious for being unreasonably demanding, cold and cynical. Regardless, Andy sticks with the job and begins to stray from her goals, affecting her career and personal life with boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier of "Entourage").Streep is simply the highlight of the film, something she's been known to do. She's so convincingly detestable that the script needs no mention of "the devil"--the book/film title makes sense just watching and listening to her. At the same time, Streep also portrays the person inside the stone-cold machine, complicating her character and making the viewer truly think about his or her opinion.At the same time, Hathaway is deserving of recognition that she can be a bankable marquee star. She's way beyond "Princess Diaries" now. Her struggle to fit in, try her hardest, make things with her boyfriend work and decide on her future is so easy to identify with every step of the way. We're never left unsure of what her character is thinking or feeling and that's a tremendous accomplishment. Other noteworthy performances include Stanley Tucci, who also works for Miranda, as the effeminate mentor Andy turns to when she needs help fitting in with the fashion scene, and Emily Blunt as Miranda's other assistant who is a nervous wreck.Directing the film is David Frankel, whose experience directing a handful of "Sex and the City" episodes certainly comes in handy. He makes sure all the critical fashion elements of the film are shown off, including some effective montages that show a variety of outfits to appeal to the female audience. Although I haven't read the book, Aline Brosh McKenna delivers a very witty script that steers clear from all things cheesy. Some of the lines that Streep and Tucci have will make you think about fashion in a totally new way.So what makes the film male-friendly? It has to do with the fact that Andy's struggle is incredibly universal. The struggle between trying to advance your career and holding on to what you care about most is something that anyone can understand. Also, everyone in working world knows that feeling of complete powerlessness that Miranda forces upon Andy. Streep is so easy to hate because she has some oppressive qualities that we all relate to in our lives. Lastly, guys don't have to fear their being too much romantic drama between Andy and Nate. Their relationship exists for the sake of affecting Andy and contributing to the film's themes. They barely feel like a couple on the screen. The other romantic relationship between Andy and a major journalist figure played by Simon Baker doesn't get too sappy either.
It will always remain a mystery as to what took so long for just a good old computer animation version of a Dr. Seuss story. "The Grinch" and "The Cat in the Hat" had their entertainment value, but the confines of the real world simply don't reflect the towering imagination of one Mr. Theodor Geisel. "Horton Hears a Who!" conveys that spirit of wacky yet message-driven entertainment.The iconic elephant, voiced by Jim Carrey and tailored to his talents as a comic actor, is playfully naive in this adaptation from "Ice Age" studio 20th Century Fox Animation. HIs sense of unbound imagination and inherent goofiness will resonate well with children as that rare combination of coming off both as friend and mentor. Surrounded by a Seuss- appropriate cast of the oddest creatures, his story of discovering an entire world of Whos upon a speck resting on a flower is the closest children's stories will ever get to the sense of cosmic existentialism and for that reason it's a powerful story to be able to be told at such a basic level."Horton Hears a Who" pits two ideologies -- one a clear winner from the get-go -- against each other: imagination versus common sense. Kangaroo (Carol Burnett) believes Horton telling the children of the jungle that there are tiny people in this speck is a poisonous idea and she'll stop at nothing to control the way her little one and the other children see the world. In the real world, the clear winner is Kangaroo, but rightfully so in a children's story, it's imagination that will take the day. Despite that inevitably conclusion, "Horton" is attention-grabbing with a bright sense of humor and ceaseless charisma.Few films blend genuinely clever humor with physical kid humor, but "Horton" does both with little extra effort. There are the nonsensical gags such as the little gerbil-like character who makes the most bizarre facial expressions and mentions that in her little world the people "eat rainbows and poop butterflies." The delivery is the adult-geared joke and the word "poop" catches the youngsters off-guard too. One sequence is a Horton spoof on anime which is simply hilarious if you have seen any anime before, but even if kids haven't, the fast-tempo of this bizarre sequence with Horton pretending he's a ninja will elicit laughs.Animation is not a focal point with this story. Fox has gone for a cartoony look that best exemplifies the bright bold colors of the Seuss books. A Seuss adaptation should without question have a look of its own and not conform to most animation studios nearly unflappable belief that more realism in animation is better. Fox picks and chooses where to be realistic (use of light, being one example).The central moral of "a person's a person, no matter how small" lies at the center of "Horton," but doesn't squeeze its way in or dominate the story to the point where the ending is cheesy. Well, the whole cast singing "Can't Fight this Feeling" is a little cheesy, but it's also reflective of how joyfully random the film is.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
David Lynch's "Mulholland Dr." is like one of those video games that the programmers make so amazing yet so impossibly difficult that in order to be fully satisfied you're forced to buy one of those walkthrough game guides. The film might be a masterpiece, but it's a Rubix cube of surrealism that prefers to leave you with more questions than answers.Psychological thriller barely begins describing "Mulholland Dr." Most notably, Lynch has no lack of ability to create suspense. Despite being a total mindfudge (implication of more explicit language necessary), the film is completely gripping and will not lose any viewer for a second. You could argue the beginning is not very deliberate, but to understand the film everything is essential.On Mulholland Dr. a woman (Laura Elena Harring) survives a fatal car accident but is left with amnesia, wandering her way to an apartment of a woman heading out of town who happens to be the aunt of Betty (Naomi Watts) a starry-eyed aspiring actress who has come to stay in LA while her aunt is gone. Together, the two try and find some answers as to the woman's identity. Meanwhile, a Hollywood director (Justin Theroux) is without his lead actress and being pressured by mobsters to select a particular one.But plot is a side dish in this movie. As hard as it is to do, the way it's best enjoyed (and I wish I'd known this pre-hindsight) is to take in the visuals and emotions and tame that instinctive plot detective inside all of us. The beauty of Lynch's work is best understood by what the events and images of the film suggest. Don't view them as tangible proof of factual happenings in the film, but as manifestations.Put on those lenses and Lynch's work is easier to appreciate. The slow movement through the sets, the symbolism, the bizarre but intriguing transitions and the way the film's score works flawlessly to direct your every thought and inclination -- it's all there if you can manage to let go of the plot when necessary.It's hard to analyze the film any deeper without exposing the cheat sheet -- even if you'll probably need to look at it anyway. Lynch has even listed a number of things to pay attention to to help understand his film -- you can look those up on IMDb or anywhere before watching and it could help.Does the fixation on surrealism hurt "Mulholland Dr," not necessarily, but the best films don't require hints or cheat sheets to love and in order to love "Mulholland Dr.," you have to know what's going on and that's a lot for the vast majority of movie watchers to handle. Appreciation for Lynch's skill is easy to develop, but it would be best if it were simultaneous with digesting the story.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
"Serpico" will always be one of the more compelling biographies ever made because its main character, even in the face of an unfair and corrupt world, clings to the virtue of honesty and comes out all right. Stories like that of Frank Serpico, a NYC cop in the late '60s - early '70s who bravely testified against police corruption, fascinate us because they make us wonder what we would do in that character's shoes and feel glad that at the end of the day we don't have to answer that question. Al Pacino stars as the man with these trivial choices, Frank Serpico, who was asked to be the snitch for the NYPD in the Bronx in terms of identifying officers taking bribes from criminals, a role that subjected him to harassment and threats from his fellow officers and caused him extreme amounts of trauma affecting his job and his personal life.Well all come to believe that a police officer's first duty is to the people -- to do the right thing. So does Serpico, so as he has the startling revelation that there's almost no one clean in the police department, we experience the same thing. Our perceptions change as dramatically as Pacino's acting. Initially, Serpico, comes off as this mousy do-good character, a good fit for Pacino's 5'7" frame. When things get bad, the dramatic styles of Pacino that we've come to know over the years really pour out. No one can yell as effectively on screen as Pacino, but he also knows when to step back and command the screen without the use of dialogue. Teaming him with director Sidney Lumet, who always knows how to pick out a script's most dramatic moment, is essentially perfect. "Serpico" is sandwiched between both major Godfather films, and it offers definite proof of Pacino's leading talents.The script, written partially by Waldo Salt ("Midnight Cowboy") is adequate enough to give us a taste of Serpico's moral dilemma. Most of the effective parts are the melodramatic scenes that allow Pacino to use those famous pipes. Everyone in the supporting cast is pretty much forgettable too -- they're all actors prescribed to Hollywood's older school of supporting acting roles: just speak with authority in your voice. It's fine, since the film would rather us just identify the as the collective "powers of corruption.""Serpico" is not Lumet's best work, but it has its moments of great visual strength as all his films generally have. He's probably one of the best ever up there with Hitchcock in terms of picking his close-ups. This is really Pacino's chance to shine anyway.What's respectable about the overall tone of the film is that it doesn't preach morals or make empty promises that the good will always be rewarded in the end and the bad punished -- instead, it says that hard honest work counts for something. Serpico takes a bullet to the face for all his grief and leaves the force and the country not long after. Not exactly a happy ending, but a different way of inspiring us in the sense that at least the corruption didn't win.
The new millennium has found its new action hero and it's not XXX or Pierce Brosnan's James Bond -- It's Jason Bourne. Based on the popular Robert Ludlum novel, "The Bourne Identity" finally makes the solo action protagonist work in the era of amped up stunts and special effects. Bourne is slick, skilled, way smart and attractive and best of all: he doesn't even know who he is. While more fast-paced and driven by mystery than most action heroes (certainly not as leisurely as James Bond), "Bourne" finally delivers the no-nonsense hero we all rightfully deserve.We are introduced immediately to Jason Bourne (Damon) as he is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea with two bullets in his back. When he wakes, he has suffered a complete memory loss. Interestingly enough, however, he finds he has a pretty incredible skill set that includes some sort of mixed martial arts and heightened environmental awareness. Slowly he pieces his life together, only to find he's wanted dead for some reason by the CIA, who presumably he used to work for. While on the run, he picks up Marie (German actress Franke Potente, "Blow") who decides to join the goose chase rather than ditch him and take his cash.The film carries a pretty all-star cast including Chris Cooper and Brian Cox as CIA higher ups and Julia Stiles and Clive Owen in smaller roles. They help sort of spread out your interest in the mystery elements of the film, mainly the very large and looming enigma that is Jason Bourne. As it is part of a greater series "Identity" doesn't exactly answer all your questions, but it clearly establishes who Bourne is and why the audience should care about him.The concept of Bourne not knowing who he is at the film is a very obvious entry point for the audience--we are meant to learn about Bourne as he uncovers the truth himself and identify with him and his actions/choices as a result. He may be much more of a super spy in terms of the sweet moves he pulls on his enemies and not how many gadgets he uses (none), his drive to understand why he is that way keeps it real for us.Matt Damon is a great fit for Bourne. He pulls of the sort of robotic, lay down the law quality that is Bourne's action hero side, but he does get across the internal struggle to understand himself that makes him human. Potente as the leading lady is an odd choice; the casting directors were certainly not going for a knockout in the looks department (or acting for that matter) but her very generic looks sort of help ground the film in reality in a way. Not every action hero is meant to hook up with a supermodel equivalent.Most importantly, the action is really well paced and exciting, impressive for director Doug Liman's first action film. The fights are incredibly well-choreographed and the editing is nothing short of fantastic. While the script tries to awkwardly heighten the drama at times, you're really too caught up in the story and the action sequences to care too much about what Bourne and Marie are saying to each other. This is a spy thriller first, ask deeper questions later movie and best of all, you never shake your head at it. Welcome to the new age of action heroes.
Houston might have had a problem, but Hollywood has a gem. "Apollo 13" out-rivals any space film in its believability and quality. Nothing about space in this film seems like science-fiction and for all the technical jargon, it's really easy to follow, resulting an a deeply moving film.It might be like "Titanic," where you know that the ship is going to sink in the end, but still, "Apollo 13" moves you through its characters and the way the story is told. It might also be a near 2.5 hour drama, but it keeps things rolling as well and you don't ever get bored. The premise surrounds the historic "successful failure" of the Apollo 13 shuttle's attempt to land on the moon, a mission lead by Jim Lovell, played by Tom Hanks, whose patience and poise make him a fascinating character. The bulk of the film is Houston and the crew working together to do whatever they can to get these men back home alive.Simply put, the acting here conveys the danger of the return mission and just how serious it all is. Ed Harris, for example, as NASA flight director Gene Kranz is other-worldly commanding on the screen. These actors suck you in to the last detail of what's going on, the great screenplay pads that with actual media coverage of the event to convey a sense of how the world is feeling, and then Ron Howard steps in to make the transitions flawless (with the help his Oscar-winning editors) There are times where a scene will show in the shuttle, in Houston, inside Lovell's family's home, at the nursing home where his mother lives, etc. all within minutes of each other and it's not confusing at all. No single thread seems overdone, they all work cohesively.Since the focus is on the characters and problem-solving, space does not become an integral part of the storytelling. It is contextual and is used to help convey the astronauts drive and motivation. For example, at first when things on the shuttle go wrong, it's not "oh, I hope we survive" but "damnit, we can't go to the moon now." Especially for Lovell, the missed opportunity for space is something that nags at him despite just being glad he survived. That is what makes this film a great space film: space is simply a new place for disaster drama to play out and make us wonder about the implications of being in danger so far from home."Apollo 13" doesn't have all the suspense that a film with a lesser publicly known outcome has, but it certainly gets you riding its emotional train to triumph. It's not glitzy, it doesn't over-glorify space and while it might have taken a hit on the entertainment value one might expect from a space movie, it more than makes up for with great, engaging storytelling.
We waited long enough to see what Alfonso Cuaron had in store for us next, but no one expected a visual effects game-changer. "Gravity" is an experience, something you might expect to see at a science museum in IMAX but with an intense plot. And even though its minuscule cast and real-time feel expose it to plot holes and improbabilities, it is truly something to behold.Sandra Bullock stars as Dr. Ryan Stone, a genius engineer on a mission to update the Hubble Space Telescope with a crew of veteran astronauts, including Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney), on his late mission before retirement. When a Russian missile strike on a satellite goes awry, it causes a field of debris to come flying at their shuttle, but before they can entirely abort the mission, the shuttle is obliterated and Kowalski and Stone are sent hurtling into space with little chance of survival."Gravity" shares qualities with both disaster films and sci-fi space opuses. In the context of outer space, Cuaron's long takes are reminiscent of "2001: A Space Odyssey," but "Gravity" is less intellectual and more of a survival tale with poetic aspects. It consists of a range of tones, from intense to reflective, from claustrophobic to vast and empty  all within a 90-minute run time. You'll feel this movie in your bones after you get up.No matter how you feel about "Gravity," taking the time to consider how the film was made will turn any opinions into total admiration. Although none of us can truly relate to the physics of space, creating a movie in which gravity does not exist (notice the poetic irony of the title?) has to be considered a hell of a feat. And Cuaron doesn't just make a movie set in space, he insists on making it feel as though it were filmed in space. He tries just about everything with the camera, from shots inside Stone's helmet to seemingly endless tracking shots. Pulling this off with as much authenticity as he appears to have, is worth nothing short of a high commendation.The lack of characters in "Gravity" puts a lot of pressure on Bullock and Clooney to be interesting enough to capture our attention. Bullock's constant panic is painful, but in doing so she maintains the film's adrenaline rush, and her humanity wins enough sympathy to make the quest for survival at the heart of the story work. Without a strong performance here, "Gravity" would in fact slowly drift into obscurity; she provides a vested interest in the outcome of the disaster."Gravity" contains very few traditional storytelling devices. Only the sequence of events has a Hollywood feel to it in that it's rather contrived; there's no way Stone manages to come out unscathed during various debris showers, for example. Moments of disbelief will crop up all over "Gravity," so when you add in the slower, imagery-driven moments along with some dialogue that's squeezed in so that we get to know Stone a bit, it's a surprise that the reaction to "Gravity" has been so universally strong.Without question, "Gravity" demonstrates what 3D filmmaking is supposed to look like and be used for, and should set the bar for filmmakers aspiring to use it. Considering Cuaron directs the film to be an immersive experience, the 3D magnifies this effect to a considerable degree. Few films have conveyed the "experience" of a movie the way "Gravity" has, an accomplishment that makes fretting over the script contrivances feel like a petty waste of time that totally misses the point. "Gravity" will long be remembered as a defining example of the history and development of filmmaking in the 3D era.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out more at moviemusereviews.com
Though there have been a few attempts to quickly turn over a good film about the Iraq War or a similar conflict ("The Lucky Ones," "In the Valley of Elah," "Jarhead," "The Kingdom"), none achieve on so many levels and try to capture the true experience of today's soldiers like "The Hurt Locker."Former embedded journalist Mark Boal (who wrote the story for "Elah") captures the spirit of this particular war with his story about a team of bomb diffusers who work with IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices). The story mainly focuses on one bomb specialist, Sgt. Will James (Jeremy Renner), who enters the picture after the team's beloved Sgt. Thompson (Guy Pearce) dies on the job. James is highly skilled, but also totes an action junkie attitude that creates tension between him and his fellow squad members.What will unfortunately surprise a lot of people watching this film is its director, Kathryn Bigelow. If you have any doubts of a woman's ability to make a Grade A action film than throw them out the window. Bigelow, who also directed action cult favorite "Point Break" and the okay film "K-19: The Widowmaker" paves the way for women action directors with this excellent film. She sets a precedent for what today's war film should look like with the raw, camcorder style that gives "Hurt Locker" its realistic, documentary feel. Screw the awing cinematography of "Saving Private Ryan," the Iraq War is not to be glorified by the camera in any way, especially considering it's still going on.Other war films dabble in the glory of war, the traumatic effects it has on its soldiers and its many other evils, but "Hurt Locker" dares to consider the temptations, the allure of war despite its disastrous affects. Its main character, James, is certainly troubled, but not because of seeing death or risking it every time he tries to diffuse a homemade C4 bomb -- it's because he needs the adrenaline rush of feeling like he's doing something dangerous and important.To Bigelow, that is the defining characteristic of this war and James embodies it. He alone at times is the sole cause of action and tension in the film. We think to ourselves that he's in a dangerous situation with a bomb threat -- then he takes his protective suit off and the intensity is magnified. In that way, Bigelow plays off our own desire to see action and suspense. It would be a whole lot nicer if the guys stayed out of trouble considering they're set to be sent home in less than a month's time, but it wouldn't be exciting. James mirrors our own action fetishism in that way, and herein lies the film's true excellence."The Hurt Locker" is an interesting film and the first originally poignant piece of cinema to be attached to the Iraq War in a way that makes a statement that films embodying Vietnam or World War II haven't already made. It's unknown cast is talented and helps keep the film much more realistic. There's something about seeing actors that are too well known in war films that instantly glamorizes it and detracts from its impact. To boot, there's a lot of great suspense and action. Scenes where nothing ultimately happens put us on the edge of our seats because they're well set-up. The soldiers' paranoia among other things translates well to an audience unaware of the true dangers of the Iraq War and highlights what makes this time significant in our history compared to any other. This is the kind of movie that could be used as a means of understanding the Iraq War years and years from now, especially in terms of grasping the perspective we had before it was even over.
A small but existent segment of the American population believes that any and all combinations of cars, guns and naked women make for the perfect care-free cinematic cocktail. But like any cocktail, there's a perfect blend required, not simply throwing them in a blend-er. Behold the difference between the "Fast and Furious" franchise and "Drive Angry." The former, for example, understands that women make the cars more beautiful, whereas Patrick Lussier, writer and director of "Drive Angry," believes that they go together because they're two things men like."Drive Angry" is not the awful kind of schlocky grindhouse flick, but it's completely hollow filmmaking. Shot in 3D, when you watch the film in the "inferior" two dimensions, you can tell the film was meant to be watched in 3D the way bullets and shrapnel come toward the camera. Fans of the 3-D medium who despise converted 3D will rejoice at the director's intention to use it, but this intention serves nothing more than the purpose of gimmick. In other words, cars, guns, naked women  and 3D.Who better for the driver seat than Nicolas Cage? Sporting yet another hairstyle, Cage gets to play angry stoic man escaped from hell. Vengeance, of course, lies at the heart of any reputable exploitation flick, so at least Lussier and writing partner Todd Farmer understand their genre. The execution, however, comes off as amateur, especially in an age with folks such as Robert Rodriguez pulling off the genre in a modern era with more success  and humor especially.Creativity for "Drive Angry" comes in the form of Cage's Milton shooting down several religious fanatics trying to kill him with farming tools  all while maintaining sexual intercourse with the waitress from the bar next door. That could be chalked up to a genre signature, but it doesn't serve any other purpose in the film. Usually the nudity or sex tells us something about the lone wolf lead character or adds to his mystique, but it really doesn't in this case. Milton's motivation is to get back his baby granddaughter from a Satanist cult that intends to sacrifice her. Having escaped from hell to do so and with Satan's "accountant" (William Fichtner) on his tail, his actions should be pretty clear-cut. After all, he doesn't even fall for the young blonde he's picked up for the ride (Amber Heard).Heard represents that kick-ass feminist force in the male-centric exploitation flick. Piper vice grips her boss's balls when he puts his hands on her at work and then promptly quits, goes home early in her '69 Charger with "I Break for Pussy" on the bumper and finds another woman on top of her fiancé. I won't spoil what happens after, but this spirit creates the bond between her and Milton as well as a troubled past relationship between Milton and his daughter for which Piper provides a second chance. Heard will one day be too A-list and above this material, so she's refreshing in the role.Fichtner, who plays the devil's right hand of sorts, also brings a fun performance to the film. He's not one of those typical self-assured villains in spite of his other-worldly abilities, but he possesses the same malice. The slightest sense of humility makes him a memorable character despite the cliché role. Billy Burke as Jonah King, the Satanist who fancies himself better than everyone else, goes a bit more over-the-top, but also makes an effective villain.The action of "Drive Angry," though much more about guns and gore than cars, satisfies for the most part except when it kowtows to the 3D. For those not watching with special glasses, that sort of zaps you out of the story. "Drive Angry" ends up being everything you'd expect it to be, provided you expected a 3-D camp-fest manufactured in a petri dish. There's definitely a place for those kinds of films, but the distinguishing factor between good and bad exploitation lies in disguising the man behind the curtain, the puppeteer or whatever force putting that product together merely to entertain at the surface level. "Drive Angry" entertains, but the failure to conceal prevents any investment into the story or characters.~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
It only seemed a matter of time before the genre of magic, specifically in an era outside of our own, was seized by Hollywood hands with "The Illusionist" and soon "Batman Begins" director Christopher Nolan's upcoming "The Prestige." With CGI to make magic seem even more eerily believable, what audience doesn't love magic? "Illiusionist" takes advantage of this fact, mesmerizing the audience and intriguing them with the thought that the illusions might actually be possible. The problem is that the film sometimes lets this get in the way with the real human element of the film, the love story, which is supposed to be the most important part.Edward Norton's character Eisenheim the Illusionist is merely a talented magician who after many years encounters his childhood sweetheart, Sophie (Jessica Biel), a girl of the upper class with which Eisenhiem is unfortunately not affiliated. The problem is that Sophie is nearly engaged to the Crown Prince of Vienna (Rufus Sewell). The Crown Prince's interest in magic reunites the two, who fall back in love. When Eisenheim sacrifices some of the prince's dignity for the sake of his magic, the prince requests that Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) do what he must to bring Eisenheim down. The two lovers then find themselves in a situation bound to tear them apart.Love, therefore, becomes the motivation for nearly all Norton's actions, but we see the plot instead being driven by the film's other conflicts, namely Giamatti's character's internal conflict between his allegiance to the prince and the truth. He seems to take over the protagonists role at a point during the film. We also get to see very little of the romance that drives the film aside from a couple of scenes that this motivation gets blurred. While these other elements that distract are entertaining and meaningful, the story's ability to grab the viewer's heartstrings is muffled. It's all very interesting from the illusions themselves to the mystery at hand, but the extra step needed for the film to flourish is a true grasp of the love story. You'll be intrigued and entertained, which is sometimes all you need, but the film cheats itself out of the opportunity to be a real sleeper.
Somehow, James L. Brooks manages to bring movies closer to the brink of reality than any other filmmaker without creating a total snooze fest on screen. "Terms of Endearment" tells a story of a mother-daughter relationship in strictly chronological fashion, but instead of a traditional plot arc, the plot ascends gradually up toward a conclusion with little spikes for memorable events along the way. What would surely be a pitfall for other writers and directors, Brooks maneuvers around deftly, drawing moving performances from his cast and painting complete and honest portraits of the main characters.The non-traditional plot structure gives "Terms of Endearment" a different sort of energy, one that relies less on a forward momentum and more on dissecting characters and relationships. Brooks lures us into drawing conclusions about the characters and then almost always proves us wrong. Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) comes out of the gate as an overbearing mother who manufactured a particular kind of relationship with her daughter, Emma (Debra Winger). Although she's hardly a wonderful woman, as the film progresses her other layers develop and suddenly we're looking at one of film's most impressively sculpted and dynamic characters, not the embodiment of the domineering matriarch as once expected. Equal credit belongs to MacLaine for selling it of course, which makes her Oscar win oh so worthy.Winger certainly deserves half that Oscar as was the sentiment of most at the 1984 Oscars. MacLaine's role has more sizzle, but the story mainly belongs to Emma. As a young woman who's always been emotionally responsible for her mother instead of the other way around, Emma has to be a bit psychologically imbalanced and Winger reflects that in her portrayal. She's sexually self-assured and fiercely self-sufficient, especially when it comes to taking care of her three children that pop up throughout the film's duration, but the negative impact shows in her relationship with her husband Flap (Jeff Daniels). She's prone to fits of jealous rage when she feels as if she's not the center of his universe.Both main characters find themselves in challenging situations with regards to love that make up a bulk of the conflict until things take a decidedly tough turn in the third act. Emma's doubts about her husbands fidelity lead her to stray from her marriage with a loan officer named Sam (John Lithgow). Her mother, on the other hand, has shut out men sexually for decades despite spurring their advances for want of attention, but she's intrigued by Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson), the astronaut who lives next door and prefers younger women. Their unlikely relationship provides the comedy of the film, but it evolves into something meaningful by the end. Nicholson gives the type of performance he would later become famous for, but the novelty of it here understandably won him the Oscar."Terms of Endearment" can't be called typical or easy; it hits you in the gut with an emotional reality check, one that's unannounced and maybe even unfair to the viewer. Rather than preach its outlook on life or take up other methods to soften the blow, it asks you embrace it without questions. Life can be (and often is) bad, maybe really bad, but there's a lot of good too; whether we accept it or not, hope floats.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Somewhere between "Paul Blart: Mall Cop" and "Observe and Report," there has to be at least a decent movie about a mall security guard. Or maybe Hollywood should just forget about this cliché-ripe "genre" altogether."Observe and Report" is the latest film to shove a tubby comedian (Seth Rogen) into a mock police officer's uniform and endow him with an exaggerated sense of justice and self- importance. Ronnie Barnhardt is a gun-loving ignoramus who turns everything into a joke and believe it or not is surrounded by even less competent and pathetic co-workers. Their livelihood is threatened when a flasher begins visually assaulting people in the parking lot, namely Ronnie's crush, Brandi (Anna Faris) the shallow cosmetics girl, and the police (fronted by Ray Liotta) are brought in to handle the mess.Ronnie is a pretty poorly executed character to begin with. By far Rogen's worst performance, Ronnie's idiot charms are not funny and he doesn't come off as lovable as creator Jody Hill intended. Hill's previous morally questionable protagonist, a karate instructor in "The Foot Fist Way" -- his debut film -- played by Danny McBride, was far more successful at earning sympathy despite an abundance of character flaws. McBride belongs in the role (he was reduced to a cameo) but Rogen got the part for having a bigger name. It's actually kind of sad: Ronnie not only has big dreams for himself, but he has a history of psychosis and a temperamental moral compass that says it's okay to have sex with a girl who's drunk and vomiting but that it's not cool to steal from the mall. That's a hint as to how this comedy that purports itself as a run-of-the-mill ends up rearing its explicit, politically incorrect and shockingly dark head to an unsuspecting audience. It's pretty messed up and Hill wanted it that way, leading us in with a stereotypical cast of misfits and deadpan humor only to redirect us in a way that simply doesn't jive.At one point when Ronnie's at his lowest, he turns to his friend Dennis, a Mexican security guard with a lisp, who says he knows exactly what Ronnie needs, which is hardcore drug usage of every kind. Conceptually, it's funny, but it's just kind of disturbing when you actually see it. Snorting cocaine and injecting heroine can only be so funny -- I know, who'd have thought? This is one of many ineffective soundtrack montages."Observe and Report" was supposed to be a politically incorrect comedy about what happens when your ridiculousness and reality are forced to confront each other, but the message I took away was that under no circumstances, ever, should you stop taking your medication if you're bipolar unless a doctor says it's okay. If you do, you'll start doing drugs, violently commit acts of civil disobedience and make the cute girl at the coffee counter who you're too dumb to notice cry her eyes out. If only we could be so wise.
There's exploiting the criminal justice system and then there's Clyde Shelton's (Gerard Butler) exploiting of the criminal justice system, which involves killing everyone connected to it. Right and wrong is hardly black and white in any good movie and in "Law Abiding Citizen" it's hardly a hundred shades of gray. Shelton is a man who lost is family and didn't get the justice he thought he deserved in the prosecution of his family's killers. Ten years later he not only gets his "justice" by killing both guys, but also when he's taken to prison he begins to orchestrate a series of murders seemingly while in solitary confinement.Shelton is a combination of the vengeful father character and The Joker -- Heath Ledger's Joker, that is. A series of carefully planned murders help him to try and make his point about the inherent flaws in the U.S criminal justice system while the attorney who wouldn't take his case all the way (Jamie Foxx) tries to stop him knowing full well he could be next. "Citizen" is not a brilliant deconstruction of American law, but it exposes it impressively and manages to make that concept turn into an exciting thriller.The harshest critics of "The Dark Knight" are liable to have the same problems with this film: plot holes. Screenwriter Kurt Wimmer, who wrote the Pierce Brosnan remake of "The Thomas Crown Affair" and the solid sci-fi dystopia film "Equilibrium" is experienced enough to make the film believable for most of the movie, but any film about a mad man concocting the most grandiose and precise murders and not failing is bound to produce skeptical viewers and rightfully so.It's an ambitious film, but in that sense and also in trying to be both entertaining thriller and social commentary, managing to succeed at one and come awfully close with the latter. The only reason the commentary falls short is because the action takes the film so far away from the original incident of Clyde's family being killed and his first act of revenge that it sets up the conflict and the "what is justice?" themes better than it carries them out to their end. Nevertheless "Citizen" is clever and at times brilliant. Butler and Foxx are credible talents and lend themselves to this film very well. Veterans Colm Meaney and Bruce McGill also round out the cast impressively and certainly director F. Gary Gray ("The Italian Job") has his credentials. It gives a needed boost to Starz' Overture Films, which aside from "Sunshine Cleaning" is a studio that hasn't had much to hang its hat on just yet.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
There's not a whole lot to complain about with "Superman Returns," acclaimed director Bryan Singer's crack at reinventing that Man of Steel for the 21st century. At the same time, there isn't a whole lot to love either, especially if you're an action junkie and require a lot of it in your superhero film diet. Although the CGI is fantastic, Singer ultimately sacrifices too much action for the sake of developing his characters. As much as the latter really makes a superhero film rise above the rest, action and excitement is the massive foundation and reason for the success of the genre."Superman Returns" puts us in Metropolis after Superman has been gone for a long time. Even Lois Lane, played by Kate Bosworth, has written an article called "why the world doesn't need Superman" and won a Pulitzer for it. Of course when Lex Luthor (Spacey) gets his hands on a crystal from the Fortress of Solitude, all of that changes and Superman must come to the world's aide again.The idea here is particularly brave. Because Superman is the most cinematically developed superhero of all time, Singer and his writing team decided to tackle the idea of a society's relationship to its superhero given the premise they devised. There was no need for another origin story and many of Superman's adventures had already been played on the big screen, so what about telling the story of a place that once had a superhero who then disappeared? It's really smart, but on the screen it just doesn't capture our attention.No complaints with the casting at all. Brandon Routh is a solid Superman/Clark Kent, Bosworth is good, Marsden is good, and Spacey as Luthor and Parker Posey as Kitty Carlisle are excellently strange and capturing of the mood of the original films. There's nothing wrong there, it's just a complete lack of excitement. While Superman's universe is well- documented, this adaptation and vision is completely new and we were kind of expected to just catch on and really care about the characters. Superman fans have such a well- developed concept of Clark Kent and Lois Lane already, but not Kate Bosworth and Brandon Routh. There's a big difference, and "Superman Returns" doesn't recognize that.So while some brave questions/themes are brewing, the surface level stuff (the far-fetched diabolical scheme, though a staple of "Superman" movies is still off-putting) is just not strong enough to make "Superman Returns" a nostalgic thrill-ride. Instead, it's a lame, but well-imagined/conceived movie with a great heart but some less-than-memorable scenes and action.
When you're going back and watching classic films, sometimes you happen upon something that encapsulates its style or genre so essentially that you mistake it for being unoriginal. That's how I felt initially about "The Maltese Falcon," but it's far from unoriginal, especially when you consider the amount of talent it brought to the big screen in John Huston, Sydney Greenstreet and Humphrey Bogart.Of course the genre to which we're speaking in this case is film noir, evident enough by the amount of smoking in the film and the main character being a private investigator, though surprisingly there's no narration. Plus, it's driven by mystery and deception.Bogart stars as Sam Spade, whose P.I. firm of Spade and Archer gets a shakeup when a women identifying herself as Ms. Wonderly (Mary Astor) comes to their office and asks that they tail a Mr. Thursby, who she says ran off with her sister. Archer takes the job, though the woman's innocence looks like a sure rouse.Well, turns out indeed that none of that was true, as that evening both Archer and Thursby are found dead. Spade knows of the connection, and it puts him in a way with the police. He needs answers from Wonderly, who turns out to be named Brigid O'Shaughnessy, but he also needs money. He agrees to put up with her lies so long as he gets paid and gets a lead so that he can stay a step ahead of the police.Spade isn't crooked, but he's no saint of a main character. He's driven by the same things as the many supporting characters that become wrapped in this mystery and he's just as self- serving and manipulative. Spade sticks to his guns, which involves never getting in so deep that he can't keep his head above it all.Because Bogart practically created the mold for the noir protagonist, he deserves all the credit in the world as Spade. He owns every scene in the film (granted the camera only leaves his side once at the very beginning) and Only Peter Lorre, one of the greatest character actors of all time, can go toe-to-toe with Bogart as Joel Cairo, one of the men after the titular statuette. Astor has her moments in the film as her character's shell starts to finally crack at the end, but Bogart is the man here.Mystery drives the "The Maltese Falcon" more than suspense. The closer to the end the more the suspense takes over, but in the early going we are left without a clue as to what's going on; all we can tell is that everyone, especially Brigid, is probably lying. Spade has to work really hard to get a modicum of truth out of anyone, and only a person of his awareness has what it takes to sort through it all.The film is forthright in its deception and wastes no time trying to convince you of anything one particular thing being the truth. It makes it hard to care much at the beginning, but as all the players come into the picture with Brigid, Cairo, Wilmer (Elisha Cook Jr.) and Kasper Gutman (Greenstreet) it's easier to get a bit more invested in the outcome.As a first time director, Huston excels down the stretch in his debut and also at ratcheting up our interest after one of the film's many long dialogue-heavy scenes usually by giving us a mysterious or suspenseful image to carry our interest into the next scene or creating a major tone shift. It's not quite to a Hitchcockian degree, but it has a similar effect.When it's not long-winded "The Maltese Falcon" works. It engages its audience and keeps things interesting until the end with some performances that simply have come to define Hollywood's most classic genre.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Let's hope that Hollywood's portrayal of the CIA is off, otherwise at this point every person with an appetite for action-thrillers knows exactly what goes on at Langley. "Safe House" is the latest "Bourne"-inspired romp featuring armed-and-dangerous Americans running, driving and parkouring through an exotic locale. Mostly well-paced and featuring an unusual relationship between leads Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington, "Safe House" entertains and carves out its own niche, though it ultimately stumbles over its (and its genres) own predictability.The story gives us Washington just how we like himmorally unpredictable. Tobin Frost is a longtime CIA field agent gone rogue who delivers himself into the protection of the U.S Consulate in South Africa to avoid some men who want him dead. Doing so puts him back on the CIA's map and he is subsequently delivered to a local safe house attended by aspiring field agent Matt Weston (Reynolds). When the safe house is compromised, the two go on the run, but Weston must also keep the dangerous Frost in his custody.David Guggenheim's screenplay doesn't hide much from the audience here: if a CIA safe house has been compromised, than somebody can't be trusted, and the folks at the top (Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson and Sam Shepard) are so cardboard that it hardly matters who's to blame. Still, the ride there will suffice, especially when it features the Reynolds-Washington dynamic.Washington is the archetype of ambiguity, which ironically makes him a little less ambiguous, but few do what he does well as well as he does. Reynolds refreshingly averts from his sarcastic hero routine to play a man who rises to meet the stakes while sticking to his guns all the same. Reynolds' caliber wasn't needed for the role of Weston by any means, but he does it well and proves his likable qualities.Their exchanges mostly consist of Frost trying to impart his broken view of life and the Agency unto Weston and then we wait to see if Weston breaks. The only real uncertainty is what Frost's next move will be as he tries to shake his "escort." With a traitor in the CIA, we also know that wherever they go, someone will be after them.Director Daniel Espinosa might not be a graduate of the Paul Greengrass School for Shaky Cam, but he definitely audited a good number of classes to say the least. Perhaps it's the absurd degree of hand-to-hand combat featured in the film that evokes the "Bourne" comparison (or the chase atop the slum houses), but at the least it does not cheat on the action. There isn't much spectacle, but that's what makes it more in the thriller vein as well.In general, Espinosa gets above-average grades for delivering the kinetic style necessary to make a basic riff on the cat-and-mouse thriller entertain. He would certainly do better with better material at his disposal.There's just enough fresh material in "Safe House" to keep the story interesting and the leads certainly help with keeping us invested in the outcomes of their characters. That's more than most standard-order action-thrillers can boast, and "Safe House" deserves at least that much credit.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
John Hughes wrote a lot of great comedies in the '80s. "European Vacation" is not one of them. The follow-up to Hughes' first big hit "Vacation" (1983), is about as predictable, unfunny and annoying as they come -- no matter how much you love the dumb but romantic Clark and Ellen Griswold (Chase and D'Angelo).I greatly enjoyed "Vacation" as well as the third film, 1989's "Christmas Vacation," but the Griswold's trip to Europe is bland and forced. Perhaps because this was Hughes' first attempt at a sequel that he didn't get it, but it's really dumbfounding how uninspired and devoid of a story "European Vacation" is. There is no through story: the Griswolds win a game show for being "greedy little pigs" and go on a tour of Europe through England, France, Germany and Italy. Even the screwball physical humor that is the trademark of the first loses all effect because you see it coming, which is part director Amy Heckerling's fault. The "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" director sets everything up too predictably.Maybe it was Hughes taking a cheap shot because he was put up to the sequel. "European Vacation" takes great pride in insulting Americans (recall the greedy little pig game show they win), especially tourists, represented by the cornball Griswold family. It also pats itself on the back implicitly saying "oh us Griswolds, we're always getting into something because our dad is an idiot." Then in nearly comic fashion it ends with a tribute to America and how grateful the Griswolds are to return to such a better country. If Hughes was going for satire and meant to do it in the form of a bad movie, well maybe I should award this 8/10 stars.It's not just the unfunniness, but "European Vacation" boasts the two worst actors to play kids Rusty and Audrey (Jason Lively and Dana Hill). They're both annoying and obnoxious, with the unattractive and loud-mouthed Audrey blubbering about the boyfriend she's left behind nearly the entire film. Hughes even goes as far as to have her comment about missing him right as she observes a giant bratwurst. Quite tasteful. Speaking of, breasts are flashed in two different scenes for no good reason (unless it was to comment on Americans' love of gratuitous nipples in their comedies).I will give the film one of its two stars thanks to Eric Idle of the Monty Python crew, whose cameo at a few different points in the film where he recites lines directly from "Holy Grail" is about the funniest part. If Hughes intended for us to find one of the film's only non- American actors as the only funny part, then another tip of the hat to him for ripping open the underbelly of Hollywood comedy in the '80s. Still, would it have hurt for him to do that while making it entertaining?
There are romantic comedies and then there's real life. "The Five-Year Engagement," believes it can be both. This latest collaboration between Nicholas Stoller and Jason Segel ("Forgetting Sarah Marshall") stars Segel and Emily Blunt as Tom and Violet, a pair of totally-in-love inseparables whose plans to tie the knot keep getting pushed back to accommodate their professional ambitions, but the delay has consequences for both themselves individually and their relationship.Truthfully, "The Five-Year Engagement" finds really nice moments of both real-life relationship drama and rom-com, but considering the two so rarely form a dream marriage of their own, we don't get to see them together.The film starts out in convincing fashion. Violet and Tom are hopelessly in love and we buy every second of their history together. That success rests with these actors: the living teddy bear that is Segel, and especially Blunt  who's something else. She's so naturally sincere and believable in every film she does yet so effortlessly funny too. There's no question that without them both, this experiment in relationship comedy would have died within the first 45 minutes. These two lovable stars help to ease the drag of a two-hour run time. So between that and the mention of "experimental comedy" you might be able to tell Judd Apatow produced this film. "Engagement" fits right in line with the contemporary comedy king's streak of pairing hilarity with life wisdom (evidenced by "Funny People").Considering the story follows two engaged people and is labeled and marketed as a romantic comedy from the producers of "Bridesmaids," it would be reasonable to expect the final act of the movie to contain a wedding. I won't spoil anything here, but you can use your best judgment in evaluating that assumption. Either way, the film's trajectory is pretty obvious, and so the creative responsibility rests on writers Stoller and Segel to entertain along the way with cleverly devised, amusing and believable hiccups for our lovebirds to encounter.Stoller and Segel are reliable vets at the comedy game, and their script hits plenty of comedic high notes from start to finish. When you consider that no single plot point other than "the two leads get engaged" could be deemed vital to the entire film and therefore all subsequent events must be creatively designed to keep our attention, they deserve a standing ovation for the number of contrived jokes that work. But the catch is that their own concept for this film put them in that situation in the first place.The story slowly uncovers the arc of these characters over time until a major second-act climax reveals an obvious ending, but the movie feels perpetually open-ended. Not in the suspenseful way, but in the everything and anything could happen so let's just cut to it already  sort of way.Most of the bumps in the road are realistic, at least toward the beginning when we've got the film on a longer leash. As it wears on, of course, Stoller and Segel feel the pressure to make something happen, and they go with a bit of a leap in logic. Regardless, when the film chooses to be real, it feels real. Violet gets her big opportunity at the University of Michigan and Tom, a chef, compromises for her as he knows he can cook anywhere. They both discuss not wanting any resentment, but the reality of the situation sneaks in as Tom discovers exactly what his compromise entails. There's no denying this happens in relationships; two people who want to commit to each other also must reconcile their personal ambitions.Seeing as real life can be boring, the film attempts to compensate with its assortment of humorous situations and characters. Several comedians including Mindy Kaling, Kevin Hart and Brian Posehn play supporting roles just sort of tacked onto the story, even though they're effective in spots. Although so much of this works, there's no concealing that it fluffs the story and simply delays the film's inevitable conclusion centered around the question of whether Violet and Tom will get married."The Five-Year Engagement" gets caught between its desire to be humorous and engaging as well as relatable and realistic  an exercise in shoving polarizing forces together. Fortunately, some talented and funny people took this risk, and it makes "The Five-Year Engagement" a sweet film and a worthwhile watch.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Going into the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece "Psycho," it's best that you know nothing -- in fact Hitchcock wanted it that way -- so this review will be devoid of any synopsis beyond that of the basic plot summaries given on IMDb. But truth is, the plot is only half the film's genius. The rest belongs to the master of murder and suspense."Psycho" thrives on suspense. Without the constant feeling of paranoia from Hitchcock's careful camera movements or from Bernard Herrmann's vigorous string quartet, many parts of the film would feel long. At this point in his career, Hitchcock was so commanding of his craft that he achieves the desired effect from his audience with nearly every shot, whether it's wanting us to focus on particular items or make specific assumptions about the mystery at hand.Perhaps the most understated element of the film is Joseph Stefano's screenplay. From what I gather about Robert Bloch's novel, Stefano restructured the story to set up a jarring shift in the plot and encase the mystery in an even thicker container for Hitchcock to best utilize his skills. The scripts only major weakness is the scene right after the climax, which is pointless exposition explaining the previous events; something movie watchers don't need today -- though that's arguably because Hitchcock made this movie.For those that love Hitchcock's style, "Psycho" is an instant classic and perhaps no film of his showcases it better. For those unfamiliar with his work, it's not hard to see while watching "Psycho" what made his films so memorable. Even those who don't have an eye for good film-making can even appreciate the entertaining suspense and constantly twisting plot of "Psycho."
You could say third time's a charm for the Bourne series, but only because "The Bourne Ultimatum" is merely the best of three phenomenal action movies. The team that successfully assembled the first two films delivers yet again and even more action-packed, intense and shrouded in Bourne's mysterious past than the first two films.If you still don't believe Bourne is the action hero of the decade, then you've spent too much time being preoccupied over the re-boot of the Bond franchise. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is the real deal and when a fourth installment comes out, there will finally be all the noise and publicity these films deserved.This film continues directly after "Supremacy." Bourne starts to get traces of another memory returning to him of his initial transformation into a CIA super-assassin. Meanwhile, a British reporter has gotten hold of information from an ex-CIA informant about Operation Blackbriar, an upgrade of the Treadstone project that bred Bourne of which Bourne was apparently the first subject. Naturally this information intrigues Bourne and also captures the attention of the CIA who still has secrets to protect as long as Bourne is alive.Joan Allen gladly returns for the second time as Pam Landy, who has begun to sympathize with Bourne. However, she is forced to work with Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) who is helping guard the Blackbriar secret and wants Bourne flat out killed. Julia Stiles reprises her role yet again as Nicki, who helps Bourne out in a couple spots. Also joining the cast is Albert Finney. Strathairn and Finney are two other awesome additions to the franchise that has included Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Clive Owen and more. Clearly the producers know talent."Ultimatum" is a lot more of the same for the series in terms of structure and formula, although the way this film unfolds is much more straightforward than "Supremacy." All the CIA treachery stuff fits in well with the action instead of being a tangential subplot. The only real subplot is understanding what Bourne's new fuzzy memory is about. Everything else makes sense as Bourne jumps from locale to locale yet again in this film, ultimately ending up in the United States for the first time, just in time for the series' best car chase yet involving Bourne driving a police car. The stunt work on this film is way more incredible than the last two. While director Paul Greengrass prefers the sometimes too shaky hand-held camera-work, it never gets dizzying or distracting because this film is so well edited. The way everything is strung together keeps your attention on all the right things whether details or just keeping you on where the action is so that it makes sense."Ultimatum" just gives you more and most applaudably without the special effects that other action films use as a crutch. It doesn't get more real than this series as far as action goes. Simply another job well done executing this film. I don't know if the formula can be relied on for a fourth (formula being Bourne tries to uncover more of his past - gets chased by CIA - beats people up in four countries minimum - car chase). There is a definitely a much clearer resolution in this film that would lead you to believe something new would need to come in for a fourth film to be made.
Abraham Lincoln. Steven Spielberg. Daniel Day-Lewis. Any of these words alone commands a lot of attention and respect; put them together, and you have an almost inconceivable amount of reverence. "Lincoln" is reminiscent of the powerhouse Oscar biopics of the '90s and early 2000s, but unlike other recent biopics, it mostly measures up to the hype.I say mostly, because as good as "Lincoln" is, the tendency will be to exaggerate it because of the subject matter and talent on hand. The film deserves plenty of praise, but it operates on the level of what you see is what you get. It lacks of the obscured themes and subtleties of more recent Oscar-winning fair, but the "old-school Oscars" nostalgia it evokes will assure that it sees a good degree of accolades.The rock at the film's center isn't Spielberg, but rather Day-Lewis. The two-time Oscar winner known for waiting for, finding, securing and delivering unforgettable leading roles as though he knows something no one else in his profession does, will disappoint no one except those hoping to see another incarnation of Daniel Plainview from "There Will Be Blood." Day-Lewis' "Lincoln" is calm, reserved yet every bit as commanding of the screen as Plainview. Day-Lewis knows everyone's eyes will be on him, so he dials his performance down in a way that makes him even more prominent, while also reflective of an older Lincoln who is used to the "fame" and concerned most about his legacy."Lincoln" takes place in the final four months of the president's life starting two months after his reelection (January of 1865) and concluding with his assassination. So no, it's not a traditional biopic, rather it shows Lincoln at a specific time in his life. You could also say the focus is less on Lincoln and more on passage of the 13th Amendment, which might've been a more appropriate (though less Oscar-baiting) title.The even greater context is the Civil War, which is turning undoubtedly in the Union's favor at this point in time, but with the body count mounting, Lincoln faces pressure to end it by any means possible. One of those means is the 13th Amendment, which would abolish slavery if passed in the House of Representatives, but Conservatives believe a peace agreement might be reached faster. Realizing peace talks/the Confederacy's surrender could happen sooner than later and derail any chance for the passage of the amendment, Lincoln, along with Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) puts all his muscle into winning over enough congressmen to secure the necessary two-thirds majority vote.Writer Tony Kushner ("Angels in America") keeps things straightforward in a film that could get lost in the intricacies Washington politics. Consequently, "Lincoln" is a rather accessible film, yet also a bit heavy-handed. Especially at the beginning, characters speak in rather detailed terms about, for example, the two-thirds majority vote, opting for clarity rather than authenticity of speech. The script also paints Lincoln as a storyteller quick to snuff out verbal conflict with a good tale or two, usually ending in a humorous punchline. We get a good portrait of Lincoln's personality in this way, though hardly a complex one. The complexity comes in with the subplot involving his relationship to wife Mary Todd (Sally Field), specifically in regards to their two (living) children, Tad (Gulliver McGrath) and Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Mary Todd gets a rather one-dimensional portrait. She's clever, but ultimately defined by how traumatized she was when their son Willie died of illness a few years prior. Field has the gravitas to hold down the part well, but it's far less interesting than the focus of passing the amendment in the main narrative."Lincoln" has its greatest degree of modern relevance in terms of how he had to secretly "buy" the votes of several moderates in the House. He promised jobs rather than uglier bribes such as money, but considering today's issues with nepotism, it's an interesting parallel, especially when you consider that this "dirty work" was done to achieve something so fundamental as securing liberty for an entire race of people. You can't exactly blame him for using whatever tactics he could. Outside of the man in the tall hat himself, Oscar winner Tommy Lee Jones should and will get noticed by awards bodies for portraying radical Republican congressman Thaddeus Stevens, who throws about some legendary (albeit archaic) insults at his Democratic opposers. He's more than just comic relief however, as he gets a pretty substantial and well-rounded subplot that tests his character as well as Jones' ability. A number of other talents show up or play integral supporting roles in the film, but chalk that up to every actor demanding their agent get them a part in the Spielberg film about Lincoln. Parts played by Gordon-Levitt, John Hawkes, James Spader, Michael Stuhlbarg, Jared Harris, Hal Holbrook, Jackie Earle Haley and more could've as easily been played by unknowns, though they all do lend some extra legitimacy to the film as far as it being an event drama.Also adding in this regard is all the top-notch technical work. Spielberg always has the best crews on hand for his films and "Lincoln" has an incredible visual color palette and the dignified look of a truly important historical drama. His camera is slow-moving and subtle so as to allow us to soak up Day-Lewis' performance and all the intriguing drama. He also knows a thing or two about emotional catharsis, and while the scene in which the House votes on the amendment won't bring you to tears, it's still so darn moving  you feel as though you are truly witnessing history."Lincoln" doesn't offer many surprises, but considering how thoroughly it handles politics and captures important themes about doing what's right in such a pure way, history teachers will show it in class for years to come.Thanks for reading! moviemusereviews.com
Tales of 20-somethings in New York City epitomize the independent film scene, as does the star and co-writer of "Frances Ha," Greta Gerwig, the indisputable indie queen. Together with writer and director Noah Baumbach, "Frances" is practically the comfort food of independent film, a genre label usually reserved for something edgy and different. However, despite the film residing in the wheelhouse of its talent, it somehow finds a certain freshness and quirky sense of inspiration that you typically don't get from veterans.Re-teaming after the slightly more Hollywood-ized "what am I doing with my life?" film in 2010's "Greenberg," Gerwig and Baumbach have taken a step back into something a little more on-the-sleeve. "Frances Ha" hides behind nothing  it is pure, unadulterated relationship-based emotion featuring entirely unremarkable characters meant to reflect the utter mundaneness and raw beauty that is the life of a struggling middle class person.Frances is a lover. She aspires to dance professionally despite the obvious limitations of her talent, and she has a powerful bond with her friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner). Their friendship, which transcends most on-screen friendships in terms of closeness and authenticity, is the core love story of the film. As much as Frances attempts to navigate new roommates and friendships, nothing can replace the connection between her and Sophie, two people who just get each other. The quote of the film comes from Frances describing when you know "that's your person."Perhaps the mere fact that "Frances" is a good love story that doesn't center on a non- platonic heterosexual relationship is what elevates it, but Baumbach makes some sound choices behind the camera too. Filming in black and white these days almost always comes off as a bit bold if not pretentious, but it works especially well in a number of scenes that employ classical music or classic film music from French composer Georges Delerue, adding foreign art-house and nostalgic tones to remind us that while the story feels modern, its core is timeless."Frances" is put together in sequences. The camera becomes a removed observer for quick snippets of scenes throughout, letting us see how Frances interacts with the world though we know what's going on inside; we have a sense of how she feels. All of these sequences are tied together by a song or musical style and have a clear beginning, middle and end, and the many sequences in the film are strung together with large chunks of time missing in between. There's no traditional plot, just a few key dramatic moments here and there involving Frances' career and relationships that shape and inform the rest of the film. At times, this can get extremely boring, but there are enough momentary gems throughout to keep the feeling of boredom from overpowering the other sentiments.Frances' dance career isn't the most interesting storyline in the film, but it's so relatable anyway. You always see hard-working, talented dancers in films, not average dancers who deeply care about dancing. It's clear that dance is what Frances loves, but she struggles, unable to make the company with which she apprentices. Yet she commits to doing it her way, and despite her ever-changing living situation and Sofie coming in and out of her life, she remains locked on her focal point, like a dancer doing a pirouette. Gerwig just owns these kinds of performances. She creates incredible nuance and mannerisms for her characters to make them quirky but totally believable. A scene in which she leaves dinner with her newfound friend Lev (Adam Driver) to run around looking for an ATM is over-the-top but kind of endearing. You never question Gerwig's authenticity, and the script steers so far away from anything resembling melodrama that Frances is never pushed into the kind of larger-than-life situation that requires an actor to really really work in order to bring a film down to earth, not that Gerwig would be incapable. The couple of freakouts Frances does have are weird, but totally natural.Fans of Baumbach's debut, "Kicking and Screaming," will see "Frances Ha" as a return to form for the filmmaker, if for no other reason than the age of the characters, though "Frances" proves how much he has matured in writing witty dialogue that actually feels authentic. The big key difference between "Frances" and Baumbach's other work, however, is the choice to focus on a central character and not an ensemble film in which we have to feel connected to what's going on with every character. His style seems best suited for these kinds of character studies.Although one might be tempted to describe "Frances Ha" as "the latest indie movie starring Greta Gerwig," it's more than just a drop in the films about 20-somethings bucket.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Grief is a process. Psychology books and personal experience will tell you that. Perhaps not all of us experience someone being ripped from our lives in an instant, but the process is always the same. Why then, is it so challenging to watch 9-year-old Oskar (Thomas Horn), whose father (Tom Hanks) dies in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, endure this all-too-familiar pain? It should be moving to see a young albeit peculiar child come to terms with this in his own way."Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close" attempts to play powerful cinematic music with extremely sensitive strings. The story is steeped in trauma and mourning, so the obvious danger would likely be creating a film that's too heavy or suffocating, but this story has moments of quirk, sincerity and even adventure. The trouble is that not until the end does the film ever let go of what Oskar calls "the Worst Day"his code for 9/11. It haunts the entire movie, and while that can certainly be justified, it throws us out of sync with the characters, who all seem to experience the fiercest of emotions when we aren't ready for them.The biggest problem is Oskar. It has nothing to do with the young Horn's performance, but everything to do with how Oscar winner Eric Roth was forced to adapt him for the screen. I have not read Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, but my guess is given the abundant use of narration in the movie, Oskar tells the story in the first person. Considering we are forced to follow and identify with a 9-year-old with Asperger's and probably some form of autism, understanding and relating to this character is crucial, yet maddeningly difficult.Understandably through no fault of his own, Oskar treats his mother (Sandra Bullock) poorly, swears at his apartment building doorman (John Goodman), throws temper tantrums, lies and despite his curiosity and adventurous spirit, uses deduction in place of logic. He's a nightmare of a main character, and his constant relapses as the film flashes back to 9/11 butt in every time you start to warm up to him.Director Stephen Daldry has experience working with troubled boys ("Billy Elliot"), but he doesn't appear to do enough to help us sympathize, which could be the result of roadblocks in the script. Given that Oskar holds secrets even from the audience until close to the end, most of which deal with revisiting 9/11, it's hard to feel bad for him. He's just a strange kid afraid to move on, which isn't exactly revelatory.Oskar's pursuit of finding what a mysterious key found in his father's closet belongs to is supposed to be the start of an adventure, but one that never really blossoms. The closest it ever gets is the 30 minutes in which Oskar befriends The Renter (Max von Sydow), an old man choosing to be mute that lives with Oskar's grandmother in a nearby building. He accompanies Oskar on his journey and challenges him to overcome his fears, and makes for an interesting compliment to the ever-gabbing child. If you had to nominate "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close" for an Academy Award, it would be for von Sydow, so in that sense perhaps he deserves recognition.All the colorful characters you would expect Oskar to meet as he tries to find every single person with the last name Black living in New York City exist in voice-over snippets. From a quick outside glance, the story would likely be about a child going on an adventure expecting to find a meaningful answer and learning that the journey was the entire point, but it somehow ends up way more convoluted."Extremely Loud's" Best Picture nomination is extremely unwarranted. Despite the talent on and behind the camera, the product as a whole is messy and most importantly, unable to connect emotionally with its audience. Certainly some people will connect with a moment or two and really appreciate the film's emotional fearlessness, but anyone versed in Oscar- caliber drama knows this doesn't fit the bill despite all the venerated talent that put this movie on Oscar radars everywhere when it first came together.Maybe it's that abundant talent that makes the film's shortcomings all the more difficult to bear, but the more you think about it, the more you realize this kind of a perspective on September 11  from the eyes of such a challenging protagonist  probably doomed it from the start. The craftsmanship, the acting and some of the raw moments in the story make the film nothing to scoff at, but the impact of it all, which is the heart of this kind of drama, doesn't come across as it should.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Known mostly as The Tramp's last motion picture, "Modern Times" is physical comedian and gifted writer/director/composer Charlie Chaplin's take on the quickly changing world around him. It's fitting for what's considered his last silent movie and the last hurrah of early Hollywood's most iconic figure and one of the greatest in cinematic history.In "Modern Times" the Tramp is fired from his assembly line job because he literally can't keep up with the grueling speed of his machine, a fantastic introduction to Chaplin's central idea of the breakneck speed of technology. He's even made the guinea pig for a new "eat while you work" machine that breaks during the test, resulting in the film's most comical scene. After surviving jail, the Tramp looks to find a new job, failing multiple times and dodging policemen left and right. Along the way he meets a gamin, a young orphaned woman (Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's then wife) and despite being at the bottom of the barrel, they strive to live in their own house and find work together.Throughout the film, the Tramp and his new gal desperately try and fit into a society that naturally rejects them like bad shrimp. The Tramp looks completely out of place and seems incapable (of course humorously so) of doing even the smallest of tasks, like assisting a mechanic by carrying his tools. But he will not be deterred, his ambition to live the American dream is as strong as every working class American who struggled through the tough times of that era (the film was released in 1936).It's not hard to draw a personal comparison between Chaplin's art form and the struggles of the Tramp in this film either. Silent movies were dying if not dead by the time "Modern Times" was released, but Chaplin was determined to prove that talking pictures were not the only suitable form of entertainment. He proves his point in an ending musical act where the Tramp speaks for the first time but must make up words because he's lost the lyrics. The ending shot is even more hopeful than the entire rest of the film."Modern Times" might not be Chaplin's most hysterical physical humor, but it's certainly one of his most biting social commentaries as well as a somewhat inspiring love story. As wacky as the Tramp might be, we certainly identify with his dream and secretly admire his propensity to act outside of social norms like we ourselves wish were more comfortable doing.
Horror movies live and die by conventions. No genre more willingly rehashes tropes and archetypes, or even entire plots. Perhaps horror fans are so exhilarated by the first-time use of an effective original horror film device they are wont to indulge it numerous times until filmmakers have tapped out every possible riff on said device.This makes horror ripe for satire, yet prior to "Tucker & Dale vs. Evil," only the "Scary Movie" franchise has tried to exploit it for humorous purposes. Even then, rather than clever, nuanced jabs, the "Scary Movie" series goes more over-the-top, inflating any scraps of satire with off-topic pop culture references. It's a bit confounding to be honest, how the horror genre finally has found something that is both homage to horror/comedy and subtly self- deprecating."Tucker & Dale" works off the basic premise of a miscommunication based on horror stereotypes: a group of college kids on their way to vacation in some remote woods meet our titular fellasa pair of honest-to-goodness rednecksat a rest stop, and take them for a pair of crazies.Well, Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) happen to be on a much-needed vacation at a cabin in the woods. One night out fishing the kids are skinny-dipping and one girl, Allison (Katrina Bowden), sees them and accidentally falls off a rock and unconscious. Her friends mistake Dale's attempt to rescue Allison for an abduction and plot a way to get their friend back.A farce ensues that sees the kids misinterpreting what Tucker and Dale are doing around the cabin as prepping to kill Allison, yet in their attempts to foil them, end up killing each other and consequently fueling their own illusion. Meanwhile, Tucker and Dale start to wonder if they're caught in the middle of a suicide pact. Eventually things become less predictable when the college kid Chad (Jesse Moss) starts taking the revenge game too seriously.Writer/director Eli Craig and spends time acquainting us with Tucker and Dale to the point that we get a nice subplot going with their relationship, but also to make the college kids seems all the more stupid. We laugh at these characters in horror films because they're stupid, but "Tucker & Dale" does it with more self-awareness; Craig knows how ridiculous these characters tend to be in horror films too.Tudyk gives his usual grade-A character actor performance, but Labine generates the adoration for this film with his lovably dumb teddy bear routine. He's a character we've seen before in comedy, but he does it with such an honest innocence."Tucker & Dale" delivers a handful of predictable moments, but there's a satisfaction in seeing them coming that you don't get in most films, simply because you want it to happen. That's part of the draw with horror films, but the enjoyment for this movie comes in the comedic sense. In terms of satire, you know exactly what Craig is going for and it makes too much sense to not be able to appreciate it.The movie does veer a bit toward the end from its satirical foundation, but by this point the characters have earned enough favor that the story plays out well enough. A more effective horror/comedy twist, however, would have been a nice addition. Craig doesn't manage to take any jabs at horror that seem uniquely genius or insightful, but "Tucker & Dale" is also meant to be a product of love for the genre too, not a complete berating. Those who love the silly thrills of horror will likely appreciate "Tucker & Dale's" self-aware perspective, and those who love to laugh at the genre will have even more cause to do so.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry" might seem to come with the childish moral of "everyone is human and should be treated fairly no matter their lifestyle," but this Sandler- style comedy really twists that message."Chuck and Larry" a film about two firefighters that agree to a domestic partnership to help out Larry's (Kevin James) kids by allowing him to receive pension after the mother died. The plot is entertaining and farcical in a way, but there's no evading (unless you aren't that sensitive of a person) the feeling of guilt at laughing at some of these jokes. While the film constantly tries to push a message of acceptance, the humor really makes that feel less genuine.Like I said, the plot is everything a good Happy Madison film should be, but Sandler has never tackled a hot button issue like gay rights, let alone a real issue at all. Like Sandler's "Click" a film whose family themes and sheer strangeness are at total odds, two things--one bad and one good--are at odds in this film. "Chuck and Larry" is funny and clever, but the social commentary is at odds with the pervasive gay jokes. Your enjoyment level of this film, when it comes down to it, is which you find the most influential or dominant in the film, though if you don't feel the least bit uneasy with the gay humor at times, you'll probably really enjoy it.
Family comedy is a genre that garners a lot of rolling eyes these days. Families have been categorized and stereotyped. The kids are crazy. The parents fight. They make up. Even pregnancy movies are that way. Are they ready to have the baby? Will they keep? Will it keep them together or tear them apart. "Away We Go" avoids all of this. Is it about expecting parents and starting a family? Absolutely, but in a refreshing way.The film is largely soft-spoken with some quirky humor thanks to the oddest supporting cast of characters you might ever see. It is indeed directed by "American Beauty" filmmaker Sam Mendes, but "Away We Go" is a completely different film. This is an exercise in versatility for Mendes and an honorable one that he pulls off as well as any of his films. The script comes form Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida, two writers previously un-integrated into the Hollywood sphere. So in many senses "Away We Go" is like a newborn -- there's just a crisp, organic feeling to it.Burt (John Krasinski of "The Office") and Verona (former SNL regular Maya Rudolph) are an unmarried couple expecting a baby girl who after learning Burt's parents will be moving away from them before the baby's born decide they have an opportunity to pick somewhere completely new to start their family. Throughout the film they travel and meet up with friends and relatives, each with a unique set of circumstances and all of whom teach them a little more about what it means to start a family.The film is not about them not being married and definitely not about whether they're keeping the baby or anything like that. They're completely in love, you can tell they'll make great parents; they just want to raise their little girl in a positive environment. Through all the wacky friends they meet up with along the way, both they and the audience begin to realize just how crucial environment really is.The phenomenal supporting cast members range from Jeff Daneils and Catherine O'Hara as Burt's parents to a hysterical and ridiculous Allison Janney as Verona's former boss out in Phoenix who clearly has an unhappy marriage with two desensitized kids. Then there's the film's diversion to Madison, Wisconsin where LN (Maggie Gyllenhaal) pushes her ridiculous parenting philosophy upon Burt and Verona. The script essentially creates a physical journey out of a couple's quest of how and where they should raise a child.Krasinski and Rudolph, however, are the ones that hold this film together. Krasinski takes the sweetness of his "Office" character Jim and turns it into a completely goofy but serious guy in Burt and Rudolph, always considered a comedienne, brings a surprising amount of warmth and range to Verona."Away We Go" is an honest, sweet, likable film that provides so many different examples of characters and situations that bring unique perspective and insight about parenting, family and when it's all said and done, what home really is. We often let the concept of "home is where the heart is" fall by the wayside, but this film finds a new way to remind us about its eternal truth.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
There's a reason TV stations devote 24-hour Christmas marathons to "A Christmas Story," and the best way to describe that is timeless. If you didn't know the movie was released in 1983, you'd be shocked to find it out because not only is it set in the 40s, but there is an old, classic quality about the way it's written and filmed.The movie truly is a Christmas story and nothing else. The plot simply follows one young boy named Ralphie on a particular Christmas where he wanted nothing else but a Red Rider air rifle BB gun. What makes it so special is the way it's told. There is a narrator, presumably an older Ralphie telling the story, that adds a strong amount of suspense as well as insight to the characters. The movie then structures itself in little memorable episodes that make you laugh and recall your own childhood all at the same time.Whether it's the kid sticking his tongue on the poll at recess, Ralphie getting soap stuck in his mouth, the delightfully creepy mall Santa, or the immortal words "you'll shoot your eye out," "Christmas Story" has something you're bound to never forget. It's replay value is also astounding. It evokes a nostalgia unparalleled by other Christmas comedies.
When it comes to adaptations, sometimes you pity the fool who knows the source material too well. I knew nothing about "The A-Team" outside of premise and having been thoroughly entertained by it, I applaud my own ignorance as it may well have been the difference- maker. Joe Carnahan's movie version of the '80s television classic aims to not merely challenge the bar for inventive sequences that end in kaboom, but to rocket launch it off its post. Those like myself who have the privilege of not being able measure this 21st Century "A-Team" against the spirit of its source material will have a much easier time enjoying it as the recklessly fun overkill that it is.Liam Neeson (Hannibal), Bradley Cooper (Faceman), Quinton "Rampage" Jackson (B.A Baracus) and Sharlto Copley (Murdock) star as an alpha unit of Iraq War covert ops specialists who as Jessica Biel's character bluntly puts it, "specialize in the ridiculous." Their chemistry acts as the glue of the film, keeping our attention and -- with their carefree attitudes -- forging that crucial viewer investment in their welfare. Expertly cast, each member of the foursome not only reaches a demographic, but also serves a purpose in the overall cohesiveness of the team.Neeson adds the measure of seriousness to the film, that same gravitas that he provided to make Pierre Morel's "Taken" a surprise success, which despite clashing with the cigar-and- a-smile image intended for Hannibal, anchors the goofy attitudes of the other three. The most impressive of the bunch is "District 9" star Copley, whose batty character provides the only comic relief that accurately reflects the tone of the script: ludicrous. UFC star Jackson in the most iconic of the roles (having been originated by Mr. T) gives the role of B.A. some surprising softness despite mediocre acting chops. Add Cooper as the swagger and "The A- Team" rests easily upon a nucleus that makes the action more than a mere testosterone injection. These personalities all come together in Mexico in the film's opening scenes, a whirlwind sequence that sets the tone for the wickedly fun (albeit absurd) hi-jinx to follow. The rest of the action is set in motion in Iraq, where the gang is set up after successfully pulling of a covert job in Baghdad. They must then escape prison and then clear their names despite both the CIA and military trying to hunt them down and play them like puppets.Moviegoers who have a tendency to pick apart the physics of an over-the-top action film will probably have some issues with the implausibility of "The A-Team," but consider the alternative: stale, overused action sequences from every other action team film that has ever existed. Instead of another car chase, we get the team in a tank attached to only a parachute being attacked by military drone planes as it plummets toward the ground. Realism for originality is not a trade everyone will make, but it suits the style of "The A-Team."As he demonstrated with "Smokin' Aces," Carnahan knows how to make a fun film that tends to compensate for being shallow with one-of-a-kind style. Take away the overused sequence of having one character explain the plan and then intercut it with the plan being executed and a few fluffy lines of dialogue and he's proved himself capable of delivering a blockbuster. Considering the script comes from himself, actor Brian Bloom and "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" writer Skip Woods, it manages to be creative and take care of its main characters despite the heavy doses of absurdity.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
I don't necessarily understand the phenomenon that "Paranormal Activity" became in the Fall of 2009, especially considering the success of "The Blair Witch Project" and "Cloverfield" bringing exposure to the documentary-style and low budget horror/thriller. Yet people demanded this film be shown in their cities and towns and this $15,000 movie grossed more than $100 million. We might never fully understand why, but my hunch is it's partially because filmmaker Oren Peli is able to effectively do what bigger-budget horror filmmakers can with just a fraction of the resources."Paranormal Activity" is not all it's cracked up to be, but it's proof again that money is not what makes a good horror movie. You can sink cash into science fiction and action films and that can make them better, but fear is like humor -- it's a part of our brain function, it has no price tag. The pleasure some people get from a scary movie comes with skilled direction; money only dresses it up and allows a filmmaker to execute fear tactics in a different physical context.The film follows a young couple that has just moved into a new home. The girl, Katie, has had experiences with some supernatural presence much of her life and it has followed them into her new home. Her boyfriend Micah has bought a camera to see if he can get down to the bottom of it and his footage is what we see. Everything takes place in their home (the home of Peli, in fact) and the paranormal events escalate as well as their relationship tension throughout the film.This premise and screenplay is just head-strong writing. First off, its premise fits its budget. "Found footage" film-making is cheap and provides an artistic excuse to make a film that way while also appearing very real. If at any moment in the film you buy into Peli's attempt to make it realistic, then you'll be at least somewhat scared or fascinated with the events.As far as being scary, Peli's tactics are simple but executed perfectly. Everything is foot-in- the-door -- worked in one scene at a time. A great horror filmmaker knows his audience's expectations and turns them into his or her greatest tool. We learn early that this "demon" comes mostly at night and so Micah sets up his camera to record them in bed sleeping, the same shot from the same angle countless times throughout the film, the same sound effect cues to trigger our response that something is going to happen. At first just the door moves, or Katie sleepwalks, but it gets a little more intense each time and spooks you just enough before you ever realize what you've bought into is kind of ridiculous. It's relentless in its ways and yet something you were rolling your eyes at five minutes ago now has your complete attention. Sometimes you're like Micah, just itching for something to happen already and "Activity" insists on just creeping forward to the climax. It's a plot ramp, not an arch. In this way we're tricked into thinking "Activity" is a good movie. In reality, though the relationship between Micah and Katie is believable, the way they handle this situation is kind of weird. First of all, I don't know how anyone could sleep let alone 21 nights in a row knowing something was haunting them. There are many times where Katie addresses the camera and you feel that the script is really stretching to make excuses for why its on at pivotal points. And as realistic as the movie feels, there's never a scene beyond the half-hour mark that feels strikingly truthful. It also takes us that long to get our first piece of subtext, that Micah's a bit upset Katie never told him about her haunting experiences before they moved in.Yet for its many flaws there's a brilliance to the fear in us that "Paranormal Activity" preys on. First of all there's the ageless notion of scary things happening at night when we sleep, then there's that blurry line that we all experience in our lives like did the door just move or did the wind blow it shut? How did that end up on the floor. Peli works in these daily oddities and slowly shifts them over to completely abnormal events. It's taking fear where we find it in our everyday lives and exaggerating. That's the effectiveness of "Paranormal Activity."~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
To label "Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief" as Harry Potter with Greek mythology is to fault the zebra for having stripes because the tiger had them first. The hero's journey story of a young protagonist realizing he or she has a destiny and entering a world previously unknown to him or her is as ancient as, well, Greek mythology. Was 20th Century Fox hoping that Percy would become the next Harry at the box office? Without question, but it should be judged on its own merits, no matter how similar the two are.It doesn't help that director Chris Columbus, who first brought Harry Potter to the big screen by directing the first two films, is behind the camera for "Lightning Thief" too, but you can't blame Fox for going after a proved talent when it comes to adapting young adult adventure fantasies for the big screen. Columbus' eye for adventure is in fact what keeps this adaptation of the Rick Riordan book entertaining, albeit his ability to create the epic doesn't cover up his inability to do much in the way of subtlety.The plot is typical fantasy: Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) shockingly learns he is demi-god as explained by the mentor figures protecting him and that he's a critical figure in some controversy he doesn't know about. He is then introduced to the world of being a demi-god and discovers he's cut out for the life and embraces his destiny. Lastly he goes on an adventure with friends to retrieve some object that culminates in some kind of battle brought on by a plot twist regarding a deceptive character.Since that's nothing a fantasy fan hasn't seen before, it's the trappings of the Percy Jackson world that will make or break the film. The success varies in this area, with what doesn't work resulting from Percy's adventure taking him through unexciting modern-day North America where the entrance to the Underworld is ironically next to the Hollywood sign, the Pantheon recreation in Nashville is the closest thing there is to "Greek history" and the reflective backside of the iPod Touch is the most convenient tool for looking at Medusa's reflection. Creative, yes, but compare that to the magic and imagination of Harry Potter and that's the biggest difference separating the two films. The casting decisions and the excitement for Greek mythology fans to guess who or what is coming next definitely helps keep "Lightning Thief" stay fresh and somewhat more surprising. As for the nucleus of young actors, Lerman easily has the look and ability of the young hero and even a voice and style that's barely discernible from Shia LeBeouf's. His closest friends are a satyr named Grover played by Tropic Thunder co-star Brandon T. Jackson, who knows his character is somewhat of a stereotype but roles with it nicely and Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), daughter of Athena, the calm and collected beauty deliberately intended to break stereotype. The supporting roles and cameos of key mythological figures are endless: Sean Bean, Pierce Brosnan, Rosario Dawson, Uma Thurman and more.As a more engaging way for young ones to learn some facts about Greek mythology, "The Lightning Thief" trumps numerous textbooks. Any child could see this movie and have a bunch of mythology to Google from the classic names of all the gods as well as Perseus, Medusa and Hydra to the lesser-known Furies and Lotus-Eaters. Other films of the genre have been more entertaining, but of the few young fantasy adaptations that have tried to fill the shoes of a soon-departing Harry Potter, "Percy Jackson" at least puts up a watchable, amusing fight.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Superhero movie follow-ups have been a tough business lately. "Iron Man 2" marks Marvel's first sequel since "Spider-Man 3" left millions disappointed in 2007. So to quell any lingering fears, "Iron Man 2" is not a letdown. It's far from it. To think director Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey Jr. would lose sight of what they did that turned a lesser Marvel character into a multi-million-dollar franchise would be a gross underestimation.Downey Jr. does not relinquish Iron Man's reputation as the wittiest superhero ever brought to the big screen. "Iron Man 2" provides just as much of a humorous joyride as the 2008 film, backing up all the subtly outrageous dialogue with superb visual effects and action that seizes all attention. It all still works because Favreau has locked down the blend between not taking the story too seriously but still telling it with conviction.But oh yes, "Iron Man 2" complicates things a bit. Self-outted billionaire superhero Tony Stark aka Iron Man has a lot on his plate from government subpoenas asking him to hand his suit over to the people to a private matter: his fake heart -- the arc reactor -- is slowly poisoning him. Feeling like it all might cave in on him, Tony makes his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow), Stark Industries' new C.E.O. Screenwriter Justin Theroux ("Tropic Thunder") accepts the responsibility of weaving these plot lines in with three new significant characters. Mickey Rourke assumes the villain role: silently vengeful Russian physicist Ivan Vanko, who after a failed attempt at using his own whip-toting arc-reactor suit to kill Tony in the film's first action sequence on a Monaco raceway, finds himself in the employ of Tony's arms-dealing nemesis, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). With Tony going in and out of the public's good graces, Hammer uses Vanko to create droid soldiers for the military, which would effectively make him the real "American hero." Scarlett Johansson goes redhead for a supporting role as one of Tony's new assistants who is more than she appears to be.The busyness continues because of Marvel's commitment to an eventual "Avengers" film in 2012 combining Iron Man and heroes of future Marvel films. Samuel L. Jackson appears as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D, looking to recruit Tony for his team and nudging him in the right direction as Tony's deceased father, Howard, holds the answer to his "heart condition."The overcrowding, however, never gets the best of "Iron Man 2." Theroux has designed the story to move along quickly and effectively, letting the action and the humor carry the entertainment factor evenly throughout the film. The unfortunate trade-off is that very little resonates about "Iron Man 2." Tony's attempt to find a new core element for his arc reactor is the one true through-line. Everything else from Tony's feuding with Pepper and his buddy Jim Rhodes (Cheadle) to Hammer's frustrations with Vanko's progress to Nick Fury all act in service of the plot. The element of Tony's irresponsibility and alcoholism, perhaps the greatest potential of the film to make any kind of statement, appears in only a couple brief scenes. Downey Jr. and Favreau give us many great Tony Stark moments, but he doesn't have a chance to grow -- just make us laugh and remember how great a character he is.And honestly, how great a character he is. Downey Jr.'s shtick hasn't gotten old in the least despite his increased exposure the last two years and the writing caters to him even more this time around. Maybe a lesser actor playing a lesser character wouldn't be able to lift up a busy superhero story with this many subplots, but RDJ has that ability. With an imaginative visual effects crew at his back and a director who knows how to condense action and make it count, he'll likely continue providing easy-to-love action entertainment as Iron Man no matter how many different chinks these films develop in their armor.-Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
If one thing is true about plot, you can rarely go wrong with Shakespeare. "10 Things I Hate About You," based on the bard's comedy "The Taming of the Shrew" isn't exactly more than an homage to the theatrical classic, but it's a teen comedy from the '90s that sticks out because of its fresh quirkiness and good heart.When Cameron (Gordon-Levitt, "3rd Rock from the Sun") arrives at Padua High School, he's easily smitten by Bianca (Oleynik, "The Secret World of Alex Mack"), but word is that her strict father won't let her date anyone, especially if her older sister Kat (Styles) doesn't. So Cameron and his friend Michael (Krumholtz) conspire to trick self-centered jock Joey (Keegan), who also has the hots for Bianca, to pay off local bad boy Patrick (Ledger) to take out Kat so that Bianca will be available."10 Things" assembles an impressive cast of young talent. Ledger and Stiles are the highlights. Despite the fact that the script calls for their relationship to make no actual sense, they manage to sell you by just acting together on screen. In honesty, what the script lacks in practicality, it makes up for in charm, a charm it couldn't pull off without Stiles and Ledger.For another thing, the movie is not filmed like a typical teen comedy. In this way it's both better and not as good. It feels more like a TV show, not a surprise because director Gil Junger has made a career directing TV sitcoms. Junger likes to choose strategic camera angles, especially in more comedic scenes, emphasizing the film's sense of humor. There is a whole comedy element based on the characters not minding their surroundings or making clever remarks. Junger keeps the camera where he thinks these jokes will be most amusing. The script he works with is very teen drama and definitely accurate in a sad sort of way though definitely exaggerated at times. Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah Lutz definitely come across as rookie writers with some really good ideas. Between some of Junger's work and the talented young cast, there's a lot to smooth over the bumps in "10 Things" to make for a satisfying and not too over-the-top romantic teen comedy. It doesn't avoid clichés, but it works with them better.---Visit my blog at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/
As weird as it may sound, "Sixteen Candles" is an important film. It's true: a film about a high school girl who has a nightmarish sixteenth birthday played a significant role in shaping movie comedies as we know them today.To start with, "Sixteen Candles" was written and directed by John Hughes. Hughes had written a couple films prior to this one for the group National Lampoon's, namely the classic comedy "National Lampoon's: Vacation." "Candles" marks the directorial debut of Hughes, his first complete film. Why is this of any significance? Well, Hughes followed up this film a year later with a little movie called "The Breakfast Club." As if that wasn't impressive enough, in the 1980s, Hughes produced more hit sequels to the "Vacation" series, a movie called "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" and created some of the finest films of the careers of Chevy Chase and John Candy. He's the father of 80s comedy and the grandfather of comedy as we know it today.So how does this all ring true in "Sixteen Candles"? To start, the film takes place in the span of 48 hours. That seems insignificant, but how many classic teenage comedies take place in a short time span? The model even holds true with today's films like the praised Apatow Productions film "Superbad." That's just one small example. The real contribution of this movie is its depiction of the teenage lifestyle. Samantha is a typical teenager with typical teenage thoughts and problems on her 16th birthday. Molly Ringwald is a name no one forgets despite her only major films being this and "Breakfast Club" because we see a little of our teenage selves in her candid performance. With Hughes help to create such a real concept (getting neglected by her family on her birthday), Ringwald communicates all those dizzying 16-year-old emotions and issues like self-confidence, being misunderstood and of course hopeless romance.The comedic genius plays its way in to all the things that happen to Sam and the completely relatable and/or goofy characters that surround her. The film is one of the first to take what "Animal House" did for college movies and apply it to the high school scene, being unafraid to handle the sex and drinking and generally irresponsible behavior. While this idea has since exploded into untold number of movies both good and awful, what makes it stay fresh today is that it doesn't over-stereotype. There are nerds and popular girls and what have you, but Hughes doesn't play up that hierarchy. Sam's love interest, the seemingly unattainable Jake Ryan doesn't have jerk-off friends pressuring him not to fall for the unknown quiet girl. them coming together is the film's goal, not it's plot. While the believability there isn't the film's strong suit, it's not as weak and cheesed up as similar films that followed it.The best part of "Sixteen Candles" is how unmistakably real it is. The family drama and goofiness that plays out (the story takes place the day before and of Sam's sister's wedding and the family's in town) is so dead on. We all have grandparents like Sam's that treat us like they treat Sam. We all have embarrassing but necessary conversations with our parents, even if we don't like seeing them on the screen either. Hughes taps into our inner or (depending) outer teenager with sacrificing the humor of the whole situation. If nothing else, "Sixteen Candles" could provide anyone with a camera and some confidence to create a movie. This is proof that movies about life in the suburbs can in fact be done well.Complimented with a killer soundtrack, freshmen who look like 12-year-olds paying money to see women's underwear, some great cars and plenty of empty cans of "Old Style," "Sixteen Candles" is classic in every sense of the word. There's no denying that it's cheesy and most of the acting is poor outside of Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall (also of "Breakfast Club") as the socially courageous geek who is a sweetheart of a troublemaker. (Oh, and appearances by the young Cusacks.) At the same time, it's the nostalgic, lost but hopeful teenage feeling the movie evokes that makes it timeless. It can't be underestimated how much of an impact this film really did have on the future of comedies.
There's a reason that movies based on Saturday Night Live sketches are looked at as the bottom of the barrel, and therefore a reason why "The Ladies Man" starring Tim Meadows back in 2000 was the last attempt. With the show regaining a bit of momentum, Universal gave it another go with "MacGruber." For the most part, it's another swing and a miss.The film is based on the character portrayed by Will Forte -- a dumb MacGyver, basically. Interesting, considering "MacGyver" is a TV show most of the film's target demographic has only heard of in reference and not actually seen. (I always remembered it as the show Patty and Selma loved on "The Simpsons.") MacGruber's one rule is "no guns," but that's not the centerpiece of the film's concept; MacGruber is simply a mullet-bearing government operative who's dumb and unorthodox in every way."MacGruber" pins its laughs on lewd jokes and bizarre partial male nudity. At one point, MacGruber creates a "distraction" with some celery. So despite the opportunity for action hero satire, "MacGruber" writers Forte, John Solomon and Jorma Taccone (also the director) decide ridiculous and raunchy will be their biggest laughs. The cleverness is limited to character names (Val Kilmer plays Dieter Von Cunth) and Kristen Wiig writhing on the floor of a coffee shop at the sound of gunfire in her earpiece.Wiig and co-star Ryan Phillippe (Lt. Dixon Piper) are mostly there to counter the obnoxious, repetitive and blunt behavior of Forte's MacGruber. He finds moments of humor, but he simply operates on just a few different levels: dumb, trash-talking and overly emotional. I guess he found some success on SNL with the character, but there's not much longevity to these shenanigans.At least "MacGruber" doesn't attempt, try or pretend to be something more than the mindless adult entertainment it offers. Hundreds of films have done it better and hundreds will do it worse. The only problem with mindless comedy is that no one remembers the middle guy.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
It's rather striking how much "Dawn of the Dead" feels like its own original film. Maybe its the move from black and white to color or the complete change in main characters, but outside of that, it's entirely the same concept.George A. Romero has made "Dawn of the Dead" true to its predecessor in its strengths and its flaws. Both, for example, are extremely boring in stretches, yet both make statements about human nature still rare in even today's horror films.Taking place right after "Night of the Living Dead," "Dawn" follows two Philadelphia SWAT team officers, a traffic helicopter pilot and his TV producer girlfriend as they seek refuge in an area shopping mall.I've seen tons of zombie films or survival films made since this one, yet the characters in "Dawn" seem less like stereotypes. We're not made to hate any one character or get squarely behind any one character. They all have their faults and you want to scream at all of them at some point not to do something. Stephen (David Emge), for example, can't fire a weapon properly or accurately, yet insists on being a hero. Watching him fire a pistol in a boiler room where the bullet could ricochet and wound or kill him is excruciating, especially because he's trying to kill just one zombie. His girlfriend Franny (Gaylen Ross) simply gets paralyzed with fear on countless occasions. It's not screaming, so maybe that's good, but in horror movies we look for the realization of fear in order to connect to the characters.Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) are at least a fun to watch. Foree is intense, smart and someone you don't want to mess with and Roger is just a plucky goofball. Considering how much time you have to spend with these guys, you do need to like them in some sense for the film to work."Night of the Living Dead" was more of an intimate study in human nature, whereas "Dawn" widens the scope and looks more at how we might respond in the wake of a cataclysmic event. The debate raging between the folks shown on TV puts the action we see in the mall in context. All the campy, gory mayhem hasn't the slightest twinge of philosophical thinking, but as the film progresses, the TV debates put those ideas in the back of our minds.At the same time, "Dawn" is clearly intended to be more of a satire and even a screwball comedy. Romero shows countless shots of contextual footage featuring gray makeup-clad zombies wandering stupidly and aimlessly up the escalator or just walking around period. It's not scary at all; in fact, it comes off as a joke. It makes you really wonder Romero's intent for much of the filmuntil the biker gang comes in the picture. At that point we're looking at ourselves as human beings with shocking disdain. It becomes no longer a survival film but a tragedy of sorts. After a rather tedious majority of the film, this is when "Dawn of the Dead" becomes a classic for more than just turning a shopping mall into an iconic image of horror cinema. Somehow, with the same thunderbolt, Romero makes lightning strike twice.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out more at moviemusereviews.com
How will Marvel's universe ever be the same after "The Avengers"? There's bound to be a vocal percentage of viewers who walk out of "Iron Man 3" thinking, "why didn't he just call his superfriends in the end?" It's a good question, one that Drew Pearce and Shane Black's script doesn't ignore, but never satisfyingly answers. Yet that doesn't seem to matter. The bigger question that Marvel has addressed is whether it could effectively narrow the scope of its universe again after "The Avengers" blew it openand the answer is yes.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) hasn't been the same since his near-death experience in a intergalactic wormhole at the end of "The Avengers." In fact, the words "New York" have become a trigger for his newly discovered anxiety attacks. He has spent his funk by building an inordinate amount of Iron Man suits, and specifically a remotely operated suit that he can summon through a biological tracking system. When a terrorist named the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) emerges, hacking U.S. airwaves to spread fear and causing thermal explosions, Tony calls him out on his cowardice, a move he immediately regrets.As the script continues to introduce all the players in this third iron-clad outing, from Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killiana think tank manager Tony spurned 13 years agoto Don Cheadle's Col. Rhodes who has a new gig as the stars-and-stripes-studded presidential bodyguard Iron Patriot, the film appears as a sloppy mess likely to meet the same fate as "Iron Man 2." Only when Tony begins to pursue the mystery of the terrorist bombings do all these seemingly disparate pieces begin to come together into what's actually a rather clever story.Story structure aside, the script does boast plenty of Stark quips in case you worried the directorial turnover from Jon Favreau to Shane Black would alter the tone of the franchise. Not even close. If anything, the "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" director pushes the boundaries of political correctness with some of the dialogue, especially in the scenes in which Tony finds himself teamed up with a 12-year-old boy."Iron Man 3" digs deeper into the psychology of Tony Stark, at least more than you'd expect from a blockbuster. Rather than open with an action sequence to get the ball rolling, we get a flashback to when Stark met Pearce's Killian as well as a genetic engineer named Maya played by Rebecca Hall. Things don't really begin to pick up until Tony has his mansion blown into the ocean.Not unlike "Iron Man 2," the film's action is largely reserved for the grand finale. Still, the amount of special effects shots is probably tripled, and the action sequences when they do come were written to be as unique and memorable as possible, with a skydiving sequence taking the cake. "Iron Man 3" hits big whenever it makes the effort to do so, proving again how Marvel Studios holds a quality entertainment standard rivaled by few.The "Iron Man" films (and this is partly fault of the comic) lack truly excellent villains. This film sets up Tony Stark's greatest nemesis in the Mandarin, but complicates it in a way you'll never see coming considering how studios and writers have flocked toward villains in the mold of Heath Ledger's Joker from "The Dark Knight."The movie gambles in that way and in other ways not all audiences will recognize. Take the boy for example. If the film failed on the whole, it would forever be remembered as "the 'Iron Man' movie with Tony Stark and that kid." That's dangerous territory. If "Spider-Man 3" had worked, everyone wouldn't refer to it as "the one with emo Peter Parker."Nothing gambles more than the script, which spends a lot of time setting up the premise for what it hopes will be an effective payoff. So much of the film seems anecdotal until you see how the pieces fit. Even then, there's no guarantee the audiences will be compelled by the completed puzzle, but "Iron Man 3" goes bold enough to surprise in a good way.The humor definitely misfires at times and the sense of danger doesn't pervade the film from start to finish, but considering how must third installments have sputtered ("Spider-Man 3," "X-Men: The Last Stand"), it's testament to a number of quality components at work behind the scenes, not excluding "The Avengers," which clearly reenergized Iron Man as a solo character. Without it, no way "Iron Man 3" opens with nearly $175 million after the critical disappointment toward the second.Few actors have truly created and owned a character like Downey Jr. and Tony Stark. Without him, Iron Man is just a second-class superhero in Marvel's canon. He single-handedly launched Phase One of Marvel Studios' plan and gave audiences a multi-dimensional hero with both despicable and lovable qualities. If he powers down the suit after "The Avengers 2," it'll be the end of an era.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
It's possible that any sequel ten years in the making would be bound to fall flat. "The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day" might have been destined to do so from the beginning. The cult following if not worshipping of the original beckoned creator Troy Duffy to bring us the McManus brothers once again, even if the first film suggested future chapters were likely. In terms of story and script, "All Saints Day" neglects most of what made the first film engaging from start to finish. Instead, style dictates the direction of Duffy's sequel and the objective to please die-hard fans, not as much those such as myself who really enjoyed the original's infectious bravado and rhythm and were hoping the sequel would at least provide as much.I really liked the 1999 film, applauding its signature feel, unique characters and religious undertones to counteract any possible label of yet another slow-mo vigilantes with guns story. I've quoted "there was a firefight!" a good couple of times in the ten years since, but my love of the film only went that far. Only a small portion of me would receive satisfaction just by seeing Connor, Murphy and Il Duce back together again; the second would have to win me over just as much as the first had to.The set-up is that the boys (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) are hiding out from the law in Ireland with Poppa (Billy Connolly) when they get word that back in Boston, a priest has been murdered and made to look like it was they who did it. That's all the motivation they need to shave their beards, grab their guns and get some revenge. It's a suspect motivation. Their characters are so much weaker in "All Saints Day" as a result. They're less funny and less believable to boot. The first film showed us they were human and simply had the gall to be vigilantes. This time they come across as untouchable. They also quarrel exactly like they did in the previous film and make similar jokes. These don't come across as "comforts" so much as blatant attempts to reap more benefits from the original film's success.The supporting cast lent so much to the original as well. Clifton Collins Jr. overdoes everything and his character is such a poor man's version of Rocco to begin with. Julie Benz is a horrible attempt at replacing Willem Defoe's FBI agent. Her fake Southern accent is brutal and doesn't rise above stereotype. Defoe provided such a rich and unique character for the film to focus on. Instead, "All Saints Day" tries to rip off its predecessor once again by having Benz's Eunice listen to music when she reconstructs crime scenes too. The homage is given so little attention as is the case with most homages in the film.I hate harping on why a film wasn't like the first, but "Boondock Saints" painted such a special niche for itself and Duffy tries so incredibly hard to recreate some of that film's success that the criticism is warranted. It starts with the script, however, which wasn't made to be good on its own so much as cater to the cult fan base. Mixing in Il Duce's backstory along with what was already going on was too much, for example. Mainly, however, is that "All Saints Day" lacks a true antagonist. Benz is actually an ally to the twins' cause for much of the film, so no true force keeps them in check. This also renders the slow-motion action sequences devoid of that payoff feeling you got from the first film. Instead, "All Saints Day" is all show and even then the entertainment value doesn't measure up.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Here's a thought: would "The Shawshank Redemption" have ever happened without "Cool Hand Luke?" Both films examine prison life in a tall-tale sort of way. Heroes of questionable morality perform valiant acts in defiance of cold and rigid prison wardens and life is at its most fragile, balancing between the joy needed to stay alive and rock-bottom depression.However you choose to compare the films, there's no doubt both are on greatest film lists. "Cool Hand Luke" simply has the distinction of being first.Paul Newman's Oscar-nominated performance is one of his very best, or at least one of my favorites to this point. I have not seen "The Color of Money," but I have little doubt that Oscar was rewarded to him for having been screwed over so many times.As Dragline (George Kennedy, who won an Oscar) so perfectly points out in his ending monologue voiced over a montage of Luke, Newman's smile alone makes Luke such a magnetic character. There's always a sense that he knows something you don't, that he has mastered some secret of life that makes him impervious to hardship. His tacit contempt for authority makes him much more likable than your typical anti-hero (if he can even be considered one), and it also primes us for his few dramatic scenes, which are soft but moving.Lucas Jackson is an honored war vet who is thrown somewhat needlessly into a prison work camp in the south after beheading parking meters while drunk. Compared to the crimes of some of the others, it's a bad deal. Luke quickly falls out of favor with the prison guards with his subtle defiance, and it takes him some time before he's initiated with his fellow inmates.There are so many memorable scenes in the film because the most pivotal moments are also the most visually appealing. Director Stuart Rosenberg and writer Frank Pierson appear to be on the same page in really emphasizing scenes such as the "Lucille" scene in which a local woman erotically washes a car as the men look on from their work post, the subsequent boxing fight between Luke and Dragline and the egg-eating scene. Prior to Luke trying to escape after "getting some rabbit in his blood" when a personal tragedy befalls him, the plot doesn't have a whole lot of places to go, so the scenes become entirely about character development, which pays off for the rest of the film. The escape attempts have an underlying strength because of the entertaining first act or so.The sense of camaraderie amongst the inmates is another thing you can't help but take notice of. Sometimes scenes are designed that way, but even when the focus is elsewhere, the extras and supporting actors are enhancing the environment, creating a mood for the film, one that expresses how caught in a bubble they are and gives you the sense of how prisoners will insist on life even in rough conditions."Cool Hand Luke" eventually evolves into a story of leadership, the qualities that make a man great, or "an original" as Dragline says. Luke becomes an inspiration for his inmates through his attitude and his actions, though more an ideal to aspire to as opposed to a role model to emulate. Newman's performance hammers that home as truth for the audience too, which makes "Cool Hand Luke" a classic.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit http://moviemusereviews.com
My how time flies. Not only have we watched three young actors and their respective characters grow up over the course of 10 years before our very eyes, but also the tonal shift from light to dark in the "Harry Potter" movies has been unusually drastic. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1″ is a true epic  a dark and brooding journey with a tone remarkably akin to "The Lord of the Rings." Director David Yates has taken a film series which was once a fanciful, light-hearted rendering of author J.K. Rowling's imagination and made it feel real and especially dangerous. I suppose you could say it's not your older sibling's "Harry Potter."The dark turn of the films was inevitable given the content of the books, but Yates has realized it in such a way that these last couple of films have felt completely different from their predecessors. Rowling's tone, in spite of more prolific deaths, has not changed nearly as much. This time around there's lots of blood, characters are dying left and right and the stuff that supplements the main plot, instead of being fluffy and magical, is decidedly dramatic.Although Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is still the courageous and impulsive one, Hermione (Emma Watson) is still the smart and prepared one and Ron (Rupert Grint) is still the oblivious one, the dialogue is adult and the moments they share are complex. The three friends must survive on their own in this film as they search for the horcruxes (objects infused with parts of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul) and are on the run from the Death Eaters, the dark wizards and witches who have seized the Ministry of Magic and have begun a reign of terror. Considering these once-child stars were initially cast on looks and being able to play their type, they continue to prove themselves as venerable adults in "Hallows."This maturity is reflected in the writing of screenwriter Steve Kloves (who adapted every book but "Order of the Phoenix"). He provides many tender and dramatic moments between the friends, not all of which were written by J.K. Rowling, trusting them to handle the deeper material. Given the flexibility of a two-film final chapter, Kloves could also resort more to cutting corners than entire sections of the book. Devout fans will notice much of the exposition regarding Albus Dumbledore's "mysterious" past including that involving the wizard Gridelwald has been axed or turned into easter eggs. That's it as far as significant omissions, and it was the right choice on account of a lack of visual storytelling opportunities, even though Harry's growing resentment of/loss of faith in Dumbledore never becomes part of the story as it does so intriguingly in the book.Yates' patience also improves the series in "Hallows." There's a build up to the events and some lengthier shots that have a lasting impact. It feels more like a dramatic motion picture than a squeeze-it-in adaptation. The film could have easily hopped from scene to scene with action at every turn, but Yates takes his time. The scene in Godric's Hollow, for example, when Harry and Hermione follow the old Bathilda Bagshot to her house only to find she's not quite who they think she is evolves slowly and culminates in a tense sequence lasting much shorter. Succinctly put, the cinematic quality of the films has continued to improve as it has done ever since Yates took over. What used to be the emphasis in the plot-driven scenes (action and visual effects) has changed."Deathly Hallows" is not forgiving of those who aren't already familiar with the Harry Potter universe, but at the same time, this darker tone, higher proportion of drama and much more cinematic feel should improve the overall entertainment factor for those hoping to get something out of the "Hallows" despite never reading the books or barely remembering the previous entries.With the PG-13 rating back on, "Deathly Hallows" feel real and the action is palpable. The casting of fighting spells back and forth in battle do some collateral damage for once. The sound and VFX teams deserve major credit for upping that factor to a new level. For once, magical realism has an application to the Potter world: Instead of calling attention to pretty visual effects, Yates and crew make them feel naturally part of the action, which keeps our focus on the characters. CGI in films has also improved over the 10 years of "Potter" movies and as such, Yates sees no compelling need to highlight them more than usual and "Hallows" is better for it.Maybe most importantly, "Hallows Pt. 1″ sets us up for a dramatic, exciting and cathartic finale to the most impressive movie franchise ever made. Yates, Kloves and the entire cast and crew have really upped the stakes with their work on this film and it shows. I have no ounce of doubt that Part 2 will be an incredible send-off for this series given the effort and creativity put into Part 1. If you're a fan who has forgotten how close you've actually become to these characters, "Deathly Hallows" will surely remind you.
Normally when you can see a film's jokes coming from a mile away, it tends to take the film down a notch in most people's eyes, but in "Christmas Vacation," the third Vacation film from John Hughes and the National Lampoon's crew, it still finds away of charming your pants off--or on fire.This time the Griswolds in fact are not vacationing, but invite their extended family to spend the week up until Christmas. This time, everything goes awry at their place. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect. Clark (Chase) goes overboard with the Christmas lights to find they don't work and manages to have assorted objects smack him in the face or take him out completely on numerous occasions. The grandparents are completely off their rockers and the kids can't stand it. Then of course what would a family Christmas be without their hick cousins the Johnsons, especially their father figure, Eddie (Randy Quaid) who is more reckless and stupid than ever in effort to push Clark over the brink.80s comedy mastermind Hughes ("The Breakfast Club," "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," the other 2 vacation movies) pretty much decided to stuff everything he included in the tons of other comedies he wrote in the decade into this film. It has everything from extreme physical comedy to wacky relatives to animals causing mayhem. That's why it's so predictable, but of course Hughes is also the master of reminding us of our family values and keeping them close (easy enough in a Christmas film). The comedy starts out rusty but once the ball gets rolling "Christmas Vacation" gets harder to roll your eyes at. The subtle outlandish humor and hi-jinx win you over every time.Chevy Chase remains the glue of the Vacation films. Every man feels like Clark Griswold at times (trouble at work, extra-marital temptations, putting all their effort into something to fail or be under-appreciated) and every person has or knows a dad like Clark Griswold. He's the epitome of the Hallmark greeting card "Dad." Without his ho-hum but quick to heat up personality that Chase nails down, these films wouldn't be as good; it would be harder to get past the predictable slapstick.
Liam Neeson the gritty action hero. How unbelievable that at nearly 60 years old, an actor can redefine his career and become more bankable. Neeson has somehow re-channeled the seriousness he brought to dramatic roles into creating utterly convincing heroes in decent (at best) thrillers. But that's not "The Grey." "The Grey" earns marks far above decent, and Neeson's performance makes it better. I know, the calendar clearly reads January, but that's a matter of maximizing box-office potential in this case. Writer/director Joe Carnahan ("The A-Team") has turned a new leaf in this harrowing wilderness survival thriller, a film as dedicated to exploring the true extent of the human will to live as much as shocking its audience with menacing wolf attacks.Neeson leads the pack in all manner of ways. Paid to protect oil workers from nature's dangers (especially wolves), Neeson's character Ottway turns out to be a group of drillers' best chance for survival when their plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness near a wolf den. He's far from a boy scout, however, and he's emotionally wounded by the past as evidenced by visions of his wife.Most of the early indicators in the film give you the sense that Neeson will do his usual solemn-faced hero routine that he executes to perfection, but the way the film unfolds (not in terms of plot, but in terms of the quality of the storytelling) asks him to go beyond that. He definitely responds.When looked at in its most fundamental form, "The Grey" could be considered just another film in which a group of imperiled people die one at a time en route to finding safety. Carnahan, however, slows down that pace so that we can absorb the extent of the danger and imagine ourselves in it. When death does occur, it's visually striking, jaw-dropping and/or thought-provoking as compared to standard efforts at the genre that involve only jump-scare deaths or death by character stupidity. Only one character, Diaz (Frank Grillo) gets a stereotype as the stubborn self-centered jerk who disagrees with Ottway on purpose. Most movies would've killed him off before he got too annoying, but Carnahan and co-writer Ian Mackenzie Jeffers (who wrote the short story the film's based on), have more interesting plans in store for him. It's also not just a film about people being hunted by wolves in the wilderness. There's no bloody man vs. wolf climactic battle, unlike what the trailers would have you believe, so film fans prone to take misleading marketing out on the film itself, be prepared. "The Grey" is much more of a suspenseful drama with high-adrenaline scenes lurking around every corner. As such, the visual style of "The Grey" asks for something different from Carnahan than the over-the-top high-flying nature of his previous two films, "The A-Team" and "Smokin' Aces." The overall tone is gritty and naturalistic, so snow-caked beards without the blistering frostbite makeup. The action is also more frenetic and gripping. Rather than shooting the action scenes in a traditional sense, he wants the viewer to feel as if they are experiencing them along with the characters. If a character falls from a tree top and hits 20 branches on the way down, that's exactly what the camera's doing. This maximizes the intensity of every major sequence. As for the wolves, they're horrifying, yet never painted as the bad guys. They're just part of nature.When it comes to issues of faith and the will to survive, that's when "The Grey" really jumps up and above the bar for its genre. The story is told in such a way that when people die, it's not for our entertainment, but to highlight the unpredictable nature of ... nature, and life and death. As Ottway wrestles with these same issues, its Neeson's performance that makes it hit home."The Grey" gives its audience the rare gift of genre-film entertainment with some serious food for thought and an ample dose of emotion. Carnahan's choices on how to tell the story, along with an ending not typical of genre films, only make it all the stronger. Both he and Neeson display the true nature of their strengths. Hopefully we've seen only the beginning of Carnahan's potential, and that nature is kind enough to Neeson to let him continue challenging the norm for the standard heroic performance.~Steven CThanks for reading!

In a time where independent films are quickly growing in the favor of not only the public but in the eyes of critics, the Academy and other motion picture associations, it can almost be said that "Frost/Nixon," a historical drama in the purest sense, is a breath of fresh air. In a difficult time such as the state of the U.S. at the moment, independent films are much more appealing as they relate to people on a more universal level. This is something "Frost/Nixon" can't pretend to be--it's political, highly intellectual, grounded in historical fact, and deals with themes of power and fame. That's why "Frost/Nixon" is likely to walk away empty- handed through much of award season, because despite being a compelling drama worthy of praise on nearly every end of its production, a drama that works your left brain is not what people are looking to see right now. For that same reason, however, many viewers, especially the very frequent moviegoers, are likely to find the change of pace that "Frost/Nixon" brings quite welcome.The film, based on the 1976 interviews between President Richard M. Nixon and British TV personality David Frost, really fires on all cylinders. It is written by England's Peter Morgan, who also wrote the Tony-award winning play it's based on, which is its first right move. Morgan, who penned "The Queen" and "The Last King of Scotland" clearly has the strength to make a film out of his script, likely why he produced it in the first place. So many plays fail to find a home on the screen that actually breathes new life into it, but "Frost/Nixon" does. Secondly, it is directed by American favorite Ron Howard, who despite seeming like a name more than anything else lately, absolutely has done some of his best work here. Considering the film is about preparing for and conducting an interview, it's amazing how compelling and well-paced he tells this story. His camera angles, close-ups, changing of focus keep this from ever approaching boring.What really brings this film together to be so interesting, ultimately, is the cast. Frank Langella, who originated as Nixon on Broadway, is simply marvelous. The mannerisms, the array of facial expressions--he is quite the screen presence and his performance is without question Oscar-worthy. We develop a liking, loathing and pity for Nixon all in one film because of Langella. His performance makes you think more about the film more than anything else in the movie. His counterpart is also well-played by Michael Sheen, who has collaborated with Morgan on his other films. Sheen's greatest strength is conveying Frost's conflicting role as both big shot personality and hard-hitting journalist. Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell round out the cast with strong performances as does rising star Rebecca Hall ("Vicki Cristina Barcelona") as Frost's love interest.What culminates in "Frost/Nixon" is a drama that is surprisingly compelling. All the elements of performance and direction and writing converge to put you in a place where you feel the struggle that Frost (and many journalists, for that matter) deal with regularly--trying to not let someone with an agenda walk all over you as you interview them. The interview is sort of an unacknowledged verbal war, especially when it involves something so incredible as corruption at the highest level of government. Not only does this pump up the film's pace, but you truly can see how similar Frost and Nixon really are despite their conflicting interests and the film takes you to greater understanding of power and public image."Frost/Nixon" might in fact be a film for the more intellectual tastes of movie-goers and not reach the broad appeal of its award season competitors, but it is an excellent example of how dialog and debate can become powerful elements of storytelling and of course how history can continue to be relevant today, especially in a time where corruption is not any less of a problem as it was then.
When you think classic Woody Allen and then you think of the last 15 years Woody Allen, two sharp and distinctly opposite thoughts come to mind. Classic Woody is all about the people, crazy neurotic people looking for love and self-fulfillment/discovery. Last 15 years Woody is all generally...weird. "Vicky Cristina Barcelona" is finally Woody finding himself in a modern context - taking what made him famous and making it work with multiple audiences."Barcelona" takes place in the city of the same name as two women, Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johannson) best friends with distinctly different views on life and love, are both smitten by a Spanish painter named Juan Antonio (Bardem). Both women's definitions of love are called into question by the odd but alluring man and even his definition is called into question when his ex-wife (Cruz) enters the picture.Allen tells this story in a highly narrative way, even using actual spoken narrative from an omniscient objective party. It's used to start to get us into the characters heads and sort of cleverly gives us expectations about what we are to see in addition to foreshadowing. It's a much more direct, yet still artsy way of telling a very Allen-like story involving love triangles and threesomes and such. While it may sound provocative, it makes actual sense as to why Woody chose for certain events to happen.This is also a very artistic film. Allen has simply moved his love of New York City to another city that is simply overseas in Barcelona. The culture and the landscape plays a very pivotal role in creating a mood for this film, some motivation for the characters to do things they wouldn't have before the film begins. It definitely leaves you longing for a carefree, overseas adventure.Most importantly, this is some fine relationship drama. All the conversations are easy to follow and extremely easy to relate to. These aren't mind-altering ideas about love, well maybe with the exception of threesomes, but they are provided a different, unique context that is the beautiful city of Barcelona. Welcome back, Woody, we missed you.
Oftentimes, indie films can be summarized in a single Twitter hashtag: #firstworldproblems. Lynn Shelton's "Your Sister's Sister" definitely applies, but fortunately, Shelton anchors her story with a script that feels dynamic and largely improvised as well as three excellent actors.The film takes place in Washington state, a year after the death of Jack's (Mark Duplass) brother and Iris' (Emily Blunt) ex-boyfriend. Jack and Iris have become best friends since. After talking to Jack, Iris can tell he needs a refresher, so she convinces him to spend some time at her family's getaway home on an island off the coast. When he arrives, he unexpectedly encounters Iris' older sister, Hannah (Rosemarie DeWitt), and the two engage in a drunken hookup that reveals to be a big problem when Iris turns up unannounced the next morning.It's really hard to see the conflict in this film at all, let alone first-world conflict, until we learn that Iris has been hiding intense emotional feelings for Jack. Then it gets complicated, albeit the whole ordeal is really trifling start to finish. Somehow, however, Shelton compels us with these selfish sad-sack characters. Maybe it's similar to the way reality shows manage to make us care about the scum of the Earth, but more than likely it's how easily we can relate to these conflicts, because most of us likely to watch "Your Sister's Sister" only deal with first- world problems.If the Pacific Northwest setting weren't so critical to the film's aesthetic, you might wonder if Shelton's film was a play first. The scenes are lengthier and the cast obviously quite small. Although there are some melodramatic spikes throughout the story, much of the film relies on moments of natural human connection between the characters.Duplass is in his wheelhouse as a somewhat confused soul with a great sense of humor and a dash of paranoia. As the star of Shelton's 2009 film "Humpday," he knows exactly what this style of drama needs to thrive. As someone capable of holding her own in everything from mainstream comedy to period pieces to blockbusters, Blunt continues to showcase her versatility as Iris. As poorly as the script builds her character in so far as reasons she should love Jack, Blunt sells it completely.DeWitt's Hannah is a messier character than both Jack and Iris, possibly combined. She's a lesbian just out of a long-term relationship who hooks up with a man, and though her reasons become clearer as the film progresses, it doesn't make her any more endearing. Shelton clearly enjoys tinkering with characters who have unlikable tendencies and deserve little of our sympathy. There's nothing at stake in the film either except whether members of the trio can reconcile their differences and actually share their feelings with each other. Nevertheless, they're lifelike creatures, and if you're the film's target audience, your issues with yourself and with others become mirrored in their struggles. As trivial as their dilemma is, it resonates, and the way Shelton captures the Pacific Northwest scenery will evoke the same feeling you get when you visit your own personal nature-shrouded getaway."Your Sister's Sister" amounts to a story of the bond between siblings that reinforces the a value of those relationships. Despite the inconsequential nature of all the conflict in the film, Shelton and her cast tap into familiar feelings and emotions with ease. The might be first- world problems, but that doesn't take away from their legitimacy.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
The stories of great people, particularly the great thinkers, have been source material for a number of acclaimed and awarded biopics, a sub-genre that has evolved a lot in the last decade. You can tell just by comparing two of 2014's best, each focused on one of the greatest British minds of the 20th century. There's "The Imitation Game," the suspenseful, "critical moment in the life of" take on the life of mathematician and computer grandfather Alan Turing, and then "The Theory of Everything," an emotional romance taking the "snippets in the chronological life of" approach to theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking.Taken from Jane Hawking's memoir, it makes sense why "The Theory of Everything" tells us more about her and Stephen's relationship than it does about Stephen's work. For those interested more in the science of Stephen's life and work, it's a film that will disappoint on some level; director James Marsh and writer Anthony McCarten are far more interested in the philosophy and ideology that influenced Stephen's way of thinking, and how Jane influenced him as well."The Theory of Everything" is also a chronicle of a crippling disease. We meet Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) at Cambridge, where he meets and falls in love with Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) and shortly thereafter learns he's suffering from ALS, a fatal disease. Stricken with depression, he tries to distance himself from Jane, but she insists on staying by his side. We slowly watch Stephen lose the ability to move parts of his body until he becomes wheelchair bound and can no longer speak. Yet miraculously the disease never claims his life, and never affects his mind, even if it does take a heavy toll on his family.Redmayne certainly deserves all the praise in the world for being able to honestly and authentically portray the evolving disabilities, but his performance is so much more than such surface-level awards-bait fodder. Redmayne's true accomplishment is how he lets Stephen's personality grow and shine through despite of the physical limitations. Through eye contact and facial expressions, he paints something special despite the clear restrictions of his brush. Stephen's spirit really shows, and it adds to what's already an emotional film.Yet Stephen is not the sole focal point of this movie. Jane is very much his equal, and in many ways, the film is really about her, a woman's struggle to be the caretaker she set out to be, what it is like to feed and clothe and literally care for an internationally famous person incapable of doing those basic things for himself. She is a complex character, both strong and weak, shoving aside expectations of how she should or shouldn't behave or think at every opportunity. A young-faced 30-year-old, Jones is trusted to convey age and maturity as the film goes on (the makeup doesn't really get the job done), and she does in a way most actresses her age simply have yet to demonstrate in their careers. Marsh and the film's casting director, Nina Gold, deserve a whopping commendation for trusting in such young talent to convey these people at such mature stages of their relationship. Most films would've gone with older veterans knowing they could get away with them playing Stephen and Jane in their 20s and that later in the film they would fit naturally. Instead, they got two lesser-known but rising stars who have long careers ahead of them and could still probably fill these roles 15 years from now."The Theory of Everything" only lacks in compelling drama. It's a portrait of two people and the ups and downs of their relationship, making it a much more indie take on the life of a famous person rather than the Hollywood prestige biopic route that won "A Beautiful Mind" the Best Picture Oscar. More concisely, it will move audiences far more than it will entertain them, which for the biographical genre, is actually refreshing.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more!
I get it. If we're not careful, our excessive use of technology will destroy our privacy and ultimately be our demise. Now that "Eagle Eye" has completely emptied the tank on the concept of cell phones and surveillance cameras being used to create an elaborate conspiracy, maybe we can go back to character-driven thrillers.No knocks on the entertainment factor of "Eagle Eye." Produced by Steven Spielberg along with a couple of the writers behind "Transformers," (real shocker there) this an exceptionally well-paced action thriller that has us hooked and begging for answers as to what's happening to Jerry (LaBeouf), who finds himself framed for terrorist-related activities and being commanded to do things by a woman on his cell phone who appears to have access to anything that can be programmed.The problem with "Eagle Eye," minus its tired concept, is that as it keeps barreling along on the railways and streets of Chicago, it only becomes less interesting and more outlandish. Unlike most thrillers that tend to get more exciting as a film goes on, "Eagle Eye" actually gets worse as we know more and more about the reason behind everything, making it really hard to critique without spoilers. We're still engaged, but we find more and more reasons to role our eyes as the film heads toward its climax.No element of the film is that atrocious, but it's just absolutely relentless. Non-stop action films can be great, but whether you switch cities or add a female partner (Michelle Monaghan) for LaBeouf to run with, it doesn't change up an action sequence if the dynamic (in this case run, run and do what Julianne Moore's voice says) stays the same.Without a doubt, "Eagle Eye" fits a genre mold and fits it well, and viewers who like spark- flying action and a good guessing game will find entertainment worth two hours. For those who've seen a lot of the genre and already understand that computers will inevitably control us all, "Eagle Eye"'s entertainment value will just barely hold up amidst a lot of derision.
"Taken" only begs one question: Why did it take producers this long to give Liam Neeson his own revenge thriller? OK, there was Sam Raimi's "Darkman" in 1990, a cult favorite before Neeson rose to fame, but the Irish actor who seems to age like fine wine has dished it to baddies in 18th Century Scotland ("Rob Roy"), a galaxy far, far away ("Star Wars: Episode I"), during the Crusades ("Kingdom of Heaven") and dare I say WWII Germany? So what took so long for him to be a modern day retired CIA agent?"Taken" and Neeson belong together. Neeson has always well-played the wise mentor role that draws respect from all other characters in the films he's in and the audiences. He's a natural fit to play an older man still capable of laying a beat down on amoral criminals, particularly of the European trash variety. "Taken" is a simple but genius vehicle to deliver that.Written in part by Luc Besson, whose films ("Leon: The Professional") have only gotten more commercial with age ("The Transporter" and sequels), "Taken" tells the simple story of former CIA agent Bryan Mills, who retires in order to make up for lost time with his 17-year-old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace from early "Lost"), a relationship destroyed by Bryan's never being around. When Kim goes to spend the summer in Paris, her overprotective father calls her right when she gets there, convenient timing considering she's about to be kidnapped. Bryan vows revenge on the kidnapper and flies to Paris, using his incredible wealth of skills to track her down and make her captors pay.Besson gives us another action/revenge story motivated by love. The father/daughter connection can never be exploited enough considering it guarantees our utmost sympathies. It also makes the hard-nosed "don't mess with me" attitude of Neeson on his revenge spree all the more crucial in our minds. "Taken" never has a dull moment because we're behind Neeson 100 percent and love every move he makes.Sure, "Taken" could go much deeper. It's sort of just assumed that part of Neeson's motivation is to prove to his daughter how much he cares, but that never actually crosses our minds thanks to anything that's in the script or that director Pierre Morel does. It also couldn't hurt to make Bryan a bit more conflicted; give us some sense that he's not exactly a paragon of justice, something that would make "Taken" come more from the head and a tad less from the fists. Instead, the movie happily enjoys the fact that it's plot, motivation, action and force of an actor in Neeson will win over the audience. And it definitely does.
"Frozen River" is one of those movies that on the outside appears to be of no interest to the average viewer. It takes place at the New York-Quebec border, deals with the little known issue of smuggling Asian immigrants into the U.S. and centers around a white low-income mother and a young Native American woman. It doesn't exactly scream "distribute me as a major motion picture." Then again, those who give "Frozen River" a chance will be incredibly impressed and fascinated with an independent drama unlike any other.Oscar-nominated actress Melissa Leo, whose done numerous small projects/roles in the past, gives a strong performance as Ray Eddy, a mother working at minimum wage to support two kids, a teenager and a 5-year-old, whose gambling-addicted husband has run out on them again, leaving them with nothing to live on. In search of her husband, she has a run in with a young woman (Misty Upham) on the local Mohawk Reservation who pulls her into the profitable world of smuggling Asian illegals across the border via driving over the river which is frozen in winter. Desperate and somewhat mad, she sees the cash reward outweighing the risk.It's a mellow film, borrowing on the bleak and snowy imagery of "Fargo" and accompanied by an equally contemplative and subtle score by Peter Golub and Shazad Ishmaily. Keeping it dramatic is Leo's performance as desperate and strangely confident woman (she's not shy at all about pointing a gun at someone) whose really quite broken inside. The film is not aggressively dramatic, but creator Courtney Hunt, in her first project, gives a story with a strong structure that delivers enough tension-filled events.Hunt definitely shows promise, even if part of the intrigue of "Frozen River" is its unique premise. Still, what ties it together is how it shows the innately human desire of providing for children and one's family that can drive a person to make choices that they otherwise wouldn't risk. It's what makes "Frozen River" something that can connect to all audiences, even if on the outside it doesn't appear to have huge appeal. It's one of those films you have to at least tip your hat to because it says "screw the business side of Hollywood, movies are about great stories."
The grandfather of the mystery genre -- and film's most adapted character -- is none other than the great detective Sherlock Holmes, so if one were to apply Holmes' own deductive reasoning skills, a modern reinvention was a matter of time. English Director Guy Ritchie ("Snatch," "RocknRolla") applies his witty and gritty crime thriller style to the first mainstream 21st Century version of Holmes, one that will likely appeal to a younger crowd and those less familiar with previous incarnations of the iconic sleuth. The reason is the new "Holmes" is much less concerned with the quality of the mystery and more focused on breathing a new quirkiness and style into the character and his top-notch detective work. The script hopes you'll be hooked on the reveal of how Holmes figures everything out and not so much the crime/mystery itself. In other words our new "Holmes" is about creating an entertaining diversion in the form of clever logic, high-brow humor and old-school science -- it uses mystery conventions but to a showier end. Wisely, Warner Bros. has trusted the responsibility of delivering this amusement to one of the best and hottest comedians out there in Robert Downey Jr. Downey Jr. continues to impress in his turn as Holmes, managing to employ his same wit and charms while creating a unique character that makes you feel as if you're watching Holmes, not RDJ with yet another accent. This Holmes is not merely a wise detective of old, but the quirky type, suggesting some insanity behind the genius. RDJ makes him much more colorful and entertaining and takes attention away from an okay storyline.The mystery surrounds Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), who appears to have supernatural abilities derived from an ancient magic. He creates terror in London appearing to have risen from the grave and committed a couple murders. Holmes and his dear friend Dr. Watson (Jude Law) are on the verge of ending their partnership because Watson has plans to settle down and marry when the crafty Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) gets them deep into the Blackwood case.The supernatural angle didn't work well for the latest Indiana Jones film and it doesn't exactly do well here. "Sherlock Holmes" Ver. 2009 is a little more Dan Brown "Angels & Demons" and a little less "Se7en." This is fine for those who can look to Holmes for a more mainstream romp than what an older crowd might hope to be a rigorous exercise in fine mystery and logic. Again, the fewer the expectations, the better.As for the lean and mean Guy Ritchie depiction of Holmes, it's not entirely unfounded. The script creatively draws the connection between Holmes' intellectual prowess and how he might use it in a physical bout. It adds another dimension and ups the entertainment factor of the character. It might feel like it's giving a character steroids to put on more of a show, but the appeal would be too narrow if Holmes were straight-laced. Credit, however, has to go to Downey Jr. for making this vision work. His banter with Watson and ability to use classic Holmes logic to a comic effect is infinitely enjoyable.It does take a bit of settling in to understand exactly what direction this new Holmes is going in, but it works thanks to RDJ and picks up as the mystery thickens and Holmes' limits are tested. McAdams' character lacks enough strength to stay memorable and as much as I like Strong, his character lacks dimension too. But the rebirth of Holmes will be a nice Holiday escape for the modern audience and those willing to keep an open mind. It's not your grandfather's "Sherlock Holmes" but can you think of any reason why it should be?~Steven CVisit my site at moviemusereviews.com
Alien invasion stories can often seem a bit far-fetched, but making a great action movie with a compelling story for just $30 million shouldn't. If "District 9" scores at the box office, maybe it will drive home to Hollywood that eternal message that great films come from great stories. "District 9" is a sci-fi movie that takes a great concept and runs with it behind committed visionaries who believe completely in what they're doing. If carefree producers with fat checkbooks had been involved, this story of aliens stranded in Johannesburg, South Africa, forced by the government to live in slums would feel about as hokey as "Starship Troopers." Instead, it's a gripping action blockbuster accompanied by a running social commentary.The only big name attached to "District 9" is producer Peter Jackson ("Lord of the Rings"). South-African born Director Neill Blomkamp makes his debut based on a script he wrote with friend Terri Tatchell. The star is Sharlto Copley, who you've also never heard of before. So aside from Jackson, what's the draw? Blomkamp's premise will simply capture your imagination and glue your interest. Most people can't sell a film with just that, but Blomkamp is so firmly in control of this fictional scenario that anyone can easily believe it for just a couple hours. If you think you can tell that from the trailers, just wait, there's more.Starting out as a fictional documentary, "District 9" explains how the aliens, termed "prawns" for their shrimp-like appearance, showed up hovering over Johannesburg in their mothership and were eventually forced to relocate to Earth. The South African government gave policing permission to Multi-National United, a corp that claimed it wanted to study the species scientifically, when it was chiefly interested in decoding its incredible weapons technology.Eventually the film shifts gears into full-out action mode as Wikus van de Merwe (Copley), who was put in charge of a new operation to relocate the prawns 200 kilometers outside of the city in new refugee-type camps for MNU, becomes infected by an alien substance, making him a walking piece of scientific research.Carrying the historical weight of Apartheid in South Africa, "District 9" essentially plays out a social drama in many aspects, wondering exactly how things might turn out if aliens came to Earth without the goal of taking over our planet. How would we treat them? Segregate them? Kill them without just cause? There are several bumps on the road to fully realizing this concept, but the idea of it and the details Blomkamp gives the aliens -- such as an affinity for rubber and an almost drug-like addiction to cat food -- cover up the mistakes with ease, keeping you interested in what's going to happen next or what else you might learn about the aliens and their circumstances.As an action film, "District 9" picks up halfway through, giving plenty of blood-soaring body- dismembering gore (sometimes to a comical degree) to those viewers that bought tickets just to get what they expected from the genre. It does not cheat those looking for just entertainment. But "District 9" clearly strives to earn more respect with its audience. The movie doesn't flaunt its weapons inventions, for example, but incorporates them naturally into the plot in order to generate intrigue, then pulling the trigger and giving us the long- awaited spectacle. It's the kind of respect that a serious storyteller has for his or her audience, and Blomkamp has it. Many plot points and dialogue exchanges are predictable, but the presentation is highly original and the concept is fresh, modern and head-smart compared to the '90s garbage of "Independence Day" and "Men in Black," as wildly popular as those films were. The documentary feel and the hand-held camera action might be the trappings of low budget, but they really tell this story in unique riveting fashion.It amazes me that Michael Bay can take $200 million and make the dizzying piece of scrap metal that was "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," yet an unknown pal of Peter Jackson can take less than a quarter of that money and make thought-provoking and exciting science-fiction with some of 2009's most original storytelling. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Actor-turned-director Thomas McCarthy came off as a natural in his first two features as a director: 2003's "The Station Agent" and 2007's "The Visitor." That put a fat old earmark on latest effort "Win Win."All three films demonstrate an understanding of human motivation and how more often than not, things do not turn out as we plan. The conflicts in his films are extraordinary in the most down-to-earth sense of the word: unusual people and unusual circumstance can enter our lives at a moment's notice and through handling that hardship we become better people."Win Win" encompasses all of these notions and into a tighter, even more Hollywood-like package than McCarthy's previous films. Paul Giamatti stars as Mike Flaherty, an attorney whose practice is struggling, so he spends late afternoons coaching a high school wrestling team. When he learns of a way he can earn money by claiming guardianship of one of his clients with dementia and placing him in an assisted living facility, he pulls the trigger despite knowing the old man (Burt Young) would prefer to live on his own.The decision proves a real win-win  until teenager Kyle (Alex Shaffer) enters the picture. Kyle hitched a ride from Columbus to New Jersey to stay with the old man, his grandfather, after his mother (Melanie Lynskey) checked into drug rehab. Mike and his wife, Jackie (Amy Ryan), take Kyle in because seeing as he can't live at the assisted living facility or alone in his grandfather's house. Kyle, as it turns out, was also a top wrestler in the state of Ohio, and he joins the team.Mike finds a way to make it so that once again, everyone wins, but then Kyle's mom shows up and throws it all into turmoil, putting Mike in a bind and bringing out Kyle's angry side.Giamatti does some of his best work as Mike. Giamatti is most often drawn to playing unlikable characters or ones with glaring flaws and while Mike fits that bill, it's much more understated. Mike bends the rules in one instance, an instance upon which everything that happens next is built. Of course after it all piles up, McCarthy pulls the plug and Mike's true character is tested.So "Win Win" doesn't offer any surprises or truly unique insights into morality. Instead, it plays out one of the many kinds of universal human dilemmas that people face every day. Then it reminds us how we should treat others and rectify situations in which we've done wrong. McCarthy is just being honest with us, and the drama and the acting reflect that.In terms of the wrestling element, one could see it as metaphor for perseverance, but its primary function in the film is to give characters Mike and Kyle an outlet. It helps Mike deal with stress and it allows Kyle to channel his hardships in a healthy way. It didn't have to be wrestling, but wrestling was really the perfect choice."Win Win" feels like a film true to its title. It can get a bit slow, but it would be unfair to refer to its pseudo-remarkable nature as "being too realistic." It strikes a nice balance of conflict, enough to stay engaging yet certainly nothing over the top or melodramatic. Considering the number of films that tip the scales one way or another in that regard, "Win Win" deserves acclaim simply for being neutral.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com
Being film's most iconic character of all time, James Bond is held to a higher standard than any other movie franchise's centerpiece. He got there by winning over all audiences by being a perfect cocktail of immaculate action hero and charming playboy, setting standards for gadgetry, cars, action sequences, filming locales, memorable villains, stunning women and more. It's an untouchable formula and yet "Quantum of Solace" distinctly chooses to mess with it, acting as a sequel and therefore having to tell a tale of mistrust and revenge. Whether it works is a matter of how much you cling to your daddy's James Bond and how willing you are to let him grow into a more modern, complicated character."Solace" picks up immediately after "Casino Royale," the franchise's reboot film that welcomed in Daniel Craig as the sixth 007. That makes it the first Bond sequel ever. Never has watching Bond necessitated the knowledge of a previous film, which is already an adjustment in itself. Since "Royale" gave us a fresh spin on Bond--him actually falling in love and having her taken from him--the follow up clearly had to introduce themes of revenge and as a result, the James we all know and love had to have a more complex psyche, or one at all some would argue.With drama being more central to the plot, enter Paul Haggis, award-winning screenwriter for "Crash." to the team of Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who made "Royale" refreshing and yet essential Bond, with great dialog and innovative action sequences. "Solace" suddenly takes a darker tone. Themes (that's right, people, Bond with themes!) like trust and revenge come into play, techniques like symbolism. Suddenly Bond isn't the same even though 21 other films are telling us otherwise.Most noticeable of all is there's a distinct drop off in the clever dialog, in fact I don't think Bond ever smiles. Part of what made Craig an instant hit was his ability to so easily combine Bond's mix of business and pleasure, his toughness and his charm. "Solace" strips him of using those talents and that's unfortunate. Instead we get a very complex, reflective Bond, and while Craig does that well, it's not as likable as a character trait.The plot is confusing and ultimately unimportant. Knowing Bond is out for revenge is enough to keep the film believable. Basically, "Solace" takes us all over the world so that Bond can beat people up or kill them in various climates. The film's action sequences are cool enough, though director Marc Forster's turn at action is a bit tough to watch. The sequences have so many cuts that happen so quickly that some of the scenes are an unintelligible blur. Occasionally there are some knockout shots that really rock, but it's mostly about the location shooting in terms of the film's visual statement.Seeing Bond assume greater depth as a character certainly has its merits, but to sacrifice some of the best aspects of the franchise like the humor and playfulness might not really be worth it. The writers and producers, however, decided not to back down from the fact that they chose to send Bond in this direction and that's commendable. They made a committed choice to show us Bond's dark side and from that perspective it's a good film. Hopefully Bond's just had his one night stand with revenge and can be back to familiar territory when he takes the screen for the 23rd time.
With so many CGI animated feature films starring cute animals pouring in and out of theaters year after year, it can be tough to sort through them all and figure out which ones are actually worth taking a family to. "Surf's Up" belongs in the pile with the good ones. Written and animated similar to a Christopher Guest mocumentary film ("Best in Show," "Waiting for Guffman") there's a unique humor to "Surf's Up" that spins the same old underdog storyline into something unusual and fresh that everyone in the family can enjoy.The focus of this "documentary" is Cody Maverick (voiced by Shia LaBeouf), a rock-hopper penguin from Shiverpool, Antarctica with a dream of getting away from the south pole and becoming a premiere surfer like his idol Big Z. Cody's prayers are eventually answered despite the fact that he has nothing but an icicle surfboard and some serious ambition. He ends up being spotted by a talent scout and makes his way to Pen-gu island just in time for the penguin world surfing championshipWhen Cody gets challenged before the tournament and fails against the world's best surfer, Tank Evans (Diedrich Bader), he meets some unlikely friends like Joe the chicken (Jon Heder), a love interest in Lani (Zooey Deschanel), and Geek (Jeff Bridges) who helps Cody learn the waves so he can live his dream and compete in the championship.There are jokes for the whole family here, which is "Surf's Up"'s most admirable trait. There's enough for the adults without too much material going over kids' heads and there's plenty of physical humor that kids will enjoy. The mocumentary style also provides a fresh set of laughs, even though the movie falls in the milder realm on the humor scale. There's also plenty of good values that one would expect from an animated movie focused on a sport: never give up, winning isn't everything, the value of friendship in picking us up when we fall.The animation is also strong, though much more cartoonish than the penguin movie "Happy Feet." Most interesting is the way that the animation is meant to reflect what it would look like if the movie were being shot like a live-action documentary. One scene follows Lani carrying Cody through the jungle and it looks like a crew with a camera and one main source of light are following her. So it's very cool in terms of film-making, not just mere concept. "Ratatouille" and Pixar's brilliance aside, this would have won the Oscar in 2008 for its ingenuity.The best way to describe "Surf's Up" is cute. It's unique, sweet and fun to watch. The films in the bad animation pile try and do too much with the humor and in executing grandiose concepts. This movie keeps the plot simple but shows it in a new and amusing way.
As far as superheroes go, they don't get much campier than the "Star-Spangled Man." A super soldier dressed in red, white and blue who bashes in Nazi skulls with his all-American shield? Undoubtedly, Captain America served a very specific purpose when he debuted in 1940, but 70 years later, Marvel Studio has found a way to make him relevant again in "Captain America: The First Avenger." With a script that dives into the soul of its character as every good origin story should and packs in adventure of old-school proportions, "Captain America" strikes a strong balance of nostalgic charm and modern action.Anyone that felt director Joe Johnston had to prove himself as the director of a superhero film should and will stand corrected. Like anyone he's had his misfires ("Jurassic Park III"), but with films such as "The Rocketeer," "Jumanji," and "October Sky" under his belt, he knows how to tell a story that pleases its audience above all else. "Captain America" achieves that almost instantly. You can feel the influence of Johnston's early career work doing visual effects for George Lucas in the original "Star Wars" films as well as "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Like those beloved films, "Captain America" quickly establishes a protagonist you can root for and a large scale for action and adventure.Chris Evans finally shakes loose his comic relief type-casting and shows off his leading man potential as Steve Rogers, a scrawny young man (thanks to some excellent special effects) from Brooklyn whose persistent yet futile attempts to enlist in the army catches the eye of a fled German scientist named Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci). Erskine has developed a serum that the military hopes it can use to build an army of "super soldiers" and he insists on finding the perfect specimen to test it on  someone of outstanding character and moral fiber. Rogers has been standing up to bullies who beat the snot out of him all his life, yet has never wavered in courage and determination. After convincing Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) Rogers is the one, Erskine and his colleague Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) administer the serum to Rogers, who's instantly transformed into the ideal physical specimen.Yet despite his new gifts, it's not all uphill for Rogers; in a turn of events, he's now the only super soldier who does or will ever exist, so presumably he's unable to help the fight abroad on his own. A New York senator then convinces him to become a propaganda tool. This diversion is the script's strongest non-action sequence because it sours any chance the film could be seen as all "God Bless America" and whatnot. Although a musical number written by Alan Menken is not usually how most films follow up the "now he's become the superhero!" scene, it strengthens the character long term because he had to carve out his own destiny. By doing just that, he embodies American ideals more than he would have otherwise and also becomes a hero anyone  not just an American  could love.As alluded to, Evans gives a career-best performance, especially miles better than Johnny Storm. Humor takes a back seat in this film compared to "Iron Man" and "Thor" and Evans puts his heart into his performance as Steve Rogers would. Although it's head-scratching how he develops fighting skills so damn quickly (though we should be grateful for the lack of a "training montage"), part of scrawny Steve lives in buff superhero Steve. He might not have the magnetic personality of Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr., but he's a billion times easier to love.Speaking of love, Hayley Atwell gives one of the better leading lady performances in a superhero film period. Her classic figure and beauty makes her a perfect physical fit for Peggy Carter, but she comes packaged with equal parts fearlessness and charisma, which make her a truly likable character. Individually, she and Evans have such strong characters, so together their relationship, built mostly on a truly mutual admiration, feels meaningful unlike most of Marvel's films thus far.On the other end of the spectrum, Hugo Weaving could not be a better choice for Johann Schmidt, a.k.a. Red Skull. A rogue Nazi with a God complex, Red Skull earns our respect as a nasty dude. The script also develops him more as Johann Schmidt at first, which makes the reveal of Red Skull more effective. His presence makes the big fight sequences work, because he captures our attention as any great villain does. As long as he's around, the fight's never over, so the stakes of the action sequences hold up well throughout the film.The period garb will initially evoke the comparisons to "Indiana Jones," but the story earns these comparisons as well. The various action sequences in or on moving vehicles is highly reminiscent of that franchise, but the focus on the main characters does it too. Sure, there are many peripheral characters that don't feel important and other weaknesses crop up, namely in the build to the action sequences, but that character focus helps give us blinders to the flaws (as any good action film accomplishes) and helps us get lost in the story and the action.Unlike the best superhero films of today, "Captain America" doesn't quite hit on the themes as well as it could, which would have helped it ascend to that upper echelon, but it has heart and character in the literal and more internal sense. Other films that did the same thing? "Star Wars," "Indiana Jones," and to give a recent example, "Avatar." If good storytelling with characters we care about truly counts above all else, then praise should be heaped on this film. It might do it the old-fashioned way, but there's a reason those films still entertain years later.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The story of an author incidentally bringing one of his characters to life can go a lot of different directions. There's an inherent fantasy element, an obvious comedy angle, and in the case of "Ruby Sparks," some dramatic potential as well. Actress Zoe Kazan's screen writing debut tries to touch on all three.Paul Dano stars as Calvin Weir-Fields, a writer whose first novel became an American sensation but between writer's block and a mess of psychological issues he can't follow it up. But he's been having dreams of a girl lately, which starts to stir up some inspiration, and eventually  for reasons never explained  he somehow writes her into existence.The predominant tone throughout most of "Ruby Sparks" is light-hearted. The cast contains numerous talents in supporting and in many cases less-than-supporting roles, in part likely due to the directing duo of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, whose film debut "Little Miss Sunshine" made waves throughout Hollywood and earned Alan Arkin an Oscar.Veterans Annette Bening and Antonio Banderas make big impressions with little screen time, while emerging or underrated talents Steve Coogan ("Tropic Thunder"), Chris Messina ("The Newsroom"), Alia Shawkat ("Arrested Development") and Aasif Mandvi ("The Daily Show") round things out with pivotal roles, generally adding to the film's lighter tones.Kazan really nails the humor, both as a writer and an actress, when Calvin discovers Ruby is not in fact a figment of his imagination and later on when he tries to control her through his writing. The struggle comes when the script shifts from fun to dramatic. She has trouble finding the right conceit to bring this silly fantasy to an appropriate boil. She ultimately has to shoehorn several flaws into Calvin's character in order to create a problem and consequently a full story arc.The premise and rules surrounding Ruby's existence mean the potential directions for the story are limitless. Calvin could go as far as to manipulate her for his own desires or accept her as how she is and live happily ever after. So while the film is busy playing around all quirky indie comedy-like, the audience has been running through the countless scenarios and will come to expect a meaningful turn of events. Kazan chooses to focus on whether the ideal love interest of the male protagonist as depicted in works of fiction could ever exist in real life.There's a sharp anti-misogynistic and feminist undercurrent inherent in that concept, which Kazan tries to frame it as a question of whether Calvin can truly be happy with a Ruby who acts of her own volition, or at least with allowing her to. Considering she's his dream girl and he's come up dry in his romantic life for years prior to her inception, you think he'd accept her and not be stupid enough to jeopardize his luck, but there wouldn't be a film there. Instead, Calvin becomes preoccupied with losing her.Given the number of unlikable characters Dano has played over the years, the unflattering characteristics that emerge in Calvin come across with ease through Dano's performance. He's actually a rather pathetic and forlorn character start to finish, with his lone redeeming quality being his humility in a world quick to call him a genius. He's a amusing to watch in the beginning, but you'll wish he weren't so completely clueless.Considering Ruby is a fictional character in two senses, Kazan gives her a realistic flair. When Calvin messes with her a bit, however, she enters some awkward territory and given the nature of her character, we never treat Ruby as a complete, real person, though we wish Calvin did."Ruby Sparks" gets lost in trying to figure out what kind of story it wants to tell, namely because outside of a fantastical concept, there's not an obvious one. Kazan seems most interested in making Calvin feel horrible about the way he's handled Ruby so that he can redeem himself, though in doing so she collapses her feminism argument  if that was even her intention.Still, Kazan fuses her debut with endearing qualities though she'd be well advised to lean toward comedy in the future. Dayton and Faris handle the humor best and seem unsure how to handle its spiral into the bizarre.All the other talents involved in "Ruby Sparks" elevate the material to a certain level. They all appear to be having a great time doing it too, even if the core conflict they so wonderfully support is much less sure of itself.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
Films that intentionally blur the lines between the real and the imagined, that completely defy our most basic sense of narrative structure can often be off-putting and regarded as strange. Some people, no matter how outside-the-box their thinking, will always see "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" this way. The title alone is a red flag for conservative movie-goers. But the truth is that this film is not abstract merely for the sake of style, but it is abstract film-making with a clear purpose. Writer Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry make that purpose accessible the entire film and the result is a unique and special film about the connection between memory and relationship."Eternal Sunshine" is about the relationship between Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet), both of whom have decided to undergo a procedure that would completely erase the other from his/her memory. The majority of plot follows Joel as he seeks out the services of Lacuna, a practice run by a doctor (Wilkinson) and his staff (Ruffalo, Dunst and Wood). As they erase his memory overnight, the film plunges into a progression from most recent to earliest of all of Joel's memories involving Clementine. Things are complicated when a mostly unconscious Joel decides, while in his own memories, that he has changed his mind.As Joel goes through his memories, things disappear, his environment magically shifts from one to the next. Some of this is nifty camera work, much of it is done by computer. It's hard to understand exactly what's going on, but since the action takes place in Joel's mind, what happens is a mix of Joel's actual memory and his mind's interaction with it. It's a brilliant and surreal trip through someone's mind that exposes more and more about this relationship as it goes, also asking questions along the way about whether erasing someone is ultimately an effective way of dealing with loss.It's a pleasure seeing Carrey take on dramatic role successfully. He seems to be able to channel his goofy energy into the neurotic and self-conscious Joel. Winslet proves her own versatility in taking on Clem, who is a free-spirited fireball, not her traditional dramatic performance, but she really demands your attention. Wilkinson and Dunst also prove to be excellent dramatic side-fodder to illustrate another perspective into the memory erasing concept.Excellent, realistic character portrayal combined with surreal visual drama create a concept of love that while abstract, manages to identify with us because there's a wild, imaginative side of love that only exists in our individual minds. Through the entire film, Gondry makes sure we see the very high and very low points of a relationship and it creates a feeling that Joel and Clementine are meant for each other despite obvious proof that they are somewhat incompatible. This helps further push the film's themes.While "Eternal Sunshine" can get confusing and test one's limits at times, a concentrated viewing will show how honest and truthful this film is to not only human relationships, but to the human psyche.
Most "one last job" movies are high-energy action flicks or thrillers driven by a veteran actor playing a character with a troubling back story, but Anton Corbijn's "The American" operates as a character-driven mood piece, a precise and quiet visual portrayal of a man trying to quit his dangerous profession who is constantly haunted and pervasively paranoid. Way different from the Clooney-led spy thrillers of the '90s, "The American" broods and ruminates under the Corbijn's precise visual style. Those expecting Clooney's return to suave criminal mastery will find themselves waiting and waiting for this film to pop. It doesn't. There is no mêlée of Bourne-style assassin-chasing amid the hillside towns of the Italian countryside, so for many, shots of Clooney doing push-ups and putting together a rifle will become tedious.But "The American" doesn't languish quite as much as it might seem, though it certainly does at times. After a jarring opening sequence in Sweden when Clooney's character Jack realizes he's being targeted, Jack quietly makes his way to Rome and then Abruzzo, where a job awaits him even though he's clearly ready to quit and he's still shaken from Sweden. Shots of him maneuvering the gorgeous countryside ensue as well as aforementioned exercise. In a town in the Abruzzo area, he meets Mathilde, his client, for whom he will build a custom rifle as that's his line of work. In the process, he becomes close with a gorgeous prostitute named Clara (Violante Placido) and comes to believe he's being pursued by the Swedes, causing paranoia to engross him. Corbijn, who directed the 2007 black-and-white biopic "Control" about the short life of Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, possesses a calculated and engaging visual style. His shots are ideally framed and pull our eye everywhere it needs to go. Considering dialogue is sparse, the ability for a scene to say a lot without saying anything is crucial and Corbijn does just that. He also plays well off audience expectation for this genre and twists the story in fresh and interesting ways. Corbijn and Clooney are clearly on the same page, even if it means the film puts too much emphasis on the non-verbal and the dauntingly slow build-up to the climax. As much as the emphasis is tone, tone and tone, we come to understand Jack (who later decides he's Edward) extremely well and see his conflict between sticking to his sinful nature as a means to survive and just letting it all go because it bottles him up inside. You can critique the method all you like and complain about the film's choice to lean towards drama instead of action, but Corbijn possesses a good measure of talent and "The American" will leave a profound impression.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
If any of the kids in "The Bad News Bears" were your child, or if you had any acquaintance with a youth sports coach even remotely like Morris Buttermaker, you'd be outraged and embarrassed. At the same time, the film delivers a message that all involved with youth sports probably couldn't hear enough of. In other words, do as "Bad News Bears" implies, not as it says or does and take the foul language and poor behavior at comedic face value only.Walter Matthau stars as Buttermaker, an drunken former minor leaguer who coaches a little league team because his job as a pool cleaner isn't exactly lucrative. His job is to coach the Bears, a group of untalented misfits, most of whom have attitude problems. Basically from Buttermaker and the other adults involved in the league all the way down to the rebel kid, Kelly (Jackie Earle Haley), who tears up the field with his motorcycle, not a character has respect for another. Kids talk back to adults, adults yell at kids -- it's an ugly scene. How "Bears" redeems itself is something of a feat.You can't deny "Bears" its heart. Every lesson there is to be learned from youth sports finds its way into this film. At the very beginning the Bears give up 20 runs in the first and forfeit. Quitting and adopting a counter attitude is present from then on. Then there's the balance between winning and playing the game, something many parents and coaches still lose sight of even today. Despite filling its cast with rotten blonde kids and insensitive adults, "Bears" sneaks this in naturally. The film nearly gets dramatic at times considering the extent to which the disrespect does become a serious part of the story.So on one hand, you have a little blonde kid saying "Great, we have a team full of (insert racial slurs here) and now a girl!" and then you have examples of good sportsmanship winning out. It's tough to call "Bears" a family film or a kids film for that reason, but then again, some kids would really benefit from the values. Most of all parents of kids in youth sports need to see this movie as it really speaks at them.As a comedy, a good chunk of that nastiness earns a good deal of laughs, especially when it involves the innocence of kids rather than the awfulness of the adults. If blurring the line between acceptable behavior in films and comedy is fine by you, "Bears" is as good a sports comedy as any. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
The Muppets stormed their way back to the big screen and the hearts of audiences everywhere in their 2011 "reboot" (of sorts) with the help of funnymen Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller ("Forgetting Sarah Marshall"). An upbeat, emotion-filled comedy, the story of "The Muppets" mirrored the way Jim Henson's creations had gotten lost in popular culture. Now that the gang is back together again, the question of where to go next is one "Muppets Most Wanted" struggles to address.The return of James Bobin to the director's chair and Stoller to the script brings the same subtle, clever, goofy and tongue-in-cheek humor of "The Muppets" into this sequel, announced in grandiose fashion with a classic Muppets-style Broadway number titled "We're Doing a Sequel," which begins just minutes after the last film ended. Composer Bret McKenzie, who won an Oscar for the 2011 movie, also returns to keep up the musical continuity.With the voice, brains and funny bone intact, "Muppets Most Wanted" should be another joyful movie experience, but something is definitely missing in the film, and the top suspect on the list is heart.The story doesn't build the same kind of emotional foundation its predecessor did, and that's really the biggest difference. The plot starts rolling when the Muppets are approached by Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais), who in spite of his last name, convinces the gang to sign off on a world tour. A reluctant Kermit agrees, as his friends are eager to build on their return to fame. When they arrive in Germany, Kermit is framed as Constantine, the most wanted criminal in the world who happens to be his doppelganger plus a mole on his face, and thrown into a Siberian prison. Meanwhile, Constatine takes Kermit's place, using the Muppets as a cover for his and Dominic's nefarious purposes. A clever plot, certainly, but not a warm one.Just look at the three main human characters, for example. Gervais' Dominic, Tina Fey as prison guard Nadya and Ty Burrell as Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon are character/caricature roles, completely different than Segel and Amy Adams, who were main roles and lovable (human) characters. Although it can and should be argued that the Muppets are the stars of their film, the human characters manipulate the plot and often take attention away from them.Subplots also abound. We follow Kermit in prison, Constantine and Dominic, the rest of the Muppets including Miss Piggy's frustrations with her frog-lover, Jean and Sam the Eagle as they investigate crimes  they're all fun and light and have their moments (especially for kiddos) but the movie leans hard on silly and clever without the emotion to weight it down.No emotion also makes it difficult for McKenzie to do his job as composer. Only one song counts as a ballad and captures any semblance of feelings and it belongs to Miss Piggy, who really isn't a main character for most of the movie. The other songs are well-written, fun and catchy, but in the context of the movie they play a very limited role, nothing like what "Life's a Happy Song" did for the first film.Any good family movie needs a balance between humor and heart, and the scales are tipped in "Muppets Most Wanted." Fortunately, the cleverness is strong enough to fuel the movie along to the point that it's an easily tolerable watch.~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit my site for more!
There's really nothing profound in "Manhattan," Woody Allen's first success after 1977's "Annie Hall." It's a story about trying to find what relationships work best that is merely themed in New York City. You get a sense that this movie was Allen really trying to do a film that he wanted to do while using some of the same tactics from "Annie Hall." But while Allen tries to give the film a classic feel by showing shots of the city and the skyline, filming in black and white and using Gershwin music throughout, it's really a movie more about people and their often strange relationships.Allen plays another moderately successful Jewish writer named Isaac Davis trying to live in New York City who has been married twice, has a child and in comic Allen fashion his last wife (interestingly enough played by Meryl Streep) left him and became a lesbian. Now of course, at the age of 42, he's dating a 17-year-old (Mariel Hemingway). If that weren't enough his best friend Yale (Murphy) is having an affair with a woman (Keaton) who Isaac can't help but also be interested in.The film is about these characters and how they handle each other and their views of themselves. Both Allen and Keaton's characters are much different from "Annie Hall," mostly because they aren't as likable because they're egotistical. Allen believes he's a sex maniac and Keaton believes she's a highly intellectual, beautiful young woman when she's really just pretentious. The acting is great and the characters are definitely interesting, but certainly not lovable. If you really take the time to analyze the characters there is a lot of depth to the film. Allen is sure to use a wide array of troubled relationships, especially by contrasting Isaac with Tracy (the high schooler). At the same time, however, there really isn't much of a dramatic climax and you spend too much time picking the characters apart because of their glaring flaws to really care about what's happening to them.Perhaps Allen's biggest fault here is not really working in New York City like the film title and the film's opening suggest. You want to feel like the city should be its own character but it never quite gets there. There is some suggestion about the city as a place of comfort, and Allen chooses many interesting shot angles that include the background more than usual, but you don't feel that being in New York adds a significant layer to the film.Overall, "Manhattan" is a terrific film about relationships and having difficulty in them. There is a lot of painful truth in the way these characters view and deal with their lives and view and deal with each other. If only Allen took more time to get the film to really hit on some of those moments and make them echo stronger, "Manhattan" would have been more than just a classic to the Allen-loving crowd.
The problem with "Knowing" is that it goes too far. It's a tough act to juggle so many overused story conventions such as decoding numbers, the apocalypse and the supernatural these days. Movies like "Knowing" have become almost a genre of their own thanks to Roland Emmerich and other disaster/end-of-the-world-predicting filmmakers. And with that comes expectations as well as a need for originality. What is supposed to set "Knowing" apart? Disaster shots? No; A protagonist trying to convince people he's not crazy though he can see the future? No; Nicholas Cage? Ahaha."Knowing" tries a bit too hard to compensate for this lack of an original premise and the result is a plot riddled with holes. As talented as director Alex Proyas ("Dark City," "I, Robot") is with science fiction and blending sci-fi themes with commercially appealing techniques that please producers, he can only capture our attention for so long until we realize how disconnected and far-fetched all the story elements are.I'll give the film a bit of credit for trying to piece together a message about family and knowing that the end is inevitable and how we struggle to decide whether we believe the events of our lives our connected or completely random, but it gets lost in film's lasting impression because of the absurdity of events. Cage plays an MIT astrophysics professor who discovers a list of numbers from the time capsule uncovered at his son's school. He discovers the numbers are the dates, locations and body counts for every major disaster from 1959 - 2009 and that includes some that have yet to happen.The glitch here is that there's no actual justification for Cage to go running toward life- threatening disasters that he knows will happen. He is a single father with a young son who he promises (in sign language no less) that he will be with forever and ever. It's convenient for him to chase these events because otherwise there's barely any action or special effects, but it sets the film off on the wrong foot. Conceived by an inexperienced Ryne Douglas Pearson who wrote the script in conjunction with "Boogeyman" writers Juliet Snowden and Stiles White, I supposed I shouldn't be shocked that the story plays out like M. Night Shyamalan meets "The Day After Tomorrow" meets "Indiana Jones 4." It certainly keeps your interest but when it's all done you realize they tried to make something work that didn't quite make any sense. Most blatantly, "Knowing" leaves its audience imagining too many hypotheticals.Proyas ultimately gives "Knowing" half its competency. He has envisioned some pretty cool action sequences and found some way of pulling something resembling a theme out of this story that tries to make something original out of a premise inherently unoriginal. Without him, this film would be in the Nic Cage scrapheap along with "Next" and "Bangkok Dangerous."~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
"It Happened One Night" is a classic love story yet its best feature is that it surprises you: it's not chock-full of clichés (though not devoid of them either) and it has an enduring sense of humor that all generations can appreciate.The film stars two classic screen actors in Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert playing Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews, one a recently fired journalist and the other a runaway heiress who meet on a bus to New York. For Peter, this scoop could save his career and for Ellie, well, she needs all the help she can get to make it to New York alive. The two develop an unlikely relationship exchanging humorous jabs as they bus, hitchhike and hijack their way and of course while neither will be the first to admit it, there's no hiding their feelings for each other from the audience.Classic films tend to rely on the prowess of their marquee actors and Gable and Colbert are terrific together. Both are humorous and play a wide range of emotions. Gable is one of those stars that has that intangible "it" factor that just makes him seem so incredibly important in every scene. There is a strong tension between them the entire film that is funny at times and romantically intriguing at others.The writing, however, is what makes this a standout classic. The way Peter wiggles his and Ellie's way out of tight situation, namely those that would result in Ellie being found out, is genius. Robert Riskin does some of the best witty dialog and scenes. The best parts of the film are when Peter and Ellie are alone, either in their motel room or out in the forest. The tension between them is highest and it makes the dialog that much better. This is a film that you remember the scenes. Like a play they all carry their own weight and interest. What happens next is not as important as what is happening."It Happened One Night" only suffers from a cliché ending. The humor shifts from wit to just laughing at the film in general because you know the inevitable will happen and anything that tries to stay in the way at that point is just--pointless. Anyone who loves classic situational and near-farcical comedy will love "It Happened One Night" and with good reason. It's enjoyable for all generations but it's very true to the era, definitely an escapist depression-era film because it concerns itself with the wealthy and pokes fun at them. There's even a song though it's incorporated in a more drama-focused way, no theatricality.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Kung fu producer, director, writer and star Stephen Chow brings a stylized and exaggerated element to "Kung Fu Hustle" that undoubtedly reaches out to a Western audience. The film is an homage to decades of kung fu movie history but it embraces CGI and moves beyond traditional fight choreography.In the film a wannabe Chinese gangster played by Chow gets the slum where he lives in trouble with the notorious Axe Gang (think the "Kill Bill" Crazy 88s with hatchets) by posing as an Axe Gang member. To fend off the Axe Gang, several villagers from the slum turn out to be kung fu masters, even the fat landlady and her bumbling husband. The Axe Gang retaliates by hiring seasoned killers to take them out."Kung Fu Hustle" is comical and action heavy, often times even comically action-heavy. It isn't violent in the "Kill Bill" sense, but nearly in the cartoonish sense, with characters chasing each other and their legs gyrating like the Roadrunner. Chow brings that cheesy '70s kung- fu sense of humor and mixes it in with the special effects martial arts of today's era. There's as much slow motion fighting as you'll see in "The Matrix" trilogy.Chow is a good director, bringing a variety of skills as both an action and comedy director. He knows how to balance the two to amusing effect. He knows how to surprise us with comedic timing but also exactly what makes us think "ooh, cool." Instead of gore, he manages the effect of gruesome violence without showing it by great set up and then cutting away at the last second.Sometimes the style is too forced or the humor too cheesy, but this is a very unique action movie with silly characters from the kung fu tradition, not the glamorous look of films such as "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," and "Hero." This is one of those action movies with misfits, not serious heroes with something to prove.Though Chow has yet to follow up "Kung Fu Hustle," he might be talented enough to bridge the Western world with the art of the Chinese (not American) kung fu movie in a way that hasn't been done since Bruce Lee, praying on our love for stylish and glitzy action. With a better budget, the CGI could be done to better effect and even the stunts too.
Disney Animation has had some trouble getting its feet on the ground without the word Pixar next to it and "Meet the Robinsons" is the kind of animated film more content with shaking things up. While the film has some lovable elements and does come together toward the end, it mostly suffers from jumpy, unsupported storytelling that will most likely have children thinking "whoa?" instead of "wow."In "Meet the Robinsons," Lewis is a 12-year-old boy who was abandoned as an infant on the steps of an orphanage. Because of his knack for invention-making, Lewis can never find a family to adopt him, but all that changes when a stranger named Wilbur Robinson comes to him from the future, trying to protect him from a man in a bowler hat, and sweeps him off to the year 2037 where he meets the rest of the Robinson family, a barrage of strange and eccentric characters.When Lewis meets the Robinsons, the film gets a little crazy. The pacing is so fast and the objective of the film becomes unclear. While the writers use this lightspeed pace to throw in some humor that you have to listen very closely to catch, little gets truly established and you don't feel like you really get to...meet the Robinsons. Disney's decision to break the number one formula rule with animated features: getting a slew of well known voice talent, doesn't help. As much as getting big names to voice characters is a selling factor for a film, sometimes it helps hasten the process of connection audience to characters. Either way, no big names seems odd. We also know very little about the film's villain, the man in the bowler hat, and while his quirky nature has an appeal, his motives, for the first major part of the film at least, are unknown. Classic villains have strong sinister motives in Disney films, then their quirks come in, but "Robinsons" works the opposite way.That said, somehow this film manages to pull it all together in revealing some important details about the future that show it's not merely coincidence that Lewis is being helped by the Robinsons. The strongest part of the film is its creation of sympathy for Lewis, who desires parents and a family above all else, despite his incredible talents. As the film ends and these details are revealed and Lewis' fortunes change, it's easy to get suckered in to good old family themes and while not exactly mapped out well, they're very present in "Robinsons."
With just over a $4 M budget, you would think there's only so much that a sci-fi/fantasy film can accomplish, but "Night Watch" proves exception with its well-imagined and executed effects courtesy the creative mind of Timur Bekmambetov. The style of the film alone helps to cover up the weak structure of the script."Night Watch," based on the novel by Sergei Lukyanenko, is sort of an anthropomorphic imagining of good versus evil, where good/light and evil/darkness are manifested as special individuals called "Others" who have been at peace since a truce long ago that said all would be able to choose freely between good or evil. Naturally there needs to be means of enforcing this truce, so there's a Night Watch (good guys) and a Day Watch (bad guys) who make sure both sides play nice. This of course becomes a lot harder with a prophecy suggesting someone will come along and his/her choice will throw off the balance forever. It's really a classic sci-fi "secret supernatural beings living among humans fighting a war of sorts" premise.From the get-go, this movie is hard to follow. That concept gets presented fairly quickly and the script doesn't really give us any extra help in understanding who is what. It's hard to tell who is on what side and why and it hurts the film throughout whether its the lack of connection felt to the characters or that you're fighting just to get it the whole time that you have trouble appreciating much else.Also important to know is that this film is not action-oriented. Although there are fight scenes, these are hardly action sequences as a moviegoer exposed to Western action movies might define them. It's more of a thriller story with lots of special effects and creative editing to bring the secret world of good vs. evil to life.Bekmambetov is the key to making this movie work. He realizes that with the right editing techniques, anything low budget can still come across effectively. One early shot of the main character Anton taking out a vampire combines a little bit of special effects, illusion and make-up, but it is filmed in quick sequence that makes it all appear simultaneous like it is a CGI effect. It's creative thinking (and a few slow motion shots too).
If there is anyone that can do justice to Stephen Sondheim's sadistic musical on the silver screen, it is Tim Burton. "Sweeney Todd," the director's latest, is an all around marvel of a film and Burton's most award-worthy project in a long time."Sweeney" stars Burton favorite Johnny Depp as the vengeful demon barber and of course Burton's wife, Helena Bonham-Carter, accompanies him as the strangely romantic accomplice, Mrs. Lovett. All that needs to be said about the plot is that it is based on vengeance, there is little dialogue not done in musical verse and it is very, very dark, insanely so.Depp delivers as the crazed, murderous Barber with a performance that after about thirty seconds could make anyone forget he uses the same exact accent for Jack Sparrow. Even his singing voice reaches levels that provide a dark yet beautiful quality for his deeply disturbed character. Bonham-Carter is not the best singer, but she gives the role an eerily humorous quality that works nicely. All the supporting roles prove excellent including Alan Rickman as Todd's nemesis, Timothy Spall as Rickman's despicable assistant and even "Borat" star Sacha Baren Cohen proves his ability to impersonate another nationality in the role of an Italian rival barber.From beginning to end the direction is superb and with Tim Burton's stamps all over it. The art direction, cinematography and costumes are all incredible and add a quality to the musical that the stage simply cannot. The dark palette (which accentuates the blood that Burton is clearly a big fan of) with specific color choice in parts truly brings out the strange beauty that Sondheim's music brings to this chilling tale.If you don't have a sensitive gag reflex, "Sweeney Todd" is a worthy film for anyone with the maturity to sit down and appreciate the nuance and the beauty of very dark tragedy. It is definitely not a film to watch when you want to be highly entertained, but it is an incredible story that is in the best of hands if one is ready to view it.
Great films rarely craft their quality from the outside in, but that's exactly what happened with "The Magnificent Seven." It started with buying the rights to remaking Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" and continued with director John Sturges casting top actors who were already stars or right on the verge. From there, it squeezed into its destiny as the final hurrah for the classic Hollywood Western.The premise of "Magnificent Seven" is so simple that the first half of the movie teeters on total boredom. A tiny Mexican village is tired of being preyed upon by the bandit Calvera (Eli Wallach), so it approaches a well-known gun for hire, Chris (Yul Brynner), in order to purchase guns. Chris insists that hiring more gunslingers will be a cheaper move and more effective, even if it means a team of a few against a whole armed gang.One by one, Chris convinces seven guns to offer their services to defend the town. As men with nothing else to live for in need of money, they easily agree. The first is Vin (Steve McQueen), a cool cat who lives on the edge. In his first major film role, McQueen shows all the suave that made him a star in the '60s.The other five are Bernardo (Charles Bronson), a burly half-Mexican half-Irish loner, Britt (James Coburn), the skilled knifeman, Lee (Robert Vaughn) the professional past his prime, Harry (Brad Dexter) the money-obsessed gambler and Chico (Horst Buchholz), the proud and impetuous kid. It's Buchholz whom Sturges fixates on the most despite the many other stars at his disposal. A German pretty boy, it's a little strange with both he and Brynner starring in the film as Europeans trying to talk like authentic cowboys. It's easy enough to warm up to them both over time, but at first you really don't feel like there's anything authentically Mexican about the film even though it was filmed there.William Roberts, the writer lone credited writer who crafted the film's final draft, constructs the film almost entirely on one-liners and other whip-smart dialogue. Consequently, "Magnificent Seven" leaves a much better impression than the experience of the film itself. Watching the film is an average experience at best given the obvious trajectory of the film  Calvera's return and a final standoff  but somehow after we see "the end" title card, it gets that much better. It's a strange phenomenon, perhaps best explained by the aura created by the stars and the nature of the Western in general. Westerns are legends in the most basic story sense, so to have so many great legends of cinema on screen at once in a Western amplifies the effect.Sturges supplies some lasting images in the action scenes and frames his shots in a way that definitely evokes the classic John Ford Westerns, but a lot of it comes down to how he captures his stars. Nobody really gets dwarfed in this film, though it is noted according to people in and close to the film that they were all jockeying for the spotlight, especially McQueen.McQueen would go on to become an icon in this decade, but arguably the film's most valuable contribution to the genre was the spontaneously inspired casting of Wallach as Calvera. Wallach left his imprint on film history in Sergio Leone's "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly," but his casting as Tuco would never have happened without "Seven," and ultimately neither would his entire 60-year career as a character actor.The on-screen talent really helps you buy into the simplistic plot devices and character arcs for each of the seven. The actors pique your interest in the characters in a way the script never does. Who can really say how much of the credit the film's many clever lines belongs to the writers compared to the fame-craving actors? Truth is, no one really thinks about the writing when they think about "The Magnificent Seven."~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
"Hyde Park on Hudson" might forever be known as that other film in 2012 featuring a U.S. president  if anyone remembers it at all. Both films are entirely different portrayals, namely in the scope of both the stories they tell and the span of time in which they take place, but only one of them is giddy over being a period piece, and it's not "Lincoln."Taking in place in 1939 prior the U.S. committing to what would become World War II, "Hudson" is a film mostly content with being pretty, excited by putting actors in period clothes who pretend to be world leaders. None of these performances are bad, (quite the opposite in fact) but the little piece of history they're reenacting lacks any bit of import.Bill Murray as Franklin Roosevelt isn't even the center of the film. Instead it's our narrator, Daisy (Laura Linney), FDR's distant cousin, whose diary and memoirs Richard Nelson used to craft the screenplay. She relays a story of romance, but one that's modest and presumed, occurring up to and during the arrival of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth from England to Hyde Park on Hudson, home of FDR's mother and his home away from Washington.The film invests a lot in presenting FDR in such a casual manner, but this notion of candid access is hardly thrilling, either because the man has been dead for almost 70 years, or because it barely shows him in the context of being president  just a man who people treat with great respect and admiration who is surrounded by a lot of people all the time. Any American who studied the president in school knows about his polio and how he was able to keep the country oblivious to it with cooperation from the press, so that's hardly a hook either.Murray is certainly an unusual but inspired choice. Playing a light-hearted and relaxed FDR makes sense for him, though if tested it would be wrong to doubt his capability to command attention in the role. The film doesn't seem too interested in digging into his psyche, just peeling back the curtain enough to show a man who longed for the affections of women and whose outlook and world view was different from other people in positions of power during his time.Linney is such a wasted talent as the meek and naive Daisy. Although she narrates throughout, she disappears in stretches, even after the script establishes very clearly that this is her story. She doesn't factor into the conflict until late, and that's if you can consider it conflict. Normally, choosing not to embellish the details of an alleged affair in melodramatic Hollywood fashion would be worthy of much commendation, but the details of their relationship are so vague and the process by which Daisy comes to have feelings for FDR and vice-versa so ambiguous that you feel nothing toward either of them.The arrival of King George VI (Samuel West) and Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) in Hyde Park provides the film a pair of interesting characters and ultimately something to happen in what would otherwise be a purposeless portrait of a president and his sometimes-lover cousin. George has just assumed power after his brother abdicated the throne and they come to America desperate to forge a partnership between England and the U.S. Therein could be the conflict at the heart of "Hudson," but the film maintains its light and often jocular tone instead, despite a footnote suggesting the events depicted were crucial to the special relationship between the countries. In essence, much stock is put into the symbol of King George biting into a hot dog."Hyde Park on Hudson" is a pleasant film, but it presumes to be interesting on the basis that it depicts famous political figures and exposes a beloved president's unflattering personal life. Maybe that's an exaggerated assumption of the film's intent, but it doesn't tell a story of any kind as far as plot structure goes. It's a great advertisement for a film audiences would prefer to see about who FDR really was, but in and of itself, it fails to offer any acute insight.~Steven CThanks for reading!

I think there's actually a proverb somewhere that says "On one of three things a film contends for Oscars: Clint Eastwood directing, Morgan Freeman acting and a compelling historical figure as the lead role." The person who first uttered this saying would take one look at "Invictus" and say: "well that's not fair." But despite being predestined for Oscar glory, "Invictus" amounts to a simple feel-good sports and human interest story in the hands of exceptional talent.The main source of antagonism in "Invictus" is the fear and embittered attitudes of its characters: the people (both black and white) of post-Apartheid South Africa during the beginning of Nelson Mandela's presidency in the early '90s. That might be poetic, but it's not exactly the stuff that great drama and conflict is made of. The only suspense created is by the posing of two questions: Can South Africa can win the rugby world cup and can it begin mend and rebuild itself under Mandela's wise guidance? Interesting, but not exactly riveting stuff for a two-hour and 14-minute film.Still, Clint Eastwood directs the heck out of this only slightly compelling script by Anthony Peckham based on the John Carlin book. Eastwood turns the mild events of the film into microcosms of racial discord. He creates similar black and white imagery to echo these intentions too. Mandela's security staff are the best example. At first Mandela's black guards are furious they have to work with white men, but we watch them grow closer and Eastwood slides images of the guards traveling in cars by race at one point then showing them mixed toward the end. Subtle and effective, this milks the story for all it's worth.You also won't find an inspirational sports story that manages to avoid cliché better than "Invictus." Eastwood keeps the focus on the people and the symbolic meaning of rugby while still bringing us into the action. There aren't any banal last chances, miracle plays or excessive celebrations. Some of those techniques are used, but you won't roll your eyes at "Invictus" and you'll truly understand what the cup meant to South Africa.Freeman and Matt Damon as South Africa rugby captain Francois Pienaar are two other towering forces working to add depth and emotion to the film. After this fall's "The Informant!" Damon continues to impress with his versatility. The combination of tough-guy and emotional leader makes Pienaar a role that suits him very well. He continues to become one of the finest actors of his generation, even if this role is understated.Freeman gives us as much as he can muster in a script that drastically undercuts his complexity. Needless to say, however, the role is indeed perfect for him. He gives us hints of inner tensions and personal problems along with the colorful personality and pristinely delivered inspirational quotes. It's important to note this is not a biopic of Mandela, but a brief history of what times were like when he came into office and how he saw rugby as a way to erase the cycle of hate and unify his country.Although it starts to burden its audience with a lot of rugby footage toward the end, "Invictus" is an excellent feel-good movie. Where it falls short is in being constantly engaging and complex. Having a triumvirate of Oscar-caliber talents in this case is more an instance of putting forth the maximum effort to lift a pleasant story as high as possible. As producer, Eastwood saw a lot of likable stuff in this story and he made it better than anyone else would have. Palate-wise, "Invictus" is like glorified homemade cooking as opposed to the layers and intricacies of gourmet.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Welcome to the high-flying stock-trading world of "Wall Street" as seen through the eyes of Oliver Stone. The Oscar-winning "Platoon" director's Charlie Sheen follow-up is not so much an insider (please excuse the pun) look at the stock market, but the journey of a young stockbroker through the joys and perils of getting rich the dirty way-- and then ultimately the consequences.The protagonist is Bud Fox (Sheen) who dreams of being a big player in the market one day. He sparks that dream by bagging a rich investor named Gordon Gekko (Douglas), who is so impressed by Fox's persistence and advice that he takes him under his wing and makes him a ton of cash. Although Fox has to get over the slightly obvious illegal hump of sure-money investments, it's not long before he climbs his way to the top and he begins to think differently (and corruptly) about the world.This is a film about the delusion of wealth and the corruption it breeds, about how making money and staying true to certain convictions don't usually go hand and hand -- as Fox learns the hard way when he enlists Gekko's help to turn around his father's employer, an airline company (certainly amusing in a 21st century context)."Wall Street" boasts an iconic performance by Michael Douglas as Gekko. He really milks the part for what it is, getting to be sleazy, arrogant and spouting off advice like every word is gold. It's really the role that launched him into more serious roles. He certainly keeps the film's intensity up when all the stock jargon can really drag it down to the average viewer. Naturally, people who understand the market better will have more invested (yep, that's two) in "Wall Street" and like it better. Still, it tells a story that Americans need to hear as a reminder of arrogance of democracy and how if we're not careful, we can fall down the same slippery slopes. If nothing else, the age old idea of money not buying happiness is reinforced.
During parts of "Network," you have to wonder if it's a joke. The exploitation of a lunatic news anchor/prophet for financial gain with society just buying right in? Nuts. "Network" can definitely be viewed as an extreme and an unlikelihood, but that's not to negate its powerful message and frightening ideas about media, consumerism and society in general.Howard Beale, played by Peter Finch, the first posthumous Best Actor winner in Oscar history, (which adds an all-too-freaky layer to the film's effectiveness), is about to retire from reading the news after ratings have bombed and he's become disenchanted with the industry. On air, he promptly announces he will, in a week's time, blow his brains out on the 7 o'clock news. What first becomes a PR nightmare for Beale's station, UBS, evolves into a godsend when Beale goes on the air to apologize but delivers an impassioned speech rousing Americans out of their funk with his war cry: "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!"The dominoes begin to fall for various minds behind the network as a result of Beale's sudden fame. The first is Diana (Faye Dunaway), a tough-as-nails producer from the programming side who crosses over into news with ideas of sensationalizing it. She creates "The Howard Beale Show" to capitalize on the media spotlight on Beale and seizes success on his coattails. Dunaway creates in many ways a terrifying portrait of a woman who seems part robot in that she's only emotional when it comes to her singular purpose of making high-rating television. Her love affair with William Holden's middle-aged Max Schumacher, a casualty of the network's new direction, serves as allegory for old and new generations of media. Not exactly a believable relationship, but a fitting metaphor. A famous actor from Hollywood's golden years, Holden fits in his role perfectly. He paints Max as a pitiable lost soul.Other personalities include Robert Duvall as Frank, the in-between for UBS and the media company that owns them and Ned Beatty as Jensen, the man upstairs. Interestingly, "Network" has nothing to do with the journalism side of a newsroom but the business side. Paddy Chayefsky's powerful script at its most fundamental level shows the dark side of the media, the business side, the side with a flagrant disregard for the ideals of journalism.With a lot of dialogue, "Network" could not have been in better hands than those of Sidney Lumet. Lumet gets the most from his actors and adds an extra power to the many speeches throughout the film. Beatrice Straight barely appears in the film yet steals a scene in the middle. She plays Max's wife, who goes off on him when he says he loves Diana. It's a riveting scene with brilliant writing, but does Straight win Best Supporting Actress without the help of Lumet? "Network" contains a great deal of screaming and shouting yet little of it comes across as "noise" because he handles it so delicately.The ensemble really carries "Network" on its bizarre ride. The likelihood of a news anchor going on TV and successfully convincing Americans to open their windows and shout that they're "mad as hell" seems implausible, but the media has changed so much since 1976, more so than the changes the film depicts from the "good old years" of broadcast news up until that point. News anchors were the final word back then, but with the Internet, news and information can be found by the consumer. A sequel or maybe more like a follow-up to this film could be even more harrowing.Chayefsky's knock-out script suffers a tad from pacing, but few films are so packed with ideas worthy of day-long discussions on end. There's so much to think about between the various relationships between the characters and what's at stake for each of them and how blown out of proportion everything is. One of the many scenes that puts it all in perspective is during contract negotiations for a show Diana has put together that would follow a Communist liberation group on its terrorist escapades. There's a huge argument between members of the group amidst the network employees and so the leader fires his gun to get them back on task to talk about subsidiary rights. It shows how ridiculous the whole show has become as everyone wants a piece."Network" serves as a cautionary tale on numerous levels. It starts as simple as news programming and grows as large as big business' control on the world and its governments. Lying beneath the surface for all of it, however, lurks what can happen when personal interests guide important decision-making as it effects what the general public will see. Major media does not have as much control on what the public sees and hears as it used to because there are more outlets for obtaining the news, but the economic troubles of news media in our time has not made it any less dependent on selfish corporate interest.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
In a post-"Avengers" comic book movie universe, bigger is not only better, but also necessary. Leave it to original "X-Men" and "X2" director Bryan Singer to get the whole gang together (old and new) in order to bring one of the biggest "X-Men" story lines to the big screen in attention-grabbing fashion. "X-Men: Days of Future Past" finally establishes an "X- Men" universe for 20th Century Fox in the same way "The Avengers" galvanized Marvel Studios' cinematic universe.Uniting the cast of "X-Men: First Class" with those of the original trilogy, "Days of Future Past" takes us into the not-too-distant future with mutant-kind on the brink of extinction at the hands of Sentinels, mutant-hunting machines that adapt to the mutants they are fighting. A band of mutants including Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Bishop (Omar Sy), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) and others has harnessed the ability to travel through time by sending someone's consciousness to a younger version of themselves. When they meet up with Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Ian McKellen) and others, they determine that using this ability to prevent the events that led to the creation of the Sentinels is their only hope, and only Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) could withstand traveling that far back in time. In the '70s at the close of the Vietnam War, Wolverine seeks out a troubled Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) living with Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult). Together they must find Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), who has plans to kill the creator of the Sentinels, Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), which is the very act that catalyzes the Sentinels' creation. To do so, they must team up with Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and stop her.Lots of characters to keep track of, but anyone who has kept up with the franchise will have little trouble making sense of it all, plus it is very cool to see all these mutants in the same film. Whereas "X-Men: The Last Stand" overdosed on all these mutants, "Days of Future Past" handles it much better. Writer Simon Kinberg (who learned from the flaws of that film, which he co-wrote) divides the action into two categories: the desolate future when mutants fight for their lives, and the past, with that entire plot line focused on finding Mystique and rewriting history.The characters involved in the past are far less numerous than the characters in the future scenes, which is the secret to success for "Days of Future Past." Rather than let numbers of mutants muddle the quality of the ones that matter most, they are used in small bursts to add to the magnitude and excitement of the film. The core of the story involves young Xavier, Magneto, Wolverine, Beast and Mystique. That's it. As such, the themes that made "First Class" such a success are here again. Xavier and Magneto's ideologies collide in the face of this greater enemy, with Mystique caught in the middle. Xavier must wrestle with his demons and Wolverine must take on the role of team leader rather than marching to the beat of his own drum like usual. Singer's return to the director's chair proves essential in so far as getting dozens of actors to play along and gluing what were many disparate "X-Men" movie components into one entry that really sets the course for the franchise going forward. The action is great, including both the gritty Sentinel fights and the more creative set pieces including a sequence in which a young Quicksilver (Evan Peters) speedily saves his fellow mutants from certain death while listening to Jim Croce's "Time in a Bottle," but this is a movie that dazzles more in scope than in spectacle. Given the sheer scale of this effort, "Days of Future Past" doesn't look as good on a microscopic level. Unifying the entire "X-Men" franchise necessitates leaving behind plenty of inconsistencies with the other films, not to mention the time travel plot has its own holes (a fault of time travel films in general, to be fair). So the movie relies a lot on the mutant dazzle effect in addition to a plot that creates dire and immediate consequences for the "X-Men" universe we've come to know in the last 15 years.Fox course-corrected the "X-Men" brand with "First Class," but now they've bridged the gap between this new direction and the old movies (not to mention the Wolverine spin-offs). In 2011, we thought the franchise had essentially undergone a reboot; now, we see it all as one in the same, and the "X-Men" universe can expand even more with the right guidance (preferably Singer's). The fact that "Days of Future Past" works well as its own film while also serving a far greater role for the entire franchise is a feat that can't be understated, especially from Fox, which has struggled with its consistency in comic book films. It won't unanimously be labeled the best of the five "X-Men" movies, but it will unquestionably be brought up in that conversation for fans of the genre. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

Most moviegoers probably didn't realize Thor was a comic book character in the Marvel universe before his big-screen debut in 2011. Flash forward just two and a half years later and Chris Hemsworth has portrayed the Norse god of thunder three times already. "Thor: The Dark World" looks to continue riding the post-"Avengers" wave, but Avengers cameos and S.H.I.E.L.D references aside, it's not what most audiences have come to know as a superhero movie.This won't matter for the target audience of "Thor: The Dark World." I count myself among the many who get giddy over mentions of realms, Dark Elves and powerful Aether. These, however, are the hallmarks of sci fi/fantasy. So, let the record state that "The Dark World" falls most definitively in that category, because if that doesn't excite you, "The Dark World" most likely won't.Marvel Studios hasn't misfired since "Iron Man 2," which  all superhero films ever considered  wasn't that much of a misfire. Thor's second solo outing more or less measures similarly to Iron Man's. The movie just doesn't have much going for it besides its geek-tastic charms, a charismatic leading man and one of the most complex and lovable villains in Loki (Tom Hiddleston).Anything that opens with a scene explaining a battle that happened long ago in which a villain and an evil power were thought to be sealed away forever better be "The Fellowship of the Ring," otherwise it belongs in a video game. Unfortunately, that's the sour note "The Dark World" begins on, explaining how Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim tried to use a powerful dark matter called Aether to cast the nine realms in darkness exactly 5,000 years ago, the last time all nine realms aligned. Of course, such things happen every 5,000 years, and when Thor's love, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), happens upon the Aether, Malekith awakens to take his vengeance."Thor: The Dark World" shares a lot of characteristics with "Star Trek," jumping between realms as "Star Trek" does planets, introducing new species with cool spaceships and cooler weapons. Asgard comes to life with the same aesthetic that original "Thor" director Kenneth Branagh and the Marvel Studios creative team dreamed up a few years ago, but "Dark World" director Alan Taylor ("Game of Thrones") gets to play around in it. The film is almost unapologetic in the way it splashes around in sci-fi/fantasy hallmarks, and Taylor's fight sequences are a significant improvement from the first "Thor" in terms of style.Taylor was also a decent pick in terms of familial tensions in fantasy. The Thor-Loki dynamic was a highlight in the first film, and given that Loki caused all the mischief in "The Avengers," it's twice as interesting watching Hiddleston and Hemsworth together. Hiddleston in particular continues to step even deeper into the role in this film, though Loki is mostly relegated to a subplot except for the film's most exciting sequence, when Thor and the Warriors Three enlist his help to try and trick Malekith. The script takes full advantage of his trickster powers, but also creates an intriguing character arc for him. It's hard to say if it's the writing and Hiddleston that make Loki a huge highlight of "The Dark World," or the notion of his subplot also serving as a continuation of what happened in "The Avengers" and a precursor to what will come in "The Avengers: Age of Ultron." Either way, "The Dark World" has significantly more of a post-"Avengers" component than "Iron Man 3" did. The script also shares the same sense of humor that gave the first "Thor" its charm. Hemsworth is such a presence that when he gets to deliver a subtle a joke it has an ironic twist to it that works every time. The humor revolving around the human characters, however, such as Kat Dennings (who needs to not appear in these films ever again  she isn't going to be the deciding factor for teenage girls thinking of buying tickets), tends to be corny. Predictably, Portman is a wasted talent yet again as Foster is further reduced to a damsel in distress fawning over Thor despite his tendency to run off to other realms and leave her for extended periods of time.Given Marvel Studios' pedigree, it's fair to call "Thor: The Dark World" underwhelming. Plenty to look at, laugh at and geek out over, but a film that will ultimately be seen as a gap-filler between two epic "Avengers" films. That's okay for Thor, because you don't necessarily have to give grounding to a fantastical character from such a strange universe, but some effort to make the film a bit suspenseful and prove a trial for the main characters might've helped stave off our wild anticipation for May 2015.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Every comic-book fan has a fantasy lodged in the back of his or her head about what it would be like to be a superhero. "Kick-Ass" is the story of said average person and plays out that fantasy scenario under the most realistic conditions possible. How would being a superhero actually work in modern day? Perhaps "Kick-Ass" creator Mark Millar went overboard on the geek daydream by fusing as closely as possible both the world of classic comic fantasy and contemporary realism, but fans who hold the genre dear will convert easily to his wavelength and consequently will enjoy "Kick-Ass" far more than anyone else. The movie plays as both ode to and satire of the genre it holds dear, which is by far its greatest attribute. Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) stars as a socially invisible high schooler who, as he begins the journey of manufacturing himself as the superhero Kick-Ass, draws numerous voice-over comparisons between himself and Peter Parker including the classic line "without great power comes no responsibility." He has a voice that puberty clearly left behind and he's insecure enough that he plays along with his crush thinking he's gay. His hesitation toward fighting crime reminds us exactly why no sane person would try this in our world.Staying true to genre convention, even the "powerless" Kick-Ass has an origin story. After donning a green wetsuit and setting up a My Space page, he decides to stop a car theft and ends up stabbed and plowed into by a car. Left with numb nerve endings and metal plates throughout his body which he appropriately comments reminds him of the adamantium inside Wolverine of the X-Men, he survives his next crime intervention and in the process becomes a YouTube phenomenon. The attention brings other superheroes out of the woodwork and their crusading generally involves killing people that work for crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), who has had enough with the masquerading and wants Kick-Ass among others dead.Charged with bringing this superhero film for superhero-lovers to life, director Matthew Vaughn ("Layer Cake," "Stardust") plays with a myriad of techniques to create a genuine comic feel. He imagines the film in segments -- each done with one particular technique or effect and given a mood through a choice in music from video game beats to Ennio Morricone Western themes. One sequence has the 11-year-old girl assassin "Hit Girl" (Chloe Moretz) taking baddies down in slow motion, the other more quickly with a coyer camera. Instead of abusing one technique, Vaughn strives for each to stand out on its own.He also determines when he wants you to take "Kick-Ass" seriously and when he doesn't. As part spoof on the genre, he uses some clichéd techniques, but then to reflect Millar's choice to take the story down a darker more serious path, he'll make a choice that impresses you and makes you realize the writing goes above and beyond where the plot of most spoofs go.The subplot of heavy-artillery daddy-daughter combo Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl is a unique but essentially classic revenge story and the relationship between crime boss Frank and his son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who wants to look up to him creates an unexpected twist on another familiar dynamic. In other words, "Kick-Ass" is original storytelling rooted in classic comic traditions and archetypes.Part of bringing superhero realism to "Kick-Ass" also requires honest levels of violence, sexual references and foul language. R-rated film veterans will not be fazed by the level of violence and not deem it gratuitous. And even though much of it is carried out by a foul- mouthed child, Moretz carries an incredible amount of maturity in a performance that more or less steals the film."Kick-Ass" strives to give comic book and superhero fans something they can identify with. Pop culture references abound in this movie and rather than annoy, they help bring "Kick- Ass" to eye level with the fan base, as if to say "we understand why you love these stories because we do too." Those who don't feel that way about the genre will still find things to like about "Kick-Ass," but will see it at face entertainment value, not as an homage to Hollywood's most powerful storytelling form in the last decade.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
I like the thinking behind Richard Curtis' concept for "Love Actually." Why tell one Christmas love story when you can tell eight? Everyone loves Christmas, everyone loves love, and if you can tell eight stories that are all related but about something different, you're bound to have everyone who sees the film relate to at least one of the story lines. It sounds sort of gimmicky when put in those terms, but with good writing and some great actors, "Love Actually" works and is surprisingly enjoyable despite a high cheese factor."Love Actually" is sort of the ultimate British-American romantic comedy. When you put Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney, Colin Firth, Rowan Atkinson, Billy Bob Thorton (and then some) all in the same billing, it's ridiculously impressive. You almost can't fail. I mean, at one point there is a scene featuring a sort of negotiation between Grant, the prime minister of the U.K. and Thorton, the president of the U.S. If the demographic for this film isn't overstated with Christmas and romance already, that certainly ices the cake.The story lines are for the most part all good, but with eight of them, they all don't have to be. You pick the ones that you like and you stomach the ones you don't as much because you know they won't last long enough to bore or annoy you. Some people will like the more comedic ones like Bill Nighy as a recording artist trying to re-ignite his career with a hit Christmas single and some will like the more straight up romance like when Firth, an author, tries to communicate his feelings for a Portuguese woman who doesn't speak English. Fortunately, it's not disjointed either, so you don't feel you're watching several different films. Christmas time helps set that tone, but in general the mood the film is consistent in all the story lines.Like most romantic comedies, there's always a cheese factor, but the better ones make you forgive the cheese. For the most part, "Love Actually"'s cheese is very forgivable. Towards the end it gets a little out of hand, but you are so immersed in the story lines that you let it go. The humor of the film is also so strong that it also earns your appreciation regardless of how much you like romance.As far as film concepts that seem like romantic comedy sell-outs are concerned, "Love Actually" is probably one of the best. It's diverse but cohesive and funny to all senses of humor. It has a killer cast and of course good heart and strong themes. So as much as you might think you're watching just another romantic comedy about Christmas, "Love Actually" at least convinces you that for the time you're wrong.
25 years after directed the greatest courtroom drama ever made in "12 Angry Men," acclaimed director Sidney Lumet returns with "The Verdict." Starring Paul Newman in a performance best described as straight from the core, the film flips the idea of justice on its head and reveals the enduring human spirit that lies within the tireless pursuit of it.Frank Galvin (Newman) is a lawyer and alcoholic resigned to checking the obituaries for possible cases and dropping his card off at wakes. When a colleague hands him a medical malpractice case that's a shoo-in for a lucrative settlement outside of court, Galvin decides that there's a good chance to win the case before a jury and decides to take on the hospital's crack legal team (led by James Mason) without his client's permission in attempt to seek true justice and resurrect his career.Lumet's film is the opposite of melodramatic, something to which a courtroom movie is quite susceptible. There's barely a single bit of scoring and the characters express intense emotions with a respectable amount of reservation. One might think this undermines the impact of the David Mamet's thought-provoking script, but in an unexpected way it really grounds the film. It's not an emotional crusade against injustice or your typical underdog story. Instead, it's about the harsh realities of the justice system despite our every effort to believe in a higher moral authority by which all men and women are bound, one that will right all wrongs.Newman's Oscar-nominated performance owes a lot to Lumet, the master of wide shots, long takes and careful zooms and pans. Without a heightened sense of drama and suspense from the camera-work, Newman would be hung out to dry. So much of his acting is occurring below the skin and inside the mind that only a top-notch director could show the audience inside of it. The single take starting with a wide courtroom shot during Frank's closing statement and ending with him sitting down as if there was nothing else he could do might be the best example of Lumet and Newman working in incredible harmony.Lumet gets that caliber of performance out of everyone from co-star Charlotte Rampling to James Mason's unbreakable defense attorney. It says so much more about a film when it's as effective without dialogue as it is with it. The quiet opening shot of Frank with a beer and cigarette playing his favorite pub pinball machine sets the tone right away that the audience is to infer mostly from this film. It's a bit more work than usual, but "The Verdict" is a rare version of the timeless story about going on when the odds are stacked against you.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
No matter which way you shake it, "Shrek Forever After" amounts to nothing more than a way to capitalize on a profitable franchise for a fourth time. Many fans will see this as proper closure to the franchise, but that's the closure *they* need, not that the films needed. "Forever After" feels much more like a side venture than a full-circle exclamation point for the 21st Century's most beloved animated character.This grand finale follows the classic "see what your life would be like if nothing ever happened" plot of "A Christmas Carol" and "It's a Wonderful Life." Shrek (Mike Myers) is a daddy ogre now whose life has become repetitive and devoid of personal free time. When he finally bursts, a crafty Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), the notorious deal-maker of fairy tale lore, strikes up a contract that in exchange for one day of Shrek's life, Shrek can have a day of being a regular ogre again. Shrek signs and suddenly "Far, Far Away" is turned upside down and Rumpelstiltskin has become the ruler.The "don't know what you've got 'til it's gone" theme gets exhausted early because we've seen this several times before. We realize that although Shrek enjoys part of his "free day," he's going to regret his decision and want his old life back and plead with his friends Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) and wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) to remember. The only plus to this story line is that it changes up these characters we know and love just enough to make the fresh again in our minds. Fat kitty Puss in Boots, for one, is quite entertaining. Yet the film never shakes us of the feeling that all this is happening just for the sake of having another "Shrek" adventure.Of all the new additions, necessary or not, Rumpelstiltskin is by far the best. Voice actor/writer Walt Dohrn shines in this elevated spotlight. He strikes up the right blend between bad guy we can pity and wacko villain and he's animated in a way that follows suit. Unfortunately, his character mutates from crafty magical underling to eccentric Napoleonic dictator once Shrek signs the contract and he becomes like most other animated despots.The other characters are up to the same tricks that DreamWorks Animation knows worked before and that we're apt to fall for again. Most everyone has at least one funny moment here or there, but "Shrek Forever After" is much less hysterical on the whole than previous installments.More significantly absent, however, is the sense of adventure and camaraderie. Previous films took us on actual journeys with these characters and showed us the ups and downs along the way, especially between Donkey and Shrek. In this film, Shrek attempts to make good with all his friends even though they don't know who he is. He's very much on his own and we don't feel all that bad for him because we all knew signing the contract was a bad idea. Certainly this lesson should be heard by children, but adults have learned it already and "Forever After" doesn't put a new spin on it.There's no shame in revisiting old friends in the form of familiar and lovable characters, but "Shrek Forever After" offers little more than those comforts. A handful of good jokes hit and some things surprise such as Rumpelstiltskin, but if this truly is the end of Shrek, I don't think any of us, fans or not, will have trouble living happily ever after.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
How is it possible that one man could be behind so many of the decade's best comedies? It seemed like Judd Apatow hit his peak with 2005's "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," a film that sky- rocketed both his and actor Steve Carrell's career. But the successes did not come without failures. While last year's "Knocked Up" and "Superbad" continued to redefine comedy, there was also "Walk Hard" and "Drillbit Taylor," films that led audiences to believe he was getting stale.But fear not, "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" not only eliminates that trend, it might very well have established an era of comedy in movie history with Judd Apatow as the reigning emperor."Sarah Marshall" is hysterical, gutsy, clever, sweet and real. It hits on all the things that make Apatow comedy successful while conquering new comedic territory. While it's easiest to give Apatow all the credit, however, Jason Segel deserves his encore. The "How I Met Your Mother" star has a terrifically written script that is powdered and pampered by Apatow's connections (the ability to put Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill in as small, very funny parts).What Segel has tapped into about comedy through his writing is that there is no reason to be afraid of what is real. What's real is what is funny and then when you throw in some ridiculous twists through strange or unusually funny characters, you have a great, easily likable comedy. While previous Apatow films push in that direction, "Sarah Marshall" seems to hit it the most directly, especially in a film where the plot is essentially about a guy getting over a girl.In addition to a terrific script, "Sarah Marshall" has a wealth of unique, humorous characters and young, sure to bloom after this film, talent. While lead actresses Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis have a solid amount of credits, the exposure from this film might very well shape their careers in the future. Bottom line, there is so much talent and humor here that when you try and recall all the best characters with the best lines, you find yourself forgetting some.While Judd Apatow will most likely find a share of failures, the amount of great comedies will continue to emerge and the money will likely keep rolling in. Only horrendous reviews could stop someone from going to see something with his name attached to it. This film forecasts a great 2008 for Apatow Productions or at the very least making a profit on "Step Brothers" and "Pineapple Express"
Of the many things that "Wedding Crashers" does really well as a comedy, the one that makes it the most special is that it dared to be rated R and outside the typical comfort zone for a "love and sex" comedy not merely by just flashing body parts. The content in this film is something anyone with a mature and open mind can laugh at, it was simply never thought to be included in films until now because it might "cross the boundaries." But when you aim for an R rating, I say have fun with it and "Wedding Crashers" does just that.Jeremy Grey (Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Wilson), who have incredible duo chemistry in this film, are self-proclaimed "wedding crashers" as in they take advantage of the long guest list for weddings by pretending to be way extended family members so they can get free food and take advantage of love-hungry bachelorettes. All that changes at the Cleary family wedding when John falls for Claire, played by the gorgeous Rachel McAdams, who gives a performance as easy to watch as fish in a tank. John convinces Jeremy to go to the Cleary's summer home so he can continue to court her despite the fact that she has a jerk boyfriend (Bradley Cooper). Vaughn gives his best performance as Jeremy, the protagonist to whom all terrible/hilarious things happen as a result of going to the Cleary's. Claire's sister hits on him and she proves to be a clingy, sex-crazed maniac, Claire's brother takes a look the wrong way and thinks Jeremy's gay and Claire's boyfriend loves to take Jeremy out anyway he can. I'd go into detail to explain how the boundaries get pushed, but that would spoil it. Vaughn also develops his signature "rant" humor in this film which is hysterical. Wilson is great in tandem with Vaughn, though his individual performance is not much different than usual. He's sort of the bridge between the comedic Vaughn and the romantic McAdams, doing both rather well. Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour as Mr. and Mrs. Cleary followed by a great cameo at the end help pad the tremendous cast.McAdams as the infallibly believable Claire really makes this film go from a comedy to a date film and elicit an emotional response from the viewer. Most based-on-sex/romance comedies that lean heavily on the comedy don't really extend that well into the other areas, but McAdams makes that happens as Claire. She's a great call by the casting directors. Aside from a couple scenes and one significant one, it never gets into cheesy territory for too long. It's mostly a fun, boundary-pushing, extremely quotable comedy with appeal for couples, not just guys.
As demonstrated by his ability to earn acclaim in everything from zombie films ("28 Days Later") to foreign coming-of-age love stories ("Slumdog Millionaire"), Danny Boyle has an extraordinary gift as a filmmaker and in "127 Hours," he channels it into an extraordinary story of human willpower. This could have easily been a compelling but plain and ordinary documentary on the Discovery Channel or National Geographic about a man pinned under a boulder who miraculously survives. Boyle, however, transforms it into a powerful statement about the will to live and where that motivation truly comes from."127 Hours" does not simply prove the point that humans will do whatever it takes to survive in dire circumstances. In fact, I might argue 9 of 10 people wouldn't do what Aron Ralston (James Franco) does in this film. Anyway, Boyle makes it his mission to use Ralston's incredible true story -- one that told at face value would probably just elicit gasps -- to alter our perspective on living. What's obvious is that none of the impact of "127 Hours" is possible without Franco. A film about a man trapped in a crevice for more than five days needs a heck of a lead actor and Franco, despite few dramatic credits to this point, proves beyond capable. Although boredom might set in for some during this film given its plot, the believability of Franco's performance remains constant and irrefutable. He possesses the fun-loving and care-free charisma of Ralston then slowly breaks that shell and shows his human fragility.Yet remarkably, Boyle leaves a substantial thumbprint on the film, much of which he shares with co-writer Simon Beaufoy, also of "Slumdog." Because the story is so straightforward, Boyle recognizes imagery and perception provide his only means of creativity. He shows us inside the tube of Ralston's water backpack, water bottle and other close-ups, all of which seem unnecessary, but they establish images which we will come to think about with a different perspective as the film wears on, such as when Aron drinks his own settled urine out of the water pouch. Boyle uses the same process shot, but suddenly we don't see it the way we did earlier and they become more meaningful than tedious.This subtly effective technique can also be found in the beginning and ending shots of the film. It seems completely random that Boyle would open with crowded streets of people as if he's tricked us and really made "Slumdog 2," but the image gains significance after experiencing Ralston's journey."127 Hours" will not be kind to people who don't take lightly to seeing blood outside of the "shoot 'em up" genre. Many of these people will leave the film thinking all they got was shock value, but of course there's much more to it. Despite the "how will he survive?" plot, a substantial amount of time is placed on flashes to memories Aron thinks of regarding his family, fantasies and of course, regrets. Boyle beautifully shows us that although survival seems an inherently selfish thing, much of that motivation and will to live comes from other people, even total strangers. Aron thinks a lot of the girls (Kata Mara and Amber Tamblyn) he hiked with just hours before the accident though otherwise he'd have likely forgotten them.The build-up and catharsis of Aron's story might not be the most powerful and uplifting based-on-true-story you've witnessed, but "127 Hours" clearly surpasses expectation in terms of the message it sends and the impact it leaves. With it, Boyle solidifies his place as one of those filmmakers you must always have an eye on and Franco emerges as a relatable everyman with above-everyman-grade talent.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Two teenage "dudes" living in California in the 80s go back in time to avoid flunking history: that's the kind of plot that may not make for a great movie, but will certainly charm you. Bill and Ted are total metal head idiots and when placed in the scholarly context of history, this blatant contradiction is at the least amusing. "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" sort of makes short order of its time travel concept, moving so quickly that the premise never has time to fully cook and so neither do the characters, but the fast-paced teenage mischief humor works in its own way for this movie to be enjoyable.When Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are on the verge of failing history, we learn that if Ted fails, he flunks out of school and his father will ship him to military school. As a result, he and Bill won't be able to pursue their dreams of forming their own metal band called Wild Stallyns. That's when they get a visit from Rufus (George Carlin) of the future, where apparently Bill and Ted are worshipped. Since the future depends on Bill and Ted staying together, Rufus provides them a time-traveling phone booth to complete their report.The boys travel quickly through time, treating everyone from the ancient Greeks to the medieval Englishmen like 80s surfer dudes. While they're not met with open arms wherever they go exactly, no one seems to notice their 80s duds and poor English. The historical figures that they capture don't exactly seem too alarmed that they're being jammed in a phone booth either. "Bill and Ted" prides itself on everybody being stupid, I guess, but with that in mind one begins to appreciate the shenanigans for the absurdity they are. I mean, Napoleon going bowling and cursing in French, followed by getting kicked out by some middle-aged white dude, is funny in its own way.Bill and Ted aren't totally lovable characters, but their naivety makes it hard to dislike them for their dumb behavior. Neither is a particularly good actor (even though that didn't seem to stop Keanu Reeves from finding future work) and their 80s lingo and jokes are pretty hit or miss with the more subtle, intelligent jokes that you have to listen for to pick up on registering the highest marks. The other good parts of the film come toward the end with how the historical figures react to the 80s."Bill and Ted" is a good movie for tweens and those who have some sort of nostalgic connection to the 80s, everyone else will find it amusing and likable comedic material, but nothing much beyond that considering it doesn't make much of an effort to do so. Slackers are as slackers do.
Darren Aronofsky's "Black Swan" will leave a myriad of lasting impressions on different people for different reasons, but universally, the film will prove to the masses that ballet is most definitely not boring. Beautiful, thrilling, breathtaking -- yes, I'm referring to both the art form and the film. "Black Swan" echoes everything there is to love about both art forms: the passion, the elegance, the drive to create something deep and moving. Aronofsky's film is every bit as graceful as the art form and culture it seeks to capture, but more noticeably, every bit as challenging and dark and uncomfortable.Although Aronofsky's name has the reputation attached because of his visceral, deeply emotional and borderline distressful filmmaking style ("The Wrestler," "Requiem for a Dream"), the spotlight belongs on star Natalie Portman as the film's first image so appropriately conveys. "Black Swan" is her story, a partial allegory for the ballet she's working on ("Swan Lake"), but more so a piercing journey into the mind of a sheltered and innocent young woman whose quest for perfection plunges her into a psychologically state that she cannot comprehend.Portman plays Nina Sayers, a ballerina in New York's finest company whose dedication to her craft is never compromised (need I point out her name rhymes with ballerina?). Her success is partly thanks to her mother (Barbara Hershey), whom she still lives with and who literally mothers her to a ridiculous extent, but has kept her focused and out of trouble. Hershey plays the part carefully, not lapsing into clichéd overprotective mother territory too much, with a bit of help from the script not overdoing it as well.Nina's dedication and innocence have finally appealed to her instructor/the company's artistic director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), who casts her as the coveted role of Swan Queen, which combines both parts of White Swan and Black Swan to make an artistic point about duality (and the film more interesting). Thomas tells Nina she's the quintessential White Swan, the innocent, picturesque dancer, but that she possesses no qualities of the seductive and fluid Black Swan. He believes in her, however, and is attracted (somewhat inappropriately) to her, so while he's given her the part, she still has to "earn" it.Nina's quest to become the Black Swan, to divorce herself from the sheltered lifestyle that has wound her so tightly so she can convincingly do the Black Swan dance, is the center of the drama. This is accompanied by a mysterious "transformation" she appears to be undergoing into an actual swan along with times when she's on the subway or other places and she sees herself. The suspenseful elements grow from subtle tension to full-blown horror as the film goes on and the pressure mounts for Nina to succeed. At times the "scares" feel extreme, but the horror complements the poise and elegance of the ballet nicely. In fact the two work harmoniously at times, especially thanks to Clint Mansell's Tchaikovsky-twisting score.Seeing as Aronofsky enjoys seizing the opportunity to make his audience uncomfortable, the horror should come as no surprise and neither should the pervasive sexuality of the film. Nina must learn to feel not think, to be seductive in her movement, and so the sexual ties to that are inherent (and arguably forced in at times). When Mila Kunis enters the picture as Lily, a fellow dancer who embodies the Black Swan characteristics Nina so desperately wants (she does drugs, sleeps around, eats cheeseburgers), a thick layer of sexuality drops onto the story. Overall, there's quite a bit of female sexuality, which despite how far movies have come, still has a taboo on it more so than male sexuality, so it does distract from its point at time. By and large, however, Aronofsky keeps these scenes pertinent and meaningful.In the perspective of the entire film, however, sexual tension marks just one of numerous tensions that Aronofsky constantly weaves under the plot. Every scene has layers of text and subtext to make the scenes that don't have a fantastical element to them equally gripping. Aronofsky and Portman are the real dance partners here, working together to make what's beneath the surface an equal player in the viewing experience as well as to reflect -- quite literally with all the mirrors -- the levels of turmoil in Nina's mind.Portman's performance ranks heads and tails above all her previous work. The overprotected child who is rigid and naive could be seen as an archetype, but Portman convinces us of Nina's reality by taking all these attributes to her core. Her emotions, like her in-tears excitement over getting the part of Swan Queen when she calls to tell her mom, are so convincing. We identify with her mixed feeling of excitement, fear and doubt among others and her performance communicates all those emotions stewing together inside her. Considering that "Black Swan" seriously features her performance if not hinges on it, her success cannot be overstated.Nina's pursuit of perfection, to embody both sides of the coin instead of being the best at one side, will relate to everyone who has ever dared to be really good at anything challenging. The circumstances and results of Nina's particular story are stretched for dramatic effect, but Portman's performance remains so convincing throughout and Aronofsky's direction every bit as masterfully artistic that "Black Swan" deserves some of the highest of the praise that will go around in 2010. The film achieves the rare poetic synergy between the music, ballet, acting and direction that leaves you thinking a lot about what you just saw. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
In the closest we'll ever get to an Austrian-American playing James Bond, Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as special agent Harry Tasker in "True Lies," a spy thriller with towering feats of action  and a few issues back home.James Cameron adapted the film from a little-known French movie three years its senior called "La Totale!" Essentially, the film imagines what a top-secret spy's domestic life would be like. Harry Tasker loves his wife, Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), but he lies through his teeth to her all the time; kind of hard to avoid when some days you're trying to make it home from Switzerland in time for dinner."True Lies" opens in pure James Bond fashion. Harry swims his way into a well-guarded estate where a party is being held, rips off his wetsuit to reveal a tuxedo and walks in to the mansion where he pretends to know everyone and then steals some key files related to potential Middle East terrorists. His escape involves explosions, a chase down a mountainside with bad guys on snowmobiles and skis and a license to kill. Schwarzenegger manages to exude some suave here and continues to prove why he was simply born an action hero.Tasker works for Omega Sector, self-touted as the "last line of defense." They're basically the CIA. Tasker works closely with Albert (Tom Arnold), kind of his intel guy and a dry-humored pessimist. They're hardly the best duo of the '80s/'90s, but they're different. Together, they go after terrorists.The film has a distinct three-act structure. The first introduces spy Harry and Omega Sector and develops the terrorist plot. The second starts when Harry tries to make up for never being home and discovers that his wife is meeting some kind of mystery man, which spins into something absurd. That "diversion" really kills the film by making it seem schizophrenic until the third act brings it all together and ups the stakes tremendously and in redeeming fashion. Cameron's a gift action director, but the film walks a weird line between action and humor. Much of the humor works, but the second-act, which houses most of it, goes on for too long. There are memorable moments with Harry and a used-car salesman and most famously Jamie Lee Curtis doing a little dance in lingerie, but those seem much better in retrospect once you've seen the entire film. During, however, they feel unimportant and wasteful.How Cameron manages to imagine the action sequences in his films is anyone's guess. Harry chasing a terrorist while on horseback into a Marriott hotel certainly hasn't been done before. From an action standpoint, there's simply no lacking in excitement. Its that very ingenuity that helps the film overcome its dual nature in the third act. Most filmmakers probably don't possess the skill to crawl out of that kind of a hole, but Cameron has that skill and then some.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
If there's anything 90s movies did wrong, it's that they botched the superhero genre, namely with the slew of bad Batman sequels. "X-Men," however, closes out the 20th century with hope that between special effects and renewed focus on characters, the genre is on the way up.While 2002's "Spider-Man" was the film that really transformed the genre by use of the origin story, "X-Men" wasn't far off with its choice to tell the story with emphasis on a few of the characters. A comic book like "X-Men," where there are multiple heroes on a team instead of one masked crusader, could have been adopted horribly with too many different characters trying to share the spotlight. Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects") picks fan favorite Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) as the focus and a vehicle by which to introduce the viewer to the X-Men world. He also chooses Rogue (Anna Paquin) to demonstrate that teenage feeling of being different and hiding from the world that makes X-Men such a human story. Lastly, he develops only Magneto (Ian McKellen) of all the villains to set the stage for the greater conflict between humans and mutants that will carry over into the sequels. The other mutants are used for visual fluff, to further the story, or to please comic fans. While you'd like to see all the mutants get attention, this is a concession Singer knows he must make to avoid his film crashing and burning.The film's weak point is the general plot or evil scheme. While the movie is mostly based around scenes that are revealing of character and show how each mutant deals with his or her abilities, this element of the film remains "take-over-the-world" focused. With a bill on the verge of being passed that could force all mutants to register with the government, Magneto and the Brotherhood of Mutants (villains Sabertooth, Toad and the shape-shifting Mystique) plot to launch a radiation attack on a UN assembly in New York that would turn all the world's leaders into mutants. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his X-Men plan to stop them, believing peaceful cooperation with humans is the only way to get things done.There's not a ton of action in the film. The fight scenes are short and far from exhilarating. Instead, "X-Men" hopes that a few scant special effects and mutants demonstrating their powers will be enough to entertain you. It does, but not in an exciting way. This is not a full- throttle blockbuster, it's a movie about characters with special abilities that affect their lives.Singer does a great job bringing this franchise to the screen. While moviegoers love great action, it's nice to see a superhero film handled with sensitivity and being about what makes the X-Men so likable, not simply about bringing them to life and having them fight each other. That's where his camera-work, like when Rogue notices Wolverine's knuckles on the steering wheel and asks him if it hurts, makes an impact. His goal is to get you in touch with the characters--the stylish suits are secondary. While you'd like to see characters like Halle Berry's Storm or James Marsden's Cyclops be more than just a suit with a special power, the specific character focus is still good enough. This movie essentially prioritizes characters and good storytelling over the action number of villains that Hollywood once thought was the most important aspect. That alone is something superhero movie fans can't ever be too thankful for.
Every comedian has a unique voice or style of comedy, but the Marx Brothers should show up first in a wiki entry about "brands of comedy." Their off-kilter performances, literalist wordplay and sheer talent have made them a timeless foursome. "Animal Crackers" is a remarkably stupid film and pointless film, but to see these boys at work makes the whole thing worth it.If you can't tell, this was my first Marx Brothers experience. "Animal Crackers" was their first prominent film. Normally I start with the most famous film, which would be "Duck Soup," but I decided to begin my journey into 1930s comedy from the beginning.The film stars Groucho, Harpo, Chico, Zeppo and Margaret Dumont. It begins as typical Hollywood fare circa 1920 when it was believe you couldn't make a film without any music and singing in it. This certainly holds back the Marx Brothers, whose brand clearly thrives in a context that their slightly more modern counterpart, The Three Stooges, would later receive -- no music, just physical humor and ridiculousness. Of course the difference in wit between these two acts is tremendous, but there's no question that Hollywood was less ready to embrace these brothers.As mentioned, the plot is useless. The bustling estate of Mrs. Rittenhouse (Dumont) receives a visitor in the form of Jeffrey T. Spaulding (Groucho) back from a hunting trip in Africa and in the midst of the socializing, a valued painting is discovered missing. Honestly, the film has a few too many moments sprinkled throughout in which none of the Marx Brothers appear. Considering the only entertainment is when they grace the screen, it's unfortunate.The physical elements of the humor via Harpo are timeless, but what makes the Marx Brothers special is the sharp verbal wit embodied by Groucho through puns, sexual innuendo, contradictions in terms and defying expectation. He does it all so quickly and smoothly and simply put, no comedian since has been able to touch it. Throw in the patented rolling back of the eyes and you get why he was such an icon from the get-go.Then there's the talent factor. Harpo plays harp for maybe five minutes and for some reason its mesmerizing. A little before, Chico plays piano an comic fashion. You simply can't believe these aren't musician doubles, but coming from Vaudeville, these guys had to have all the tools, primarily humor and musicianship. These scenes also help bridge the gap between the expectations of audiences in the late '20s early '30s to see musical performances and the Marx Brothers' humor."Animal Crackers" bores in terms of story, but as a successful showcase for comedic and musical talent for some of the finest actors whoever gave it a go, it suffices.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Like most '90s sequels, "Lethal Weapon 3" proves the third time's a flop. The movie isn't horrible. It's watchable and provides the antics fans of the first two films have come to expect, but it offers no stimulation. It's flat, uninspired and typical. Riggs and Murtaugh aren't pushed in new ways or given any opportunity to grow as characters. Riggs (Gibson) is up to the same wisecrackery and Murtaugh (Glover) is still "too old for this ****."The plot is pretty standard. Murtaugh is days from retirement (isn't he always days from retirement?) when Riggs sets off a bomb he was trying to diffuse when he should've waited for bomb squad. Gosh, he's so darn reckless that Riggs! You'd think writer Jeffrey Boam ("Lethal Weapon 2," "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade") would stop leaning so hard on blanket personality descriptors of the characters. Anyway, the two get demoted to street duty where as luck would have it, they witness criminals taking something in an armored truck. They end up getting wrapped up in a major LAPD case involving an ex-cop stealing tons of automatic guns and selling them to gangs and such.The story never captures the full scope of what's going on. There's little sense of urgency and the alternative technique of mystery isn't used either. Murtaugh and Riggs just continue to be in the right place at the right time to catch bad guys in the act leading to pivotal turning points. I failed to feel any sort of emotion while watching the action in this film, I merely assumed something good would happen but not even Richard Donner could deliver on the action front.Another point to harp on is supporting cast. Boam brought back Joe Pesci's character in a small role where he's selling Murtaugh's house and also trying to get in on the action. Pesci is one of those actors that you either want to focus on or forget about because he's either very good or too much. Obviously in "Lethal Weapon 3" he's the latter. Rene Russo also joins as the martial arts-savvy Internal Affairs sergeant whom Riggs gets the hots for, naturally. Just the mere technique of throwing in a love interest cop for Riggs to get serious about (which he does to not believable effect) is offensive to those who have a sense of what effort a sequel needs to make to be any good.Apathy would be the best way to describe the way one receives "Lethal Weapon 3." Whereas its predecessor was infinitely more imaginative and impressive as a sequel, the horse needed to complete this trifecta was too similar and just dressed up to look different. Much of it is being stale, much of it is just not being a good script.
No one tells a more imaginative, original story than Hayao Miyazaki. While fantasy is a genre with limitless potential, there's still nothing like one of Miyazaki's animated fairy tales and "Princess Mononoke" is one his finest.The story follows a young warrior named Ashitaka who gets bitten and cursed by some sort of forest demon. The wound is surely fatal unless he embarks on a journey to find a cure. In his travels, he stumbles across a town of iron miners who are seemingly at war with wild animals, namely a pack of wolves and their princess, San. Ashitaka must try to play peacemaker as the forest's deer god--who both sides seek out for different reasons--might be his only means of a cure.The animation that brings a world of fantasy but also of feudal Japan to life is excellent. So many of the creatures are transparent, the large demons and gods are drawn of individual organism-like things that all move on their own while also making up a whole. The work must have taken forever. The nature backgrounds are also beautifully drawn. While most of the work and figures are in traditional anime style, the magical creatures will amaze you and the action is particularly well-directed to enhance the visual experience."Princess Mononoke" is a film for those who either have an appreciation of anime or more simply, an appreciation for imagination. Miyazaki's deer god sweeping through the land, his forest demons consuming people, Ashitaka's living scar, etc. are all things that simply inspire the imagination in everyone.While the film leaves its biggest impression as just a one-of-a-kind fairytale, there is some definite effort made to show that this battle between the humans and the wild animals is representative of man's struggle with nature. It is a fantastical dramatization of how we often upset the balance and harmony between the two. For people who have been exposed to nothing but Western film with Western ideas, this is quite a refreshing theme rooted in Buddhist philosophy and other Eastern religions, but certainly one all cultures can understand.
Perhaps the only thing that's beyond normal in "Good Will Hunting" is the fact that Will Hunting is a mathematical genius. The rest is about as real as a film can get while still being interesting. To be two hours about a young man and his issues and to be so good says a lot about the acting and the writing of this film: that it's very, very good."Hunting" stars Matt Damon as the title role, the enigma that is Will Hunting. Damon is so good at capturing the broad spectrum of his character's emotions. Hunting is written to be a psychological head case who thinks he's figured out what life's about and what people are about and Damon really shows you that. It's a role that would seemingly be played by Leonardo Di Caprio, but we all know what he was busy doing in 1997.Hunting is a janitor at MIT and when he starts solving some of the most difficult of math equations, he gets discovered by Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard). Because Hunting is an orphan and spends most of his time around South Boston getting into trouble with his friends, the plot gets moving when the professor agrees to get Hunting out of jail time with the exceptions that he spend time on math with him and that he go to therapy. After therapy with several top shrinks fails, Hunting is taken to Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) and the two form a unique relationship. The film is in general about the psychological and social journey of Hunting as he begins to understand what life's really all about.Just as good as Damon though are Skarsgard and of course Robin Williams, who is in a role that seems perfect for him, or at least he makes it his own very much so in this film. His character is so honest, but also very poignant and funny.It's a simple concept really. You tell the story of a genius who was orphaned and abused as a child and you have a story of untapped potential and of letting go of the past to embrace the future. Damon and Affleck, who are responsible for the film's intelligent screenplay simply tell this in a really complex way, showing it through the relationship between Will and Sean, Sean and Professor Lambeau, and even Will and his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck). There's a very wide spectrum and experience there. Sometimes the dialogue does seem a bit too elitist and literary, but most of the time it's natural and just meaningful. Gus Van Sant adds some touches of his own, but this is mostly about the story and the characters, so he succeeds at his job of letting it be about them."Good Will Hunting" might now blow you out of the water, but it's touching because it's so human and because the characters could be any of us. Will is the extreme (lonely poor orphan math genius), but we all identify with extremes better in some way, and that's what makes this film successful.
Never underestimate robot boxing. Despite reaching for nearly every cliché in the family- oriented sports underdog drama handbook short of titling the film "Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots," DreamWorks delivers a undeniable crowd-pleaser with "Real Steel."Just as Hugh Jackman's Charlie tells his estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo) as they train a rusted-up sparring robot to be a champion boxer, it's all about putting on a show for the people and that's exactly what "Real Steel" does. For better or worse, robot boxing is cool, cool enough that should it ever cross into the non-fictional world, people will pay to see it, just as they will to see this movie.In championing old-school sports movie values with a contemporary video-game-like twist, "Real Steel" is a 9-to-12-year-old boy's fantasy and one that dads won't mind taking their kids to see. Other than a script that tosses around the word "ass" like it's the new way of saying "cool" (or as if the MPAA finally gave PG-13 movies permission to use it), there's a good heart and moral to the story.In the not-too-distant future, former boxer Charlie Kenton trains ton-sized robots to fight in the ring for a living, only he's constantly running up a sizable tab as his bets don't usually pay off or up. When he learns his ex has died and custody of their 11-year-old son has defaulted to him, Charlie strikes a deal with the boy's rich uncle to sign custody over to his family for enough money to buy a new bot, but it also entails Max staying with his "dad" for the summer. As it turns out, Max is a bit of a robot boxing fan with twice the stubborn charisma of his father. Together they uncover an old bot in a junkyard named Atom who helps them put aside their ill will and get back in the gameYes, "Real Steel" is 100 percent cookie cutter  an old blind hound could sniff out what's coming next  but when sports montage comes to uplifting Danny Elfman score, a cookie cutter still makes cookies. In this case we're talking giant-sized robot cookies, and it's that shape that makes all the difference.The likable qualities of "Real Steel" all come down to presentation, from the unique premise of robot boxing (ok, unique enough) to the charm of the lead actors to director Shawn Levy's sound and instinctive storytelling style. Jackman and former "Lost" star Evangeline Lilly try to create a chemistry from a subplot that's barely accounted for (her dad trained him, they've always been sort of on-again-off-again), but they make it work, mostly because they're beautiful people with a decent measure of likability and talent.Levy makes the whole mold come together with an eye for what casual moviegoers like most and the presence of mind to know just when to say stop so that the script's pouring of sap doesn't make the whole thing soggy.The robots though, they steal the show. (I initially typed "steel," which I thought was worth mentioning.) If I had at least 15 fewer years I'd already be out buying my Atom and Zeus action figures  maybe Noisy Boy too. The bots are well-conceived and expertly branded with unique names and appearances.Speaking of branding, product placement runs rampant in this film. Max downs three Dr. Peppers before teaching Atom some dance moves, the robots are controlled by HP hologram computers and ads in the boxing arena rep XBox 720. If that kind of excess turns you off in a film, well, it's not like you could call it surprising.The heart comes from the father-son relationship, which evolves over time after starting out maddeningly immature. Charlie treats Max as a mere pawn at first and Max oversteps his boundaries as an 11-year-old. The script puts them on equal footing: Son seems to know just as much as father and youthful optimism seems a force as powerful as logic. Of course the optimism wins; we're at the movies after all. Hope could definitely last five rounds in the ring against even the fiercest robot."Real Steel" can be counted among the rare films that offer an argument for the perpetuation of the Hollywood machine, but if all formulaic movies could handle the characters this well it wouldn't matter. Truth is, it's as easy to despise the movie in principle as it is to just enjoy it at face value  provided you dig giant fighting robots.~Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com!
The first question that we beg of "The Machinist" (of what will be many) is "holy crap, why is Christian Bale so damn skinny?" Other than the actual fact that he dieted on tuna and an apple every day, there's no real answer for this in the film, but it can pretty clearly be deciphered as a metaphor or a physical manifestation of his character's troubled mind. But while the film has its metaphysical bases covered, along with its distinct color palettes contributing to a pervasive feeling of paranoia, "The Machinist" offends the one thing a viewer can't ever forgive: common sense. Not in its plausibility, but in terms of expecting that it can get away with not tying up every loose end."The Machinist" is a thriller in the purest sense. It is one character that strange events happen to that cause both him and the viewer to go insane trying to make sense of. The soundtrack even has a classic suspense score a la Hitchcock. Specifically, Bale plays Trevor Reznik, a factory worker who lives a lonely existence that consists of early morning (1 am) ventures to airport diners and paying the same hooker (Jennifer Jason Leigh) over and over again to the point that they're more or less together. When he meets a strange man who accidentally causes him to sever the arm of a fellow factory worker, Reznik begins to yell conspiracy, finding notes on his refrigerator that equate to a game of hangman.The film has a great look. Director Brad Anderson succeeds at turning it into a mood piece with the constant use of blues and greens and the lighting. It makes for a film with as much of a suspenseful look as plot. "The Machinist" will have you trying to get a step ahead the entire time, trying to figure out how much of it is in this emaciated insomniac's head versus what's real, with an ending that will not disappoint. At the same time, while many questions are answered, some glaring ones are not. The significance of the film's title is lost and what role this job and what happens in the film at it with the severed arm and the like seems to have nothing to do with the plot twist. Perhaps the general obscurity of the film's events will lead most people to a mostly hazing understanding of it all when it is revealed.Still, fans of the genre will have something to enjoy in "The Machinist," especially ones that give equal importance to film-making and not just the plot coherency, much like true Hitchcock fans. While it may not leave you fully satisfied, you certainly won't regret the whole experience.
It wouldn't seem easy for any documentary filmmaker to tackle an issue with as broad and universal (pardon the unfortunate pun) a scope as health care, but Michael Moore, the United States' most famous and controversial documentarian, strikes again with more poignancy than ever before. "Sicko" is multi-faceted, strongly organized, emotional and thought- provoking. Best of all, it's Moore's least controversial film to date. He continues with his liberal sense of humor, but "Sicko" poses more questions about what it means to live in America than it does to assign blame.It is clear that Moore also has more help than ever before, with financial backing by the Weinstein Bros and a team of researchers to find the most compelling personal stories from the tens of thousands of if not millions of health care tragedies to be told in America. Armed with these resources, "Sicko" goes into the history of health care and HMOs in the U.S., gives countless examples of people denied insurance or denied coverage of certain operations at the deadliest of costs and then ventures up north to Moore's favorite country and overseas to both the U.K and France, to inquire about the effectiveness of their universal health care. Lastly, its final thirty minutes involve Moore taking a handful of 9/11 emergency workers who were not adequately treated in the U.S on a journey to Guantanamo Bay, where America's worst criminals receive free treatments.As usual, Moore lines this film with moments of shock, where we have to laugh at how painfully obvious his points are. He also brings back his leanings toward satire and exaggeration for humorous effect. And just like always, Moore merely addresses the other side with an example or two, never really digging deep into opposing viewpoints. For example, we've been told time and time again that universal health care in countries like Canada comes at a cost -- lesser quality, longer waits for treatment, etc. and instead of surveying hospitals all over Canada, he merely takes us to one. He would better silence skeptics if we knew with 100 percent honesty that he didn't just pick the hospital with the responses he was looking for.Still, Moore's documentary is not about converting to Canada or Britain's system, but about the principle of universal health care. The mentality from talking to these countries is that everyone should be helped, that when it comes to health -- to life or death in many cases -- that nobody should be deciding whose worthy or not worthy of treatment, especially not billion-dollar HMO corporations. Everyone values his or her health, and it's so distressing to know that our country is stuck in a rut where too many dollars and jobs are at stake to just flip our health care system over and shake it out. This is an issue where everyone's livelihood is affected and Moore offers plenty of insight into the emotional factors, the everyday person.Moore has a tremendous responsibility as a filmmaker. After "Bowling for Columbine" shot to critical and box office fame, he's become the most visible icon of the documentary craft out of thousands of others like him who will never be known in the slightest. Add that to his choice of social topics and his tendency to have a sense of humor about him and he will always be a controversial but crucial American figure. No one dares to upset establishment like Moore and as much as he becomes a social pest to many people for it, democracy requires it of us and Moore simply has accepted the responsibility.
"Dead Poets Society" is a maturing into adulthood drama whose story and messages are as instructional as they are inspiring. The film is like an inspirational teacher, the one in high school that changed the way you thought about life and knowledge. It reflects this in Mr. Keating, the teacher who touched the lives of a group of teenage boys for the better despite the monstrous obstacle of conformity in all their paths.Directed by Peter Weir ("Gallipoli") and written beautifully by Tom Schulman, "Dead Poets Society" stars Robin Williams in one his first great dramatic performances as Keating, an English teacher at an all-boys boarding school who inspires his students with poetry and by encourages their own free thinking with the simple motto of "carpe diem (seize the day)."But the film is really about the boys and their various struggles. Todd (Ethan Hawke) is quiet and keeps to himself -- he's scared of personal expression. Neil (Robert Sean Leonard) is living in the iron grip of his father (Kurtwood Smith) who insists he become a doctor when his passion is really acting. Knox (Josh Charles) discovers infatuation/love and the courage it requires and Charlie deals the barriers of free speech. Keating's lessons inspire their actions and bring out new parts of themselves and together they hold Dead Poets Society meetings in a cave in the woods.The clique of rebellious teenage boys and their unusual teacher are not motifs foreign to film, and neither are themes of fighting conformity and making the most of life. Most adults know all about these ideas -- they're not exactly profound and original -- but Tom Schulman tells "Dead Poets Society" in such a way that allows you to rediscover them and reawaken memories of what that personal experience was like. We see the rigid culture and system of the school and the classroom and then suddenly Keating comes in and makes learning what it should be. Suddenly we remember who our "Keatings" were and what it was like when we finally learned the value of our own perspectives, ideas and most importantly, desires.The cast of young men is excellent. They make sure no character entirely falls into a teenage stereotype despite their many personalities that make up the group dynamic. We remember our own youthful enthusiasm through their experience and empathize with their troubles.Weir's direction leads us gracefully into this rediscovery. His use of symbolism and the subtle ways he re-implants elements of the classroom scenes into the students' subplots and other key moments of the film draw us back to the power of the learning experience and how it can leave such a fine imprint on our lives. We see clearly how those scenes with Keating give life to the rest of the story and rekindle our memories and ignite our emotions as we connect to the characters and their experiences."Dead Poets Society" is a great execution of a simple inspirational drama/tragedy. Despite having all the elements, it avoids cliché much of the time or at least masks it with the strong connection the story builds with its audience. Many films have been more dramatic or original, but this film really gets the most out of what it is and tells a story about something universally human to which every soul with even the slightest meaningful education experience can relate. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
In the world of young adult book adaptations with a fantasy/science fiction edge, "Divergent" is one of the few to actually fall in between really good and intolerable. It's no "Hunger Games," but director Neil Burger ("Limitless") and writers Evan Daugherty ("Snow White and the Huntsman") and Vanessa Taylor ("Game of Thrones") do a respectable job bringing the Veronica Roth novel to life with maturity and actual filmmaking talent.Having read the book, it's kind of in the same boat. It's not as good as the first "Hunger Games" book but it has that same adult, ultra-violent tone with romantic subplots that don't overtake the plot but rank a clear second to it. The dystopian world of "Divergent" is far more complicated than "Hunger Games," which widens in scope as the trilogy continues instead of turning the whole world it has built on its head in book one as "Divergent" does. Essentially, "Divergent" the movie is as good as the material allows it to be, meaning its faults run as deep as those of its source material.That said, "Divergent" is an intriguing and engaging story, even if it feels unpolished at times. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) is a teen living in one of society's five factions in dystopian Chicago. She has reached the age when young people are tested to find out which faction (all of which are based on different virtues) they are best suited to, though in the end they are given a choice no matter what the results say. When Beatrice takes the test, her results are inconclusive. This means she's divergent; she doesn't belong in just one faction, and in a world where everyone is supposed to fit in a specific place, this is dangerous. She chooses to leave her selfless faction, Abnegation, for the bravery and free-spiritedness of Dauntless.Woodley's talent and career trajectory suggests that Summit Entertainment was going for the next Jennifer Lawrence-type to play Tris and she's as good as it gets. With the book being told from the Tris' perspective, it's incumbent on her to communicate the many feelings that Roth so excellently expresses in the book and she does. The rest of the cast isn't too bad either, though only Theo James as Four, Tris' Dauntless mentor-turned-love interest, gets much of a platform. He's every bit of mysterious, dark and handsome as the part necessitates."Divergent" sacrifices these side characters in the name of bringing all the memorable plot points of the story to life and explaining Roth's highly intricate dystopian world. There's nothing simple about the faction system for those who haven't read the books, so it eats up some screen time. And with so many scenes and moving pieces, there's little breathing room in the screenplay. The other initiates that Tris befriends (or tangles with) in Dauntless who keep the story grounded in a lot of ways don't develop in the film so that parts including Tris' experiences in the fear simulations, the capture the flag scene and more can all have space in the final cut. "The Hunger Games" took a similar philosophy, to let the main character be the real emotional focus of the film and to shut others out, but again, "Divergent" is more complicated, and the story doesn't have emotional turning points in the same way "Hunger Games" does.Artistically, however, the adaptation does a nice job, even if it borrows on the "Hunger Games" aesthetic a little. Burger nails the test and fear simulation scenes, in which Tris experiences a lifelike simulation induced by a serum. He gives them the eerie, larger-than-life quality they require but in a natural way that outdoes the average film's creepy nightmare sequence. The adrenaline rush of Tris' dauntless adventures also comes through. Speaking as a Chicagoan, it would have been nice to see more of the city's actual aesthetic in the film, which is essential to this series, but there's more potential for that in the sequels.So many young adult novel adaptations have been made, and maybe barely 10 percent manage to become "Twilight" or "The Hunger Games." It isn't and won't become those (even though it's better than "Twilight"), but "Divergent" proves there is room for a successful middle ground in this genre, something it desperately needed.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

There isn't a whole lot of hilarity going on in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," it's one of those movies that is meant to capture an era, a generation, like "American Graffiti" before it. There's is no real plot line, just a series of scenes that follow characters Brad, Stacy, Mike, Mark, and surfer bum Spicoli (Sean Penn). Its charm is not its humor, but its relatable parallels to high school life. It's a film about high school kids trying to get laid and dealing with jobs and parents and hard-nosed teachers in the process. It's the first thing I would give an alien studying high schools in the 1980s.The film marks the debut of writer Cameron Crowe, who essentially went undercover to deliver the accuracy of high school life and in the process sparked what would become the stereotypes that countless high school movies and TV shows would depend on for decades after. His genius is that you get all these characters. They're naive and well-intentioned, but they just screw up. That's who everyone is in high school. They're also horny, but that's another matter."Fast Times" is not without its memorable scenes, even if the humor won't put you in fits. The scene where Brad (Judge Reinhold) pleases himself to the image of his sister's best friend in her bright red swimsuit has inspired countless spoofs and similar re-imaginings (like 1989's "Christmas Vacation." Even though Spicoli feels entirely irrelevant to the plot, his scenes dealing with the infamous Mr. Hand are impeccable examples of character acting and that's why his image is synonymous with the film.So its lack of plot might be boring and it might not be the bucket of laughs you'd expect, but "Fast Times" is representative of a type of film-making that for is iconic and memorable because of its honesty.
One thing that science-fiction junkies often consider is what aliens would think of us if they studied our planet. Alex Proyas' mystery thriller "Dark City" tells a tale of how they might experiment with us if they discovered our planet and what they would learn about what makes humans tick. In essence, that's what Proyas' script aims to do, discover just a little piece of what it means to be human, and that's what all great films accomplish.The Strangers are the aliens in the film who have the power of "tuning" which essentially means willing the physical environment around them with their minds and the help of their giant underground machines. They use this power of creation in combination with artificially manufacturing memories (with the aid of a scientist played by Kiefer Sutherland) to create scenarios in which to study their human subjects. So when John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up one night with no memory to find he's wanted for murder, he begins to uncover the truth as he searches for answers to his own past."Dark City" begins as more of a mystery thriller. There are unsolved murders, John is searching for his memories and he's being hunted by a detective (William Hurt). Couple that with Proyas' vision for this experimental city environment, modeled in a 1930s or 40s style but with a dark and decrepit feel to it and you have sort of a science-fiction noir film. It's really a beautifully imagined world even though it's very old-fashioned and downtrodden. As the film progresses and you learn more about what the Strangers are up to and what they're capable of (key in on Sutherland's character for the explanations), then "Dark City" emerges as the sci-fi thriller it was born to be. Visual effects abound (that are quite impressive for 1998), action around most corners and explanations of the bizarre aren't more than a scene away.Directorially, Proyas makes more a visual statement early on in the more noir/mystery portion of the film. There some really great shots -- copious amounts of them in this film in general -- all of which are helped out by intriguing lighting and set design. Between this and the script, you can tell just how vivid Proyas' imagination has to be to actually bring this film to life.For fans of science-fiction, this film is an easy favorite. All of the film's shortcomings, whether you find the acting just sort of at par or the dialogue not all that stimulating for the actors to work with, the mythology of this film is so elaborate and spectacular that it gives your brain plenty to chew on. The film is not shy about its probing into the relationship between human memory and emotion and is exceptionally poignant in tackling such an abstract concept.~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
There are many different ways to look at Federico Fellini's masterpiece, "8 1/2," and the one you choose ultimately determines how well you understand and enjoy the film. There are broad lenses that capture the bigger picture of fictional film director Guido Anselmi's creative block and the tighter lenses that zero in on Fellini's creative choices during imaginary sequences and their underlying messages. For the average viewer, the big picture lens -- if you can keep that perspective the entire length of the film -- will earn the more favorable response. It's the artist, however, anyone who watches this film that has struggled to create, ever, who will love it most.With the title actually referring to the number of films Fellini had made, "8 1/2" is clearly a personal endeavor. It is an acting out of his own personal struggles as an artist by having his main character imagine his own struggles. Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) has a number of women in his life -- a wife, mistress, a couple actresses -- even brief acquaintances that have stuck with him somehow. Juggling them all in his mind, he tries to make sense of them all together but can't do it without favoring certain ones and his attempt to use this as the basis for his film fails him.He also wants to create something meaningful to people -- something truthful. Nothing purely escapist, but still effectively consoling. Holding himself to this standard, he is able to achieve nothing artistically with regard to his "upcoming film," completely unable to satisfy himself, his producer or anyone else in his life for that matter. The result of "8 1/2" is a discussion of the purpose and role of art. Is it purposeful or purposeless? Meaningful or ultimately meaningless? The surrealist quality of the film reflects the chaos of addressing that very subject. There is a futility in attempting to create art that fully and completely encompasses and reflects truth and reality and that in itself is the point of art. It's the beginning of what could be an endless discussion and that's yet another characteristic of exceptional art.Fellini has made this discussion come to life in an evocative way and one that is just as cognizant of relationship drama as it is about relationships being artistic inspiration. There are countless aspects to analyze as a result and it makes "8 1/2" one of those "Film Studies 101" movies~Steven CVisit my site at moviemusereviews.com
Charlotte Brontë's seminal literary work "Jane Eyre" has been adapted countless times and prepared in a myriad of ways from the 1943 Joan Fontaine/Orson Welles version that was whittled to an hour and a half to the 1983 BBC mini-series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton that spans five-plus hours. That certainly begs the question of why anyone, from writer Moira Buffini to director Cary Fukunaga to Dame Judi Dench, would feel inspired to recreate this coming-of-age story about love and accepting its blemishes.Fukunaga's ("Sin Nombre") take doesn't exactly provide an amazing revelation or epiphanic justification for bringing "Jane Eyre" back to life, but it does prove that no classic can be so overdone that it becomes untouchable; even the most tried and dated of love stories can find new life. Fukanaga has given "Jane Eyre" a photorealistic makeover devoid of frills and fiercely au naturel, but no less gripping than the story's "livelier" retellings.Fictional period dramas often feel overtly pristine and glazed over to the point of fairytale, but in watching this film, you get the sense that this is quite possibly how the story would have looked and felt if it had been true. All the way down to accents, this rendition has clearly labored over historical authenticity and it shows in the finished product.Mia Wasikowska ("The Kids Are All Right") continues to choose spot-on independent films despite leading the billion-dollar "Alice in Wonderland" of 2010 and it continues to pay off. She's clearly adept at embodying literary characters, or at least at recreating them within herself rather than worrying about trying to become the way the majority perceives them. Her modest looks suit Jane perfectly and she can play both the fragile girl who has been so often wronged by those who were supposed to care for her and the somewhat self-assured young woman who so plainly understands right from wrong.Buffini ("Tamara Drewe") tells "Jane Eyre" in an un-narrated flashback. The film opens with Jane dashing away from the spectre of the Thornfield estate and stumbling through the beautifully captured but cold and desolate English countryside in a state of total anguish. She arrives at the Rivers' place where they enquire as to her identity. As the voice of Mr. Rochester (Michael Fassbender) beckons her, she cannot block out the memories of her journey. The film then catches up to that point in real time and continues on to the end.Other than a terrific performance from Amelia Clarkson as young Jane, the early chapters involving Lowood School seem to be of less significance in this version other than the very clear point to establish Mr. Brocklehurst as an insensitive headmaster and clearly spell out Jane's early traumas that have affected her perspective. The love story between Jane and Mr. Rochester and the way it affects Jane takes supreme precedence in this film and with a two- hour run time, rightfully so. Nevertheless, the short beginnings prevent the film from showing the whole scope of Jane's troubled life.Fassbender and Wasikowska work terrifically and manage to communicate the class and age discrepancy that made "Jane Eyre" a juicy read back in the 19th Century. Fassbender does seem to let Rochester's guard down quicker than expected, but I enjoyed his choice to be less standoffish and more brooding; he determines his secret to be more a responsibility of an unfortunate nature than a loathsome burden. His love for Jane then feels more sincere.An actress as magnetizing as Judi Dench choosing to play the caretaker Mrs. Fairfax sums up the humble attitude of this "Jane Eyre." She uses her gravitas to the effect of being the film's lone comic relief and complements the scenes rather than stealing them from Wasikowska, who is 55 years her junior.The film itself aims for subtlety and chooses not to amp up the shock value of the story's most pivotal scenes. There's some manufactured suspense, but it's mostly natural. It ends up being the most commendable aspect of Fukunaga's vision, but maybe the most hampering as well. He creates exceptional tone and mood with the help of his wonderful cast and this seizes our interest, but his "Jane" never takes a chance with any emotional punches. A superbly crafted film, just not a resonant one.~Steven C
There's no denying that "The Reader" is a well-crafted film. Director Stephen Daldry ("Billy Elliot," "The Hours") has proved himself more than capable of handling a struggle as deeply internalized as that of Michael Berg (David Kross), a German teenager in post-WWII Berlin wrestling with the shame of an affair with an older Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet), who herself is wrestling with having been a Nazi. There is no question that despite the film being about guilt and shame and how the characters are affected by bottling it up, that Daldry is able to successfully communicate the story, its emotions and keep it visually interesting (though Winslet is the true master of this skill). Yet somehow, "The Reader" doesn't manage to drive any kind of message home. It drives home three or four instead of clearly focusing on one.Ironically, a character at the end of the film suggests to an older Michael (Ralph Fiennes) that if he's seeking catharsis he should turn to the movies. Well, not this one, at least. It's really hard to pinpoint what this film is about. Is it about a scandalous love affair and its implications? Is it about the guilt that is never absolved when one commits crimes of genocide? It's even hard to tell who the film is about because Winslet is as powerful of an actress as there is when it comes to commanding the inner monologue that she'll have you convinced the movie is about her even when--from a bare bones perspective--it's really about Michael, or at the least their relationship.There's just too much for the viewer to reconcile in "The Reader." Between overtones of suggesting we should feel sympathy for a Nazi and understanding why older Michael is being so emotional about Hanna decades after they were last intimate, there's no room for clarity. While you can certainly feel captivated by Winslet's facial expressions portraying a heavy clash of guilt and shame, that doesn't help you better understand why her ex-lover is struggling emotionally to get through law school. It might not seem right to say it, but Winslet is so good that she becomes more a part of the film than perhaps she was intended to be. Audiences will like "The Reader" for its parts, but not the sum of them. Each subplot, each essential question, gets addressed in some way by Daldry and writer David Hare, but the main idea, the message as a whole, is unclear. There are so many satisfying bits and pieces, scenes, symbols and imagery that appear particularly artistic and poignant, that there's something for everyone viewer to connect to, but together they feel almost meaningless.Because of the thematic identity crisis, there are some structural issues with the film as well. While the producers wanted you to know about Schmitz's dark past, the film ignores the fact that you know for the first 45 minutes or so. It begins telling the story chronologically from the day Michael and Hanna met but then ends up shifting more frequently. These different 'time zones' don't exactly succeed well on their own either, they're all a part of the greater story, which as we know, is not entirely clear."The Reader" is an example of why Winslet is every bit deserving of the acclaim she receives and of how you can take something seemingly unfilmable and give it visual life and make it interesting. In a year as full of remarkable films as 2008, it's simply hard for "The Reader" to stand out, especially with some flaws that keep it from being a deeply meaningful film in addition to a well-made one.
The talk that "Yes Man," is Jim Carrey's return to leading role comedy through the reincarnate of "Liar Liar" is not off-base by any means, but other than Carrey himself, this movie is completely different. This is Carrey in a much more contemporary comedy, not a product of formula that made him a star in the 90s. "Yes Man" is still extremely formulaic when viewed alongside recent comedies, but if you can just say "yes," and not dismiss it too early on, you'll be surprised by how fresh and entertaining this film can be.Carrey stars as Carl Allen, a man whose boring job and divorce have him in a rut so bad that he would rather make excuses and be left alone than do anything. But when he begins to lose the faith of his best friend (Bradley Cooper of "Wedding Crashers"), Carl reluctantly attends a seminar about the power of the word "yes." At the seminar, Carl enters a 'covenant' in which he agrees to say "yes" to any opportunity, no matter how strange, that comes his way. By doing this, Carl meets a lot of frustration, but he also meets Allison (Zooey Deschanel)and his life begins changing for the more humorous.It's the right role for Carrey, but it's also a touch odd to see the master of last decade plugged into a film where the writing, the cast and nearly everything around him is hip and current. Director Peyton Reed ("The Break-Up") and writer Nicholas Stoller ("Forgetting Sarah Marshall"), for example, both are well-versed in the recent frat-pack/ Apatow clan comedy mania that has defined the last five or so years. There is some great situational writing from Stoller where every joke or thing that Carl agrees to do is able to come back to make the film funnier later on, but Carrey does fit strangely into it all. After all, he is 46 year old and his love interest, Deschanel, is 28. Carl Allen is clearly written for someone younger, yet without Carrey there is no star power to sell this film. Carrey has that power and beyond, and though it's a bit weird to see a middle-aged man going out with the guys and getting completely drunk, it was still the right choice by the producers because his comedic strengths fit the role in terms of characterization.Sure, "Yes Man" is one of those comedies where a guy starts out pretty despicable but wins the audiences favor and gets a girlfriend who finds out he was a jerk and doesn't forgive him though we know he has changed so he has to do something valiant to get her back. However, that's nothing new in Hollywood and "Yes Man" deserves to be judged on the meat of the comedy and not its bones. In that respect, it's mostly a very funny situational film though some of the dialog intended to be witty/clever falls flat.The only other things that keep "Yes Man" from becoming one of the year's best comedies is the excessive use of product placement and Warner Bros. decision to brag about all the popular movies it owns the rights to ("Harry Potter" and "300") by showing them in various ways throughout the film from actual footage to costumes to DVD cases. But that's all nit-picky because as much as "Yes Man" might sell out, it's really got some great stuff buried inside.
Well, you knew Terry Gilliam wasn't going to make a traditional contribution to the '80s fantasy/adventure canon. "Time Bandits" might be the oddest film ever intended for family audiences. Only the writer/director's second non-"Monty Python" film after 1977's "Jabberwocky," Gilliam infuses purposefully odd humor and nonsensical characters and events in this smorgasbord of an epic.Kevin (Craig Warnock) is an imaginative young boy whose parents are obsessed with "As Seen on TV"-style kitchen appliances and other material objects, but he doesn't have to worry about them for long when a band of dwarfs climb out of his wardrobe and whisk him away on an adventure throughout time in search of treasure.The dwarfs are not all that different from Kevin's parents; they seek only to amass treasure despite being in possession of a map that shows all the world's time holes, Kevin sees this as a quite a waste of a gift, but there's not much he can do  and it beats being at home. The five dwarfs, Randall (David Rappaport), Fidgit (Kenny Baker, a.k.a. R2-D2), Strutter (Malcolm Dixon), Og (Mike Edmonds) and Wally (Jack Purvis) are a delightful bunch. Gilliam shoots the film at their level, and you really see them for their acting ability, not simply their stature.Complicating their journey from Napoleon France to the Middle Ages to Ancient Greece and beyond is that they're being pursued by the Wizard of Oz-like Supreme Being, a sort of euphemism for God, who wants his map back, while the Evil Genius (David Warner) tries to lure them to his Fortress of Ultimate Darkness to steal the map and recreate the world in his own evil image. Evil Genius is an extreme caricature of the force of evil equipped with a bizarre bent only Gilliam seems truly capable of.Whatever statements Gilliam and co-writer Michael Palin wish to make about God/Satan or good/evil get lost fairly quickly in the countless strange events that occur in each of the journey's pit stops. After sinking with the Titanic, they get caught in an ogre's fishing net only the ogre has back pains that distract him from being menacing. In moments like those the film feels as its most "Python."Although we're only peppered with the humor of "Time Bandits," Gilliam's imagination never lags for even a moment. He undoubtedly proves himself a man of tremendous vision, even though a child would be more likely to be terrified of it than appreciate its combination of dark and eccentric."Time Bandits" is truly an adventure to behold. The journey of its hero plays second fiddle, but there's enough swirling metaphor and symbolism for the child's imagination going on that we understand what he's going through and identify with it personally. The ending does but another weird cap on things, but it gels with the unexpected nature of most everything else in the film.Gilliam embraces fantasy and historical fantasy archetypes with a fervor nearly equal to his desire to chop them into weirdly shaped pieces before serving them to us. "Time Bandits" is consequently as familiar as it is spontaneous and silly. Although not the staple of its genre, it certainly must be described as timeless.~Steven CThanks for reading!

When a beloved book is given the big-screen treatment, there's always the excitement factor of getting to see what was once only in your head come to life right before your eyes. That excitement was 100-fold, however, with J.K. Rowling's smash-hit fantasy series beginning with "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." With that much anticipation, there are some serious expectations for Warner Brothers' behemoth franchise-to-be, and gladly the pay-off of seeing it all for the first time makes "Sorcerer's Stone" a success with Potter fans.As for those who never picked up the book, there might be a good portion among them who aren't left spellbound. The enormous project suffers a bit out of fear of failing the fans, which is fair as they're the target audience -- along with families in general. That's where the choice for Chris Columbus to produce and direct becomes the level-headed choice. With credits including both "Home Alone" films and "Mrs. Doubtfire," Columbus clearly knows how to work with kids -- and there is a lot of that work needing to be done with young actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson taking most of the screen time. All three are quite talented for having barely a credit to their names and Columbus deserves much of the praise for their performance.The rest of the cast is pretty remarkable: a who's who of outstanding British acting (and some Scottish). Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonnagal, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, John Hurt as Mr. Olivander, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Alan Rickman who is brilliantly chilling as the mean, stone-faced Professor Snape. Each of them clearly talented enough to bring these characters to life not just visually but with complexity. They are like the respected elders of the film and we bow our heads to them.At the same time, the first Harry Potter is a much more childish film full of good vs. evil cliché. Maybe the attribution should go to the desire to not get slapped with anything more than a PG rating, which is understandable, but it dilutes the mystique of the novels. The art direction (with lavish sets and costumes) makes the film carry its own magical quality just like the book, but it's the dramatic storytelling that's not as breath-taking. Part of that problem belongs to the challenge of adapting the book. Steve Kloves ("Wonder Boys") proves an interesting choice, but I wouldn't wish this assignment on anyone. Kloves opts for taking the maximum time producers would give him (two and a half hours -- too much for a family film) and crams as much book material as he can into it. Not exactly the best way to do it, but the safest as far as fan-pleasing goes. "Sorcerer's Stone" ends up vaulting from scene to scene and the result is that Harry goes from boy who didn't know wizards existed to wizard student with the knowledge that strangers wouldn't just carry dragon eggs in about an hour and a half. The story still gives Harry time to charm us and express his fears and wishes to know his parents, but his hero's journey is undermined by sheer desire to fill the screen with as many magical elements from the book as possible."Sorcerer's Stones" will certainly satisfy fans' itches and entertain them at a high level of quality, which I can say falling into that category, but it's a bit too much like a really long race because of its commitment to book obedience (and I'm sure plenty was missing too). But seeing it all come to life is enough to entertain the masses and provoke the imaginations of nearly all who sit down and watch.
"Lars and the Real Girl" is about a man named Lars (Gosling) who begins to seriously date a sex doll he ordered off the internet. Sounds like a wacky comedy, right? In reality, however, the only reason there is anything to laugh at in "Lars" is because the idea of it is absurd and we can't ever fully come to terms with the fact that Bianca is in fact a mannequin. The result is a light-hearted drama in the form of a peculiar character study that while not at comedy, is something to smile at.Nancy Oliver, a writer for "Six Feet Under," has crafted a story about how if you try hard enough, you can make anything fake become real. The film begins by showing us Lars has some serious social issues and there is a sense of pity and a drive to understand him. When "Bianca" comes into the picture, we don't see Lars' motivational process, she just sort of shows up, and immediately we identify with Lars' brother and his wife, the main supporting characters who Lars first introduces Bianca to. We think Lars is as crazy as they do and go through the process of trying to figure out what we would do in that situation. The answer? Go with it. The plot reveals itself from there.The acting is good in this film. There is no really intense drama dialogue, so it's hard to put this film entirely in the drama category--"independent" seems most fitting as it has a very off-beat sense of humor. Gosling completely sells the social dysfunction and he and director Craig Gillespie almost have us believing Bianca is real at times. Emily Mortimer as Lars' sister-in-law also gives a noteworthy performance. She should end up in some more mainstream film in the future."Lars" won't leave you that emotional, but you'll be slightly captivated by this compelling character and how he learns to deal with his social issues in a unique way. At its core, it's a film about how "make-believe" can sometimes teach us more about real life than we think it can, and for Lars it's everything. So while this film might not be exactly what you thought when you popped it in, it's definitely something easy to enjoy.
You don't get the sense you're watching a major piece of cinema in "The Wild Bunch" until just before the credits roll. With the exception of a few deliciously intense gunfights, the film rolls along like a tumbleweed or at times even a pig in slop, celebrating the guffaws of male camaraderie and delighting in prostitution and violence. Then you realize you're watching Hollywood's first gritty, no-apologies Western. The usual sugarcoated outlaw mythos has been shattered and Sam Peckinpah appears as groundbreaking of a filmmaker as they come."The Wild Bunch" stars William Holden in a timeless story of aging outlaws tying up lose ends just as with another classic Western released the same year of 1969 in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." And tying up loose ends means one last bloody job regardless of the consequences. Pike (Holden) and his buddies Dutch (Ernest Borgnine), Lyle (Warren Oates), and Gorch (Ben Johnson) along with the troublemaker Angel (Jaime Sanchez) and the slap-happy old Freddy (Edmond O'Brien) realize after shooting their way out of a robbery that the money they stole was fake, money they planned to retire on. Not only that, but it was also a set-up and Pike's old partner Deke (Robert Ryan) has been hired to go after them. They flee to Mexico where they strike a deal with a general named Mapache to steal numerous guns and ammo in exchange for the money they need to finally call it quits. This involves the second big sequence, a train heist, where the outlaws lift the weapons right from under the noses of Deke and his pathetic "army."It sounds like classic Western, but the execution is far from it. These outlaws, despite our rooting for them most of the time, are far from exemplary heroes. They demand their pick of women when lodging in Mexico and they get drunk and careless. An unspoken code of conduct between them seems to be the only guiding principle they have.Then there's the laughing. Somewhere from 6 to 10 scenes end in over-the-top male laughter. This recurring "symbol" of laughter represents "The Wild Bunch" accurately: It grows tedious and seems quite pointless, but by the time that last laugh graces the screen -- perfection. The ending is a powerful closing statement that turns "The Wild Bunch" from a simple R-rated Western to arguable masterpiece. Rarely does a conclusion make a film like this one does. Where does one rank a film in cinema history that passes for enjoyable during the process but impresses in hindsight? Most films drop hints of greatness along the way, but the end glues "The Wild Bunch" together. Before the climactic ending, only a couple superb and satisfying bloody action scenes (with a heck of a lot of cuts for a film made in the pre-digital era) are worth celebrating. With a wider lens, however, few films did their part better to challenge the Western genre better than "The Wild Bunch."~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Bravo to Walt Disney Co. for having the guts and brains to make fun of itself and then go ahead and make lots of money off of it. This is a really fun comedy that combines both the magic of Disney pre-21st century with a 21st century sense of humor. It's also not too heavy on any one of the things it tries to be: it's not too musical-heavy, romance-heavy or joke- heavy--it really caters to all ages and both genders (though girls are more likely to appeal to it at first). This is one of the first things Disney has done in awhile (other than stay with Pixar) that deserves applause."Enchanted" is a live action/animated mix that attempts to show what happens when Disney's animated "happily ever after" world collides with modern-day "never happy" New York. It's a clever concept that unlocks a mostly fresh set of jokes to be made. Combine that with a few first-rate songs written by Disney master Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, the genius behind "Wicked," and you have something special. Giselle is a typical "Disney Princess" from animated land Andalasia looking for her true love who is Prince Edward. The evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) of course wants them never to be happy and banishes Giselle to New York where she is played by Amy Adams. Edward (James Marsden) goes after her as does Narissa's squire Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) and a chipmunk named Pip. Giselle is discovered by a divorce attorney played by Patrick Dempsey who has some relationship issues of his own and both our way of life and Giselle's love-filled naive way of life clash.Amy Adams is the far and away standout of the film, though Dempsey does do well as your pretty standard "i don't believe in fairy tales" kind of guy. Adams convinces you so easily she's from an animated world. Marsden does this well too, but Adams runs away with your affections. Her characterization never cracks and she beautifully shows us her character's inner transformation as she falls for Dempsey and subsequently our world. Her skill makes a pretty cheesy romantic-comedy plot seem special and different.This is a really feel-good, fun story that even though it plays out like any fairytale formula, still works and doesn't turn you off to enjoying the end. It is a very clear-cut we learn how to believe in love more and the fairytale characters learn to be more realistic and that both can live in harmony...all that good stuff. It's just a really positive way to spend 100 minutes.
You would have thought somewhere along the line that George Lucas would have run out of ideas for moving vehicle chase/fight scenes, that the characters other than Jones would eventually get flat and boring, or that Steven Spielberg's style would feel repetitive and not as exciting at some point, but no, they're just as good as ever if not more refined in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."In the third installment, Indiana finds himself fending off the Nazis yet again, except this time it is because they've kidnapped his father, Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery) in order to obtain Jones Sr.'s diary on the holy grail, the study of which Jones Sr. devoted his entire life. The film is a quest to foil Nazi plans to get a hold of the grail to obtain eternal life and Indy must stop them in addition to save his father with whom his relationship is poor.Unlike "Temple of Doom," "Last Crusade" goes down the religious artifact path that "Raiders" used to launch Indiana Jones into the mainstream of iconic characters and great Hollywood films. While these films are more about the action and the humor and Harrison Ford anyway, at least unlike "Temple of Doom" the plot is not so absurd that it detracts from those elements to an extent.Connery as Jones' father adds another humorous aspect and depends Jones' character. More so than ever, we get a sense of who Indiana really is, not merely what he does and why he does it. The opening scene with River Phoenix as young Indy is not only clever but truly telling of the famous hero.The action sequences, Ford's persona, and the cleverness of it all never disappoint and for that to happen in the third installment of a series is simply outstanding. Indiana Jones will forever define adventure and the series' imprint on Hollywood action film-making is solidified more than ever in "Last Crusade."
Coming-of-age stories come in all forms, though one would expect a New York City drug dealer at the height of hip-hop in the mid '90s to have already experienced a loss of innocence. For Luke Shapiro (Josh Peck), however, dealing pot is just a summer job, and for all his street cred, he's a lonely dude unexperienced in the ways of love.Jonathan Levine's "The Wackness" tells that typical story of a last summer before college, but clichés don't run wild thanks to a re-calibrated the moral compass. Something's off with each of his three main characters; they're not the most likable or at the least morally sound, which provides a challenge for the actors in terms of generating sympathy.Sir Ben Kingsley seems to really enjoy that challenge. He plays Dr. Squires, Luke's shrink whom Luke pays in pot. Unconventional doesn't quite describe Squires; everything about Kingsley's performance feels unpredictable and spontaneous, but deeply rooted in a mid-life crisis. He projects a desire to be in Luke's place in the way he offers advice, which sometimes is misguided and sometimes spot-on. Both, however, share loneliness at different stages in life and therefore become friends.As much as Dr. Squires urges Luke to sow his oats, however, he also wants Luke to stay away from his step daughter Stephanie (Olivia Thirlby) for unclear but certainly hypocritical reasons. A popular girl with inattentive parents, Stephanie's well-versed in many things, including boys, but she takes interest in Luke's charms. Their relationship doesn't necessarily feel right in the fairy tale sense, but it does feel true-to-life because more often than not, there's a discrepancy in the amount of life experience two people have, especially at 18.This dictates the essence of Levine's message, though one wrapped in a complicated shell built of excessive drug use and morally misguided activities. For Levine, coming of age is about accumulating experience, both positive and negative, the "dopeness" and the "wackness" as Stephanie tells Luke. The challenge is finding the right perspective, not unlike the perspective with which we need to view some of the characters and their questionable activities in order to appreciate the film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Any good film, book, essay or song has a grabber that catches your attention and hooks you through the rest of that work. "Speed" is a two-hour grabber. It is the consummate thrill-a- minute movie, the kind where all sins of bad acting and preposterous events are forgiven because the action and suspense are like a wild concoction of sugar and crack. This action movie will bring out the adrenaline junkie in just about anybody.Far from perfect or even basically intelligent, "Speed" is about exciting as movies get. After an "eccentric" old man (Dennis Hopper) rigs a crowded elevator with explosives to collect a ransom, two LAPD cops, Jack and Harry (Reeves and Daniels), stop him, but he gets away. Days later, he rigs a public bus with a bomb. Once the bus travels 50 mph the bomb will arm. If it drops below that mark, it will explode. To make things more thrilling, he drags Jack into the crisis.Writer Graham Yost toys with us like a cat with a ball of yarn. Everything that could go wrong does go wrong. Yost hurls all kinds of unforeseeable problems at Jack and the rest of the characters. He must've sat down and made a list entitled "things that can go wrong when you're on a bus that can't slow down." It sounds sort of elementary, but it's actually clever. He strings them together effortlessly as if they were dominoes as opposed to separate plot points. Either way, it's better than the alternative of "how many times they can narrowly escape the inescapable," but there's some of that too.Unfortunately, if there were a Razzie for Worst Performance by an Ensemble, "Speed" would be up for the award. It doesn't say much for Keanu Reeves when his best quality as an actor is being stoic. If he cried at a real family member's funeral I'd probably think he was faking it. It works for "Speed" however because he's the on guy not freaking out and in control -- well, except for one notable three-year-old temper tantrum. Co-star Sandra Bullock in one of her earlier roles is annoying, setting a precedent for much of her career. Even Dennis Hopper takes a bit to become a convincing nutjob. Then again, it's all easily overlooked in a film as breakneck as "Speed."Eternally engaging, suspenseful and cleverly constructed, "Speed" is a bar-setting action film. No other movie will be able to go near the stay-moving singular vehicle hostage action movie without bringing "Speed" to mind. It's a category of its own, a heck of an action cocktail that will leave you punch drunk to the point where just about any line of dialog is a keeper.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Cold War paranoia meets 80s computer geekdom in "War Games," a story about a high school boy named David Lightman (Matthew Broderick in his first major film) who unknowingly hacks into a computer that simulates possible nuclear war strategies with Russia and appears to have actually convinced the US military that an attack is imminent. While it might be dated "War Games" struggles with its preposterous premise and execution of suspense that borders on laughable. At the same time it's a light, easy movie (a rarity as far as Cold War dramas go) and for those who remember their 5 and 1/2 floppy days it's a nostalgic one.The movie should be commended most for putting the young Broderick in the spotlight. He's a protagonist that's easy to love with his goofy disposition and devious ways. This is without a doubt the film that landed him his career-soaring role in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" a few years later. His co-star and eventual "Breakfast Club" star Ally Sheedy plays Jennifer, the friend-turned-love-interest that gets caught up in what happens because she and David hacked into the school computer to change their biology grades. Silly is the best way to describe what Sheedy makes her character and maybe that's why she and Broderick have good chemistry.The film's biggest problem is the other end with the military/nuclear war side. The adult characters aren't particularly likable and the actors play their roles pretty seriously. If the premise were more believable, maybe their performances would be more convincing, but instead it just looks like there's something off. The movie also starts for a good 15 or so minutes focusing just on the military side. We don't even meet David first. That doesn't make sense. If a kid gets-in-too-deep story is going to work, we need to identify with the kid first.It seems then that the computer gadget factor was what the creators relied on with this movie, which doesn't really work outside of the 80s. There's only so much excitement a giant white box with a black screen and white writing can bring to a movie after the mid-90s. While hacking is still a prevalent thriller movie tactic, finding passwords like David does is unimpressive. The nostalgic factor is there for a few laughs, but it's not attention-getting like it might have been."War Games'" success today is merely because of cult status. It's pretty straightforward and fun to watch, but not a bone in your body will take it too seriously or care. It just doesn't deliver any tangible suspense.
Good day, democratic imbeciles. You first knew him as a Kazakh news reporter, then as an Austrian fashionista. Now, dedicated character comedian Sacha Baron Cohen plays a North African fascist in "The Dictator". The journey of Admiral General Aladeen is unlike his predecessors in that it's not done in a mockumentary style. So, how does this change the actor's shtick?The use of a traditional story (and those words aren't being used lightly  it's cookie-cutter) attempts to mainstream Cohen's brand of humor, whether that was a conscious choice or not. The pop-culture references are a bit more frequent, the potty humor dialed up and the shock gags not as inspired as say, two grown men wrestling naked and chasing each other through a hotel. All the same, Cohen's trademarks are still there, from ignorance-based jokes to thoughtful satire.The writing team that assisted Cohen with the screenplay consists of three "Curb Your Enthusiasm" writers, one of which is Jeff Schaffer, who wrote "Bruno." These folks are all familiar with a looser narrative style, in which the story builds around the jokes. Even director Larry Charles (producer on "Curb"), who did "Bruno" and "Borat," has essentially no typical storytelling experience. As with any film with a plot simply meant to string together a necklace of gags, the individual jokes are forced to carry the film and the results are hit and miss.Aladeen is a great deal more unpredictable than Cohen's previous characters. You never know if you're going to get the poor idiot routine a la "Borat" or the strong-willed dictator used to getting his way. It keeps you on your toes, but feels less complete and ultimately less lovable. It also doesn't help that the plot has him trying to thwart his brother's (Ben Kingsley) plan to turn Wadiya into a democracy. That said, Cohen most definitely wants make you feel uncomfortable rooting for a character who yearns to oppress his people once again.Capped off by a simple yet brilliant speech about all the things America could do if it were a dictatorship, Cohen's commentary hits some strong notes during the film, even if it doesn't compare to the eye-opening methods of his first two, especially "Borat." For the most part, however, the script focuses on making sure no minority loses out on some form of a jab.Yet for all the genuinely creative jokes, like a misinterpreted helicopter ride over New York City, "The Dictator" relies a bit too much on sight gags, like a man yanked out of a bathroom mid-urination or the milking of a woman's breasts. It's just stupider than "Borat" and "Bruno", and with that track record in mind, you're just kind of stunned when an obvious attempt to get laughs draws silence. Fortunately the hits outweigh the misses, but when your story isn't all that interesting, the misses start to stand out.Given the array of recognizable cast members, "The Dictator" is also much more of an ensemble effort, but it is definitely Cohen's show. The casting of Kingsley proves wasteful unless it was to make the point that Kingsley can play any race or religion, but his collaboration with Cohen on "Hugo" is the likely explanation. Anna Faris tries to add some heart as a semi-butch super-organic shop owner, but she's drastically underutilized for someone as funny as she has proved to be. The biggest supporting highlights come courtesy Jason Mantzoukas (Rafi on FX's The League), who plays the perfect foil to Cohen because he's given every opportunity to call Aladeen out on his stupidity.Unsurprisingly, the bar Cohen set with "Borat" will sour people on "The Dictator". You want to walk out of one of his comedies feeling challenged and pushed further than you ever expected (in terms of entertainment), whereas the tone of "The Dictator" is clever, but resonates as mostly silly.As far as the "traditional comedy" experiment goes, next time (assuming there is one) Cohen and Charles should try working with a story structure at least resembling more of a mockumentary, evendare I sayfound footage. It does not have to go back down the road of roping in real people, but Cohen benefits from that touch of realism.The results of attempting to translate Cohen's style to the rise-and-fall format suggest that his brand of comedy needs more space to breathe. The sketches and bits need time to develop organically, without an obligation to a through plot line. Fortunately, there's enough successful humor here to see Cohen through until the next ridiculous character.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
The recent trend of comedies centered on experimental relationships continues with "Friends with Kids," which explores what happens when longtime best friends who both want kids decide to have a baby to avoid the complications raising children has on romantic relationships. It seems like a Hollywood-typical setup, but writer, director and star Jennifer Westfeldt ("Kissing Jessica Stein") gives it a genuine treatment that steers clear of the farcical direction these comedies so easily (and often) give in to.Julie (Westfeldt) and Jason (Adam Scott) have been best friends since college who are happily single. Their other college friends, played by the "Bridesmaids" crew of Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd, Jon Hamm and Kristen Wiig, are married and most recently, having kids. Over time, they observe the toll having kids has taken on their friends relationships, and decide the want to avoid that at all costs. Together, they conceive their plan to raise a child under joint custody and continue to pursue romantic relationships with other people.At first, this concept is a tough sell. The chemistry between Westfeldt and Scott is palpable enough that you don't believe it when they say they're not attracted to one another. And maybe there's a lingering sense that Westfeldt wanted this to be obvious as if to say they're forcing themselves to pretend not to have feelings for one another, but it still doesn't feel like it makes sense. After little Joe is born, however, the situation starts to feel possible and even real.Westfeldt is savvy enough of a writer to recognize that these experimental relationship comedies  be they friends with benefits or some other arrangement  all have an obvious trajectory: the main characters realize they have feelings for each other and fall in love. Rather than mess with this inevitability, she embraces it, but at the same time lets it happen in a more authentic fashion, largely due to the well-rounded nature of her characters.The character she plays, Julie, has a certain humility and a soft-spoken nature and while she's emotional, it's not in some cliché, up-and-down manner that we generally get from main female leads in these situations. Scott is supposed to be more of the comedian; Jason can't stay in a relationship more than a few months and lacks the ability to restrain the dirty thoughts in his head from leaking out his mouth, even in the worst settings. At the same time, he's not a jerk, but rather honest and caring.To further explore whether this experiment can work, Westfeldt uses the couples played by Rudolph and O'Down and Hamm and Wiig as comparison points. Rudolph and O'Dowd's Leslie and Alex have lost their intimacy as a result of kids and Hamm and Wiig's Ben and Missy become increasingly frustrated with each other. Then, Westfeldt has all these characters judging and commenting on each other. In doing so, she successfully communicates the idea that there's no easy or perfect way to raise a child, that no one's necessarily wrong.Edward Burns and Megan Fox, who play the love interests of Julie and Jason post-having a baby, also add a whole other layer of perspective to the situation. Even if it this arrangement works for Julie and Jason, how does it effect the people they date? None of the characters in the film are superfluous or unnecessary, they all offer some insight into the story; even the brief appearances by Julie and Jason's parents bring something to the conversation.As sincere a vision a Westfeldt tells her story with, however, not even she can completely write around the predictability of her story, and at times the plot pulls in that fated direction too quickly and some elements feel rushed away or overlooked. Fortunately, our attachment to and the likability of Jason and Julie help to push through what we might be more skeptical of in a lesser Hollywood comedy."Friends with Kids" will likely come as close to a legitimate imagining of what happens when people try these non-conforming relationships as we're ever likely to get. It's warm, naturally humorous and unafraid to delve into more serious, dramatic territory, and it has the the cast capable of such versatility, a fact that should not be understated when you consider most of them are known for being comedy actors.As for Westfeldt, she might not be a prolific filmmaker like her biggest inspiration, Woody Allen, but when she has something, she delivers. "Friends with Kids" is something that will resonate with people who closely identify with the characters, who see themselves in or having done that "everyone's married and having babies" phase of life. Everyone else could still learn a thing or two and be entertained as well.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
Christopher Guest has quite the resume and reputation for his quirky, awkward satirical mockumentaries, but "For Your Consideration" simply doesn't measure up with the rest.It's hard not to judge "Consideration" by its predecessors such as "Best in Show" and "A Mighty Wind." With the same cast, the same satirical (though not full out mockumentary) style, it simply asks for that and it doesn't succeed the way those movies do. The premise of "Consideration" is on the set of a movie (a ridiculous) movie and the overblown Oscar hype that the film gets. The film contains everyone from the actors to the producer in the cast, as well as a couple Hollywood-focused TV show hosts. The characters are still quirky and amusing in a subtle way, yet something is off. Their depth and the interest in what is happening to them is non-existent and it makes it harder to laugh at the them in the long run and considering characters tend to drive Guest's films, that makes it tough from the get-go.The plot is simply not as intriguing as well. This perhaps lies in the fact that the focus is not on something obscure like dog shows or traveling folk musicians, but instead on basic Hollywood, which offers less genuine interest in subject alone. Compound that with the weak characters and you have a huge Guest disappointment.
It's not unfair initially to dismiss "The Day the Earth Stood Still" as sci-fi pulp from an era full of it, but the film's anti-war message given the Cold War context it was released in makes it nothing short of a classic. Its commercial exterior featuring posters with Gort the space robot pales in comparison to the social/diplomatic values it preaches at its core. Sure, it's not all that suspenseful or riveting for science-fiction, but it represents one of the first pop culture films to reflect important moral values.Borrowing from the lucrative UFO alien movies before it, TDTESS begins with a flying saucer landing in the Washington mall and producing an alien with a human appearance named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) and his robot protector Gort, a goofy-looking man in a shiny suit with the ability to disintegrate anything with a beam from his eye. For starters, Klaatu is greeted by military bullets that destroy a gift he intended for the president that would give us the ability to study life on other planets. That's the example of the strict satirical tone taken by writer Edmund H. North (based on the short story by Harry Bates).Despite humorous special effects and the cheesy running and screaming you see in pulp alien invasion movies, TDTESS manages to expose many of our flaws including our fear of the unknown and our propensity to resort to violence. It warns of the dangers of nuclear energy and outwardly scorns war. In the beginning years of the Cold War, such a message getting out to the public is an accomplishment that must be lauded.TDTESS isn't only good for its messages, though it certainly is what makes the film stand out. Rennie is a terrific Klaatu. He's intriguing, friendly but also very frank, winning our sympathies but still convincing us of his other-worldly nature. The relationship he develops with the young Bobby Benson (Billy Gray) is the film's most interesting subplot next to Klaatu helping a scientist out with an equation that will lead to interplanetary travel.Rarely does a film become a classic solely because of its message, but TDTESS certainly does. It's so frank, but speaks such an undeniable truth that in the form of cheaply made science- fiction, resonates in a way that straighter films can't. That's the beauty of the genre and why TDTESS is its first classic. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
"Rain Man" might be most remembered for Dustin Hoffman's brave and remarkable performance as autistic savant Raymond Babbitt, but the film's greatest strength lies elsewhere: its sense of humor. At first, you're inclined not to laugh at Raymond's oddities and especially not at the way his brother Charlie (Tom Cruise) treats him, but as the film progresses, you become less worried about being respectful and suddenly "Rain Man" is really just a film about two brothers on the road together, sometimes sharing funny moments, sometimes sharing tough ones -- but who discover something about themselves through their newfound relationship."Diner " director Barry Levinson, who has always carried his sense of humor about him in all his projects, is responsible for much of this tone to what is a challenging story. Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow do write in some humor, but when summarized, this film does not have a pleasant story line. It's about a young man who's angry that his father left him nothing upon his death, finds out it all went to an autistic brother he never knew he had and in his rage, as sort of a ransom, kidnaps his brother and heads for L.A. Cruise plays an unlikable yuppie with no patience or sympathy for his brother's condition. He's entirely selfish and blinded by deep-seated father issues having grown up without a mother and leaving his father after a dispute at age 16. It's a good role for Cruise, having played rebellious younger characters in "Top Gun" and "Risky Business" at this point in his career, it was a good fit that smoothly transitioned him into a more dramatic role, establishing him as more than just the latest fashion. Charlie's change is the most significant in the film, and though it's hard to believe he's not being selfish about Ray from beginning to end, it's the transformation in his sense of humor that really sells us. At first he's funny because of how he overreacts to his frustrations in taking care of Ray, but once he understands him, it becomes sweet and genial.Raymond is Hoffman at his finest, maybe the height of his career after "Kramer vs. Kramer" and "Tootsie." Playing the mentally challenged is done so little because it's such a difficult thing and a touchy subject that Hoffman had to have handled with incredible sensitivity as he was developing the character. The real genius in his acting is in his eyes. You can always tell he's counting or paying attention to details and he's mesmerized by the world around him. That sort of guides how he interacts with the characters. Levinson picks up on this and subsequently gets a lot of scenic footage, namely Las Vegas where Raymond is fascinated by everything that sparkles.The troublesome part of the story is that it glamorizes Ray's savant abilities and at one point takes advantage of them with little remorse. At the same time, it's clear that despite the opportunities for "Rain Man" to just lay on the sap, Levinson wants it to feel real. Even Hans Zimmer (in his first score) was forced to keep the score electronic '80s style, which while awful is a distinct choice in tone. In real life, Charlie probably wouldn't treat his brother all that much better, he would just appreciate him differently. This is not about changing one's life forever, its about the experience and rewards of brotherhood. All the way to the ending, there's not but a brief moment that would make you want to cry, just be happy that the characters both got something positive out of the experience.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Sports movies have always been preoccupied with what's happening on the field, the court or what have you. They tell stories of underdogs defying the odds and champion values of honor, courage and determination. "Moneyball" peels back that obvious first layer yet achieves all those very same ends. The sport of baseball is essential to this story, but the story isn't dependent on baseball. Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) faced a debacle after his team lost the 2001 ALDS after being up on the New York Yankees, a team with three times the payroll. His star players, Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen, were all free agents that the team would never be able to resign. Knowing that fans and the owner would expect another winning season, Beane turned to a young man named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an expert in sabermetrics, or boiling down statistics to evaluate players' value rather the traditional scouting techniques and intuition. Together, Beane and Brand scraped together a team of undervalued players and made an improbable run at a pennant.Foremost, "Moneyball" tells Beane's story and the emotional ups and downs of trying to change the game. He didn't care about championships or winning in the figurative sense, but about changing the game so that smaller teams would no longer be "organ donors" for wealthy clubs like the Yankees. Pitt continues to impress with his comedic abilities as Beane, playing him not all that dissimilar from Lt. Aldo Raine ("Inglourious Basterds") in terms of charisma and humor, but obviously Beane is a much more believable and compelling character.Hill works as a terrific compliment, going for understatement and never so much as attempting to take any comedic reigns. He opts instead to wait for and pick his moments and then nails them. Whatever ounces of humor veteran writers Steve Zaillan and Aaron Sorkin's screenplay chooses to toss at us, none of it falls flat, especially thanks to the splendid delivery of Pitt and Hill.Baseball has a key role in the film and fans of the sport will enjoy the feeling of being behind- the-scenes, but "Moneyball" never gets lost in a preoccupation with the outcome of the games and whether the A's win or lose. Natural curiosity will be there for those unfamiliar with their early 2000s baseball history, but the story generates much more interest in how losing or winning will impact Beane. Devout baseball fans are used to only media portrayals of GMs that consist of either great praise or blame for the level of talent on the field, so this narrative perspective wherein Beane is a protagonist we actually like constitutes a drastic change. The underdog team element that permeates most sports movies exists in small doses in "Moneyball." Director Bennett Miller shows us just enough in-game action to raise the stakes and improve the suspense  no more, no less. The players depicted in the film, such as Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt), David Justice (Stephen Bishop) and Chad Bradford (Casey Bond), are supporting characters that enhance the story on the periphery instead of through needless subplots. We still feel what's at stake for them and appreciate the "second chance" of sorts that Beane has given them. Philip Seymour Hoffman as disgruntled A's manager Art Howe shows the unflattering side of coaches and serves as an effective roadblock on Beane's road to success.If anything, there's a bit of a disconnect in the film between the philosophy of what Beane and Brand did and how it actually translated into success. There's talk of taking more pitches and montage scenes of Beane and Brand coaching the players to an extent, but we're asked to take the film's word for it that the theory was in fact responsible for the on-field results. In the end it just limits the magnitude of the accomplishment. Instead of measuring our satisfaction on the success of the entire team, we measure it on whether Beane is happy or sad."Moneyball" amounts to insightful, character-driven drama with a lighthearted sense of humor  a refreshing departure from most baseball or sports films period. One game gets the reenactment treatment, but otherwise no genre clichés hang around in hopes of being used as a feel-good safety net. "Moneyball" spreads the sports message that all those sports values of courage and risk-taking still mean something even if they don't culminate in a scene utilizing uplifting music and slow-motion celebrations. ~Steven CVisit my site, moviemusereviews.com!
There's no denying that "Precious: Based on the Novel "Push" by Sapphire" is a tough film. The harrowing story of an overweight illiterate 16-year-old girl pregnant by her father for the second time and living with her abusive mother is not the fare most of us go to the theaters for. But sometimes we need a more eye-opening film experience to jar us from the comforts of eye candy action/adventures and Jello pudding romantic comedies. "Precious" is one of those films worthy of enduring. Director Lee Daniels, in his second effort from behind the camera, is privy to the troubling nature of his film and he adds a subtle layer of beauty and comedy that lifts "Precious" above other social issue dramas that bury themselves in conflict and strife. It makes the story of Clareeice "Precious" Jones seem undeniably like non-fiction when it in fact is not.A teenager with all the problems mentioned above, Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) lives in Harlem in 1987 and has been suspended from school because of her second pregnancy. The principal recommends an alternative school that will teach her to read and get her GED. She hesitates because after all, her mother (TV comedienne Mo'Nique) tells her she's useless, should've been aborted and that there's no sense in anyone teaching anything to a girl too dumb to learn.Precious believes all these things about herself and to make herself feel better, whenever she doesn't want to confront her issues, she fantasizes about being a movie star or a famous singer with a light-skinned boyfriend. Geoffrey Fletcher's excellent script gives us all these fantasies and daydreams (like Precious seeing her and her mother getting along in the Italian movie they watch on TV) along with all the flashbacks to traumatic events as well. These scenes are where Daniels gets to use his artistic flair to lighten up the film and show us more abstract ways to think about this difficult story.The film follows Precious' growth as her new class, classmates and teacher (Paula Patton) help her find a meaningful relationships and sense of family and community as well as give her the valuable skills of reading and writing that she can use to carve out her own life.Everything you've heard about Mo'Nique's performance as the mother is true. Her character is a wrecking ball and her performance swings that ball in an emotionally devastating manner. The way she treats her daughter while all she does is watch "$100,000 Pyramid" and collect welfare checks that she obtains deceitfully is enough to make anyone's blood curdle. But playing a horrible person alone doesn't make you Oscar-worthy. I don't know how on earth she's able to take this monster and squeeze a confession out of her that's so strikingly real and nearly pitiable, but she does. Her psychology of Mary is so complete that although you won't forgive her, you certainly understand."Precious" is worth the more unsettling film experience. It's not a story with a happy ending, but it shows that no one is a prisoner of her own circumstances. That anyone, as long as they seek out some form of help, can take that first step toward changing her life or at least feel comfortable if not proud of who they are. At first, Precious sees a pretty white girl when she looks in the mirror. By the end, she sees who she is meant to be. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Created by J.J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg. That phrase says a lot. As more and more clues were revealed as to Abrams second secret film project, the mere presence of these two respected names began to connect dots in the minds of film fans. The first teaser  made before the film even began casting  implied aliens. No surprise there with Abrams' viral marketing hit "Cloverfield" and Spielberg's classic, "E.T." Yet the connection between those two films only grew as more information came out about "Super 8." A Super Bowl TV spot revealed child main characters in a late '70s setting, only a few years off from the actual release of "E.T.," and the presence of a mysterious monster evoked "Cloverfield." Does "Super 8" burst with so much originality as to end those comparisons? No, but Abrams continues to prove he knows how to entertain an audience.To appropriately continue the juxtaposition, "Super 8" ultimately works as a scarier "E.T." for adults. To drop another Spielberg film into the mix, the monster attacks feel a lot like "Jurassic Park" although the monster itself possesses the same mystique as that of "Cloverfield." Yet alien/monster film is just one piece of the movie's identity. In all other senses, "Super 8" serves as a period piece, a look back at what it was like to be a kid growing up in the Midwest in 1979. The creature feature part helps bring life to the imagination of the main characters and turn that era into a tall tale setting of sorts.For Abrams, who would have been 13 in the summer of '79, this project is clearly personal. You cannot divorce the filmmaker from the film in this instance. He was undoubtedly one of the kids out there making movies on his Super 8 camera and the plot of this movie enacts a fantasy of his to some extent; what it would be like to actually capture footage of the events he once so desperately tried to create in his own home-spun features.The story follows Joe (Joel Courtney), who loses his mother in a construction accident a few months before the events of the film. He's a dedicated friend and make up artist to young filmmaker Charles (Riley Griffiths), who's making a movie on his Super 8 to enter into some Ohio film festival competition. Charles wants to film at a train station at midnight and he convinces his usual cast and crew of friends to indulge him, as well as Alice (Elle Fanning), who Joe becomes smitten with even before she arrives. While filming, a freight train comes by and suddenly a truck zooms onto the tracks and derails it. After narrowly escaping certain death, the truck driver warns them not to say a word of what happened, which gets tougher and tougher in the coming days as people, pets and electronic appliances disappear."Super 8" could've been a drama about kids with big imaginations making movies to avoid dealing with the harsh realities of their family lives  it might have even been better that way  but the big alien in the room quickly changes that. At times, the switch between coming- of-age story and sci-fi horror feels jarring, but both elements exhibit excellent craftsmanship independent of one another. Abrams simply doesn't sew them up into the most seamless of quilts.But maybe he doesn't need to. "Super 8" has a surprising amount of humor, a bit of effective suspense, cool action sequences (if you can brush aside the preposterousness of the inciting train derailment), realistic family drama and a few touching moments as well. Those are all winning ingredients, obviously, and "Super 8" is a worthwhile watch because of them, but a large through-line seems to be missing. Abrams' concept always held more weight than his story, and though the integration entertains completely, the transformation from concept to film was not as heavily scrutinized as it might in a project that's not its filmmaker's brain child.There's a slight air of disappointment, if for no other reason than because of the mammoth secret that Abrams kept from us and the reveal not being mind-numbing. Although "Super 8" remained a mystery up until its release, the plot itself has a much harder time remaining mysterious throughout the film. Once the kids uncover information of the monster's origin, the film loses all steam from a "figure it out" perspective and "Super 8" enters the realm of predictability, which you don't expect when you go see a film kept so tightly under lock and key.Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment logo and Abrams' Bad Robot stamp certainly suggest greatness, but better to realize that those talents imply a certain reliability more so than than ground-breaking cinema. Spielberg broke his ground; now he's producing "Transformers" and bad "Indiana Jones" sequels. Abrams has always been more of a television pioneer and did this once before with "Cloverfield." As such, "Super 8" is a film you can depend on for entertainment, one that's a product of successful films of the past, not a game changer that will move us into a new era of "top secret" filmmaking.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Apatow Productions had a terrific 2007 and then "Walk Hard" happened. At least they know it--$35 M budget and a total gross of less than $20 M. While the musical biopic parody is an idea that certainly among other parody options is fitting for this decade, Apatow productions learned that success will come with originality. That and not to a release a film like this at Christmas time."Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story" stars John C. Reilly in an hour and a half romp through his life as a musician beginning in the 1950s. Spoofing all other music biopics, Cox finds his way into love affairs, drugs and much much more. A lot of the parody jokes get overplayed and redundant, but some are definitely spot on. It definitely feels like an Apatow script, only this time with director/writer and friend of Apatow's Jake Kasden getting his say."Walk Hard" is star-studded. There are an unbelievable amount of cameos from Apatow's trademark crew as well as stars from Saturday Night Live and others not usually in his movies that make an appearance in the film. The amount of familiar faces makes the film seem incredibly over-produced and some of the shortest scenes appear to have an unnecessary amount of money put into them.The film does have more humor in many respects than "Talladega Nights," but by no means comes close to matching up with "Knocked Up" and "Superbad." While those two films are somewhat more poignant and true-to-life, "Walk Hard" relies excessively on ridiculousness to be funny, more so than any of the Apatow predecessors.In short, "Walk Hard" is funny and at times clever, but mostly just over-the-top and dumb. Every turn is a left turn and while many are applaudable, some are just downright weird.
"The Italian Job" is a great getaway film and we're not just talking about robbery getaways. This movie never bores and is solely focused on action, technology and crime strategy lore, moving along at a brisk pace and giving the bare amount of drama to provide fuel for its characters and story line. It's a 110 minute vacation that has all its bases covered, delivering a smooth ride with little to no chinks. While it may be a remake that doesn't really improve on the original, it successfully defines itself in a modern context as a fun heist flick.The film takes us straight to Italy for a job being done by well-acquainted accomplices. There's the mastermind John (Donald Sutherland), his protégé Charlie (Mark Wahlberg), the odd explosives expert named Left Ear (Mos Def), the trying-to-be-cool hacker (Seth Green), the lady's man driving expert Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) and the inside guy (Edward Norton). This is a pretty good ensemble with a wide array of talents. Wahlberg doesn't carry this film and that's how it should be. It's a very "Ocean's Eleven" style formula, but director F. Gary Gray gives this film its own more relaxed vibe, limiting the comparisons.The job is successful, but after the getaway, Norton's character goes rogue and takes the loot for himself. He retreats to California and the guys plan to get it back, with the help of Charlize Theron. The rest of the film they devise their plans and execute them, with the script incorporating character development into those scenes. Still, it's not particularly dialogue heavy and no moments ever lag.This is not a very flashy heist film like "Ocean's Eleven." The action and car chases are much more subdued, with little gunfire and no extravagant crashes or explosions. It's not going to wow you, unless you're a 30-year-old single woman who loves Mini Coopers, but it's definitely creative. The elements of the heist will interest you if you're into that whole crime strategy stuff, though there's no unforeseeable twists. Best of all, the drama is minimal and not distracting from the film's objective of pure entertainment.So "Italian Job" doesn't exactly raise the bar with action/heist films, but it understands the genre and knows how to deliver it the right way, providing exactly the kind of entertainment one would expect watching this kind of film.
The horror genre clings onto and feeds off of audience expectations. From a fan perspective, horror-lovers tend to flock to films that appear as if they will evoke the feelings of previous successes, even to the point of supporting blatant mimicry. From a filmmaking perspective, a horror director's go-to card is expectationthe audience recognizing those classic audio and visual clues that create the anticipation of a scare.The entire horror genre is built on the foundation of what we think will happen, so when "The Cabin in the Woods" comes along and utilizes these expectations while also blowing the roof completely off them, it makes for a wildly entertaining success.Sure, some folks will want a run-of-the-mill "cabin in the woods" story, the one we've seen a thousand times thanks to paragons "Friday the 13th" and "The Evil Dead" among others. "The Cabin in the Woods" might let down those purists who rank the scare factor as top priority, but for fans of parody and satire, this is a must-see.The minds behind the film suggest a certain intelligence you won't find in horror offerings from amateurs. Drew Goddard, writer of "Cloverfield" and on TV's "Lost," and Joss Whedon, one of the most revered names in geek culture, team up on a script that delivers a great deal of wit and at the same time a strong mystery, a combination that makes for an irrepressibly exciting movie."The Cabin in the Woods" requires a certain amount of aversion to spoilers in order to be fully enjoyed, though so many unsuspected twists crop up that a few details won't actually ruin anything. Essentially, five college kids head to a remote cabin for the weekend and predictably ignore some tell-tale signs that something's amiss. The catch is that despite seeing this setup before, we as an audience don't even quite know what's going on this time around. The fact that the film doesn't open on a cabin, woods, or college kids is your first hint.Perhaps the biggest surprise has nothing do with the plot: the young protagonists are somewhat likable and the actors portraying them have a good deal of talent. Nearly everyone will recognize Chris Hemsworth (Thor himself) as Curt, but the highlights are unknowns Kristen Connolly and Fran Kranz as Dana and Marty, one an attractive bookworm and the other a clever stoner. The characters fit your horror stereotypes, but each with a bit of a twist that makes them more respectable. Even the "dumb blonde" (Anna Hutchison) isn't that dumb as she cares about her friends. Heck, the fact that these five would all be friends is kind of a jab at stereotypes.Strong writing reinforces the fact that these are more developed characters and shows Goddard and Whedon recognize that even though the goal is to turn the genre upside down, their film still needs to do the things good horror films do right in order to succeed.Without giving anything away, the central idea behind the movie is basically to give a mythology to a typical horror story motif such as the cabin in the woods, to weave it together with a science-fiction yarn that allows us to look at the genre both with humor and a greater reverence."The Cabin in the Woods" provides pure entertainment of a brilliant sort, an absolute rarity in any genre, let alone horror. With some pitch-perfect casting in roles best kept a secret, Goddard and Whedon sell their twist with great effectiveness. In hindsight, the whole operation could have backfired had there been just the slightest reason not to stay interested or care about the characters.Anyone with a keen eye for or love of satire and a familiarity with the horror offerings being played off of will find themselves on the exact same page as Goddard throughout the film. Consequently, these folks will simply love "The Cabin in the Woods." It's one thing to poke fun at a genreanyone can do that, especially in horror. This movie does it without flopping into silly mindless spoof territory, instead entertaining us exactly as a traditional horror riff would.Although you won't see critical accolades because genre films get no love, "The Cabin in the Woods" will get its due when it appears on countless Best of 2012 listsunless more and more 2012 movies that aren't supposed to be this good soar beyond expectations.~Steven CThanks for reading!

A man who doesn't play by the law when it comes to delivering justice isn't an original idea for a main character, and Tom Cruise is far from an original action star, but somehow "Jack Reacher" doesn't suffer too much from being stale.Lee Child's book series appears to be a good fit for film by combining two traditional genres into one seemingly unique hybrid. "Jack Reacher" weaves together a traditional thriller structure with climactic points of physical, "Bourne"-like action. The heart of the story is a mystery, but its fuel is the brutal hand-to-hand combat sequences.Based on the Reacher novel titled "One Shot," the film centers on the horrific murder of a handful of civilians in Pittsburgh by sniper rifle. An ex-military sniper named James Barr (Joseph Sikora) has prints are all over the crime scene and the prosecutor's office believes it has an open-and-shut case. Instead of confessing, however, Barr tells them to "get Jack Reacher." The next day he is assaulted while in custody and beat into a coma.Reacher (Cruise) is also ex-military, investigating internal crimes. He's a drifter who never leaves a trail unless he wants to be found. And sure enough, he shows up at the D.A.'s office right on cue. He eventually strikes a deal with the attorney defending Barr's case, Helen (Rosamund Pike), who happens to be the D.A.'s daughter. He becomes her chief investigator and like that he's off gathering evidence, though he wants Barr to be guilty as much as anyone.We know from the film's excellently chilling opening sequence that Barr is not guilty and that a much younger man (Jai Courtney) actually shot those civilians and must have wanted to frame him for some reason. As the mystery unravels, Cruise as Reacher collects badass points by taking guys down at every turn until he finds the truth.Better thrillers with less obvious twists and more satisfying endings have definitely existed, and plenty of better action movies have graced the silver screen, with Cruise himself even starring in some of them. But "Reacher" still offers a satisfying watch for genre film fans.Reacher has a distinctive personality as a character. He has a sharp sense of humor that writer/director Christopher McQuarrie expertly translates (I assume), a man whose intelligence and no-nonsense animalistic side appear constantly at odds with one another. Some folks will become fans of the character very quickly, while others will at least be piqued. Cruise is normally an odd choice when you want someone imposing, but he add a foot to his height in his performance alone.McQuarrie makes an impressive directorial debut. The imagery and some of the storytelling devices elevate "Reacher" above your typical thriller. The quiet opening sequence plunges you right into the story and creates an emotional investment in wanting to know what happens, even if how it all happens isn't ultimately that satisfying. McQuarrie set his bar really high with his Oscar-winning screenplay for "The Usual Suspects" and his other projects haven't measured up, but he might have found a good vehicle for his talents. His rumored attachment as the next director of the "Mission: Impossible" franchise has my approval to be sure.It's Cruise's show, but Courtney shows potential as an action star and Pike proves why she needs to get better roles. Helen is a part that could've been played off as more of your typical "female criminal justice system person in over her head" character, but Pike blends a good deal of resolve in with her fear. She's no Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, but "Jack Reacher" is no "Silence of the Lambs."Although his screen time is comparable in terms of how little of it there is, Werner Herzog's villainous character is far from Hannibal Lecter too. It's fun seeing him in a creepy role like this, but he proves to be a waste, and Robert Duvall comes in late in the game too as a bizarre character that strikes me as someone from the book(s) McQuarrie wanted to include. The script wants to establish Reacher as someone who is not your typical hero, someone you don't always find yourself rooting for at every turn because some of his decisions are rash and frankly, not satisfying from an entertainment perspective. To do so, the film doesn't deliver certain satisfying conventions we associate with action films and thrillers, yet there's little doubt that fans of both genres will be curious to see if Reacher comes back to the screen in the near future.~Steven CThanks for reading!

It had been 12 years since John McClane (Bruce Willis) last stopped a criminal mastermind's mass terrorist plot and "Live Free or Die Hard" tries to make up for every single one of them. John drives three pedestrian cars, a police car, a mack truck and flies a helicopter; he survives at least three long-distance falls and outruns two or three explosions; he saves two lives (including someone close to him) and kills at least a dozen. Well, that last bit was at least expected.The long-awaited fourth Die Hard film delivers on the explosive and inventive action fronts like any solid action film, especially one in this beloved series, ought to. Director Len Wiseman ("Underworld") proves he can handle the challenge of a mainstream action flick with ease and considering "Live Free or Die Hard" teeters on the edge of preposterous throughout its run time, the fact that he grounds any of this in realism warrants applause.Mark Bomback and David Marconi's story runs terrifically at full speed, though it is fairly obvious that the script had to be tailored for the likes of John McClane. The cyber-terrorism plot of hackers controlling all the major networks and servers in the U.S. and playing with traffic signals and interfering with police communications is not the first premise that someone writing a film for an old school hero such as John McClane would conceive. I was not surprised to see Marconi's name on the story as the film was highly reminiscent of his 1998 thriller "Enemy of the State," one of the first of what are now way overdone "techno- thrillers." The story has McClane working for Homeland Security and investigating a hacker name Matt Ferrell (Justin Long) after it appears someone has messed with the department's network. Here is where John finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time yet again as someone's out to kill Ferrell. Much like Samuel L. Jackson's role in "Die Hard with a Vengeance," Long gets to be the baggage to play off of Willis and also provide some sense of freaking out seeing as McClane has no reason to do that anymore.Much of "Live Free" models itself off of "With a Vengeance," not necessarily a poor choice considering that film was equally as exciting as far as pacing and action quality. Timothy Olyphant as the criminal mastermind Thomas Gabriel at least has a bit more practical motivation for his crime than Jeremy Irons did as Simon Gruber. In this film, McClane finds himself in the mix rather than the actual target partly a byproduct of making this script a Die Hard film rather that building one from scratch.Olyphant is solid as a villain although it certainly takes a bit of time to take him seriously. Colorful villain is probably not his strong suit but its nice to see him in a lead. Long works well as a balancing act for Bruce. He's one of few in his circle of comedian buddies that appears to have what it takes to cross into other genres and both play the lead or a character role.At times, "Live Free" is like getting repeatedly hit by a car and not dying (which happens to at least two characters), but Wiseman clearly understands that McClane's character (and all the characters for that matter) is most important in a Die Hard film. You simply can't hinge everything on the action. No, the movie doesn't evolve John as a character in any way, but it doesn't suck him dry of his humanity either, even if he should've died at five different points in the film. Yet again, that's the Die Hard shtick, love it or leave it.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Before "Star Wars," George Lucas had another vision of the future, particularly in a long time from now in a galaxy that happens to be our own. "THX 1138" is his Distopia film, his "1984" or "Brave New World." It's directly inspired from those works, borrowing the ideas of drugs to sedate human emotion (Brave New World) and sex being illegal (1984). It's a visionary work, not a revolutionary one, but for the early 70s, it impresses. Lucas manages to bring his concept to life, even if it's not exactly as thrilling or interesting as what the Star Wars saga would be.THX 1139 (Robert Duvall) is an ideal member of this "utopian" community where religion means stay calm and do as you're told. When his roommate, LUH, begins to change out his sedatives with other pills, he begins to fall in love with her. Consequently, the "big brother" equivalent finds out, and THX is taken captive."THX" can be boring at times. Though you can tell Lucas has put a lot of thought into this world, he doesn't care to offer any help to those struggling to make sense of it. There is no clarification dialogue -- you have to pay close attention to the images and surroundings to understand it. This is admirable, but makes things difficult for most viewers. The film therefore drags at points not necessarily because what's going on isn't interesting, but the viewer is missing contextual help to illuminate the action on screen.Fans of the genre will appreciate Lucas' contribution and his imagination, but probably not love it. The themes are light and the drama low. There's no sense of danger or incredibly sympathy for the main characters. One thing to note is not to watch the Special Edition. As Lucas loves to do, the SE goes back and adds CGI to the film, which is a travesty. Part of what makes these movies so great is that they offer a vision of the future from the perspective of 30 years ago and today's technology doesn't interfere. Do your best to get a non-remastered copy.
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" had some pretty amazing competition for Best Picture at the 1995 Academy Awards: Robert Redford's "Quiz Show," Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction," "The Shawshank Redemption" and the winner, "Forrest Gump." To say the least, this little British comedy was way out of its league. As unorthodox and interesting of a romantic comedy as "Four Weddings" can be, the comparison stops there next to those all-time greats. But that's not to diminish the British talents that emerged with this film: director Mike Newell, star Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis, all of whom are held in high esteem today. Together, they put together a non-traditional, droll comedy with a unique approach that muses about love, life and marriage.The events of the film are indeed as described in the title. A group of friends with non- traditional and/or non-existent love lives attend various weddings of their other friends (and a funeral of course). The focus is Charles (Grant), a bit of a clumsy fellow trying to sort out his feelings on marriage having burned several past lovers as he could never commit. At the very first wedding of the film, Charles meets Carrie (MacDowell), an attractive, flirty and slightly domineering American who hooks him in. After a one-night stand, they find each other three months later at the next wedding, only it turns out Carrie is engaged.Curtis, creator of Rowan Atkinson's (who has a hysterical cameo) character "Bean," makes the better moments of this film with his Oscar-nominated screenplay. You can never completely get a pulse on the humor: one minute he's dry and the next more slapstick, but it works. The romantic subplots -- of which there are many -- could have used some work, but "Four Weddings" never feels typical. Curtis' construction of the story, though odd, keeps the film running at an amusing tempo. With the exception of Charles, no character receives a complete portrait, but each receives a strong attribute or context with which the actors can work. Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is a victim of unrequited love that tempers the wedding experience for her and Gareth (Simon Callow) has a joyful "everything's a laugh" mentality at weddings. We never see into who these characters really are, Curtis provides enough detail for them to feel real and to enhance the running dialogue about love that makes up the meat of the film. Ever since this film, Curtis ("Love, Actually" and "Bridget Jones' Diary") has specialized in the multi-character romance because he's adept at character design.The fact that "Four Weddings and a Funeral" tries to play in both dramatic romance and comedic romance prevents it from ever finding footing. Newell excels at directing both, but both don't exist in harmony in this case. The dramatic moments in particular hurt from lack of character depth and the comedic moments -- there aren't enough. The film is memorable, but the identity crisis keeps it out of the conversation of great romances.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
First there was Gollum, then Caesar the ape and now ... Ted? If you thought motion-capture animation was beyond the range of foul-mouthed R-rated comedy, here's your evidence to the contrary. "Family Guy" creator Seth MacFarlane has taken his love of characters who shouldn't behave like humans behaving like humans to the next level and the big screen  with "Ted," a story of growing up  at the age of 35.Fans of MacFarlane and "Family Guy" will be the first to tell you that the comedy pioneer has been more cold than hot lately (I guess those manatees in the tank of idea balls have been worked too hard). It's not easy to keep scoring laughs using the same non-sequitur formula over and over again, but fortunately "Ted" is a more comically cohesive effort than you'd ever expect from the king of unexpected random jabs, references and political incorrectness.If you haven't been curious enough to find out what the film is about already, "Ted" tells the story of how young John Bennett (who grows up to be Mark Wahlberg), who had trouble fitting in as a kid, made a wish on Christmas Day for his teddy bear to come to life. His wish comes true and Ted becomes world famous, even appearing on the Johnny Carson Show. But as Patrick Stewart lovingly and frankly reminds us in his role as narrator: like Corey Feldman and Frankie Muniz, eventually, people stop giving a ****.Despite a serious relationship of four years with Lori (Mila Kunis), nearly middle-aged John is still ripping bongs and watching '80s "Flash Gordon" with his equally irresponsible teddy bear best friend. Eventually, John must start to make sacrifices if he wants to become the adult that Lori wants him to be, and Ted is arguably the chief reason for his inability to shape up.There aren't exactly any curveballs in this story, but that's when you realize you're watching a film in which a man is trying to stop hanging out with his profane teddy bear. Despite the obvious outcomes, "Ted" has to be considered an original comedy.It's also consistently funny. Sure, the nature of many of the jokes is that they exist in a vacuum and aren't necessarily related to what's going on or what matters, but much of the references actually tie into the plot later on (such as Flash Gordon ... it'll make sense when you see it) and it's far less random than skeptics will come in expecting. That said, some of its best jokes and references will resonate on a personal level, i.e. if you watch this with a group of people, you're bound to laugh really hard at times when they don't and vice-versa.The only thing that feels a little out of place is a subplot involving Giovanni Ribisi as a creepy single father who has been a longtime admirer of Ted's and inquires about purchasing him for his overweight son. You've never seen Ribisi like this and that alone is amusing, but the focus of the film is on how John and Ted's mischief impacts his ability to grow up and get more serious with Lori, and this sort of butts into things.Yet for all its shenanigans, the amount of heart and sincerity in some of the relationship drama between John and Lori is surprising. Wahlberg and Kunis are generally pretty convincing, even if it's a bit weird that John is mature enough to have a relationship last four years but not enough to not screw things up at his job or avoid giving in to Ted's peer pressure. (Bear pressure?)The secret weapon is that Ted really is kind of adorable, and the mo-cap gives him an extra lifelike quality. The film hits some emotional notes early (who can't identify with loving a stuffed animal?) and this helps it to reconnect later on despite all the R-rated chaos in between. That ability alone assures "Ted" will be seen as better than a majority of foul- mouthed, dirty-minded comedies."Ridiculous" comes to mind as the best descriptor for "Ted," which one has to imagine MacFarlane aimed for in the first place. His performance as the titular bear is certainly reminiscent of Peter Griffin (there's a wink to the audience about that, by the way), but more importantly, Ted is treated as more than just an opportunity for a never-ending string of jokes that are simply funnier because "it's a teddy bear."Maybe having to create a complete package in the form of a movie has helped MacFarlane learn how to tone down his shtick. Audiences will write you off if you deliver them something inconsistent and scatter-brained that goes beyond 30 inconsequential minutes of their lives, and MacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild make the majority of adjustments needed to honor that notion. "Ted" is as engaging as it is clever, funny and ridiculous. ~Steven C
For those not easily smitten by J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy tales, "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" was a substantial letdown from "The Lord of the Rings" films, and the thought of enduring another immensely long trilogy too much to bear. But even they'll agree with the biggest fans of "An Unexpected Journey" that part two, "The Desolation of Smaug," shows substantial improvement over the first film.Foremost, the film benefits from needing little to no exposition. The suspense and action ratchets up quickly as Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and the dwarfs, on their quest to reclaim their homeland from the dragon Smaug, are still being pursued by a band of ruthless orcs led by Azog the Defiler at the behest of the frightening, amorphous Necromancer. They must journey through the cursed forest of Mirkwood, home of the wood-elves, up the river to Lake-town and across the lake to the Lonely Mountain where Smaug awaits.The action sequences alone prove "Desolation" a better film than "Journey." Nothing was really wrong with the first film, but the danger, excitement and creativity of "Desolation" simply trumps its predecessor. The return of Legolas (Orlando Bloom) along with his companion Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly, who looks born to play an elf) brings with it the return of incredibly fluid, exciting and yes, perhaps even unrealistic fight choreography. Remember when Legolas took down an entire elephaunt in "Return of the King" in a brilliant sequence? The barrel escape on the river shows it up big time. Simply put, orcs are treated as deli meat in this movie.Aracnaphobes be warned: director Peter Jackson is relentless in the spider scenes in Mirkwood toward the beginning of the film and as for any dragon-phobes  yeah, you might want to walk out of the theater after the first two hours, because at that point begins the Smaug show. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers delicious vocals (as expected) playing the fearsome dragon, and the sheer scale of the climactic sequence inside the cavernous halls of the dwarf kingdom of Erebor doesn't disappoint.As was a noticeable challenge in "An Unexpected Journey," the "Desolation" script contains even more filler and plot lines not in the book crafted from appendices than the first film. Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo del Toro generally make good use of this creative freedom by keeping the pace of the film up some parts of the movie, though excellently written and executed, go on a bit too long and provide little value outside of pure entertainment.Two-thirds of the way through this adventure, it has become clear that the themes of "The Hobbit" trilogy don't run nearly as deep as with "The Lord of the Rings," and neither does the emotion. A subplot tries to create a love story between Kili (Aidan Turner) and Tauriel as a change-of-pace from the danger and fear (the film's primary and dominant emotion), but it just doesn't hit. Kili has nowhere near the same level of audience admiration as Legolas, whose legacy from "Rings" carries instantly over to this film and who seems an obvious match for Tauriel. Outward ploys to generate some emotion such as this, however, wouldn't be necessary if the same motifs that made "Rings" more than blockbuster (friendship, the struggle of being outside of one's comfort zone, the fear of failure) were a part of "The Hobbit." Freeman and Richard Armitage (Thorin) are true talents, but they can only go so far with this material. What "Desolation" makes up for in entertainment value from "Journey," it loses in heart.Other casting decisions earn excellent marks among the film's new characters including Lilly and Cumberbatch. Lee Pace nails the elf aura as good as Cate Blanchett playing the elf-king Thranduil and Luke Evans makes a fine, likable hero out of Bard the Bowman, the man who harbors the company in Lake-town. Although his character is a waste, the delightful Stephen Fry is another good call as the master of Lake-town. And let us not forget old friends: Ian McKellan gets a good number of badass moments during Gandalf's side-journey.Anyone unsure which format to view the film in should consider that the last sequence with Smaug and a few others occur in somewhat dark locales. This is a significantly less than desirable situation for traditional 3D, because 3D already makes the frame seem darker. Those looking to upgrade from 2D should make the jump to HFR 3D, which despite its many critics, definitely has less motion blur and doesn't have the same issues with darkness.Jackson, of course, continues to marvel with his vision for Middle Earth. The design of the locales and the sets (the wood-elves' kingdom, Lake-town, Erebor) show a great deal of technical sophistication and more importantly, imagination. The places truly come to life in all these films, and with a sense of eye-opening grandeur. Sometimes it even borders on too big and magnificent."The Desolation of Smaug" definitely sets the stage for what will surely be another memorable conclusion in both excitement and scale. The film ends on much more of an unexpected cliffhanger than the first film and the first "Lord of the Rings" films. "The Two Towers" definitely unwound in the end, as ominous as it still was, but "Desolation" will leave viewers with a sense that what they just saw will be like foreplay when they witness the conclusion.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The story may indeed not be true and Chuck Barris may never have had anything to do with the CIA, but "Confessions" is sure as heck interesting. To be truthful, the film even takes into account the somewhat elusive nature of that particular side of Barris' story. Two people need to be thanked for that: director George Clooney and writer Charlie Kaufman. Kaufman presents Barris' three-fold life in probably the best way that something so absurdly complicated could ever be told. Somehow in less than two hours, Kaufman balances Barris' love life, TV career and CIA well enough so that we're a.) not too confused and b.) not too short-changed in any one important aspect of Barris' life. Clooney also shoots this with a variety of interesting techniques that offer more depth to the story.In the beginning of the film, however, we are very loosely attached to Barris' sudden CIA recruitment--it doesn't seem to be a player in the plot. However, as it begins to demand more of his time, we see its place and effect on his life. The way the Clooney portrays those scenes where Barris is on killing business is very different to the way he shows the other parts of his life, which keeps a sort of mystique about that whole plot line in a way that might suggest Clooney is himself skeptical of Barris' story.In general, the film starts out as a meaningless sexual romp--there's no true understanding of why he is truly drawn in to television or why he truly accepts Clooney's character Jim's (his CIA connection) proposal. Once we see him really bounce around between all these things and watch it affect him, then the film really takes off and becomes something more special. Sam Rockwell, who plays Barris, also gets better as the story gets stronger. At that point, you start to see the real reason this story is being told, in the thematic sense.The rest of the cast is rather good. Clooney finds a great, subtle role for himself and he brings in a slew of cameos that are very clever and effective that give the film a distinct sense of humor. Barrymore even finds some points of success although she still feels like a romantic comedy actor somehow stuck in a thriller."Confessions" is a very complex story, but it has its merits. Perhaps making it longer to add more depth to each of the "dimensions" of the story would have been best, but it seems almost unfeasible to actually give everything the appropriate time it would need to really turn into something very relateable, deeply emotional and human. It definitely starts to get there, but not until late in the film. This is what prevents it from reaching the next level. The level it's at, however, compared to many films, is still a terrific one.
Not since 1976's "All the President's Men" has a film shown how vital, dangerous and deeply conflicted the field of journalism is, and "The Insider" goes there and beyond. It's not just about professional and legal conflicts, but also issues of trust and dignity that have deep personal repercussions. Michael Mann ("Heat") delivers yet another film that goes beyond its subject (journalism), beyond merely a plot with intriguing conflict and into a realm with ethical considerations for everyone."The Insider" delves into issues of confidentiality and where journalism's first allegiance is by telling the story of how former "60 Minutes" producer Lowell Bergman (Pacino) convinced a top researcher for a Big Tobacco company, Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), to come on camera with information implicating the industry for knowingly enhancing the addictiveness of the nicotine in its products. But Mann isn't as interested in the logistics of the legal processes and whatnot as he is the personal implications for Wigand, Bergman and CBS. Issues of trust and moral responsibility abound. Wigand and Bergman develop a relationship both with the most honorable intentions in our eyes -- Bergman wants the truth and Wigand wants to risk his financial well-being to enlighten the public, but Wigand's paranoia and the responses by Big Tobacco lawyers create a shaky dynamic between the two. The cast is loaded with incredible talent (Christopher Plummer, Philip Baker Hall, Rip Torn, etc.) but Pacino and Crowe are the most necessary to mention. Pacino brings his same machismo: he sounds as if he knows exactly what he's talking about -- his reactions when his character comes under fire are calculated and not overplayed, even when he does his signature shouting. As for Crowe, his character's emotional issues are apparent and his execution of this is vital at taking us beyond the issue at hand and having great sympathy for his conundrum: to tell the truth he risks his family and his livelihood. His performance, in addition with that in "L.A. Confidential" is all the proof necessary that this guy can act.Mann and "Forrest Gump" writer Eric Roth deliver a script that while certainly busy with many characters that are hard to discern at times, perfectly gets across exactly what needs to be said as succinctly as possible to both move plot and provoke thought. It's very easy to stay with this film despite needing to move quickly to fit everything into 155 minutes.Especially journalists, but everyone who has daily ethical concerns with their job, can also appreciate the fairness with which the film handles both sides of the debate. Basically, CBS makes a critical decision on whether to air the interview and both sides make convincing arguments. The best part is that what's unquestionably, morally right wins out in this film despite it's very psychologically damaging consequences on its main characters. As Mann points out, where the truth is concerned, it's not all about who wins, but it's the principle on which you got there."The Insider" is thought-provoking and insightful, a true example of how one specialized area like investigative journalism and confidentiality law suits can become universally understood through great dramatic writing and the write talent executing it.
The superhero genre reached a higher echelon in 2008 with "Iron Man" and "The Dark Knight," and considering the success of 2/3 of the X-Men franchise so far, "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" can certainly be held to those standards, especially a movie whose title alone suggests getting right down to its hero's adamantium core.But "Wolverine" plays more like a spin-off, defining "origins" as the back story and not the psychological workings of the character. It's weak on themes, but loaded on more new mutants with new powers, explosions and plenty of subplots. Basically, it fails where "X-Men 3" did, trying to do too much at once, rushing the plot along and sacrificing the deeper reason audiences are drawn to Hugh Jackman's character other than he's cool and has a crude, sarcastic sense of humor. However, it succeeds much of the same way X3 did and beyond: more explosive action and creative use of an immense visual effects budget. Although director Gavin Hood doesn't bring more insight into the film with his work, he certainly has as good of an eye for the stylish as anyone.The first sign that you know this movie isn't going to be top tier for superhero flicks is the number of mutants/villains. For a story about one, singular X-man, there are way too many other characters to follow: Col. Stryker is their ringleader, but Sabretooth (Schriber), Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Reynolds), Bolt (Monaghan), Gambit (Kitsch), Wraith (will.i.am), Agent Zero, the Blob and young Cyclops (not to mention a slough of extras) make the film dizzying. Especially at the beginning, we need to see more Wolverine -- it's his movie.To the film's credit, its quick movement makes it easy to watch and entertaining and there's some surprisingly good comedic timing on Jackman's part for an action movie. Seriously though, it must have been a blast (no pun intended) on the set during action sequences because they actually destroyed everything they possibly could: CGI, real and both. This film is the beginning of what will surely be mind-blowing visual effects at the movies this summer. Hood gives new visual strength to the franchise and provides a much more epic feel to this film -- it's clearly about this grand journey for Wolverine, even if it's more spectacle than introspective.Surprisingly, the ending was the most satisfying part of the film. All the subplots converge, it makes sense and the loose ends that fans of the first three films will notice get tied up fittingly at the end. For the whole first hour of the film you're juggling Wolverine and Sabretooth's rivalry, Stryker's team of guys with powers, Wolverine's romance with Kayla out in the wilderness, what's happening to the team of guys with powers ... why the heck kid Cyclops is in the movie ... it's not overwhelming, it's just not as enjoyable when you can't focus on one thing or character as much as you'd like. Still, the ending justifies the strange means, at least in terms of the epic battle that ensues."Wolverine" is not a travesty for the genre, but it certainly doesn't meet the expectations for a thorough superhero movie experience. You get amped up action and style over meaning and that makes it entertainment more than catharsis. Expect to be entertained and little else and "Wolverine" will satisfy your itch for the summer movie season. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com/
It has finally been assembled. Marvel's decision to make "The Avengers" might seem like the superhero equivalent of the ensemble movie "Valentine's Day," or the theory that stuffing multiple popular actors into one movie is an adequate substitute for storytelling and makes it so marketable that no one could pass it up.While that's not necessarily not true of Marvel's super plan five years in the making, "The Avengers" means something more to comic and superhero fans; it is a culmination of a lifetime of anticipation that does in fact have a historical precedent set by Marvel Comics. Essentially, this movie is a collective nerd-gasm, but whether you're part of it or not, there's plenty to love about how geek godfather Joss Whedon tackles this gargantuan task.Still, it's pretty amazing what bundling seven or so of the most beloved comic characters of all time into one package can do when it comes to creating an entertaining diversion. Many folks will nitpick at "The Avengers" script from now until eternity, but something needs to be said for the experience of being so awe-stricken that you couldn't care about those things if you tried. There's no shame in covering up "flaws" with entertainment, especially when you deliver that entertainment with a level of quality rivaled by few blockbusters of this scale."The Avengers" is a near-perfect execution of giving the people what they want. If you had to make a list of what you wanted from an "Avengers" movie, Whedon and Marvel would appear to have read your mind. The action sequences blow every previous superhero film out of the air, land and sea, the wit and humor come from more than just a series of punchlines or catch phrases, and all the characters get a chance to shine from an action and development perspective.Story is secondary to achieving those goals. Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) power-obsessed brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has made a deal with an alien race known as the Chitauri to destroy Earth so he can rule it. He breaks into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and steals the Tesseract, an object at the center of "Captain America: The First Avenger" that has the power to open a gateway through which the Chitauri can invade. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), realizing Earth is about to be at war with an unstoppable force, summons Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), a displaced Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor in hopes they can place nice and band together to stop Loki.So you have high stakes (global destruction), and a force powerful enough to justifiably bring all these heroes together. That's all you really need. The script properly gives each hero reasons to fight and a personal journey, something to overcome. All this for seven characters in a 140-minute runtime. Even though we're building up to yet another movie climax that involves the destruction of a major American city by hostile alien forces, it's still this unique grouping of characters that changes the whole game.As someone who seems to specialize in creating projects that develop cult followings, Whedon was really a perfect choice to write and direct. Despite what one would assume to be a lot of pressure, you never get the sense that "The Avengers" is trying too hard. The balancing act of all these characters might have seemed too tall an order for any one man, yet with actors really dedicated to the souls of their characters, Whedon and the cast pack in so much into even the smallest of exchanges.One character the movie excels at in particular is The Hulk. Ruffalo commands the role of Banner as if he was the one who played him in the first two "Hulk" features. The script paints him as the team's secret weapon, but also as the most volatile link in the chain. Some fear the green monster, others (Tony Stark) try to provoke him. Either way, despite sharing screen time, this Hulk is both more brutal and emotionally accessible than ever before. More than any other character, you'll end up most curious about what Marvel might do with him next.In general, the lack of time needing to be spent on plot development gets rationed off to all the characters, allowing the third-act action to pay off in more terms than simply eye candy. Each hero has a personal story arc or obstacle to overcome, whether its Tony Stark proving he can set aside his ego or Captain American understanding that he can be relevant in the 21st Century.With so many heroes in one film, Hiddleston had to bear a ton of weight as Loki, creating a presence that could balance out all these good guys. Although not much of a physical threat, his The Joker-like move to allow himself to be imprisoned gives him the fuel to be cunning and unpredictable in performance and in actuality.From a pure entertainment perspective, "The Avengers" should be considered king of all superhero movies. What it lacks in thematic and character depth it makes up for with action and humor. Whedon writes so expertly around clichés and identifies ways to make the film naturally funny, and the way the action scenes are edited together, there's no confusion in regard to what's going on despite the chaos of the Chitauri invasion scene.Marvel deserves all the credit in the world for building to this point and delivering precisely what fans wanted. Although anyone can enjoy this romp, not just those who saw both "Iron Man" films, "Thor" and "Captain America," there's no doubt the legwork in those films makes it so much easier to enjoy the entire dynamic of "The Avengers." What a momentous achievement from a business, filmmaking and audience perspective.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out moviemusereviews.com
Pregnancy and eventually the bond between mother and child is a powerful thing. Hormones, attachment, sometimes postpartum depression -- even the mystery of what's growing inside -- Roman Polanski channels all these things into storytelling elements of suspense and paranoia in his superbly written "Rosemary's Baby."Played by a 22-year-old Mia Farrow, Rosemary is the young wife of a struggling actor (John Cassavetes) who moves into a new apartment house in New York next to some strange old nosy neighbors, Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman (Sidney Blackmer). Under strange circumstances she becomes pregnant and starts to believe there might be some conspiracy surrounding her baby."Rosemary's Baby" is not really a horror movie. There are no frightful images, only the illusion that you might see one, which is Polanski's best trick. Its chock-full of suspense and creates the helpless feeling of not knowing what to believe half the time. The French-born and currently exiled director delivers his first big hit with this plodding script that is never too challenging but takes hold of its audience.Farrow as Rosemary is this wonderfully cheery and naive spirit who we see crumble before our eyes as her intuition and gullibility are at odds with each other. She does the first half- Rosemary quite well but shows some room for improvement in the more dramatic half of the film. Ruth Gordon is an effectively irritating scene-stealer, helping build Polanski's slow dramatic momentum by arousing our suspicions early.It's not altogether poignant other than underscoring this precious bond between mother and unborn baby, but the execution of suspense is second to very few other films of its kind.
The Holocaust has been revisited in film so many times that I imagine the first thing German-born film actors ask themselves upon meeting is "which film(s) were you a Nazi in?" The crimes of the Nazi Party and the German soldiers carrying out its mission to revive Germany through the mass killing of Jews and other "invalids" are so unfathomable and powerful that filmmakers and storytellers can't help but find so many ways to tell complex stories of morality and human survival."The Counterfeiters" is another one of these films, but lack of originality is absolutely the only knock against it."Counterfeiters" focuses on a group of Jews assembled by the Nazis to create mass quantities of Ally currency to be used to decimate Ally economies. It's the same type of lens on the Holocaust, but a different "edition" so to speak. Yet the script is immaculate, the drama understated and effective, the plot completely engaging, and best of all: it's a Holocaust film under two hours -- and a great one at that. It begins with a morally complex main character, the crooked-faced Salomon "Sally" Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics), who before the war was a professional counterfeiter, one with considerable artistic talent who chose the more "financially sound" career. Simply put, he's a criminal and the crimes of the Holocaust manage to make us sympathetic to him. He's an honest criminal, but a criminal no less. As the leader of his counterfeiting team in a way, following his point of view is extremely interesting. There is his survival instinct, his pride over the work even though it's helping the Nazis and characters such as his friend Burger the printer (Adolf Burger, who wrote the book the film is based on), who pressures him not to do the work and risk death on principle.These are all familiar Holocaust film themes. There are the Jews who will do anything to stay alive, helping the Nazis or doing whatever they bid for an extra scrap of food and soft beds and those who would be willing martyrs, dying before they stoop to a certain level or help a Nazi.The difference is in the execution. Stefan Ruzowitzky has done an incredible job adapting Burger's incredible true account. He's identified the key moments and turning points and crafted ideal scenes to help build the plot up. He wastes no time getting to the point. The scenes are short and sweet, giving us bursts of information, emotion and symbolism, sometimes in just a minute. Directing off his own script, he directs us to key visuals that convey all that information like a leftover piece of food that conveys the hunger not always at the forefront of a scene. The pacing is exceptional, especially for a Holocaust film, and though some of the scenes are brutal it doesn't hit the audience over the head with scenes of terror and emotion that go straight for the heartstrings. It's much more subtle and effectively so.It's hard to visit yet another Holocaust film, but "The Counterfeiters" is worth it because of Ruzowitzky's fine craftsmanship and its overall subtly. It's the impact of a Holocaust film without all the emotionally distressful scenes and the screaming and the heartfelt violin music. The unique story of Sorowtisch and these group of Jews who are given a bit more privilege yet in turn forced to wrestle with a bit of moral guilt makes it a warranted trip into a oft-visited historical genre.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
For a totally preposterous magician caper, "Now You See Me" has a surprising meta edge to it. The film talks a big talk about deception with its Morgan Freeman voice-over narration ("the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see"), but in spite of its high levels of ludicrousness, it delivers exactly that. "Now You See Me" treats its audience as the spectators of a magic act, luring us in and giving us the razzle-dazzle with a stunning reveal of what's behind the curtain in the end.The two reactions you will have to this film is that you'll either hate being duped or you'll be really impressed that you were. It begins with the exceedingly elaborate script from Boaz Yakin ("Prince of Persia"), Edward Ricourt and Ed Solomon ("Men in Black"). They craft something so totally compelling that no one is bound to turn this film off or walk away before it's over. Plot holes and leaps in logic and belief are stashed aside until the final minutes because the mystery simply envelops you, just as any good magician in his or her act.Four magicians with unique talents, slight of hand master J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), escape artist Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), mentalist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and trickster Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), have mysteriously been recruited to create a magic act unlike anything ever seen. Fast-forward a year later and they reveal their act in Las Vegas, with a grand finale in which they rob a bank in Paris while on stage. Their little display catches the attention of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and an Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent) who work together with famed magician debunker Thaddeus Bradley (Freeman) in order to guess their next move.And their moves only get more and more complicated and astounding. The script teases with little bits that make you think you're inching toward an answer only to be caught looking the wrong way. Director Louis Leterrier ("Transporter," "Clash of the Titans") adds plenty of movement and excitement to the proceedings as well.If you so desire to dig below the surface layers of "Now You See Me," it goes from wildly entertaining and engrossing into downright horrible. No, it's simply not feasible that anything that happened in this movie could happen. Yes, the characters are only as interesting as their different talents and witty remarks, and their motivation to execute this grand plan comes from something we do not know until the very end. It's too slick, too neat, too glossy."Now You See Me" will only be as good as the person watching it allows it to be. Bite early and lay back and you're bound to enjoy it; stay skeptical and bank too much on the payoff and you're bound to dismiss it entirely. It's the same with any movie that's building toward a big reveal right from its opening scene. Live by the twist, die by the twist.Personally, I bought in. Fantastic performances from Eisenberg and Harrelson plus the gravitas of Freeman and Michael Caine as the executive who funds their show helped keep up the appearances and cover up the blemishes that really only became apparent to me upon reflection post-credits. I came in open-minded and bought into the entire aesthetic of the movie and enjoyed it presumably a lot more than if I had paid too close attention to the details. And the ending had me fooled, which happens a lot less these days.As easily as one can find the seams "Now You See Me" and tear it apart, it does exactly what it set out to do: beguile, trick, deceive and entertain its audience. Regardless of the artistic qualities or merits of a film, if it does what it sets out to do, it's a success.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
When Tim Burton and Disney present you a pretty little 3-D film with a tag on it that says "Watch Me," you're likely to indulge. The prospect of one of the finest fantasy directors (who's a bit mad himself) creating the beloved and colorful world of Lewis Carroll's classic children's tales in the era of CGI and 3-D seems flawless. Yet somehow, the magic factor does not find its way where it is needed most: the story.While 3-D films are still novel, CGI is not. Not even James Cameron's "Avatar" could win audiences on visual effects alone; it needed a classic story. Linda Woolverton's take on "Alice in Wonderland" preaches classic "dream the impossible" and "carve your own destiny" themes, but they're not organic in this plot. To fit in all the classic characters from the both Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking Glass," Woolverton throws them in like set decorations. Perhaps Burton too is a bit ignorant and doesn't let us discover these characters so much as smack us over the head with them like a flamingo croquet mallet. The only instance where we get to know these characters is the Mad Hatter's tea party, which was likely because of Johnny Depp.The story is a "return to Wonderland" premise. Alice (Mia Wasikowska) dreamed of Wonderland as a little girl, but now she's 19 years old and she's just arrived at a fancy party which she does not know is in honor of her wedding engagement, which she's not expecting and isn't sure she wants. When the white rabbit shows up she follows him down the rabbit hole and the familiar adventures begin, only Alice conveniently doesn't realize she was there before as a little girl so that all the memorable scenes and characters can come back.The truth is that Wonderland (apparently called Underland) is very different from the one we know as far as what's going on there. The Red Queen, played with the right amount of quirk and arrogance by Helena Bonham-Carter, runs a cruel regime. Supposedly Alice is the only one who can end it by slaying the giant Jabberwocky, but she's not all that sure that's her destiny either. In fact, she insists she's dreaming.There aren't many unexpected turns of events from there. By the trailers alone, it's fairly obvious Alice won't be too reluctant to save Wonde--er--Underland. Now that we're not concerned about what happens next, we turn to the wide array of colorful characters to entertain us.Anyone familiar with the original stories probably had a scene or a character in mind that they were looking forward too. For me, I was excited for Absalom the hookah-puffing caterpillar, in part because he's voiced by Alan Rickman. He pops up at the beginning as the know-all figure the others turn to and then a few times in between, but it's not enough to soak up the character. That's pretty much the story with everyone except the Mad Hatter. Depp is allowed a rangy performance from sentimental moments with Alice to full-on random Scottish brogue. It's no surprise that he and Bonham-Carter, the Tim Burton regulars, are both the funniest and most interesting because they're full of surprises. No two line deliveries are exactly the same -- that's the quirkiness of a Tim Burton film and there wasn't enough of it.I didn't have the chance to catch this film in theaters or in 3-D, so I won't comment on the visual effects. However, the environment of Wonderland was hardly a "character," which all the best setting are; they play integral roles in the film. The production team put together these CGI landscapes but they go unexplored. One example of strong environment integration was the floating (assumed decapitated) heads in the Red Queen's moat that tiny Alice crosses like lily pads. Once again, something you'd expect more of from Burton."Alice in Wonderland" is simply childish. It would appeal most to children and the story and character integration are best described as amateur. There was so much more about these characters and their world that seem worthy of exploration, but there was no chance for it in "Wonderland." For a story that is about championing imagination and the impossible, there was nothing inspiring and magical about it other than a few key performances. At least Wasikowska was a likable Alice with the right balance of skepticism and curiosity. Unfortunately, I was far more interested in what happened to her before she fell into the rabbit hole and I doubt some 3-D glasses would've changed my mind.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
We've seen plenty of Ben Stiller comedies, we are very familiar with Jack Black's sense of humor and if you've watched a fair share of movies (including "Iron Man"), you know how good Robert Downey Jr. can be, but never before have you seen them like this, teaming up to create summer 2008's best comedy. "Tropic Thunder" is not a violent action comedy like it lets off--instead the gun is aimed at Hollywood, taking shots at actors, writers, producers, the whole lot as they try and make a Vietnam War film. It's not the most laugh-out-loud funny comedy in recent years, but its combination of great and diverse talent playing a variety of amusing characters and clever Hollywood-spoofing jokes makes it a unique brand that is familiar but fresh."Tropic Thunder" is a new war film based on a book written by a war vet played by Nick Nolte. The film brings together action star on the decline Tugg Speedman (Stiller), drug- addict comedian Jeff Portnoy (Black) and over-dedicated several-time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr.) who has undergone surgery to become black for the film. The film brilliantly starts with three trailers from their previous work, the funniest being "Satan's Alley" starring Lazarus and Toby Maguire as gay monks. With cast and crew unable to gel on set and receiving terrible publicity with the threat of being shut down, their director (Steve Coogan) agrees to send the actors into the actual Vietnamese jungle and film them guerrilla style. Only it all goes wrong and it quickly isn't a movie anymore.Directed by Stiller himself and written by him and lesser known actor Justin Theroux, there is definitely a sense that the film centers around Stiller's character and his style, but this is definitely all about the coming together of Black, Stiller and Downey Jr. along with some familiar but smaller names from Apatow Productions like Jay Baruchel of "Knocked Up" and Danny McBride from "Pineapple Express." Britain's Steve Coogan is transitioning nicely to America as the film's aggravated director and Tom Cruise takes a bold risk as the film's self- centered, foul-mouthed producer.Downey Jr. steals the show. He's playing an Australian who is playing a black man and stays in character at all times--it's ridiculous. You believe it so easily. His style really freshens up what could have become just another Stiller movie. Cruise, while not hysterical, really leaves you asking if that's him the entire time, because he really transforms for the role and not just in being bald and fat. The performance definitely gets props.It's the spoofing that really does it, though. While viewers may see red flags with the warnings about insensitivity toward people with mental disabilities and with Downey Jr. in blackface, you can pretty clearly tell why and it's not to make fun of either group. All the main characters basically make fun of actors with their descriptions: Stiller is like a dumb Tom Cruise, Black is a drug-addicted Eddie Murphy type, Downey Jr. is a pretty clear shot at Russell Crowe, etc. The plot is loaded with more cracks as well as some other clever humor and jokes. The film is also not bad as an action film with plenty of explosions.There might be some jokes that don't work, but there's lot of different jokes in this movie because of the variety of comedians in it, so if something misses you're sure not to see the same type of jokes following it up. The general tone, however, is crude humor and that's where the R rating comes in. There is also a decided lack of female actors in this film, which gears it pretty much for guys only. This is a fun movie though and is sure to lead to more Hollywood-spoofing films in the future should it pull at the box office.
If books, movies and television have warped our minds in any way, one way is that we crave this cathartic clarity at the end of every mystery story we consume. We have to know who dunnit or we go berserk and these media have taken our natural instinct and turned it into our expectation. One would suppose that "Zodiac," a murder mystery based on the real, infamous killings of the late 60s and 70s in the San Francisco area, is one of those films, and in many ways it is--but it's something more. "Zodiac" is not so much a film about solving a mystery as it is about the obsession that fuels it.David Fincher, who directed perhaps the greatest murder mystery of the 90s in "Se7en," returns to the genre again to direct the more biographical and fact-based "Zodiac." With Fincher's expertise, Zodiac becomes a mystery that sucks in all your attention, building suspense and--more importantly--your mental and emotional investment. Like Fincher's previous work, the cinematography is strong, (he collaborates with Harris Savides once again from 1997's "The Game") the lighting and shadows helping to build the mystery shrouding your every thought.Basically, the story is so thoroughly told, with no detail in the case spared, that you become obsessed. Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal), the San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist that took it upon himself to pursue the case when the leads fizzled out, is a victim of that very obsession, and therein is why this is a very good film. The main character and the viewers are completely in sync--we identify so easily with him, feeling all his frustrations, watching his family life start to crumble away.Sometimes, this amped up perplexity for the purpose of creating the viewer's own obsession, does sacrifice the film's other elements. There's only so close we can get to the characters (all who are played very well), like Robert Downey Jr.'s Tim Avery, drug-abusing Chronicle reporter, or Mark Ruffalo as police detective David Toschi. With our brains so focused on the mystery, part of the human element of this film is lost. These were real people and the victims of these crimes were actually victims. But such is Hollywood, and the mystery elements are a precedent for marketing the film. At least Fincher doesn't let them completely dominate, awakening us to our dangerous obsession of mystery-solving.
Chips falling as they did, the odds of "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" equaling its predecessor were not exactly ever in its favor. Director and adaptor Gary Ross left the burgeoning film franchise, Suzanne Collins' series undoubtedly lost a little luster with its increased exposure and "Catching Fire" takes on a much larger scope than the first book as revolution threatens the dystopia of Panem. Well, with Francis Lawrence at the helm ("I Am Legend") and a screenplay from two Oscar winners in Simon Beaufoy ("Slumdog Millionaire") and Michael Arndt ("Oblivion," "Toy Story 3"), "Catching Fire" makes adapting mega-popular book series look easy. The sequel builds on the tone Ross set for the series while improving upon the action, tension and drama.Beaufoy and Arndt perfectly convey the pressures upon Hunger Games victors Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). Their act of defiance masquerading as true love allowed them to survive the Games together, but now they must sell it to the districts of Panem in order to fan down the flames of revolution they've kindled, or risk President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the Capitol hurting the ones they love."Catching Fire," like its predecessor but in a whole other way, is a tale of two parts: the first being Katniss and Peeta's "Victory Tour" during which it becomes clear the districts' defiance of the Capitol has gone too far to stop now, and the second being the 75th Hunger Games, which has been manipulated this year to snuff out Katniss for good. Although these parts look and feel totally different, the strong narrative binding them together makes the movie impressively cohesive and doing justice to metaphor in the film's title and at the heart of its story.The biggest difference between the two "Hunger Games" films is the stylistic approach of directors Lawrence versus Ross. Ross used a lot of hand-held camera-work whereas Lawrence uses a more standard approach and picks his angles. The action scenes of "Catching Fire" are therefore a lot crisper, with no shaky-cam to blur the violence down to PG-13. Lawrence opts to leave a lot of the violence to the viewer's imagination and it's much more effective.On the other hand, Lawrence doesn't seem to have quite the same rapport with the other Lawrence, his star. Ross had a way of capturing Katniss' emotion in a real, deeply introspective way. He made Katniss his focal point, boxing out the supporting characters; Lawrence is more inclusive, sacrificing a little of our lens into Katniss to account for the many new characters in "Catching Fire." Some of Jennifer Lawrence's facial expressions don't have the same effective intensity as they did during, for example, the slow-building Reaping scene in the first movie. Katniss has lots of moments in which she emotionally snaps, which puts the pressure on Lawrence to sell us on the emotions, but she's a little limited with how effective she can be.Instead, characters such as Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), Effie (Elizabeth Banks), President Snow and newcomers Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and head gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) get a little more of a spotlight and make "Catching Fire" feel more like an ensemble film. The script also supports them with some good lines and moments. Considering "Catching Fire" moves the story in a direction that is bigger than Katniss, it's a smart decision that could pay dividends in the two-part conclusion, "Mockingjay," which underwhelmed as a book."Catching Fire" works from start to finish and doesn't waste much screen time in all of its 156 minutes. There's very little action in the first half too, but the trap in which Katniss is ensnared provides the high stakes and the suspense to get the ball rolling. Considering the trailers didn't bother to hide that Katniss returns to the Hunger Games arena once again, it's testament to the work Arndt and Beaufoy have done that the moment when President Snow reveals that information has a heavy and harrowing effect in spite of its inevitability. Adaptations of major book series or multi-film franchises often struggle when the scale of the story grows so large that there's so much more to take account of, but hiring these ace writers and a director with some experience reining in big genre films helped "Catching Fire" take a major step forward in a way that can only be compared to the "Harry Potter" franchise. If they can make "Mockingjay" work despite splitting the tiny and very different book into two parts, that'll be another success entirely.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Nightmares are about the closest any of us get to confronting something truly terrifying. In them everything feels so real, but we wake up and all is fine. Wes Craven sees the powerful possibility for horror by blurring that line and such is the premise of "A Nightmare on Elm Street," a story of teenagers being hunted in their dreams by a burned man with knives attached to his fingers."Elm Street" is not as scary so much as fraught with creepiness and suspense. When Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) does strike, because it is within a dream world independent of reality, the attacks are exciting and original. Essentially, Freddy is nothing but a slasher, but his existence in a "supernatural" plane keeps "Elm Street" fresh.One of the under-appreciated story techniques that Craven uses is that he focuses on Tina (Amanda Wyss) for the first 15 minutes and it is with her gruesome death that our attention turns to Nancy (Heather Langenkamp), our true (and infinitely more likable) protagonist. This simple technique of violating expectation sets the tone for the film on a positive note.As an antagonist, Freddy is simply demented. The one scene where Englund really gets to do any acting is during his assault on Tina in the beginning. He's a goofball -- anything but terrifying. But with the knife fingers and Craven's suspense techniques he becomes as formidable as any slasher.Outside of the horror elements, Craven excels at creating rules for the dream world that Freddy occupies. It starts with only being able to attack you in his dreams and then expands to including any wounds that you suffer at his expense show through in the real world. Then we later learn you can take things back with you from the dream world into reality. This kind of contextual crafting usually gets reserved for science-fiction movies, so it's refreshing to see another genre trying it out.The credit for retaining the film's sense of self-seriousness belongs to Langenkamp. She believes in the material as any one of us would in her situation. She's cautious brave about taking on Freddy but not stupid brave. She's not afraid to tell the other characters what's going on but she doesn't act all crazy explaining herself like most protagonists do when the people around them think they're insane. Thanks to her, "Elm Street" doesn't necessitate being laughed at for being preposterous; it's genuinely suspenseful and dramatic.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
John Hancock is far from your average superhero, but the trailer told you that. What the trailer doesn't tell you, is that after the rogue anti-hero drunkenly parades about as advertised, he has to develop a backstory and make the film go from a clever spin on a hot- ticket genre to an emotional action drama. There are entertaining and unique elements that make "Hancock" standout, but they end up secondary to a hodge-podge and two-faced plot concept.It's easy to be deceived these days by the shear unruly star-power that is Will Smith, especially when he's attached to a project dealing with superheroes, a genre that has been a cash machine. He's talented no matter what he does, and in that regard, "Hancock" is enjoyable. While I personally felt his character was too much of an a**hole as the script so frequently and unoriginally puts it, that doesn't mean Smith isn't good at it. He's just a great hero no matter the film. To quickly summarize, Smith plays "Hancock," a lonely, drunken jerk with Superman powers and a public approval rating of zero. When he saves Ray's (Jason Bateman) life, Ray offers his services as a P.R. consultant and the two work to change his image. Eventually, you get to Hancock's back story and some strange but obvious twists take the film down a different path that to explain would be a major spoiler.So from the perspective of a producer that has a decent script with a highly marketable concept written by some nobodies and with a director (Peter Berg) attached whose best action credit is 2007's "The Kingdom," I would definitely want to sign someone to play Hancock who is going to guarantee me top spot at the box office. Well, voila. Smith is such a proved commodity with an amazing streak of top first weekend box office spots that he could get any contract he wants and he should do that. After Smith, the marks for "Hancock" are pretty much middle of the road. The CGI and Berg's directing style is too sloppy for what should be a clean-cut summer blockbuster. His refusal to use any camera stabilizing device works for a few scenes, but most of the time it's just dizzying and the close-ups become obnoxious. The plot concept, which paints a picture of Hancock as a hero and then fills it in with the origin story later instead of the other way around, makes for an interesting affect, but instead of enlightening what we know about Hancock, it ends up taking the film in another direction entirely. While you might think this movie would leave you with themes about turning one's life around and becoming the best you can be, that gets glossed over and you're left themeless.If you want summer fun at the movies that is about as clumsy, destructive and amusing as the title character is, you should check out "Hancock." ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
You wouldn't expect someone with Kubrick's vision to tackle something as gritty and human as war, but Kubrick does and the result is a brilliantly written and carefully crafted Vietnam War film that captures better than any war film the true nature of dehumanization of both enemy and soldier.In its basic form, "Full Metal Jacket" has a two-part structure, one in basic training and one abroad during the Tet Offensive, with the through line being Matthew Modine's character Private Joker as he wrestles with the true nature of what it is he has gotten himself into. In the beginning he establishes himself as "Joker" and says he was "born to kill" a message with truly meaningful irony as he wears that statement on his helmet in the film's second half. This is truly Joker's story and it is through him we understand Kubrick's message.The supporting cast, however, is where the plot tends to revolve, specifically in the beginning. Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) gives a truly unforgettable performance as he simply drills the recruits for the bulk of this section. You start to feel like he's giving you orders and screaming profanities at you because of how much he dominates the beginning of the film. The conflict arises when recruit nicknamed Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) simply can't keep up, failing at everything and Hartman never eases off until Pyle conforms to the idea of being a killing machine. This antagonistic relationship speaks to war on the most basic level and Kubrick does an incredible job portraying that.The screenplay is out of this world, especially the lines written for Sgt. Hartman, and the directing is incredibly solid. Kubrick has made a war film in which full out action sequences are immaterial and yet we are still entertained and intrigued. There are times where the film gets a bit slow and redundant, but it's definitely done to focus on the psychological part of war, not the action part.
It would be an insult to call "The Cove" the dolphin and porpoise version of a "Save the Whales" documentary. It is a documentary thriller filled with wildlife education, thorough journalism and top-notch espionage as much as it sheds light on an environmental/animal rights issue as deserving of our attention as anything else.Louie Psihoyos draws the analogy perfectly to "Ocean's Eleven." He is the Danny Ocean with the drive to assemble a team and accomplish his mission: finally capture video evidence of dolphin slaughter in Taiji, Japan to make the world aware and the Japanese government accountable for its actions.Psihoyos brings together a number of specialists from deep-sea divers to set designers who work for major Hollywood special effects, set and props company Industrial Light and Magic. Together they must slip by local authorities and fishermen who literally dedicate hours of their time just to prevent people from getting video footage of any wrongdoing (who also have their own cameras hoping to get enough evidence to arrest these "tresspassers.") So much of the power of "The Cove" comes from the fact that this one cove serves as a large percentage of Japanese dolphin slaughter.The documentary also has a main character, Rick O'Barry, who is an incredible story in and of himself. O'Barry is a longtime dolphin freedom activist who has been arrested countless times for freeing dolphins. Ironically, he was the very man who trained the infamous Flipper for the 1960s television show and having gotten to know dolphins so well, learned that captivity is more harmful for them than we realize.Part of the initial power of "The Cove" is its guilt trip. We learn how dolphins aren't best suited for captivity despite their apparently happy demeanors and if you've ever been to Sea World or enjoyed any kind of dolphin performance or "swim with the dolphins" attraction, immediately you feel like a terrible person. How often we forget that dolphins are the most intelligent creatures on the planet and that they're most sensitive to sound, which is stressful in a closed environment. The film continues to bring up their intelligence and challenges how you think about these creatures or any animal.As far as journalism, "The Cove" covers all its bases. From probing the international committee that determines all laws applying to whales, dolphins and other cetaceans to examining the argument of "well, you Americans slaughter cows" to the mercury level of whale and dolphin meat, there's little this documentary doesn't talk about.Ultimately, the powerful narrative of "The Cove" makes it one of the best documentaries ever made. Few films can truly achieve character depth (as in O'Barry's story) and suspense (their mission to plant cameras where they're not allowed) while being entirely true and not contrived in the least.If you like feeling empowered to leap to action after a documentary, this is not quite the expertise of "The Cove." It's more a change in perspective and a showcase of what empowered people can accomplish when they put their heads together. Unless you have time to go to Taiji or campaign for awareness over the Internet, there's not much you can do in your daily life to make a difference other than not visit Sea World on vacation.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Los Angeles and gangsters. Before "Gangster Squad," the first film that ought to come to mind is "L.A. Confidential." For Ruben Fleischer's latest, that creates an outrageous comparison point. The "Zombieland" and "30 Minutes or Less" director was probably not aiming that high. Even if he weren't, he's still not even aiming to add a prestigious entry to the gangster film canon. "Gangster Squad" is instead one of if not the only history-based gangster movie that just wants to be an action flick.Okay, so maybe not just an action flick, but considering the slick characters, numerous gun fights, explosions, etc. and sharp-tongued dialogue, no questioning entertainment is the goal. Considering we're used to mob dramas that have high aspirations and a disproportionate amount of these films have won great acclaim, a number of audiences are likely to find something a bit off.The first reason is the historical context. Jewish gangster Mickey Cohen has settled in Los Angeles in hopes of establishes his criminal network and owning the city. Police Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) wants to break his grip before it takes complete hold, so he recruits Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to put together a team that will operate outside the department and the sight of the law to bring Cohen down.O'Mara assembles his team in classic (albeit formulaic) cinematic fashion, with men who each have various specialties from the sharpshooter (Robert Patrick) to the tech geek (or the '40s version of a tech geek) played by Giovanni Ribisi. Among the last of the men to be convinced is Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), a womanizer who seduces Grace (Emma Stone), Cohen's etiquette coach and play thing. Together, they plot ways to hit Cohen where it will sting most.If the team-assembling sequences don't tip you off as to the movie's super squad action flick qualities, Cohen's sinister ways of torturing and killing the men who screw up and the ubiquitous actions scenes will. Even if the events depicted in the film were all true, they definitely didn't look this pretty in real life.Fleischer's glory-shot style with big action payoffs simply wars with everything we've come to expect from the genre. Strike thatmob dramas have had among film's greatest payoffs, but with a jaw-dropping realism that shakes you deep down. As terrific as "Gangster Squad" plays late '40s dress-up, it does so with the intent of glorifying both the era as well as organized crime and law enforcement. If you like your movies slick, "Gangster Squad" will fail to disappoint you as you might be lead to believe it will, but if you prefer something that gets its hands dirty and doesn't care much for looks (more of a Sly Stallone type gangster film), you won't find it here. There's a reason Ryan Gosling and Josh Brolin are the heroes here.Honestly, I applaud Fleischer's choice to focus on the glitz; after all, this is set in Los Angeles and Cohen had over-the-top aspirations. The script's choice to be more of a fast-talking action film was probably not as necessary. Regardless, going into "Gangster Squad" anticipating an action film done in '40s costumes will greatly improve its entertainment level.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
Something about mythical fantasy and smoking weed suggests that a combination of the two should work. Epic quests, magic herbs and ridiculous, raunchy humor could have all gone to the same high school but never gotten a chance to become friends. "Your Highness" consequently brimmed with potential as the first "high" fantasy flick, especially coming from the team that successfully combined stoner comedy with a crime thriller in 2008's "Pineapple Express." Yet crammed into the same space, these different genres weaken each other and "Your Highness" falls short of anyone's fantasy.Director David Gordon Green and in particular star and co-writer Danny McBride have not had any misfires to this point, at least as far as making entertaining films. But while "Your Highness" isn't a total bore, it commands no attention either. Thadeous (McBride) is the lazy, worthless hornball of a prince who envies his charming and heroic older brother Fabious (James Franco). After a successful quest, Fabious comes home to wed his newfound bride, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel). But when the evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux) interrupts their nuptials and kidnaps Belladonna in hopes of impregnating her to fulfill an evil prophecy, Thadeous and his squire Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker) must aid his brother in stopping him and saving Belladonna. On their adventure they must seek a powerful sword hidden in a labyrinth, escape treachery and befriend a crafty maiden warrior named Isabel (Natalie Portman).A predictable and cliché fantasy plot can and should be excused in a movie of this sort, but lazy humor and forced expletives shouldn't. Those who know McBride's brand of humor  in particular as seen on his HBO show "Eastbound & Down" know that his trademark is the effective use of swearing and perverse comments. They come in no short supply in "Your Highness," but it felt like the fantasy element, possibly even the English accent, tongue-tied him in a way. In other words, the swearing and raunchy dialogue isn't any less than usual, but it's less effective in this fantasy context. In the instances when various four letter words get the laughs, it's because they seem unexpected. McBride and longtime friend and co-writer Ben Best needed to either dial down the quantity and commit fully to or away from the medieval speak. If nothing else it's just indecisive.This wouldn't be as much of a problem, however, if they hadn't written an overwhelming majority of the humor into the dialogue and instead focused it into situational humor. The few situational comedic moments there are work nicely, but they're fleeting.As a fantasy film, "Your Highness" actually had moments of sincere creativity. The five- headed serpent sequence worked the best by far of all the action scenes in terms of both style and creative thinking. Perhaps the approach of making a fantasy film and letting the comedy follow instead of trying to make a fantasy comedy might have helped. Most cult fantasy movies were born this way, though understandably that was the '80s and things have simply changed a lot since then."Your Highness" boils down to a mixed bag of penis and vagina jokes, f-words and over-the- top special effects. It could well be considered the exact opposite approach taken to fantasy comedy of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." This film's best enjoyed by extremely high young people or nine-year-olds with active imaginations who have never seen an R-rated movie before. The laudable moments, though present throughout, dissipate before they can improve the overall experience of the movie.Even after seeing this experiment blow up in the faces of some actors and directors I respect, watching this film there still seems to be the potential to effectively pull off modern comedy in the fantasy context. It just needs to be more clever, and "Your Highness" doesn't care about being clever, even if at times it appears capable.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com
Books and films about the past are often made because they resonate with the time in which they are published or released. No example is more fitting than "Charlie Wilson's War," which shows how what was once a great--albeit covert--American success in Afghanistan in the 1980s had far-reaching consequences that we deal with today. It's a film that teaches us to be mindful of the past and to be conscious of how our current actions might affect the future.Director Mike Nichols, though certainly a capable director, doesn't do much to add to this film. This writer's film, a great screenplay delivered by West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin. Clearly there's no arguing he's got the credentials to deliver "Charlie Wilson's War," originally a book by George Crile. It's smart, witty, intellectual and there's plenty of spice mixed in. Then of course you have incredible talents delivering the script: a writer can't ask for better than Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.The film centers on Texas congressman Charlie Wilson, a whiskey-drinking womanizer who doesn't claim to be anything else. He's a paragon of the immoral politician and this sets him up to be not only a great character, but someone who will certainly learn a thing or two. Hanks gives him the perfect dose of Southern charm to woo you away from dwelling on his sexist behavior and questionable politics. Somehow, Charlie is raptured by what he sees going on in Afghanistan, where the Soviet Union has been unleashing air attacks. With the influences of a wealthy Houston woman (Roberts), Charlie manages to increase funding for countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan to defend themselves. With the help of the CIA and agent Gust Avrakotos (Hoffman), he is able to keep it quiet so that the country doesn't even know that it's really fighting a war.Since this is a political drama, there's a lot of talking, which makes the characters even more critical. In addition to Hanks, Hoffman provides some comic relief with his character's quick temper and foul mouth. It's just what a film with no action needs to stay interesting. The 90 minutes length is also helpful.What makes this film go from good to very good is the knowledge that the viewer brings in. Twenty years from now this might not make an impact on your average viewer with no sense of today's War in Afghanistan. Knowing that arming these countries with weapons to fight Communism was going to come back and bite us in the form or our own war with these countries makes the process of how Wilson went about this all the more interesting.
When you look at body of work of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, nothing could incorporate those styles more poetically and literally than "From Dustk Till Dawn." It could well be argued that their styles are mashed together like peanut butter and jelly rather than blended, the result is something fun and memorable nonetheless.The first half of "From Dusk Till Dawn" serves up a crime drama with Tarantino's signature chaotic edge along and spurts of intense violence. Without any context, it's another wonderfully tension-ratcheted Tarantino film. Then our main characters go to check out the Titty Twister bar and strip club and suddenly we're handed gory over-the-top grindhouse mayhem.The only through-lines in the film are the characters. Performances from George Clooney and Harvey Keitel in particular make for a terrific overall film experience. Movies this screwy don't usually have the pleasure of such commanding talents, but "Dusk" has them and flaunts them. What we'd do 15 years later for Clooney to play a character like Seth Gekko again ...Gekko and his brother Richie are two thieves on the run. After blowing up a roadside convenience store, they run into father (Keitel) and his two kids at a Texas motel and decide to force them at gunpoint to take them over the border. Seth is smart and cocky whereas his brother clearly has some kind of mental disability in addition to being a sexual deviant. Throw all that out the window, however, when the entire lot of them are attacked by vampires.Keitel's Jacob Fuller is a God-fearing man who puts family first and the Gekkos and later vampires test that in different ways. Characters this likable never find their way into films like "Dusk," but Tarantino characters have their own category. We empathize completely with Jacob's desire to keep his kids safe above all else.The creativity of the obscene B-movie side of "Dusk" (should I call it "Dawn"?) makes Act II something worthy of enjoying all on its own. The makeup and visual effects work together in such a way that they form caricatures of vampires. We tend to laugh at the corniness of monster makeup, but the crew here has a self-awareness. They make "Dusk" freaky and hilarious all at the same time, never allowing the audience to dismiss it as total shlock.It's clear that as much as Tarantino and Rodriguez love these kinds of movies, they're not merely imitating the genre. They're giving it the quality of ingredients that only excellent filmmakers can provide. The only things holding it back are the grindhouse genre's inherent weaknesses and general confusion over why the first part of the film ultimately has nothing to do with the second. Those who like both filmmakers' styles will find "From Dusk Till Dawn" quite satisfying in all its imperfection.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out my site, moviemusereviews.com
If you hadn't caught on to the fact that the success of superhero movies lately has been because of origin stories, then this film's title should have rung the bell. "Batman Begins" is all about Bruce Wayne: the man, the mystery, the legend and dives straight into the heart of one of comics' most infamous crime-fighters. It's exactly what a lover of the modern superhero film could hope for. Not only that, but this total rebirth of the Batman franchise is actually preferable to the original two films. While those films may have a place in your heart, trust me that "Batman Begins" will make you shun half the original films, deny their existence, and insist that Christopher Nolan direct 3 more--which he very well could."Batman Begins" is essentially a character study of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Bale). Bale's version of the Caped Crusader is excellent. He's tough, ruthless, gutsy, gets down both the playboy and the hero and is also somewhat mysterious and feels hard to crack. The film's first 45 minutes are all about telling his story--the death of his parents and an incident with bats-- which fuels his anger as he trains to fight his fears and develop the martial arts skills that being Batman will require of him. The rest of the film is Wayne's return to Gotham City to become Batman and try and save a corrupt city.I don't want to get too much into the plot other than to say it's of classic superhero diabolical nature. Some might be let down that the film's lens is so firmly fixed on Wayne, it doesn't permit for a strong antagonist. It's not as much about the bad guys themselves, but what they stand for and how they clash with Bruce's morals and ideology. To be blunt, "Batman Begins" is relentless with its thematics, constantly pushing the themes of overcoming fear, crusading for justice and making a difference all while staying true to one's self. The focal point of an overwhelming percentage of the dialogue is on getting these themes across. As much as that is the case, I can gladly say that nearly all of it feels natural and not awkward, which is impressive. It is simply so common that Nolan makes it part of the film's feel.Don't hear me wrong, "Begins" is loaded with action and gadgets and has the distinct feel of a comic adaptation. It even has enough one-liners and "this time the joke's on you" lines to make you giddy, but it all relates back so flawlessly to the themes, which is really where this film does its best work. Next to that, Nolan imagines an excellent Gotham City that feels both very real and very comic-like.My only real beef with the film is the weak link in its all-star cast chain: Katie Holmes. She's so hard to believe and 90% of those lines that do feel cheesy come from her. I think it's something to do with her really tight cheeks. A performance worthy of noting on the other end is Cillian Murphy as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow. He's excellent at doing both the real and the very characterized acting.Anyone who was skeptical of such a quick rebirth of this franchise will be more than pleasantly surprised by this film. This has the potential to be an incredible franchise by the time Nolan and Warner Bros. are done with it--perhaps one of the best superhero franchises of all time. Its combination of both the real and comic book universe has infinite entertainment and overall quality potential.
Since Judd Apatow took the crown of hit comedies in 2005 with "40-Year-Old Virgin," his films, and essentially comedy, has gotten dirtier and dirtier, or at least more not holding back the censors and settling with an R rating. If this is indeed true, then "Superbad" could very well be the apex. All the stuff guys think about or talk about only with their closest friends is the heart of the dialogue and it makes "Superbad" all the more super.Essentially a teen comedy, "Superbad" is about two best friends named Evan and Seth (named for the writers who based the film off their high school years: Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen of "Knocked Up") who are nearing the end of their senior year and are pretty much just foul- mouthed losers. Jonah Hill as Seth in particular. Hill, who made appearances in previous Apatow films, gets top billing here and much deserved. His lines are always the ones that your really dirty subconscious would say if you didn't beat it down constantly and that delivery along with his goofy appearance is his specialty. Michael Cera as Evan, however, is perhaps the half of the duo that makes it all work: his soft-spoken, "under-your-breath" humor balances out the loud, attention- sucking Hill--a quality not typical of comedic actors but something that suits Cera really well. He also makes the more meaningful, awkward high school years truth to the whole film work effectively to take "Superbad" somewhere beside the bathroom to get its mouth washed out with soap.The plot all takes place in one day when Seth gets invited to a party (a real party!) of a girl he has a mad crush on. To please her, he promises to bring the booze with his non-existent fake ID. Enter Fogle, the scrawny friend-out-of-pity with the quintessential nerd looks who has a fake ID that says "McLovin'" and it all goes crazy from there.What really makes this film win you over is how relatable the situational comedy is. Even if it all gets blown out of proportion, the way the characters handle it is so true to teenage life. It's easy to label "Superbad" as a teen comedy, but it goes beyond that--it clears the hurdles of the trash high school comedies that infested the early half of the decade and plus, it's rated R. This is a comedy truly for best buddies to recall their ridiculous high school days. Even if you didn't do the things Evan and Seth do in the film, your friendship was similar-- everyone's was/is. So no matter how outlandish and bizarre "Superbad" gets, it never warrants an eye roll because the characters are so strong.
What makes "Die Hard" so good is that it still holds its own in the 21st century despite changes in the way films are done and special effects are created today. It set up a framework for which other action films could be successful, adding new equations to the action blockbuster formula.The plot is the first demonstration of a "scenario thriller," or a plot that revolves around one single event and/or place. It's' simple: terrorists are attempting to steal from a wealthy businessman so they hold up and rig the building. One 90s film that for sure got its legs from "Die Hard" was "Air Force One." Part of what makes "Die Hard" so good is that it sets up a premise that is easy to follow but also suspenseful. It creates its twists and turns within the main line of the plot, so you can see it all coming if you think about it, but it keeps the intensity up.Next step toward success is John McClane. You have an off-duty cop thrust into the vortex of something that he had no intention of getting involved in. It is the birth of the unsung action hero in a sense, the rebel who has what it takes, but never really knew it until he is forced into a situation. Part of what makes McClane such a good character is that while he is bad ass, he shows signs of humanity, praying that the cops will show up to help him and talking to himself.While not the film's strong suit, the subplot between McClane and his wife makes the plot work better and provides some more footing for the plot itself. Even the relationship formed between McClane and Sgt. Powell as they struggle to get the higher ups to believe them is an important part of the film. It's not exactly well put together, but it helps with the film's main goal of being a great action film, giving it just the extra amount of suspense.Lastly, the action is just good and the relationships between McClane and the terrorists is great and sometimes amusing. When McClane comes face to face with Hans Gruber, the head terrorist, and doesn't know it's him, you have a dynamic unique to action films. There's a lot of great clever action moments and stuff blows up, which is always a plus when it's not the center of what goes on. It's worth watching "Die Hard" just in respect to a film that inspired many of the great action films we watch today.
Every so often it's nice to take in a breath of fresh air from today's over-sexed teen comedies. "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" doesn't exactly absolve itself here, but it bravely doesn't lean on sex like a comedic crutch either. It's a sweet and sometimes even naive teen romance -- not terribly clichéd, but not terribly funny either. "Nick and Norah" remains steadfast in the belief that movies more closely resembling reality are inherently better and it makes an okay case for it.The movie takes place all in one night as music-loving rich teenagers from suburban New Jersey head into Manhattan because some apparently amazing band that never reveals the whereabouts of their concerts is said to be performing sometime that night. Nick (Michael Cera) is the recently dumped member of a band composed of himself and three gay friends who play a gig early that night, when he meets Norah (Kat Dennings "40-Year-Old Virgin") the be yourself type girl that tells it like it is and loves music for music's sake. Both pretend to be dating for split second to upset Tris (Alexis Dziena), Nick's manipulative ex and Norah's pushy friend. From the get-go we know Nick and Norah will end up together for real; the only question is how long will they have to fend off annoying supporting cast members before it happens?Cera and Dennings are good. Much to my surprise, Cera's restrained/quiet humor style that made him the ultimate lovable loser character in "Superbad" and "Juno" holds off from getting stale at least one more film, perhaps because "Nick and Norah" relies more on natural teenage awkwardness for laughs than the contrived dialogue kind. Dennings is the film's real talent. We're more in touch with what her character is feeling and going through than any other. Unfortunately, as unfair as it both sounds and is, her rebellious goth look will probably always limit her career.The only other likable supporting roles in the film are Cera's gay van-cruising buddies. Major kudos to the acting and direction here -- never before has a movie handled gay characters so normally, as sad as that sounds. The gay characters are sweet and not horrifically over- stereotyped like nearly every comedy. In other words, they come off as characters who happen to be gay, not "let's put gay characters into this story." They're the most sincere and likable roles in the film. The cameos in the movie are also first rate, from John Cho to Andy Samberg.Other roles such as Norah's drunk stereotype friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) who throws up a lot and has the movie's worst recurring gag with her Violet Beauregarde chewing gum habit, are petty annoyances to the natural chemistry of Cera and Dennings. The ex-girlfriend is another one of those parts, but at least we're supposed to hate her."Nick and Norah" is one of those movies that will never amount to anything more than "cute." It's a love story that successfully gets us to want its main characters to be together, charming us long enough to overlook its overall okay-ness and generally praise it for not laying on the raunch like most of its kin.
Heading into "World War Z," all expectations need to be tossed and burned. Once you read the book and watch any trailer, it's clear that the Paramount wanted to make a large-scale zombie film and felt more comfortable basing it on established source material than an original story. Hard to blame them, for as well as Max Brooks creates a portrait of war through documentary- like post-war accounts, very little of his novel could be characterized as cinematic. For a total reinterpretation, however, "World War Z" manages to be a welcome addition to the worldwide pandemic/zombie genre. The script speaks to the power of many minds being better than one, with Matthew Michael Carnahan ("State of Play"), "Lost" writers Drew Goddard ("The Cabin in the Woods") and Damon Lindelof ("Prometheus") and a story by J. Michael Straczynski ("Thor"). Director Marc Forster, as well, shows he's a more capable action director than "Quantum of Solace" gave him credit for. "World War Z" manages to create suspense and intrigue despite being far from the first film about society breaking down at the hands of rabid flesh-eating zombies.Zombies all too often go hand-in-hand with the horror genre, but "World War Z" plays out as more of a thriller and a survival film. Brad Pitt's Gerry Lane must work with the government to uncover clues toward a possible cure, and he also must run for his life when things take a quick turn and his or his family's safety is compromised. His quest takes him to South Korea, Jerusalem and Wales.There's little to "World War Z" that doesn't meet the eye. It works primarily as an exercise in tension and thrives on its ability to lend a certain freshness to the genre. Although nothing about the film is unfamiliar to any fan of zombie flicks, Forster gives us the sense that we're experiencing it all for the first time, playing off any prior knowledge of zombies we might feel we have, in a sense, in order to keep us on our toes.Although mostly just a gore-less version of "28 Weeks Later," "World War Z" manages not to do anything too stupid to insult the genre or draw negative attention to itself. Considering how far it veers from the popular source material, "World War Z" was ripe for derision from fans and critics, but its ability to work as a suspenseful thriller manages to save its value as a blockbuster.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Despite its fourth director in five tries and even a new screenwriter, the Harry Potter franchise takes a huge step forward in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," based off the fifth book in the young adult fantasy series by J.K Rowling. Whereas Harry's character growth took a backseat in the Mike Newell-directed fourth film, "Goblet of Fire," "Order of the Phoneix" restores our protagonist to a place of inner turmoil where he is set to achieve great personal growth.British TV director David Yates takes on the task of directing Michael Goldenberg's (2003 remake of "Peter Pan") script and the results are deeper and darker than Harry Potter has ever gone before on the silver screen. Gladly, Yates' favorite Potter film prior was the third, "Prisoner of Azkaban," directed by Alfonso Cuaron, who took a much more character-driven take on the series, which resonated more with most fans and critics. Yates successfully restores the series' intelligence and wit, remaining magical and mysterious but also full of tension and excitement. The pacing is quick like "Goblet of Fire," but our portrait of Harry is in greater detail.In "Order of the Phoenix," Harry (Radcliffe) takes a step closer to his destiny as he learns more and more about Voldemort (Fiennes), the man who killed his parents and has tried to kill Harry in the past. Although Voldemort has returned, the Ministry of Magic, the governing body over wizards and witches, have been denying it to the public and spinning it to make Harry and his headmaster at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore (Gambon) look like conspirators. That brings Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to Hogwarts, a power-hungry old woman who takes the school under her control and fills it with propaganda. Harry and his friends must now take things into their own hands to prepare for Voldemort's inevitable rise to power.As Voldemort's return to power looms fast-approaching in the distance, a dark overtone sweeps through all of this film and Yates is sure to use proper foreshadow to keep it so. His ace is Staunton, the series' most vivid antagonist to date. She's deranged in the pink and frilly sort of way and takes over Hogwarts with a laugh and a smile. In response, Harry forms an underground club where he teaches magic self-defense to fellow friends and students such as the usual Ron and Hermione (Grint and Watson), more extensive parts from Neville (Matthew Lewis), Ginny (Bonnie Wright) and Harry's crush Cho (Katie Leung) and new character Evanna Lynch as the odd and spacey Luna Lovegood. But the film belongs to Radcliffe. This is his most trying performance as Harry yet and he meets great success. Harry is having constant nightmares in the story in addition to the one unfolding before him. Radcliffe really has to juggle anger, fear and his new role of leader. Thanks to some great writing and direction too, we understand exactly what Harry's going through at every turning point.Most thrilling, however, is we get to see wizard fighting wizard action for the first time. It's beautiful, scary and really intense. Choreographer Paul Harris helps turn this wand-fighting into an art form and the visual effects crew does the rest with sparks flying and characters zooming about in puffs of smoke. Action can finally be added to the list of genres that Harry Potter applies to and without embellishment.Just as Harry Potter begins to embrace his destiny in this film, "Order of the Phoenix" accepts the darkness that these books naturally have evolved toward and it does so with not only great visuals that bring the novel to life, but with Harry's inner struggle. Yates understands this and as long as he's there, we can count on the remaining two adaptations to do great justice to this story.
Don't mistake the gay characters and situations of "I Love You, Phillip Morris" for being original story components. Sure, not many movies of this caliber are so carefree and open about homosexuality, but underneath, the fact that the main character Steven Russell (Jim Carrey) is gay has no bearing on the story John Requa and Glenn Ficarra are telling. Although it certainly dresses it up and gives it its own flavor, Russell's story is about embracing who you are and finding something  in this case a love  worth living for.That said, Requa and Ficarra embrace the gay world of "Phillip Morris" unabashedly. The film enjoys regular bouts of vulgarity, especially sexually explicit language and a fair share of both depicted and implied gay sex. Those viewers that are still getting over "Brokeback Mountain" might want to look for other forms of entertainment. Those who can't look past the gay humor will almost certainly see "Phillip Morris" as nothing but bizarre and, well, queer.Steven Russell is a church-going Southern man with a beautiful wife (Leslie Mann) and family, yet he's been gay as long as he can remember. After a devastating traffic incident, he has an epiphany that he can no longer live in this picturesque lifestyle and must embrace who he is. He moves to Miami where being a tasteful gay man comes with a price tag, which leads him to commit insurance scams among other cons to pay for his new lifestyle. When the law finally catches up with him, he lands in prison where he meets Phillip Morris (McGregor), a fellow gay inmate who's more tender and much less Type A. Steven then realizes he can pull similar cons in prison to make his and Phillip's relationship work. Eventually he secures their release from prison but Steven's lies continue.Carrey and especially McGregor give noteworthy performances. Known for his acting eccentricities, Carrey channels them appropriately into playing a gay man, but more so a man who won't hesitate to cheat the system to have the life he wants. He's desperate in a mentally disturbing way, willing to go as far as killing himself (numerous attempts no less) in order to lead that life and not get caught. Despite appearing in the film's title, McGregor is far less critical to the story except in serving as Steven's one true desire, but he infuses the film with a sweetness that allows it to succeed as a romance.The film charts Steven's lack of progress when it comes to learning his lesson, namely that there are consequences. He simply can't understand why Phillip can't see that he's bending all these rules for the sake of their love. Carrey balances the innocent quirkiness with a sad desperation; Russell ranks as one of his best character portraits, without question.Requa and Ficarra milk the gay humor and con man high jinks to give the film its off-beat tone, but the story has a nice simplicity to it. That simplicity could easily be overlooked given how loud and foul the film behaves at times, so perhaps the directors would do better to dial back a bit instead of incidentally masking the depth and message of their film. Regardless, the two handle homosexuality appropriately by avoiding flagrant stereotyping and creating complete characters.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
You may have seen a neo-noir film before, but after you've seen "Brick," nothing else seems deserving of the label. Rian Johnson's film doesn't simply utilize the language and plot structure of the noir, but actually adds to the genre's legacy by so successfully transposing it into a modern setting."Brick" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Brendan, a high school loner in Southern California who in the film's powerful opening images we see looking over the dead body of his ex-girlfriend, Emily (Emilie De Ravin). Rewind back two days and we learn that Emily got herself in trouble and tried to keep Brendan out of it, saying something about a Pin and a brick. With that information, Brendan launches himself into a fearless investigation of Emily's death and along with the closest thing he had to a friend, high school insider The Brain (Matt O'Leary), because to stick his nose into a local dope ring.Johnson's script does not ease viewers into the noir style or this contemporary noir world he has created. Brendan confronts everyone he knows to be connected with Emily in an abrasive, even violent style, cracking off dialogue like he's the second coming of Humphrey Bogart. At the same time, if you can follow along closely, you'll pick up on all the ways Johnson has tweaked the noir language to fit a high school context. The film even gets downright funny in this regard on a few occasions, like when Brendan gets his balls busted by the assistant vice principal (Richard Roundtree), with whom he eventually strikes a deal, a relationship that echoes how private investigators have to cooperate with the police."Brick" can be difficult to follow, but in a way that makes it even more like the '30s and '40s noirs it brilliantly echoes. The pacing is quick, and Johnson always has a new carrot to dangle in front of Brendan and consequently us as well. True to the genre, seeming friends become enemies and seeming enemies becoming allies. Brendan is bounced from character to character in order to gather all the information he needs, playing people off each other if he must and concealing his love for Emily amidst it all. After consulting an old flame (Meagan Good) in the drama program and Dode (Noah Segan), one of Emily's lovers since her split with Brendan, Brendan quickly realizes he's dealing with the school's firmly entrenched dope ring and must get in if he wants to know the truth. He becomes entangled with doe-eyed beauty, Laura (Nora Zehetner) whom he doesn't know if he can trust, the mysterious Pin (Lukas Haas) and his hotheaded muscle, Tugger (Noah Fleiss).Even though the characters are all in high school and the script occasionally takes time out to let us appreciate the humor of teenagers behaving like '40s gangsters, "Brick" has extremely violent and grim tendencies. Film noir generally has a slick, shadowy look and given the era, portrays violence in clean fashion, but Johnson enjoys interrupting his more beautiful shots with bouts of face-punching and enough blood to keep you on edge. He almost completely distracts us from the unlikelihood of such violence from teenagers, or at least how calm and collected the characters are with such violence.Teenagers are emotional creatures, which should make noir a bad fit. Brendan never flinches unless his life is an immediate danger. We are to believe only that he loves Emily by the way he so relentlessly pursues the truth, not by anything we see in his face and certainly not by anything he says. Only Dode shows that fragility, though he's an ancillary character, and Tugger as well to a lesser extent. Yet still, "Brick" remains a captivating mystery. If Brendan were on a quest to find who stole all the homecoming decorations, the entire concept would probably have tanked, but Johnson keeps everything high stakes and we buy in to the whole thing.Also remarkably impressive is how Johnson turns So Cal suburbia into a noir setting, which is typically, the dark, seedy and dangerous urban environment. He also has characters who can't legally drink, so that hallmark isn't at his disposal either. During one scene, a bunch of The Pin's pushers sit in his house drinking milk that his mother is pouring for them, completely oblivious to their activities. Johnson doesn't work too hard to make the script funny, but when he inserts a joke like that, it somehow doesn't detract from the intensity of the central plot.But Johnson's imagery really seals the deal for "Brick." He can easily make the film more tragic, poetic, gritty or clever whenever he desires. He does all four with a deft hand suggesting he will never struggle to do magic with a script so long as its halfway decent. As finessed as the dialogue is and as exciting as the twists turn out to be, you're far more likely to remember "Brick" for the many powerful visuals.The few noir films we get these days usually only mimic or borrow a technique or two from this classic genre. Most would probably consider it extinct, but "Brick" feels like a significant and genuine new chapter to the genre's history, or more succinctly, has proved it can have new life in a modern context.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Every so often a film comes around and reminds us that film exists as an art form, not merely as gripping or entertaining storytelling. Like an abstract painting, a film is allowed to be devoid of a singular purpose and instead aim to affect us and withdraw a reaction. David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" served as that reminder in 1986, creating a portrait of small-town America that intrigues, haunts us and even makes us chuckle."Blue Velvet" at a narrative level, functions on the principle that we are all intrigued by the darkness in this world, even if we're not ready to handle it. Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), is college-aged, returning home after his father is hospitalized. One day he discovers a severed human ear in a field near his home and decides to turn it in to the police. In doing so, he meets a detective's 18-year-old daughter, Sandy (Laura Dern), who tells him how she overheard her father discussing the name of a night club singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) being involved in the case. Tickled by curiosity, Jeffrey enlists Sandy's help to spy on Dorothy, but when Dorothy catches him in her apartment one day, Jeffrey gets personally tangled up in the matter.Once again, the presumption for this film to work is that these two naive kids let their curiosity get the better of them, perhaps because their lives are devoid of intrigue. The scenes between Jeffrey and Sandy seem to come right out of "Happy Days," or any '50s and '60s- based film. "I can't figure out if you're a detective or a pervert," Sandy asks Jeffrey, which finally addresses the strangeness of the matter at hand, that two otherwise young strangers have formed a relationship based on a shared interest in voyeurism. By the time we would find out Jeffrey's answer (he says "that's for me to know and you to find out"), it's already too late.Caught in Dororthy's closet, Jeffrey  and subsequently the viewer  are exposed to some frightening horrors, a simultaneous loss of all forms of innocence. When Frank (Dennis Hopper) comes over, inhaling either helium or some other drug through a breathing mask, we're introduced to one of film's most dark and disturbing characters. Frank beats Dorothy and rapes her in a bizarre manner as she wears a blue velvet gown. The significance of the blue velvet comes from the classic Bobby Vinton song that Dorothy sings at her club and Frank is quite fond of it. Turns out that Frank has some kind of control over Dorothy and Jeffrey plans to discover why. But when Dorothy seduces him, it complicates matters.Hopper delivers a truly frightening performance, made all the more effective because Lynch puts us squarely in Jeffrey's shoes. He seems to understand exactly how we would feel caught on the other side of the fence, and MacLachlan exudes that innocence and naive determination to confront evil.It seems grossly amateur to call a David Lynch film a story of "good and evil," but "Blue Velvet" does not present archetypes of those concepts with exception of Frank embodying nothing good. His film provides a visceral, brain-jarring punch using excellent scene composition and overt symbolism. Although you'll be dying to know why Lynch has done these many unsightly things to get this reaction out of you, patience is key. Eventually we are left with nothing but our own reaction to interpret, which all high art should succeed at doing. Like many of Lynch's other films, I would expect a more enjoyable second viewing, knowing now that the events of the film are secondary to how they're supposed to make you feel.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Any John Steinbeck title-turned-film tends to scare away contemporary viewers with thoughts of two-plus hours of depressing country drama, but we often forget how radical Steinbeck was for his time, particularly with his Depression-era Dust Bowl novel "The Grapes of Wrath." With an adaptation by one of Hollywood's first great directors (and greatest frontier/Western director) in John Ford, this film is anything but a classic adapted for the screen just for the sake of it.Starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, "The Grapes of Wrath" centers on Joad, recently paroled after killing a man in self-defense, and his large family (including parents, grandparents, uncle, sister, brother, etc.) traveling out to California after being forced out of their Oklahoma home in search of work. This one flame of a new life out west, however, slowly begins to flicker away as they find out more and more that they're one of thousands competing for the same few hundred low-wage contractor jobs.The realization creeps up on the characters and even ourselves. A whopping 70 years later, if you come to the film without putting your history cap on, you'll almost be convinced the Joads have a shot. Screenwriter Nunnally Johnson hinges much of the film's movement on moments of realization, creating a growing shadow. Ford gives each scene a chance to sink in with his lingering closing shots that slowly fade to black. These are ancient foreshadow techniques, but Ford reminds us why they're timeless.The building tension keeps "Wrath" from festering too long in thoughts about good and evil and what actions make a man one or the other, which was sort of radical thinking for the Depression era. The former preacher Casy (John Carradine) who lives like a hobo and claims he no longer has the spirit because he cannot determine automatically what is right or wrong anymore was more progressive than we realize. Occasionally the script will go back on itself or insert somewhat needless moments of pause for Ma Joad (Oscar winner Jane Darwell) to sermonize about Steinbeck's themes, but audiences probably needed to be hit over the head with this stuff in 1940; it is a different philosophy, that's for sure.Tom Joad's famous speech to Ma as he leaves his family to go off and fight the cause ("wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there ... ") is one of the earliest American "one person can make a difference fighting for what he/she believes in" speeches on camera. Since 1940 we've had so many more examples of real life people who have stood up for a cause and fought injustice. "The Grapes of Wrath" might seem unoriginal in that thought, but in American history, it's hardly the case. And most certainly, that message will never become irrelevant in spite of hope that it one day might be.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"Inglourious Basterds" is many things, but one thing it is not is a World War II drama. The setting is an alternate version of history, where Nazi-occupied France becomes the wild west for another of filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's Sergio Leone-inspired pulp action movies where various Jews can carry out their revenge fantasies on assorted members of the Third Reich.A true QT film through and through, "Basterds" is smothered in the director's many trademarks, and calling cards are left at each of its lengthy and dynamically suspenseful scenes. From '60s-style title cards to narrative digressions to scenes set entirely around a table, fans of the filmmaker who revolutionized the writing and directing of film in the '90s will find his seventh feature film to completely satisfy their itch.But does Tarantino's recklessly violent style have a place in telling a story that circumvents one of history's darkest chapters? That's a matter of personal taste. There's no doubting the filmmaker is in top form -- humorous and attention-grabbing, crafting some great characters and even better scenes -- but it's a style that's seen better applications than WWII.Broken into chapters, "Basterds" introduces us to a couple main story lines that lead to an ultimate objective of revenge. If not for its pulp groundings, the film could be called "Everbody Wants to Kill Hitler," for all intents and purposes. First there's Shoshanna, a young Jewish girl hiding in France who manages to escape when the farmer hiding her family confesses to the S.S. The scene is one of Tarantino's best, especially thanks to Christoph Waltz as the charming and delightfully intimidating Nazi Col. Hans Landa (aka "the Jew hunter"), whose beguiling manner clashing with the serious undertones of the plot makes his performance worthy of nothing less than an Oscar nomination.Then there are the Basterds, Jewish American soldiers under the command of Lt. Aldo Raine, a one-dimensional albeit hysterical character played just so by Brad Pitt. Raine is up for nothing but killing Nazis and making good sport of it, as is Eli Roth's character Sgt. Donowitz aka "The Bear Jew," whose weapon of choice is a baseball bat. But no matter how outrageous it all sounds, there's nothing secretly fulfilling about Jews killing Nazis and that's part of the film's problem.These stories come together in 1944, when Shoshanna is now running a movie theater (another predictable QT move) where the Nazi party hopes to show off its latest propaganda film, "Nation's Pride," inviting the biggest names in the Nazi regime including the Fuhrer himself. This happening attracts the Basterds and even sparks vengeful thoughts for Shoshanna.Of course preparing for such a plot brings need for deception, perfect fodder for these long intense scenes with inevitably violent conclusions along with of course the prowess of Waltz as Landa. Though for every brilliant set up, Tarantino brings it to climax with meaningless pulp. These violent battles and merciless killings send off vibrations that simply deaden upon hitting the air, not resonating through the rest of or after the film ends. That kind of bloody and clever outcome works great in films like "Kill Bill" or "Pulp Fiction," where there's no realism to the circumstances of the violence, but it comes off as immature in the context of WWII and the Holocaust.Perhaps I should have expected no less from the master of climactic deaths, but there's an unignorable side to "Basterds" and that's the emotional depth of the Holocaust and the terrible war surrounding it. When this sense of humor is effective, many people may feel guilty being entertained comically by "Basterds," and at other times they might find it feels stupid and pointless. Then again, many might push the historical context aside and delight in all of the style and excellent craftsmanship.So despite Tarantino's brilliance, all of which manifests itself through different scenes and character in "Basterds," nothing accounts for the rift between how many viewers think about WWII as they watch a film about it (fictional or not) and how viewers watch a Tarantino film, a genre in itself that carries its own set of expectations. It can almost be best described in this way: Either wild west Ennio Morricone music set to Jews killing Germans in WWII works for you or the clash is a bit too unnatural. Either way, you respect the talents of the filmmaker. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Rarely are films so originally and simplistically creative as "Amelie." There is so much innovation in cinematic storytelling done in this film that you can even begin to see life in a unique way. Writer and Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet takes us into the dream-like world inside the mind of his title character Amelie Poulain in a way that is exciting, entertaining and insightful."Amelie" is about a girl of the same name played by Audrey Tatou who grows up living a shy and sheltered existence that carries into her early adulthood as she works in a cafe in Montmarte mostly minding her own business. Her life changes, however, when she uncovers an old box in her flat that belonged to a boy. She sets out to find the owner and when she does, she is launched into a self-fueled mission to do justice as she sees it and silently bring good to the lives of those around her. As she does, she begins to confront the need to change her own life in the process.It's a feel-good story from the start, but what makes it interesting is Amelie herself. Jeunet shows us her imagination as well as her actions in real life and we really get a good sense of why she is who she is and why she's introverted. The scenes where Amelie watches TV and the dialogue is truly about her, or when things come to life are really clever and interesting. Tatou shows us Amelie's quiet demeanor and uncontrollable smile in a way that makes Amelie likable, identifiable and even catches you pulling for her to succeed.Sometimes the film tries a bit too much to be artsy for the sake of being artsy, but overall it makes the film more entertaining regardless. The storytelling is still very clever in that we will see Amelie doing things and setting up the events to come without understanding what she's doing and then we get to see the events unfold as she planned them and it's very satisfying. There's a lot of it and it can get confusing (especially if you're not fluent in French) but there's still a lot to enjoy from the quirky characters to the clever language.The best part of "Amelie" though is that it's a film with a big heart in addition to its big imagination. In the end it's about helping people and the small miracles we can create for others every day and how that helps us learn to face our personal challenges and make small miracles happen for us. Amelie sees how she can make a difference and that is the greatest thing that people wish for.
Nothing says 1980s cop thriller like a story of two cops that don't want to work with each other being forced to work with each other, especially when one of them is black and the other is Mel Gibson with flowing hair.There's not much to say about "Lethal Weapon" other than it got it right. Riggs and Murtaugh (Gibson and Glover) are undeniably one of the top duos of all time. After all, their chemistry was spectacular enough to bring about three more sequels. But why does the aging, skeptical black man work well with the younger, reckless, suicidal white guy? It's this huge contrast that reaches a wide audience.Because of how different they are, both heroes connect to everyone, but it's really more about how they are one person split in two. We all have a more grounded perception of our lives and our jobs like Murtaugh, but there is a part of us that wants to live on the edge and do things the bold way. That's the whole idea behind Shane Black's script and he sums it up well at the end. Of course it didn't hurt that he had one of the greatest directors of that decade bringing his work to life. Richard Donner is about as solid as you can get when it comes to action. While some of the scenes are definitely "please keep this locked up in the 80s" material, Donner does a lot to show you just how similar Riggs and Murtaugh are with camera angles and shots that compare them similarly.The plot is really only a vehicle for these characters to interact. It seems like every time the two go somewhere they are launched directly into an action sequence. There is no set up, no tension building; something merely explodes or suddenly there's a helicopter and a guy shooting at them. It's kind of ridiculous and the bad guys as a result seem way out in left- field, but the point is just how Murtaugh and Riggs respond to all these events and how they're changed. We just get to enjoy some great 80s gunfights along the way.
The best science fiction is often the kind that doesn't feel like science fiction at all. Almost always, the genre's most lauded stories and films earn that praise for never losing their human qualities in the face of elaborate story structure, futuristic props and set pieces and stylish action. That's why Hollywood so often returns to the work of Philip K. Dick, a master of idea-based science fiction. Screenwriter George Nolfi makes his directing debut with an adaptation of Dick's "Adjustment Team," a story that possesses a true human factor that Nolfi weaves up through the concept's intricacies and to the surface."The Adjustment Bureau" lacks for any reason to be labeled an action movie. The "action" of the film entails Matt Damon running away and throwing a few punches. The only intensity comes from chase sequences. Perhaps "romantic thriller" would be the best way to describe the film, for at its heart, "Adjustment Bureau" is a love story whose obstacles have been manifest into science fiction.Damon stars as David Norris, a young up-and-coming politician who seems a shoo-in for winning one of New York's U.S. Senate seats, but loses after an impulsive practical joke is caught on camera and affects public opinion. While writing his concession speech in the bathroom of the Waldorf, he bumps into Elise (Emily Blunt), a woman who captivates him instantly. She inspires him to deliver a candid speech that puts him in position for another run in four years, but disappears that evening without a trace. Days later they run into each other on a bus and David gets her number. All seems well, except that exchange wasn't supposed to happen. In fact, David and Elise are not meant to be together period.That's according to the Adjustment Bureau, a team of men in fedoras that work for a mysterious Chairman who orchestrates the fate of all. The Chairman has agents working for him, such as Harry (Anthony Mackie) and Richardson (John Slattery) who see to it that things go according to plan. Harry, in particular, has long been assigned to ensuring David follows his path, as great things are in store for him. When Harry fails to make the one thing happen that will prevent David and Elise from reconnecting, David ends up seeing behind the curtain and learning the hard truth, one that he refuses to accept. He realizes he must find a way to outsmart the Bureau if he ever wants to be with her.The classic "fate vs. free will" debate manifests itself quite poignantly in this film. Although overtly so at the onset, "The Adjustment Bureau" confronts the concept in a more direct way thanks to the brilliance of Dick's concept. What makes this film execute it right is the ever-so-critical lead chemistry. Considering the plot revolves completely around whether David has control over his destiny with Elise, creating the viewer's desire for the success of their relationship is Nolfi's most crucial task. Luckily, Blunt and Damon light up the screen, especially Blunt, who gives Elise an attitude and a foul mouth to go along with her elegance. Only down the stretch in the film's last sequence does their relationship feel forced or overblown.As science fiction, "The Adjustment Bureau" manages to cover up issues of implausibility to make you understand how the Bureau itself works and functions and using what rules. They simply represent  in human form  that which we attribute to chance. They even have a fallibility to them, which adds a nice touch that few sci fi films open themselves up to, and it allows Nolfi to insert some humor to prevent the film from getting to self-serious. Some might desire to see the Bureau as a relentless and powerful group ala hard sci fi, but this film recognizes that not all science-fiction concepts can be so pristine and perhaps they can even benefit from a few scuff marks.Not only does "The Adjustment Bureau" never lose sight of the human factor, but it also prioritizes it, which makes the film accessible to a wider audience. The film amounts to a story of love overcoming the odds, only the odds are guys in suits who can control the flow of the universe. The merging of these genres might lead to some sacrifices on both ends, but it makes for an enjoyable film with universal appeal.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Independent-spirited could be said of "Rachel Getting Married," but the film is a clear drama, it's just without all the glitz and lighting and framing. It's a "docudrama," a drama filmed like a documentary about a wedding and the dysfunctional but good-hearted people in the family partaking in it.There aren't interviews or voice overs or anything like that, but Jonathan Demme puts you there as a wedding guest, often times (even directly) suggesting that the film is just someone catching parts of the wedding on camera. The scenes and the dialog feel real 95% of the time. They are natural and not contrived. The film centers on the struggles of the bride's sister Kim (Hathaway) but even she seems secondary at times. This is about the wedding and family and how we all learn to love despite glaring problems, character flaws and deep-seated regrets.It's truly delightful to see Demme direct a film as powerful as "Rachel" again. 15 years after "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia" and he shows that he can still do meaningful storytelling. Utilizing his favorite "no tripod" technique, Demme brings a candidness and reality to "Rachel" that is unparalleled in other films. It's a risk in that it doesn't subscribe to the typical rise and fall actions of movie plots, but it's a positive one in that it portrays human drama much more like human drama plays out in real life. I challenge anyone to name a film that flows as true to real life as "Rachel" does. Excessive filming of the rehearsal dinner toasts and dancing at the party might bog some Hollywood-conditioned minds into losing attention span, but those scenes further set the film's realistic tone.Hathaway is outstanding as Kim, a woman who is clearly troubled that we make lots of judgements about, but we come to love halfway through the film despite her flaws. There's a lot of honesty and despite some of the "show" that Kim puts on, Hathaway brings us into her character's intimate, soul-opening moments. She is unquestionably gifted and one can only hope she'll start saying no to more rom-coms and yes to more dramas. Kim is so rich and complex and she teaches the audience a lot."Rachel" is a lot about being human and flawed and still loving and giving love. Rachel and Kim develop good cause to hate each other, yet they make up their differences at times in the most natural of ways. There is no key scene where Rachel and Kim talk and reconcile their differences. It happens naturally. That's what makes Jenny Lumet's script so excellent. I'm sure she had a little help from her father (the legendary Sidney Lumet ... coincidence the groom is named Sidney?) We see this family do real family things, we celebrate in their joy and empathize with their struggle, and like our own families, we forgive their poor decisions. It's an untraditional film, but the realism and honesty is something that everyone who watches this film will appreciate to some extent. With the gifted talent and thoughtful direction, it's a true gem of a film.
Disabled people having sex isn't a topic so much tiptoed around as completely ignored by  well, pretty much everyone. So at the very least, Ben Lewin's "The Sessions" has to be applauded for shattering taboos. With an outstanding performance from John Hawkes and a script that takes a brazen (i.e. open) approach to sex, "The Sessions" will at least win over hearts if not awards bodies.Hawkes plays Mark O'Brien, a role that if played by any actor with actual name recognition would be forecast as an Oscar favorite. Independent film connoisseurs know him well, and it is they who will appreciate how completely different Mark is compared to most of Hawkes' body of work, namely that Mark has a sense of humor. But Hawkes is such a natural that those who don't know him well won't find anything extraordinary about his performance. And what a shame.O'Brien was a real-life writer and poet (and the previous subject of an Oscar-winning documentary short film) who was unable to move anything below the neck due to polio and generally restricted to an iron lung apparatus. He wrote about his experience with a sex surrogate in an actual, published article and died a few years later in 1999. At the age of 36, after falling for one of his caretakers only to be spurned, he determined to lose his virginity. In the film, O'Brien is put in touch with a sex therapist/surrogate named Cheryl (Helen Hunt) who can legally assist him in a series of no more than six two-hour sessions to achieve his sexual goals. With the blessing of his priest (William H. Macy), O'Brien embarks on this life- changing journey.Lewin and Hawkes construct a truly believable and lovable character in Mark, someone with a unique sense of humor and world view. At the same time, he's not just some quirky optimist meant to inspire us into not taking our own lives for granted; he's complicated and has deep- seated emotional issues.Having not read O'Brien's piece, it's difficult to say how much in the film is result of Lewin expounding upon his own theories about him, but his close connection to Catholicism conveniently adds a moral dimension to the film that adds more perspective to the situation rather than attempt some kind of "balance" to the "debate." (Personally, O'Brien shouldn't feel any moral reprehension, but that was who we was.)It gets sticky as far as truth especially with regards to Hunt's Cheryl. Hunt's calm demeanor really makes the session scenes work, but it's when she starts to develop some kind of emotional connection to Mark that things start to feel more out of the fiction world of, say, the rom-com. If you've watched a single rom-com, you're well aware that two people engaging in sexual activities are 99 percent likely to fall for each other, regardless of what they say or do, but you'd expect something different from "The Sessions." It doesn't quite go there, but it flirts with that line more than it should considering Cheryl does this for a living and you'd expect she could keep things professional or she wouldn't be doing it.Other than Hunt's wickedly distracting attempt at a Boston accent, it's a joy to see the Oscar winner on screen again, or at least in a relevant film. Cheryl's a terrific and unique role that requires a brave actress, which Hunt clearly is.Lewin does his best work with the intimacy of the subject matter. The approach he takes to sex strips it of all its Hollywood armor, so to speak. He doesn't over-romanticize it or downplay it or tiptoe around it. If he did, the film would probably not work, but viewers who have any degree of sexual experience should identify with the raw and open approach as far a language and even nudity.Where he struggles slightly, however, is in creating a viewing guide to his own movie as the movie is going on. The film opens with a lot of voice-over narration from Mark, which feels appropriate and quite welcome given that he's a writer by trade, but as the sessions pick up, we shift to a more objective, case study perspective of him capped off by countless scenes in which Cheryl speaks into a tape recorder and dissects him psychologically, which in the context of the film, is its subtext. It's an awfully heavy-handed move that definitely holds the film back from achieving a powerful emotional climax (phrasing regretted, but unavoidable).Also, for being set in the late '80s/early '90s, there doesn't appear to be a period feel to the movie at all despite a lack of computer technology, which calls into question Lewin's eye for detail. It's a small gripe, but considering the power of the subject matter and the talent on screen, "The Sessions" could have been something truly special with a bit more care and filmmaking talent. Nevertheless, it's a highly recommendable film that's a hundred times less dreadful (emotionally speaking) than so many other films about quadriplegics and other physically disabled characters. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Short Circuit" is one of those rare '80s comedies that knows what it is. It delights in its tackiness, awkward jokes and poking fun at both the "tech movement" and Cold War dramas. It never gives off the sense that it's trying to be something it's not, staying fresh, funny and even laughing at itself.Maybe the best way to put the filmmaker's attitudes into perspective while making "Short Circuit" would be to mention that director John Badham not only made a much more serious Cold War adventure film in "War Games" a few years before, but the robot (No. 5 as he's called) at one point imitates John Travolta's dance moves in "Saturday Night Fever," another Badham film. Badham even takes to making fun of his other work using "Short Circuit."Although Badham gets the credit for making No. 5 such a lovable character (with some help from fine voice acting in Tim Blaney), the writing team of Wilson and Maddock deserve a lot of credit for the film's clever and amusing take on artificial life as well as the numerous jabs at Cold War America."Short Circuit" is about a top secret set of military robots designed by Newton (Steve Guttenberg of "Police Academy") for the military supplier he works for called NOVA. When a lightning strike fries one of the robots, he ignores his programming and escapes the facility where he meets an animal-lover named Stephanie (Ally Sheedy of Badham's "War Games") who takes him in believing he's an alien. When NOVA searches for No. 5, the robot soon develops the concept that if NOVA catches him, they will "disassemble" or "kill" him. The rest of the film No. 5 is on the run with the help of Stephanie and eventually Newton.No. 5 is a crafty robot thanks to some brilliant writing. After soaking in hours of television, he drops clever catch phrases from westerns and other films including commercial jingles as he evades his captors and even other robots in what is a hysterical sequence. Wilson, Maddock and Badham realize what a truly unique character they have to play with and they utilize him to the fullest.Admirably, everyone on this movie knows that the plot is immaterial and it's all about watching to see what goofy stuff No. 5 will do next. Both Sheedy and Guttenberg just play to the robot, seeming to laugh whenever they have to interact with him. They understand it's not about them at all and they just enjoy themselves while doing adequate acting. The only other role with any personality is Fisher Stevens as Ben, the unacknowledged Indian stereotype that loves women and butchering English phrases for comedic value. Funny, but it probably wouldn't fly in the 21st Century.It's also worth knowing that this is not as much a family film. Kids will find No. 5 funny, but there's a lot of questionable language including some sexual references. With the number of funny one-liners, "Short Circuit" is ripe for kids to repeat. Still, the comedy in this film is so much better than so many other '80s movies because it recognizes that it's goofy, which also makes the satire work better. Not Badham or anyone else tried too hard to make a quality movie and the result was that they got one.
Call me old fashioned, but I like movies with plots. I thought "stoner comedy" was just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which lots of weed is smoked and the people watching it are more apt to enjoy it high. "Grandma's Boy," however, has decided this is a full-blown niche and that stoners represent a piece of the comedy pie that need to be reached. Apparently, Allen Covert (star and producer) and the Happy Madison gang were right, but that doesn't make "Grandma's Boy" any less boring and unfunny. They might be completely stoned -- but the characters are mostly half-baked.Alex (Covert, a longtime supporting player for Adam Sandler, first-time star) is a mid-30s professional video game tester whose roommate has gotten them evicted. He could look for a new apartment, but then we don't have a movie. After trying a couple friends, he ends up living with good ole Grandma Lilly (Doris Roberts of "Everybody Loves Raymond"). She wakes him up a 6 am and has him do chores and soon he's falling asleep on the job and so the new video game sequel might not get done on deadline.Like most people, Alex deals with his frustration and eradicates boredom by either playing video games or getting high or both. His friends/co-workers all do the same thing. Most of them are virgins that live at home in addition to loving video games. They're all awkward and all with the exception of Nick Swardson and Joel Moore (only at times) their characters aren't funny. Funny if you're blazed ... sure, i suppose, but I can't say from experience.Maybe all we loser guys like is getting high, playing video games and awkwardly ogling women with specific attention on their breasts, but even so, it shouldn't be the driving force of an entire film. Neither should old women getting high on accident (saw that one coming) or being the but of gross-out sex jokes -- but that's what happens when a film isn't about anything. No conflict occurs until the last 20 minutes outside of the slight problems of being out of pot, Alex trying to get the hot girl (Linda Cardellini) to like him and the guys scrambling to finish their levels for the video game deadline.Characters can be the saving grace for these meandering stoner flicks, but aside from a lovable Doris Roberts, the aforementioned Swardson as the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates and Joel Moore's skill at making robot noises, there's little character ingenuity. Covert is a run-of-the-mill main character with no comedic dimensions, his dealer friend Dante is an inept actor and waste of screen time and Jonah Hill and Kevin Nealon are written so far into the periphery it doesn't matter.If you like movies about nothing and watching them in a state of mind and body that enhance that nothingness, "Grandma's Boy" will likely be just what you're looking for. Those who need a little more talent and wit to get on board with a comedy will be left unaffected. The most I can say for "Grandma's Boy" is that it's watchable despite its pointlessness. It won't feel like a total waste of time but you'll wish you did do drugs so you could at least have made the most of the hour and a half.~Steven CVisit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com
Euthanasia is a challenging moral issue on which there are any number of stances, but "The Sea Inside" manages to make its audience put all that aside and just pay attention to the true personal story of Ramon Sampedro.Sampedro is hard to crack. Javier Bardem had the enormous challenge of becoming a man who was so utterly convinced and so at peace with the idea of ending his own life. You can't simply chock that up to Sampedro being mentally disturbed or psychologically wounded, even if the film suggests he was more wounded than he allowed himself to admit. Bottom line is that in spite of being a quadriplegic, he had all his wits about him; he just felt death was the best way to move forward.That's not easy to understand as a viewer. The notion that nothing, absolutely nothing, would give Ramon cause to live, is tough to swallow. In the film we're treated to a number of meaningful relationships in Ramon's life. He bonds with his nephew, Javi (Tamar Novas), becomes smitten with his new attorney, Julia (Belen Rueda), and forges a new friendship with Rosa (Lola Duenas), a woman moved by his story and convinced she can help him see cause to live again. Yet his belief in his right to "die with dignity" is so totally resolute.Spanish writer and director Alejandro Amenabar and co-writer Mateo Gil give us a full range of perspectives on Ramon and his situation and keeps the movie intensely personal. We don't see many court room scenes; this is no Hollywood biopic in which the main character crusades for what he believes in and receives some swelling emotional climax for his efforts. In fact, the film leaves us on quite the opposite note with a haunting final scene as Ramon decides to take his own life when the courts will not grant him the permission to do so legally.As so many great European filmmakers tend to do, Amenabar also gives us a poetic side to Ramon's story, which in this case is especially fitting because Ramon is an excellent writer and poet. Between the title and the film's opening, it's not shy about this notion of the sea inside, which is Ramon's mental escape from his physical reality, though to complicate matters, the sea is also directly tied to how Ramon ended up a quadriplegic. We connect most to Ramon through the dream scenes, through his fantasy. Despite the limited degree of empathy we can possible have for him, we still identify so clearly with his longing and desire, and Amenabar gives this to us with such a soft, deft touch.We also see Ramon as his friends and loved ones see him. The film explores the psychology at work when someone you are so close to, someone you have helped and cared for for years and years, wishes they were dead. The degree of public attention on that wish makes it all the more challenging for these characters, many of who we like, many of whom we don't. We get to see them  just as we see Ramon  in 360 degrees.As a Western viewer, there's a definite itch to see a bit more of the technical side, to explore Ramon's story in the large context that is the euthanasia debate, but Amenabar does such a incredible job convincing us that there's no need for it. This is an issue that has a clear face, that can and maybe should be judged on a personal level. In this particular instance, there's no public debate without a personal decision. If Ramon did not want this for himself, then no one would be having this conversation.Consequently, each viewer will grapple with the issues in this movie on an intensely personal level. Personally, I went back and forth as the film did, so purely wanting Ramon to win his own personal right to decide, yet wanting so desperately for him to find cause to live. In bringing this conundrum to this personal level, Amenabar effectively captures the large-scale complexity of this issue."The Sea Inside" is a great film for the way it accesses these ideas, not so much in the power of its drama, but regardless it leaves a lasting impression.~Steven CThanks for reading!

It's hard not to appreciate the sheer intelligence behind the bombardment of absurd jokes that makes up "Airplane!" It may not be laugh out loud humor, but it's definitely top-notch laugh a lot inside your head humor.The team of Abrahams, Zucker and Zucker prove with "Airplane!" that there is a market for their brand of comedy. While over time the spoof movie has lost a lot of its touch, there is a somewhat classic quality to "Airplane!" that makes it clear why it is still funny over 20 years later. Unlike modern spoofs, the jokes are entirely based outside of a pop-culture context. While certain things were no doubt funnier in 1980, this film is not foreign in humor to those born of that generation. Plays on words and making fun of overdone movie clichés are trans- generational. "Airplane!"' is a movie that needs no plot synopsis. It really is just a necklace strung up with gags and excuses to make corny jokes that while not hysterical are endearing. All you need to know is it takes place on an airplane.While the jokes and quotes seem to dominate how one remembers "Airplane!" a lot of credit needs to go to the actors that pull these lines off without coming off as bizarre or stupid. Somehow, Leslie Nielsen, Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty make "Airplane!" feel sincere despite the outlandishness.
"Brothers" boasts great dramatic prowess and a trio of talented actors in their prime. The only thing missing is originality. The family drama caused by a father leaving his wife and kids as he's deployed to Afghanistan coupled with the terrors of post-traumatic stress disorder are - - as insensitive as it feels to say -- nothing new, at least to the world of film.Jim Sheridan's intimate film based on the 2004 Danish film from Susanne Bier, creates moments of great drama. Cpt. Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) is a devoted marine who on his most recent tour to Afghanistan gets in a helicopter accident and is presumed dead, widowing his wife, Grace (Natalie Portman) and leaving two little girls in the care of with his alcoholic Vietnam vet father (Sam Shepard) and prison parolee brother, Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal). The trailer makes this out to seem like a more serious version of the film "Pearl Harbor" with romantic feelings coming between Grace and Tommy before they know Sam's still alive, but luckily, as much as there might not be surprises, there are no clichés in "Brothers."Impressing the most is by far Maguire, who shakes his boyish looks and "Spider-Man" related typecasting to portray a young father obsessed with and completely ripped apart by war. At first it's hard to believe Sheridan expects us to see Maguire as the elder brother of Gyllenhaal, but the end of the film Maguire not only has you shaken, but also totally convinced of his character.Portman has a far more typical role in playing Grace and being asked to tackle a pair of scenes where she finds out her husband is dead and then again when her husband is alive. She's excellent as the fragile but not outwardly so "widow," but her talents could be better utilized in a more complex character. Regardless, she's spot on.If there were a Best Performance by a Child Oscar, I think hands down 10-year-old Bailee Madison as the older sister Isabelle would've won it. For someone her age, the complexity of her portrayal and ability to show exactly what she's feeling without overdoing it is amazing. Her character is incredibly mature and she is equally so. Isabelle is the child that knows what's going on and has some issues with wanting attention.The only reason "Brothers" was passed on at the Academy Awards was simply that it was straightforward. Maguire was probably inches from a nomination, but the film on the whole doesn't offer a formative experience. For intense family drama, however, not many will beat it.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Dysfunctional family antics get taken to the extreme in "This Is Where I Leave You," the story of four adult siblings who reunite in their childhood home after the death of their father, whose last wishes were for them to sit shiva, the Jewish custom of staying together as a family for seven days following the funeral to mourn and be comforted by family and friends. But the Altmans are far from religious, and each family member has his or her shtick along with problems in their personal life, and all together they drive each other bonkers in a perpetual cycle of farcical melodrama.The Altmans are a true all-star family: Jane Fonda plays the matriarch, and her children are played by Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Corey Stoll ("House of Cards") and Adam Driver ("Girls"). Along with spouses, significant others and neighbors being played by Kathryn Hahn, Rose Byrne, Dax Shepard, Timothy Olyphant ("Justified"), Connie Britton ("Friday Night Lights") and Ben Schwartz ("Parks and Recreation"), the cast is totally stacked for Jonathan Tropper's adaptation of his novel. Why they all came together for this script, however, is anyone's guess. "Leave You" is an absolutely over-the-top mess of a dark slapstick comedy trying desperately to be an introspective indie dramedy.The main character is Bateman's Judd, who weeks before getting the call about his dad walked on his wife sleeping with his boss (Shepard), but it doesn't seem so bad alongside his siblings' problems. His sister, Wendy (Fey), has two young kids and a jerk husband, his older brother, Paul (Stoll), is having trouble getting his wife (Hahn)  an ex-girlfriend of Judd's  pregnant, and his younger brother, Phillip (Driver), is dating his much older therapist (Britton) who is just like their mother. The side plots don't even end there.The script plays out like an endless round robin of family members having heart-to-hearts and exploding at each other in bouts of physical violence. Judd talks to Wendy out on the roof, fights with Paul, goes for a spin with Phillip, weeps with his mother and falls for a girl he grew up with (Byrne), all while dealing with his soon-to-be ex-wife (Abigail Spencer). The scenes barely have time to set themselves before they escalate into chaos, lust, hilarity, poignancy or whatever the end goal is. Clearly, veteran comedy director Shawn Levy is in over his head with this one. Juggling a dozen characters is easy in the "Night at the Museum" films, but illustrating the combination of grief, personal hardship, family dynamics, relationship dynamics and more has him completely out of sorts. He's a director who understands comedic timing and how to pace a film in an entertaining way, but he has no idea how to slow the script's pacing down to create empathy for the characters and allow the audience to chew on Tropper's well-intentioned themes. He also peppers in an "indie soundtrack" in hopes of creating that tone, but it only backfires given how "un-indie" the rest of the movie is.The cast is fun to watch, but the number of clichés and melodramatic moments kill any seriousness or realism they bring to their characters. The fact that the actors are such proved talents really just proves that the film's biggest problem is the plot and the way the story was strung together. They make this movie infinitely more bearable because they're funny, quality actors, but they don't tip the scales from "watchable" to "good."There's no breathing space for any of the characters and their stories, which sucks them dry of any realism and makes the whole film seem completely ludicrous. How could that much soap drama happen to one family in a week's time? As much truth as there might be to the themes of Tropper's story and that logically all these things can and do happen in relationships, there are just too many of these conflicts for one movie."This Is Where I Leave You" is a classic trap film. Casual moviegoers browsing through their rental options will surely say aloud, "Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, the director of 'Date Night' ... how did I miss this in theaters?" Well, usually there's a good reason for it.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more
Morally objectionable journalism practices instigate absurd high jinks in Howard Hawks' "His Girl Friday," based on the play "The Front Page" by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. The only thing more over the top than the rapid dialogue would be Hawks' portrayal of the newspaper business during an era where the press became part of the story rather than covering it objectively from the outside. Either way, it makes for good fun from an audience perspective.Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell star as Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson, ex husband and wife, the former the editor of a major New York City paper and the latter his ace reporter, one who intends to quit her job (and the profession for good) and remarry with a nice insurance salesman (Ralph Bellamy) in Albany. As a man on the losing of a divorce settlement who hardly has any scruples to begin with, Walter doesn't take kindly to the news and pulls the necessary strings to turn keep Hildy within his grasp. Apparently, that even means exaggerating the story of a man expected to be hanged for shooting a police officer to make it so juicy that Hildy can't stand to lose the scoop.The two have an excellent chemistry, but a kind much different than most films of that era. For one, the speaking lines are rattled off faster than usual and the banter much more hectic as a result. In ways this ups the humor because you barely have time to catch your breath in between the jokes, but at times it requires more focus than usual for a comedy. Hawks' likely desired to capture the hectic nature of 'the biz,' but it really just makes the film more ridiculous. Grant surprisingly thrives as Walter, a rather despicable role and Russell really stands out amongst the boys. It's hard to believe her character was male in the original play; she adds so much dimension and character to the film.Goofy would aptly describe "His Girl Friday" in a number of instances. It makes very light of some serious subject matters to suggest a satire of journalism in some regards, but it's mostly just insanely witty slapstick in fast motion. The character dynamic between Grant and Russell carries the first act until the goofiness takes over into a farcical second act. Although at breakneck speed, it's amusing to watch the reporters call up their news desks the second events change and start giving exaggerated accounts of everything."His Girl Friday" is not the iconic romantic comedy of the Golden Age, but then again, it was never intended to be a romantic film in any regard. Unusual for that time as well, it would probably require a second viewing to be most enjoyed as not having to figure out what's coming next would free up some time to truly listen and ingest Grant and Russell's terrific lines.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
If you look under the genre tags for "Blade: Trinity," comedy is listed. That should tell you something right there. Yeah, I must say it is a comedy, but you're laughing at the film, not at its jokes. While "Blade" set the precedent for a franchise full of sleek action and intriguing vampire lore and "Blade II" at least manage not to degrade the franchise completely by staying entertaining, "Trinity" manages to give up taking the franchise seriously and it's shameful.Apparently, David S. Goyer, who wrote the first two films and produced the second, decided he wanted a third film so bad that he decided to write and direct it himself when Guillermo Del Toro ("Blade II") decided not to return and likely when many other directors turned it down. Goyer had only minor directing experience and it shows in this film. The script could have perhaps lived up to the other two, but Goyer decided to not be shy about humor, including plenty of terrible jokes. Aside from keeping true to the stylized fight scenes of the first film, the only thing Goyer does right is continue the great pacing of these films, because despite being bad, "Trinity" never gets boring."Trinity" takes place not long after "Blade II," where Blade (Snipes) becomes wanted by the FBI who are of course corrupted by vampires led by Danica Talos (Parker Posey from the Christopher Guest mocumetaries like "Best in Show," a waste of her talent). This time, the vampires have unearthed Dracula, the first vampire, who takes the human form of a young, muscle-bound, dark-skinned Englishman (Dominic Purcell) in effort to eliminate Blade, their only real threat. Where Ryan Reynolds ("Van Wilder") and Jessica Biel (WB's "7th Heaven") come are as the "Nighstalkers" (Nightstalkers, Daywalkers...it does all get a bit confusing) a couple of gadget-loaded vampire hunters who have been running their own operation and now aim to protect Blade by helping exterminate Dracula.There's a lot going on in "Trinity" and there's really no focus or clear motivation for anything that the characters do. The film lives from action sequence to action sequence, distancing itself from any actual ideas/themes that could enhance the storytelling or deepen Blade's character. The three films have progressively gotten worse at this to the point where it's nearly non-existent. There's really no continuity in the film, with too many bad characters, actors and sub-plots. I'll give Goyer points for bringing in Jessica Biel, she's absolutely gorgeous and Reynolds' "Van Wilder" frat-boy humor makes him certainly perfect for the part, but those parts are of course horribly written. Reynolds knows his character is never taken seriously and so rather than half-ass the jokes, he just plays them up so that at least it's not awkward after awhile.Being released 2 years after "Blade II," you can tell "Trinity" was just slapped together. Goyer borrows the chin-opening model Del Toro imagined for the Reapers in "Blade II" and applies them to Dracula and a Pomeranian. He decides colored contacts are a must for vampires and that the sped up time in the city shots from the last films should be used on multiple occasions for no reason. There are also some useless scenes and weapon-loading or people-walking montages with music in the background. It's all about style and what each shot looks like, not how the film looks as a whole, which is a waste of what the series could have become based on the first film.
If Michael, Magic and Larry, etc. became the first ever "Dream Team" of basketball players in 1992, then the cast of the "Glengarry Glen Ross" should be considered the "Dream Team" of male acting. There's Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, Jonathan Pryce and Alec Baldwin. You won't find seven better names in an opening credit sequence.Together they make up the all-male cast of the film adaptation of David Mamet's play and they lend it the sheer power that this exploration of human nature through the eyes of desperate salesmen might not have otherwise had.It's no surprise director James Foley was incredible wary of taking a story that clearly belongs on the stage and turning into into a film. "Glengarry" is dialogue-driven and there's absolutely no physical action in the entire script, which takes place in less than 24 hours real time. It relies heavily on impassioned monologues and the morally ambiguous characters delivering them.The film's first major scene features an angry speech from Baldwin meant to fire up a group of slimy, foul-mouthed real-estate salesmen, explaining that whoever finishes top in sales wins a Cadillac and the loser gets fired. Firm boss Williamson (Spacey) hands the men tired leads and they complain that without the new Glengarry leads, they won't sell a thing.The highlight is a 66-year-old Jack Lemmon as Shelley Levene. I'm baffled at the fact that he received no Oscar nomination considering his status with the Academy. Levene is completely desperate: he works the old leads until he can't anymore, tries to bribe Williamson for Glengarry leads and Lemmon absolutely nails the obnoxious salesman who always has some cheap maneuver in his back pocket. Instead, Pacino got the nomination as Ricky Roma, the hotshot salesman with a serious attitude. He's excellent, but we've seen Pacino with that kind of command numerous times before."Glengarry" is a tough film, but Foley and this amazing cast sell you on it the best they can. The story leans on its characters, the talent playing them and the illustrative and attention- seizing monologues they deliver and it can lean away considering those aspects are like impervious steel. There's no way the film could be handled any better. Foley gives maximum effort to provide the most compelling angles for the dialogue, shots that will reveal as much character as possible and stimulate audience thinking. Its very open-ended themes will connect with only a chunk of its viewers, but you have to admire the absolute power that this amassing of talent commands on the screen. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
"True Romance" blossoms on a lot of levels, but it most distinctively bears the mark of an early Quentin Tarantino film. The scene dynamics and the way it plays beautifully in and out of turning points are all early signs of the would-be master at work. Released the year between "Resevoir Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction," "True Romance" doesn't carry his directorial signature, but it reeks of Tarantino in all the right ways and compares favorably with those two early '90s crime thrillers.The replay value of "True Romance" dwells in how its bounty of supporting actors all went on to outdo its two stars. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette play Clarence and Alabama, a couple who meet because Alabama was a call girl hired to sleep with Clarence as a birthday present. They fall in love and marry instantly. To put the past behind them, Clarence visits her pimp (Gary Oldman -- that's awesome supporting role number one), kills him and makes off with a half million in coke.Hunting the runaway couple are agents of a mob boss played in one 100 percent Tarantino scene by Christopher Walken and later by James Gandolfini in a breakout performance. Brad Pitt, who worked with director Tony Scott's brother Ridley as an unknown just two years before in another fugitive film, "Thelma & Louise," plays the unassuming stoner roommate of Clarence's best friend (played by comedian Michael Rapaport). Other notables are brief appearances from Samuel L. Jackson and Val Kilmer, as well as Dennis Hopper's as Clarence's father.Even with this "secret" knowledge, this dynamic works for this story, one that attempts to broaden one's definition of love to include murder, running from the law and flat out acting nuts. Clarence and Alabama are unconventional and completely stupid, deserving of losing everything, but in front of a backdrop of characters who define true moral scumminess, it becomes easy to root for them.Scott certainly helped create the suspense necessary for a dialog-heavy Tarantino script and that warrants applause, but Quentin simply owns this picture at its core. Hopper's "history lesson" where he laughs in Walken's face as he refers to his ancestors as a racial epithet showcase Tarantino's classic tension-twisting. The way a scene's momentum shifts at the drop of a hat and climaxes into pure mayhem captures his utter brilliance. The characters spanning a wide array of vivid strangeness and the sheer untamable wildness of the story and events make "True Romance" hard to forget.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"(500) Days of Summer" informs us right away that it's a boy meets girl story, not a love story. Interesting, considering our preconditioning for the romantic comedies of happily ever after, or in this case, the indie romantic comedy with "a way of working out" that has been done so many times already that "indie" is more a style than a way to distinguish the production value of a film. But avoid labeling itself all it wants (as its main characters Tom and Summer try and do), "Summer" is a love story. There might be more to it than that, but it's a story about love and how we romanticize it versus how it really is, regardless of its disclaimer. It's a bold script from first-time scribes Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber that pits RomCom convention against the harsh realities of dating. As such, it's bound to appeal to both the chick flick crowd and indie-lovers -- it will get audiences thinking more perceptively about love, while still appealing to the pleasures of escapist movie-theater romance.Like eight of the last ten indie love stores you've seen, "Summer" starts with a break-up, only it backtracks to the beginning of the relationship and tells the story from the beginning (while of course jumping back to the time of the break-up). Confused? Conveniently a counter helps us keep track of time in the film, showing us how many days into the 500 we are at all times. Anyway, Tom is a hopeless romantic greeting-card writer played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("3rd Rock from the Sun" child star and Heath Ledger look-alike) who meets a girl, Summer (big-blue-eyed rising star Zooey Deschanel). He believes he's found destiny -- she doesn't want anything serious.The two hit it off with their playful personalities and while Tom falls hopelessly in love with her, she doesn't seem to budge. We start to hate on Summer a little bit for not prescribing to this fated romance we've built up in our heads because we're all sucker's for that kind of a love story, but that's where "Summer" gets smart on us.Directed by Marc Webb, who's done music videos with Green Day, 3 Doors Down and Jesse McCartney, "Summer" does take on this whimsical quality that very much appeals to a younger generation. At the same time, he brings us realism when the movie is supposed to relate to us the most (in the bars, at the office) and that artsy quality when the writing calls for something a bit more non-traditional. He handles the contrast well, as does Gordon- Levitt, who is either playing a depressed pessimist or a head-over-heels optimist. Deschanel is also terrific, looking the part of this elusive girl with classic good looks and emphasizing her quirks as well her brutal honesty. If she can break her indie typecast, Deschanel will become one of the finer actresses of her generation.As told by the film's slightly obnoxious and inconsistently used narrator, "this is not a love story" ends up serving to prep us for the film's divergence from formula. For those that want happily ever after, it tempers this expectation, pleading with us by basically saying "please don't get get mad if the ending isn't the magical song and dance number you were hoping for." But it ends up being pretty clear what "Summer" is trying to do. It serves as the writers' own discovery of what exactly love is, how they worked out and reconciled the pain and heartbreak -- love's truths -- with this romanticized idealizing of love. Summer becomes not this cold person who is having her way with Tom because he's the one in love, but someone with simply a different understanding of love, who comes from a different place mentally/emotionally when it comes to relationships."Summer" is a great film because it combines all the cheesy energy that we love about romantic comedies with this strong sense of reality. Although the reality too can become a bit much at times, "Summer" is a film that has finally found a way to appease the masses while breaking the formula that has kept the boy meets girl story on a ball and chain for decades. It's not a perfect, but what a feat that is. ~MMRVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/
As the world's most popular superhero, Spider-Man is the poster hero for the resurgence of the superhero genre at the movies, but these days he's hanging there by a strand of webbing. When Sony gave Peter Parker a reboot in 2012's "The Amazing Spider-Man," they became the first studio to recast and reimagine an entire (and lucrative) franchise, and therefore ran the first experiment to test audiences' reactions to a reboot with the original so fresh in their memory.Results have been all over the board, and they will likely continue that way for "The Amazing Spider-Man 2." With the Spider-Man origin story out of the way, director Marc Webb and a large team of story architects including James Vanderbilt (lone remaining writer from "The Amazing Spider-Man"), Jeff Pinkner (TV's "Fringe") and the infamous blockbuster duo of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci ("Transformers," "Star Trek") had the freedom to explore new ideas and grow the scale of the Spider-Man universe.As advertised, Spider-Man battles three baddies in this film: Electro/Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), Harry Osborn/Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan) and Aleksei Sytsevich/Rhino (Paul Giamatti). Although the film narratively manages to avoid the villain overcrowding of the late-'90s "Batman" films and "Spider-Man 3," it's far from ideal.As with the Lizard in the first film, these villains stem from Oscorp, which truly emerges as evil's central address in this rebooted Spider-Man universe. The opening sequence further establishes Richard Parker's connection to Oscorp, which is completely revealed in this film after being heavily teased in the first.Along with the villains and their plots and the mystery of Peter's parents, there's Peter himself and his journey as Spider-Man, his journey of discovering the truth about his parents and his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). It's probably enough material for two 90-minute films, but it's presented instead in one 142-minute film. Something does give, but surprisingly, it's not the Peter Parker stuff, or the emotion.Webb makes the cut as an action director to be sure, but his real strength is in creating character chemistry and realistic romance. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are special together on screen, which might have something to do with their off-screen chemistry, but regardless, their performances  particularly together  are the movie's greatest asset. What could have been a melodramatic roller-coaster subplot really works because Garfield shows us how torn Peter is between his instinct to love Gwen and her father's stern warning in the first film to leave her alone. Stone's Gwen is a strong young woman who acts for herself first, and so her conflicts with Peter aren't petty, but realistic.But the real testament to both Webb, the casting folks and the writers is the relationship between Peter and old friend Harry, which has just minutes to materialize in a believable manner. DeHaan and Garfield create this honest portrayal of forgotten friendship in only a few key scenes that lead to the crucial turning points of the film. Those turning points are just okay as is, so the work in these low-key scenes proves critical.Essentially, for all the good work done in character development on Peter's end, the dreadful development of the villains acts as a counter force that fortunately only weighs the final product down so much thanks to the good elements.Let's start with Electro. Foxx is cast as a one-dimensional version of his mentally ill character from "The Soloist." An Oscorp electrician and huge fan of Spider-Man, Max Dillon lives in his own world and suffers from an inability to separate logic from his emotions. Although the character does victims of mental illness no favors, it's plausible that Dillon could become villainous under the right circumstances. That said, the film's circumstances aren't great, particularly in the realm of why the self-proclaimed Electro would want to kill Spider-Man. Electro is a cool villain aesthetically and the special effects are terrific, but he's comparable with Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze.Although Harry Osborn's motivations make a bit more sense, the film rushes through his character arc. The story asks us to pity him and then despise him with little time to make the transition. DeHaan makes the most of it, however, and shows he has quite the chops for playing a villain.Plopped in all of this is Peter discovering just what his father was up to for Oscorp and why he left him as a child. What we learn makes total sense and satisfies our curiosity to know, but the information doesn't impact the film's climax in any way. Peter does nothing differently  he still must stop Electro and Green Goblin from destroying New York  and killing him.It is easy to get lost in story details and plot points and character motivation, but "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" is also as entertaining as it should be, and more so than its predecessor. The camera-work and special effects are the stuff Sam Raimi probably only dreamed of and take the character (literally) to new heights. The use of slow-motion proves to not be cliché, but to actually let the audience see the quality of the effects, the attention to detail. The action also hits harder  PG-13 seems to be getting more and more graphic, which as a 20-something non-parent, doesn't bother me one iota.With the "Sinister Six"  a team of Spider-Man's enemies  coming down the pipeline soon, Sony needs to be a little more thoughtful about how it handles its villains, and they also should consider condensing the many themes and story lines of this new series. With just a bit more focused storytelling, their engaging, thoughtful and entertaining new "Spider-Man" could go from good to great, and meet fans' growing expectations of Spider-Man on the big screen.~Steve C Thanks for reading!

Films with a tight premise tend to be reliable; so is the combination of director Tony Scott and Denzel Washington. The two have never struck gold, but they've produced solid, dependable box-office results and audience approval. "Unstoppable" has and will continue to achieve both. 90 minutes of entertainment can certainly be as good as gold and the film proves it with its straightforward delivery.Scott and Washington hop from one train premise (2009's so-so thriller, the remake of "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3") to another. Instead of a hostage situation, however, "Unstoppable" is much simpler: what if a freight train went unmanned at speeds up to 70-plus miles per hour carrying highly explosive materials as part of its mile-long cargo? Minus a personified antagonist in the form a a wack-job (RIP Dennis Hopper), this is "Speed" the train edition.The plot, which was inspired but not based on a true story, barrels along exactly like Train No. 777. But Mark Bomback ("Live Free or Die Hard") doesn't cut the humanity out of the story. Although not entirely without awkward friction, he slides in the character development and the human angle to keep the story real. Washington's Frank and Chris Pine's ("Star Trek") Will have just enough backstory and believability to up the stakes and provide the motivation necessary for two railroad workers to put it all on the line and go after this train in attempt to slow it down. Sure, it's a bit weird that Frank would ask Will about the situation with his wife while the two are going backwards on a train at 80-90 mph, but it's earnest.In spite of the simplicity of the concept, Scott keeps things intense without overdoing it. The thriller veteran employs a great deal of tactics to increase the apparent magnitude of the situation. The only annoying one (and this is partly on the script) is the overblown live coverage of the event on the news (not to mention unrealistic). The audience knows everything going on; we generally don't need a newscaster to re-narrate it for us ("it appears he is trying to manually brake the train!"). It gets a little agitating, but the action has your attention in a vice, so it doesn't matter.Since "Unstoppable" is sort of a disaster film, Bomback finds ways of making "the man" the antagonist. Initially, it appears as if the railroad company wants to attempt to preserve the train with costs as the primary interest and not derail it and lessen the chance for civilian casualties should the train reach more populated areas. It's a small peek into how major companies handle PR nightmares such as these. One of the film's better scenes is when Frank and Will commit to disobeying the orders of the authoritative character, Galvin (Kevin Dunn of "Transformers") and verbally give him the middle finger.In essence, "Unstoppable" confines the reach of the film and infuses the core elements with enough guts to make the film entertaining and intriguing despite the sheer simplicity of concept. You wouldn't expect a film about freight trains to excite anyone except model train collectors, but there's no lack of intensity. The story certainly fits Scott's filmmaking style and Washington (as always) and Pine hold up the human aspect.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
If more folks could see "Everything Must Go," there'd be a different perception of Will Ferrell. That's not to say he gives a powerhouse performance as an alcoholic on the down and out, but he's believable, sympathetic and he's not trying too hard to be funny. Dan Rush's film doesn't try too hard either despite Ferrell's presence. The humor is muted and subtle. Rush prefers to focus on capturing what it's like when a troubled person's life can't get any worse.Despite being excellent at his job, Nick Halsey gets laid off in good part due to past drinking problems. When he returns to his Arizona home, he finds his things strewn all over the lawn and that his wife has changed the locks and codes on him. That'll drive anyone to the sauce, let alone a recovering alcoholic. Nick stockpiles Pabst Blue Ribbon and goes to live amongst his things on his front lawn.Nick gets attached to his stuff, refusing to sell it even though the only way he can remain on his lawn for six days is to have an official yard sale. His setup attracts the attention of a young boy named Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) whose mom is taking care of a sick person down the street as well as his new neighbor, Samantha (Rebecca Hall), whose pregnant with a husband who constantly travels.The script gives us no real sense of Nick's wife, job or any of his previous attachments, so we don't really empathize with him being caught between the things he has loved in the recent past and the opportunities appearing before him for a better future. We're ready for him to move on too quickly, so it's left to Ferrell to convince us of this predicament.Ferrell's performance appropriately matches the tone Rush has given the film: laid back, reflective and subtly amusing. Nick is kind of a lazy drunk, not a belligerent one, the kind of guy who simply craves a beer at all times. The Hollywood treatment for alcoholics would've felt unnatural, yet you almost crave it so that you feel more strongly about his problem. All the intensity is saved for one pivotal scene that serves to deliver the film's message. It's effective, but things spiral a bit from there.Once Nick finally starts to sell things, the script throws a final test at his character to see if he's learned anything, and that's where a few big reveals come in and twist the tone of the film. It goes from pleasant, upfront and truthful to oddly manipulative and it ruins the sense of resolution. Ferrell remains the constant through that final act storm and he deserves that recognition.If you've read this far you know this isn't a typical Will Ferrell part, but it highlights the strengths that anyone who didn't see "Strange Than Fiction" never knew he had. Nick is not the easiest character to love or understand, but Ferrell cues us in to what's going on in his mind the best he can.Even with some mistakes, "Everything Must Go" tells an honest story about personal tragedy and how we cope with the moments that bring our dignity to an all-time low.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The two most lovable stoners in movie history return in "A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas," which somehow continues the series' impressive balancing act of clever humor, crude jokes, stoner gags and heart.When you look at the franchise's three biggest stars  John Cho, Kal Penn and Neil Patrick Harris  it becomes clearer why the movies work. All three of them have gone on to be successful in all manner of films and television shows, a testament to their acting ability. If they had been written and portrayed as shallow, obnoxious stoners, this Christmas special would've been direct-to-DVD and recast with no-name actors.This third adventure takes place six years after "Escape from Guantanamo Bay," and our dear friends have stopped talking to each other because Harold has grown up and Kumar has not. Their paths collide once more, however, when a package for Harold arrives at Kumar's apartment. He courteously brings it to Harold's new house, where they reconnect and discover it's a giant joint, and they accidentally burn down Harold's father-in-law's (Danny Trejo) beloved Christmas tree.The search to replace the Christmas tree before midnight mass is on, and it takes the duo and their replacement best friends Todd (Thomas Lennon) and Adrian (Amir Blumenfeld) on less of a wild journey in terms of geography and general weirdness, but one with plenty of wacked-out sequences from claymation drug trips to NPH's recollection of his time in heaven to an R-rated riff on a classic "A Christmas Story" gag.With all the 3D pandering and psychedelic trips (every drug imaginable gets play time), "A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas" was meant to be experienced on the big screen (or a 3D LED set), but its meta jabs at the medium help ease the multitude of slow-motion shots that hurt the pacing of the movie when viewed in 2D.As a fan of the series who is not a fan of the marijuana (in the using sense), several scenes remind the sober viewers we're not high enough to watch this movie, but enough of the jokes are clever as opposed to simply balls-out. I've always found that the hallmark of the franchise is never that each installment is a laugh fest, but that it stays grounded while occasionally funnier than you'd guess it would be. This is of course thanks to Penn and Cho, whose chemistry continues to be the bread and butter of the series. That, and the reliably delightful appearance of Harris.In spite of the many examples the film puts forward that give us an opportunity to shrug it off as immature and stupid, it finds ways of being charming. How you can find yourself rooting for a waffle-making robot not included in the film for any logical reason is testament to what Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg have created.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Mel Gibson returns to suitable form in "Edge of Darkness," a revenged-fueled thriller by the producer and writer of "The Departed." It's not that anyone doubted Gibson's prowess, especially in a role with motivation as clear as "you people killed my daughter and when I prove it I'm going to make you pay in ways you never imagined." For some reason, we expected him to be rattled after eight years off which included his infamous DUI and the subsequent racist and anti-Semitic rants. The role of police detective Thomas Craven works for him. Heaps of praise are not warranted here, but this complicated mystery is a decent flick that he pilots with ease. The premise here is last year's surprise hit "Taken" mixed with your typical corporate and government cover-up thriller. The former is Gibson's specialty: adding some emotion to the hardened cop role, and these days he comes at a cheaper price than Bruce Willis. The latter is writer William Monahan's specialty, the writer who weaved together the many characters of "The Departed" into a top-notch suspense film. The issue is the two don't work in tandem as well as they should. Certain scenes are dedicated to Craven's emotional side such as hallucinations of his daughter as a child or her talking to him. Others are dedicated to Gibson finding out about the crazy nature of his daughters work and exposing the truth."Edge of Darkness" feels like two scripts that someone tried to make into one. I've no idea what the BBC program the film is based on was like, but perhaps it had more time to make both plots operate together as one. Monahan and Andrew Bovell's version rushes through both.The better-executed part is by far the conspiracy. It's not all that complicated, but the information whips by and much of it comes out of Ray Winstone's unintelligible mouth, magnifying the problem. Winstone plays a cover-up specialist looking into the death of Craven's daughter. Named Jedburgh, his motivation is unknown. While initially Craven believes he was the intended target of the bullet that took down his daughter, we quickly learn that's not the case from Jedburgh. Craven digs into her past (their relationship wasn't very open prior to her death), finding out she worked for a nuclear power manufacturer headed by Jack Bennett, played by Danny Huston, an actor with a reputation for playing the dislikable character without overdoing it. As it turns out, she might have been trying to expose something.Considering her father's motivation is in avenging her murder, not in being a hero by setting Bennett and those he's in league with up to be caught with their pants down, the signals are mixed. By the time we are wrapped in the mystery, we become far less interested in Craven's internal struggle and Gibson's performance loses weight. When the script decides he's going to turn the ass-kicking dial up to 11, our reaction is not immediately "get 'em, Mel," but "hold 'em captive and get more information out of 'em so we can find out what's going on ... Mel!" The story comes to a compelling "Departed"-style climax, but it takes a mental adjustment because these two plots aren't on the same page.No knocks here against "Casino Royale" director Martin Campbell, who was obviously brought in to tackle the challenge of generating the emotional impact while expertly handling the action and suspense as he proved capable of by turning James Bond, cinema's most infamously hardened hero, into an emotionally complex character. The action and suspense scenes are terrifically paced, but the script keeps Campbell on a leash as far as everything else. There's only so much one can do to make a father's redundant hallucinations of his little girl palatable.Nevertheless, "Edge of Darkness" will grab your attention in spots and on occasion floor you with its thorough knowledge of police department infrastructure, protocol and information access (did I mention Monahan wrote "The Departed?). And Gibson, he does what he always used to, keep it real with a likable protagonist. It sure makes you wonder how the guy can be an a-hole in actuality. I guess that's acting for you.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Seriously, prohibition did no one any favors. "Lawless" is a Western-inspired take on the gangster pic, in which the only rules are that there are no rules and the men with the power are the men who wield the most fear  and guns.Combined with his previous films "The Proposition" and "The Road," Australian director John Hillcoat has become the foremost director of contemporary Westerns, even if only "The Proposition" can technically be considered as such. Running through each of his films thematically is the notion of man doing what he must, namely putting the bonds of family ahead of all else.The Bondurant brothers, Howard (Jason Clarke), Forrest (Tom Hardy) and Jack (Shia LaBeouf), run a successful moonshine operation in Franklin, Va. during Prohibition, but when some feds, namely deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), move in from Chicago, they shake things up in attempt to put a stranglehold on "The Wettest County in the World." Rakes' lack of hesitancy when it comes to using violence to assert his will pushes the brothers to the edge, and the film builds toward an inevitable standoff."Lawless" serves mostly as an exercise in the escalation of violent tactics in a place without law and order. Other than being slimy, obsessive-compulsive and all manners of dislikable, Pearce's Rakes doesn't appear to have much reason behind his methods other than he thinks he can get away with it. The Bondurants' refusal to give in to anyone else taking a cut of the profits is all it takes for things to get ugly  and fast.The film has an eye-opening physicality emphasized by Hillcoat's skill at depicting brute force and bare-knuckle violence. The way Rakes among others behaves will get quickly under your skin and have you rooting for full-force retaliation. This raw treatment calls upon our instincts and emotions like a Western does as opposed to the more mental approach, or aiming to appeal to the intellect while exploring corruption and power dynamics, per se. Consequently, "Lawless" ends up more thrilling and satisfying than complex and stimulating.The story zooms in on the youngest, Jack. It's a more dramatic turn for LaBeouf to be sure, but not exactly out of character. He's still the cocky-but-naive type, obsessed with the glamor of his trade but lacking the stones to defend himself or more importantly, hold his own amidst the corruption. You'll be drawn to his innocence, but despise him for his frailty.It's Hardy who wins top acting honors in this one as Forrest, the soft-spoken yet most dangerous and brazen of the three. If you had any doubts about Hardy's versatility or skill in more dramatic fair, this will put them to rest. He's the real deal. The script also provides him some vulnerable moments that deepen his character. Forrest might be stubborn, but he knows what it takes to survive in this jungle of sorts, and the subtlety of Hardy's delivery makes him all the more formidable on screen.If Pearce's character weren't so needlessly despicable, he might challenge Hardy more seriously for the film's best performance, but regardless, he disappears into the role and its his menace that drives it by fueling the characters' fire and consequently ours as well.The ladies of "Lawless"  Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska  are wedged in, though they provide a nice balance to an otherwise unapologetically gritty film. We learn little about either woman: Chastain's Maggie came from a not-so-glamorous job in Chicago and sought out the Bondurants for work, while Wasikowska's Bertha is the preacher's daughter whose sole purpose in the script is to ultimately get Jack in trouble. "Lawless" would've been a great film if the time were taken to weave them more into the film's fabric as opposed to a distraction from the blood and moonshine. Gary Oldman's intriguing mobster character Floyd Banner has a similar fate.Choosing to view "Lawless" through the lens of a Western set in the South will make a world of difference. As a period drama, it's generic at best, not really adding anything to the conversation on Prohibition. Seeing it as a Western helps justify the general themes and wild, seat-of-the-pants attitude toward action and character motivation. Either way, it's a striking and gripping piece of genre filmmaking.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
In 1998 when "Blade" showed us how much fun it can be to watch Wesley Snipes kicking vampire ass, creating the first combination of action movies with society's beloved vampire mythology, we assumed he'd be back for round 2 and we expected it to be just as entertaining. Well, four years later, "Blade II" rolls out, and the good news is that the action and the fast-paced blood-spewing entertainment continues. The bad, however, is that the story and the writing are less creative, failing to really immerse us in the vampire lore that made "Blade" so interesting. While the bad plot development doesn't really saw the legs out from under "Blade II", it certainly makes it difficult for anyone who did not really enjoy the first "Blade" to get anything good out of it.For the sequel, Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro steps in to replace the vacated spot left by "Blade" director Stephen Norrington. The difference is apparent but not that drastic. Del Toro uses a more martial arts style of filming fight scenes and this takes away some of the highly stylized shots of the first film. The action is not as cool-looking but the fight choreography is a bit better. Del Toro is also more imaginative in terms of how the characters look.The plot takes place two years after the last film. Blade has been out in search of his mentor Whistler (Kristofferson, who, surprise, didn't actually die in the first film) when he is approached by the vampires who request his help. The reason is that the vampire mutation has apparently evolved into a strain called "reaper" and these reapers feed on vampires. Agreeing only because these reapers are deadlier than vampires with less weaknesses, Blade teams up with some skilled vampires (ironically trained originally to kill him) to take the reapers down.The reapers are more barbaric creatures--not very interesting for the film's focus, but brought to life in an interesting way by Del Toro. They are pale, bald creepy figures with chins that open up to reveal parasites for feeding on their victims. They make the overall tone of "Blade II" more about the gross than the sleek like vampires. In fact, most of the vampires in the film are just dubbed as such, it doesn't really play a role in their characters. The lore of the first film is simply taken for granted here so we can jump right into the plot.The cast is even worse than "Blade." Why? Because there are more people in it. Last time, the only bad performance we had to deal with regularly was Stephen Dorff as the evil Deacon Frost. This time, there's a whole crew of pathetic vampires and then some other nuisances. The worst might be the annoying new sidekick of Blade's/tech geek character Scud played by Norman Reedus. The script also calls for a new vampire love interest for Blade, which might be the worst part of the film. There's nothing in the film that says these two should be interested in each other yet they are. Those two examples are just the stand outs in a cast that you kind of are just hoping will die at some point in the film, which interestingly enough, most of them do.David S. Goyer, the original film's writer, continues with the great pacing that made "Blade" entertaining, but in this film, there are too many characters and the pacing leads to us not caring at all about any of them except Blade. Even then, "Blade II" is only an excuse for Blade to kill more vampires/reapers, not grow as a character. Some of the strengths of his character from the original just disappear, like his struggle with the fact that he's half- vampire. This is mostly because the plot is not conducive to rehashing those themes."Blade II" is a great example of how a sequel maintains the entertaining elements of the original but cuts off the material underneath with a fair plot. The film aims for "not disappointing" instead of "good," and so it achieves just that and nothing more.
Imagine Batman and Superman were two Irish Catholics from Boston that sprayed their hapless, costume-free villains with bullets. That's "Boondock Saints," sort of a "Guy Ritchie meets vigilante justice" crime film that relishes in the cool rather than the real. Still, over- the-top as it may be at times, there's no denying "Boondock Saints" both its cool and cult status.Connor and Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) are a pair of Irish fraternal twins with unflinching faith and a lot of body art who after an attack on their favorite bar by Russian mobsters on St. Patrick's Day goes awry, realize they can rid Boston of its crime filth, fulfill a religious responsibility and make some money on the side by killing sinners. On their trail is arrogant and borderline crazy FBI detective Paul Smecker (Willam Defoe), known for accurately reconstructing crime scenes (as long as he has his classical music handy).Once the McManus brothers go on their spree, the film takes an interesting approach, showing Smecker go through each crime scene and guess what happened before actually showing you what happened, increasing the suspense and getting across Smecker's frustration with how clean these guys manage to be.Although the plot and style of the film is dominated by the McManus brothers and their not nearly as sharp or morally sound companion Rocco, character-wise, this film belongs to Defoe. In his strongest character maybe ever, Defoe's distinguished and inherently insane features work perfectly for a detective who is so smart he's nearly a lunatic. His performance is nuanced at times and over-the-top at others and while the other over-the-top parts of the film detract a bit from it, Defoe manages to make his ridiculousness work, namely the cool scene where director Troy Duffy films both Defoe constructing the scene and the Saints actually doing all that, together.The film's greatest weakness is that it glorifies the vigilantism of the McManus brothers in a way that detracts from the realism. They become superheroes in almost too much of the sense of the word. Their clean kills and getaways, even their reception by the public (which is more told than shown) seems a bit too far-fetched. Even the symbolism is overdone with the twins' rosaries shaking on the wall pegs or thrashing about as they get beaten. The religious angle is highly controversial, but this is also the point. Never before has religion been a motivating factor in vigilantism in film. Still, the execution is more about style and entertainment than about the real possibility of these figures existing.
With so much garbage being dished out these days by Hollywood under the label of "romantic comedy," films like "Roman Holiday" never grow old. The timeless fairytale elements like a princess trying to disguise herself as a commoner and the classic routine of two people being dishonest with each other falling in love only gets better played against the live backdrop of Rome.One of the first films to truly shoot on location, "Roman Holiday" is that quintessential romance in a foreign country picture. In it, a young English Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn), tired of her royal routine as an ambassador, sneaks away and into the path of American reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). After Bradley realizes who she is, he crafts a plan to turn the coincidence into an exclusive story and spends a day with her going about Rome. It's similar in premise to the 1934 Frank Capra classic "It Happened One Night" only less dramatic in terms of romance.Little can describe Audrey Hepburn, but she is outstanding in the role that shot her to fame and earned her an instant Oscar. She has an allure to her and a beauty that is not unparalleled, but incomparable to any other star of the era. She looks youthful and childish at times but is also emphatically elegant and classy -- she's a unique beauty.Opposite her is a perfectly cast Gregory Peck, whose experience and maturity really shows in a role that is ultimately a supporting one. This is a story about Princess Ann and her discovery and he recognizes that, never taking focus from her in their scenes together. William Wyler captures this excellent chemistry in a film that is really quite naturally entertaining. It doesn't necessitate serious conflict -- the premise alone and our anticipation of them both coming clean about their facades keep us going and even then, Dalton Trumbo (story) and Ian McLellan Hunter (screenplay) bring us that moment in a way that is implied rather than forced, avoiding clichés that most romantic comedies of today can't seem to let go of."Roman Holiday" is such a classy movie that despite moderate laughs and no deep conflict, manages to capture our attention and our lighter side. It's one of those films that just sweeps you up and gives you something to enjoy without redundant or overbearing tactics that the genre has been so used to see for a century.
When the credits roll, Joe Swanberg's "Drinking Buddies" will at least leave you thirsty. Whether you'll be drinking to toast or drinking to forget is another matter.Regardless in which camp you fall, "Drinking Buddies" is best enjoyed with your favorite craft beer in hand (or several). The story follows Kate (Olivia Wilde) and Luke (Jake Johnson), who both work for a new Chicago craft brewery, and their complicated relationship with their significant others and each other.There isn't much to the story: if you're a beer nerd from the Midwest like I am, you might have more fun playing "spot the beer" than keeping an eye on what will happen next. The dramatic tension in this comedy comes from a weekend that Kate and her boyfriend, Chris (Ron Livingston),spend in Michigan with Luke and his girlfriend, Jill (Anna Kendrick). The sexual tension between the male and female counterparts is quite palpable and it drives (slowly) the entire rest of the film.Fans of conventional Hollywood storytelling will likely cite "Drinking Buddies" as why independent films are awful, whereas fans of independent films will commend everything Swanberg does in this movie. It's a natural, true-to-life portrayal of relationships, where the characters live in a fishbowl and we observe them, counting the similarities to our own lives. There is practically no manufactured conflict, just people drinking, talking and trying to make sense of their lives.Swanberg's script sets up situations in which a major conflict between the characters could break out at any second, but the film relies chiefly on its on-screen talent in order to work. Wilde and Johnson have excellent chemistry, to the point where it's almost painful that the story mostly deprives us of that romantic satisfaction. Wilde in particular hasn't given us a performance this raw since she made it big in Hollywood, so to see her give us the full range of the fun-loving but deeply insecure Kate is perhaps the finest takeaway "Drinking Buddies" has to offer. Johnson, on the other hand, while an ideal fit in his role, is mostly operating in familiar territory for anyone who follows him on Fox's comedy "New Girl." Kendrick and Livingston, though technically important to the story, feel secondary to what may or may not happen between Kate and Luke. The depth of character is just not there for Livingston's Chris, or really for Kendrick's Jill either, though Kendrick (as always) makes the most with what she's given."Drinking Buddies" completely and honestly captures the indefinable nature of contemporary relationships, it just doesn't say anything new about it. You don't need to watch Swanberg's film to see a prime example of the oft-blurred line between Platonic and non-Platonic in a relationship, even if this movie does it particularly well. Similarly, the role that craft beer and beer culture plays in the film feels minimal if not irrelevant. The one idea that can be gleaned is that alcohol accentuates the complication of feelings by releasing impulses that otherwise can be repressed, but that's not exactly visible upon watching.Expert talents and a filmmaker who truly understands relationship dynamics help elevate "Drinking Buddies" above the level of less astute indies that bank more on situational comedy and drama to bolster their themes. Yet the consequence is it hurts the entertainment value to a great degree. "Drinking Buddies" isn't boring, but it's underwhelming despite its strengths.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

The way "Ordinary People" depicts the family is tough to swallow. Is the Jarrett family really ordinary? They suffered a horrible loss when their eldest son died in a boating accident and their youngest has recently come home after four months in the hospital because he tried to kill himself. These are not "ordinary" circumstances per say, but these are how once-ordinary people would handle such tragedy -- how any of us who can identify with feeling ordinary would handle such tragedy. That's the beauty of Alvin Sargent's script, Robert Redford's sensitive yet powerful direction and humbling performances from a terrific cast.I personally took to "Ordinary People" more quickly because it takes place and was filmed where I grew up in north-suburban Chicago. Although that personally brought it home more easily, there's something that everyone can connect with in this film. If nothing else, it addresses family intimacy, which every family has varying degrees of, and it will guaranteed make you think about that from a different perspective or maybe even awaken a greater need for that in your own life.The Jarretts, Calvin (Sutherland), Beth (Moore) and Conrad (Hutton) appear to be a very pleasant and agreeable family in the beginning, but look closer and you can see the tension. Family discussion is like a formality and Conrad and Beth in particular have a completely shattered relationship. All three actors master the script's subtext and create believable and complex characters and relationships. Their profiles are so comprehensive in fact that they can't easily be summarized.The focus is namely on the Oscar-winning debut of Hutton as Conrad. Hutton inherits one of the most psychologically complex film characters ever and he bottles it all in and somehow it manifests itself into this touching and fragile performance. Conrad has nightmares, he feels out of control, he's lost touch with his high school buddies and the swim team, he has romantic needs that he wants to explore, family troubles and he's harboring an incredible guilt. The sympathy he generates is immense, which is part of what makes the film so compelling.It might in fact be Judd Hirsch playing the psychiatrist, but the tension in Hutton's performance will turn every viewer into someone desperately wanting to help Conrad. In fact, Hirsch is a bit non-traditional as well, playing a more provoking and edgy shrink as opposed to a warm and sympathetic one, which makes us feel even more like the one person who wants to really listen and help Conrad and help him.There isn't really a dramatic plot arch to "Ordinary People." The basic idea is that Conrad starts seeing a psychiatrist and he comes closer and closer to confronting what he has to in order to truly overcome his troubles. The drama builds through increased conflict as more and more small events occur that push the characters, thus breaking the family's shaky but operational status-quo a bit at a time.Sargent's brilliant script is built around this natural rise in relationship tension. You can feel where the film is going to go from one scene to the next because the conflict causes obvious cracks that create logical next steps for the action to take. Part of this is also Redford's near- flawless transitioning. We're so clearly in the heads of these characters that each scene is so clearly the cause of the next and an effect of the last. He picks great moments to move from one to another and it keeps momentum going in a script without many dramatic events. There's only slight over-dramatic compensation in Redford's directing at times for this lack, but most of the time he's spot-on.But the enduring effect of "Ordinary People" on its audience is the portrayal of the family and its relationships. Each character has a psychological file folder that's overflowing and their interactions with each other are consequently so complex that you feel right away that this is the stuff of real relationships. No character sits permanently in a nut shell and more importantly is the realization that no one person is to be blamed or feel guilt for any one event. "Ordinary People" has such a firm grasp on the essence of family conflict and it shines through in an otherwise ordinary film.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
As Americans, we had never been so fixated on killing a single individual as we were Osama bin Laden, the brain behind Al Qaeda and dubbed architect of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. "Zero Dark Thirty," the story of this 10-year manhunt, leaves out that social and political narrative, opting instead to capture the CIA's operation to find and kill bin Laden from a purely procedural perspective.Director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal's tense yet human-focused style translates right over from their Oscar-winning effort "The Hurt Locker" to this film, which could find itself with a similar amount of accolades  if it doesn't drown in controversy first.Its depiction of torture scenes toward the beginning aside, "Zero Dark Thirty" conveys the CIA and main character Maya's (Jessica Chastain) fixation on doing whatever it took to find bin Laden. It never stops to ask why, opting to use its opening minutes to play 9-1-1 calls from Sep. 11 over a black screen and get at our emotions rather than our rationale. It's an effective technique, though the engrossing espionage plot blots out any emotional elements to the film until the very end.The factually ambiguous Maya is an intriguing creation. She evolves very gradually over the film's lengthy run time from a woman whom we presume to be in over her head to the only person with the stones to do what it takes to succeed. It's as though Boal and Bigelow wanted to play with our assumptions about what a pretty redhead is or isn't capable of and then ratchet her character up into this fiercely strong female character who can't be labeled a dominatrix. Chastain brilliantly plays it very cool for much of the film and only turns up the dial in rhythm with the height of the stakes."Zero Dark Thirty" puts you in the trenches with the CIA in the way that Boal writes his script, as compared to "Argo," which plays a tad more to the audience by explaining scenarios clearer and being especially wry. "Zero Dark Thirty" offers a handful of laughs, but it's grittier and much more procedural in nature. Unlike fictional thrillers involving the CIA and other secret operations, it does not glamorize any part of the process and the script refuses to wedge exciting action sequences into the film to break up the pacing to appease viewers with shorter attention spans.We don't get a whole lot more than plot, so Chastain and actors Jason Clarke, Jennifer Ehle, Joel Edgerton, Kyle Chandler and Chris Pratt have to find openings to deliver character-telling moments to keep everyone human. Chastain puts on a straight face, but you sense her emotional roller coaster throughout. The others don't get as many opportunities, but Bigelow has this incredible gift to turn them into more than guys wearing suits or military fatigues.Bigelow constantly keeps her movie interesting and "Zero Dark Thirty" boasts exceptional editing. It's easy to tell when something bad is going to happen because the tone of the film shifts so drastically, but the payoff of these climactic moments is always satisfying. The final scene, the raid on the compound where bin Laden was found is completely silent and utterly captivating, proving the how is as much if not more important than the end result (considering we all know what it is).Much has been made about the film's stance on torture, namely it depicts enhanced interrogation techniques and pivotal to the discovery of the information that ultimately led to bin Laden's location. The graphic nature of these scenes will definitely be a matter of taste, but as to whether the movie glorifies torture  that's stickier territory. It definitely suggests a certain degree of necessity in using harsh tactics in order for the CIA to get the information it needed, which is an issue of fact vs. Hollywood dramatization, but it doesn't by any means milk the torture scenes for entertainment purposes.If I had to guess, Boal and Bigelow wanted to convey how even the most horrific tactics were utilized to achieve the end goal of finding bin Laden, that there was a certain desperation and not much consideration for the ethics. The film takes nary a moment to consider the moral question of interrogation techniques, predominantly because it's not a film about whether torture in this situation is ethical. It doesn't depict characters relishing in torture, but characters who feel as though they have no other choice."Zero Dark Thirty" is a black ops thriller without the glitz of fancy technology, chase sequences in exotic locations and highly skilled super spies. It captures the steadfast effort of the CIA and the chances it took in order to even be in the position to attempt an operation on the bin Laden compound. It takes dramatic liberties to be sure, but it relies on just great filmmaking technique to rivet and captivate.With such a timely subject and being the center of so much controversy (beyond the torture and also into how much the government cooperates with Hollywood), "Zero Dark Thirty" opts not to make any statements, political, thematic or otherwise. It consequently lacks the other facets we attribute to great movies, but what it does well it executes in consummate fashion.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
"Super Troopers" is a great comedy because it's hysterical yet there's nothing recycled about it. There aren't any actors who have been in too many comedies or a plot that's just about setting up gag after gag. This is a true ensemble comedy, and although it may be easy to dismiss as immature, it's sharp and clever immaturity. There are plenty of interesting and amusing characters and there's even some mystery to keep your interest.The film is the first hit by the Broken Lizard group, which is led by director/writer Jay Chandrasekhar. It's basically about a group of state troopers who are literally so bored that they result to making bets and playing ridiculous games that result in hilarity. The mystery starts when the begin to uncover a crime and are trying to outdo the local police department.There is a lot of drug humor and use as well as plenty of immature sex-related humor. It's pretty classic immature humor, but it's not forgettable. The opening scene is a great tone setter for the film and really illustrates how Broken Lizard is a bit more clever and less formula-dependent as other immature movies that use similar comedic tactics. The other reason this film is better than others of the genre is that these actors have talent and create interesting characters. It's not just about gags, but about the way the characters behave. That's all that can be said as to why this film is better than similar fare without ruining the movie.The most memorable character is probably Farva, the stupid cop who takes his job the most seriously and is the butt of everyone's jokes, played by Kevin Heffernan. Brian Cox is also great in his only comedic role I can remember as the foul-mouthed captain.Very few movies will offer you mindless entertainment like "Super Troopers" does and actually capture your attention and convince you it's worth watching again and again.
There have been tons of films that depict addictive drug abuse, but no film does it quite like Darren Aronofsky does in "Requiem for a Dream," using camera techniques to mess with your mind and visually drive you insane, much like the characters of the film spiral into drug-induced oblivion. The film is not particularly insightful--it is an independent film-- whose goal is clearly to make a film that shows drug abuse in a way never done before."Requiem" follows essentially four characters whose lives go south because of drugs. There is Harry (Leto) and Tyrone (Wayans), two junkies who turn to selling dope to make a living, Marion (Connelly), Harry's girlfriend who will do anything for cocaine, and Sara, Harry's mother, an older, widowed woman who gets selected to be on TV and begins to take pills to suppress her appetite so that she can wear her favorite dress on air. Sara's story is the most jarring and unique to movie plots and therefore feels distanced from the others, but the technique is what matters in "Requiem" more so than the story itself.This is Aronofsky's film from beginning to end. Numerous camera techniques are employed, particularly rapid sequences of close-ups when the characters are doing their drugs of choice. In addition, Aronofsky uses camera mounts on characters at times and even security cameras to capture some scenes in Sara's storyline. Aronofsky also does various slow downs and speed ups, white fades and more in the editing process that continue to inject director presence into the material. He really experiments with everything with varying degrees of success. What makes Aronofsky's work so great, however, is not the techniques themselves, but how they are allegorical for drug addiction. He feeds them to us in steady and unobtrusive doses at first with the rapid close-ups for the first hour of the film, then as things start to go out of control in the plot, we get more and more abrupt changes in our viewing of the film from camera angles to the edits. It's brilliant because you can easily enjoy the beginning of the film, but by the end you feel really disturbed by everything and it all happens so quickly. Aronofsky actually psychologically messes with you, successfully.Other praise for this film goes mostly to Ellen Burstyn as Sara. She's hauntingly brilliant in showing the gradual turn to insanity. A much deserved Oscar nomination. Leto and Connelly are also good, but this movie is more about how Aronofsky makes them appear rather than how they act."Requiem" is really an art film, not a Hollywood-friendly drug movie about the dangers of drugs, but an experiment with the human mind and its ability to be altered by fine director craftsmanship. While there's no true catharsis in the film, it's a movie-watching experience in its own little category by itself and worthy of a try if you're in the mood for something radical. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
When done right, few tales are more riveting than a person's descent into madness. Alfred Hitchcock proved this time and time again and Jeff Nichols reinforces it in "Take Shelter," a film likely to have been lauded by the master of suspense himself. Anchored by the performances of Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain, "Shelter" broods and festers but ultimately thrives on the brink between buildup and utter chaos.Shannon, far from a household name but a favorite of cinephiles since his head-turning supporting role in "Revolutionary Road," stars as Curtis, a construction worker and father living in a rural town with his wife, Sam (Chastain), and their young daughter, Hannah (Tova Stewart). Their daughter has developed extreme hearing loss and Curtis' job provides them the benefits necessary to afford cochlear implants, but Curtis' recent slew of horrifically real nightmares seems to be the real issue here.In his dreams, Curtis experiences premonitions of a near-apocalyptic storm that includes odd bird flight formations, motor-oil-like rain, and twisters, and appears to make everyone that shows up in his dreams eerily violent from his dog to complete strangers. The resulting paranoia and occasional physical side affects leads Curtis to seek medical attention, but also to start renovating the storm cellar in his backyard should his visions come true.The question of whether Curtis is a prophet of sorts or just mentally disturbed drives the film  not much else does. Nichols tells this story largely through a series of character snapshots depicting Curtis riding the ups and downs caused by these nightmares. A few key moments boil the story to a point, namely a riveting scene when Curtis loses it a social luncheon, but the pensive script withholds from us straight through the end like a well-trained indie film.As we go deeper and deeper with Curtis  and eventually Samantha and Curtis' best friend/co-worker Dewart (Shea Whigham)  we do learn some key details about Curtis' medical history that shed light on the situation, but even in the midst of fact, Nichols never gives us the satisfaction of arriving at any concrete conclusion about his predicament.With the weight of an immensely introverted character dealing with a mental struggle placed squarely on his shoulders, Shannon proves why you'll only see him with more and more frequency in the future. He makes sure we care about what happens to Curtis, but beyond that he slips back and forth between deserving sympathy and deserving skepticism. He is not simply some Jobian character to whom bad things are happening, and this makes his challenge all the more challenging for the viewer. Credit as well to Nichols for crafting a protagonist far from the norm.The winner of 2011′s most ubiquitous actress award, Chastain, gets the more alpha-type role instead. She's the good-hearted, open and loving type driven entirely by logic and unafraid of confrontation. Many will identify more with Samantha as a result, which adds a layer of complexity to the film to say the least."Take Shelter" offers compelling character-driven suspense, though at times it will try your patience. If you can chalk that up to quintessential indie filmmaking, then by all means do and enjoy this complex and challenging character portrait all the more for it. However, the real thrill of this type of film is that at any moment the bottom might drop out on the entire story (aka the $%&+ might hit the proverbial tornado); the difference between liking that and loving it is accepting when it doesn't.~Steven CCheck out my site, moviemusereviews.com
There's something comforting in visiting (or revisiting) the Coen brothers' origins more than 25 years after their debut with "Blood Simple." Although not their best work by any means, "Blood Simple." laid a foundation that proved beyond refute what the filmmakers would continue to build upon in their careers. "Blood Simple." shows not only the continuity of their work, but also their devotion to particular brand of storytelling.As we've come to know them for, the Coens have spun a tale of ordinary people in un-ordinary (and difficult/illegal) situations, flailing like fish out of water as some recurring symbolism might suggest. Wealthy bar owner Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya) hires a private investigator (M. Emmet Walsh), a cowboy to the gills plus a 10-gallon hat, to spy on his two-timing wife (Frances McDormand) and her current lover and Marty's employee, Ray (John Getz). Tired of feeling inadequate, Marty pays the investigator to off them, but things don't go quite as he suspects.A series of dominoes fall in which all of the main characters end up over their heads based on a disconnect between what they believe to have happened and the reality (that we the audience see firsthand).Other than McDormand, who would marry one of the brothers and become a staple in their films, the major difference between "Blood Simple." and their prime work would be the acting. Walsh and Hedaya fit their roles well, but Getz, a rather critical character, can't seem to pull it off. He plays something between frightened and stupid. Fortunately we're so intrigued by what the consequences of his pivotal scenes will be that we're mostly distracted from thinking about how much better the film could've been if he could fit the bill. The Coens' films have always needed a combination of actors who can pull off ordinary people and those who can be a bit larger than life but in a controlled way. Walsh pulls off the latter as the private investigator and McDormand as the former, which makes the climax work quite well.Connecting the dots of the film can be difficult at times. The story lacks a sense of justice and authority (as simple as having a police detective in the script), which makes it impossible to predict the film's outcome in exciting fashion and blurs the lines between good and evil. Just as the Coens wanted, to be sure, but some residual effects seem to linger that makes the characters tough to understand in terms of motivations. In the end, something ends up going missing from the poignancy of the film, but for a first crack at that type of major climax poignancy, they do all right. At the same time, one would be hard pressed to call the film's flaws rookie mistakes by any means. Few filmmakers demonstrate the visual prowess, the innate ability to understand where the audience's eyes will go, what it will focus in on and the way in which it will process that information.What a treat to see these talents feeling their way through a first full-length feature and how they've improved.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"Superman II" is a direct continuation of the 1978 original, yet it is directed by Richard Lester, not Richard Donner, and there is the film's biggest point of contention. The controversial firing of Donner led to a film that while it doesn't have a distinctly different feel, certainly feels a bit shaky at points in terms of making sense. Otherwise, "Superman II" is still a pretty attention-capturing special effects and stunt-filled sequel.The film's villains are General Zod (Stamp) and his cohorts who after being imprisoned in the Phantom Zone by Jor-El, Superman's father, in the very beginning of the first installment, are released by a hydrogen bomb explosion in outer space thanks to Superman's heroic efforts at the beginning of this film. As Zod tries to take over the world, Superman grows closer to Lois, though his personally life will soon be sacrificed if the earth is to survive Zod.For 1980, the film's use of green screen is pretty effective though definitely obvious at points and the sweeping shots of Superman flying give the film an epic quality that combined with the John Williams score are pretty cinematically unbeatable. A large amount of explosions and actual car crashing stunts combined with the special effects powers of the Kryptonians in the film make it pretty action-intensive.What is most surprising is the script. Mario Puzo, famed writer of the "The Godfather" trilogy, in his last writing credit, makes the relationship of Lois and Superman really jump out. There is some real drama to be had there. Margot Kidder as Lois helps this along too. This movie is just as much about her character as it is Superman. The script really hits at the interesting concept of "can Superman give up his powers for mortal love?"There were definitely a couple points during the movie where I had to ask myself if I'd missed a scene because something was off. The focal points seem to jump around and you really can't tell what's supposed to be important overall. Lois and Superman on their own is a great story, but it gets lost in the Zod taking over the world plot. And Lex Luthor (Hackman), while a great personality and name, certainly doesn't need to be there.
We've finally reached in age when science fiction doesn't have to mean action films and where low-budget genre films have become "of interest" to producers and distributors. Although you could hardly call "District 9" a cheap film compared to Gareth Edwards' debut feature "Monsters," Neil Blomkamp's film was much cheaper than the alien movies that came before it and Edwards' first feature film continues that trend.An alien invasion film with minimal action is a tough route to travel, but Edwards largely sticks to it. I was expecting there to be hardly any alien presence in the film, but he gives in to our curiosities as sci-fi fans and ultimately the film is better for it.The premise of "Monsters," set up by a few title cards of context, is that an alien presence has landed in Mexico, which has since been quarantined to contain the giant octopus-like creatures that have been deemed hostile. Similar to a "28 Days Later," the film focuses on a microcosm of that event, two characters forced to stick together if they're to make it back from Mexico to the United States. It becomes immediately apparent that Edwards has thought his film through in terms of how an alien invasion of this kind would impact people's lives, especially in such a low-poverty and already troubled area in Mexico. There's a bit of a commentary on immigration here considering Sam (Whitney Able) and Kaulder (Scoot McNairy) must befriend locals for shelter and pay exorbitant amounts of money to get back to America. That, and the United States has erected a massive wall at the Mexico border. This message is very subtle, however, and not preachy, which keeps the focus on the characters where it belongs."Monsters" provides a lot for you to chew on with these subtle points, but a little too much rests on the main characters without much sci-fi action to lean back on. McNairy and Able play likable characters and do so with a very natural style, but Edwards has written them one- dimensional backstories, which makes their characters cut-and-dry in terms of motivation. For example, it's abundantly clear from the beginning that Sam is not happy to be engaged to this guy we don't ever meet, but it seems to be the only thing that defines her and her choices and feelings. Her relationship with Kaulder grows very organically in-scene, but their fate becomes painfully obvious from the moment they meet.Chiefly, "Monsters" is a survival story, a film more interested in how an alien invasion would affect people's lives on a personal level than how the government would handle the situation or even from a filmmaking standpoint, unconcerned with entertaining its audience. Kaulder and Sam are put in peril and reevaluate their lives often on this journey and must come to terms with the fact that practicality becomes less of a factor in making important decisions when your life is threatened.Considering that the film operates as science fiction but not in a typical way, "Monsters" definitely leaves you with something to be desired, but it more or less creates a unique flavor from pieces of "Cloverfield," "28 Days Later" and a bit of "District 9."~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Sex addiction has yet to get a serious film treatment until "Shame," the sophomore feature from filmmaker Steve McQueen. Generally we feel inclined to put a comic spin on anything that taboo (see the adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's sex-addiction novel "Choke"), but here we see how it ruins lives and relationships.Like any addiction, main character Brandon (Michael Fassbender) becomes preoccupied with sex, participating in everything from prostitution to Internet pornography to relieving himself in the bathroom at work. The film's first act is a long sample of how sex dominates most of Brandon's thoughts as he goes through a typical week, a character study in perversion but not one that demonizes his habit so much as displaying it for what it is. We don't feel bad for Brandon nor do we despise him. Shame, aptly, might be the most applicable emotion.As with any character study, a lot hinges on Fassbender's performance, and he delivers. Brandon isn't given a line of dialogue for what feels like ages at the beginning, yet Fassbender perfectly (albeit somewhat horrifyingly) telegraphs his internal thought process. McQueen is in perfect sync, injecting us into Brandon's brain as best he can by subtly sexualizing a lot of what Brandon sees. A sequence on the subway is entirely silent but especially powerful as Brandon eyes a woman across the way.Stretches of "Shame" will bore some viewers to death, but it's a sacrifice McQueen makes to convey the solitude and loneliness of a man with Brandon's condition. His lifestyle simply does not allow for extended periods of human contact or long-term relationships. When he makes efforts to do so in the film, it's painstaking for him. Much of the movie feels superfluous (it could rank among the longest 100 minutes in film history), but to some extent we cannot truly understand Brandon unless we are fully treated to that isolation, to a complete lack of interest in anything but sex or something that might lead to sex or sexual satisfaction.After our first series of trials observing Brandon, McQueen and co-writer Abi Morgan drop in Sissy (Carey Mulligan), Brandon's equally troubled (in a whole other way) sister. Her on-screen introduction features her completely nude and arguing with Brandon in the bathroom, which sets the table for their relationship. Sissy is the opposite of Brandon, a jazz singer completely dependent on human contact and emotional connection. Her intrusion on Brandon's life understandably causes him to get angry and emotionally volatile.Brandon is not entirely averse to change, but he struggles mightily with it. The third act is an experiment that achieves both positive and negative results and digs into the question of whether or not one can personally overcome something of this magnitude. Never, however, does the film confront its themes or questions through dialogue. Only once does Sissy even allude to Brandon's perversion, telling him he has no right to chastise anyone else's sexual choices.Fassbender and Mulligan ultimately anchor "Shame." Without them, the film would be deemed powerfully told, but completely un-engaging. Their raw performances and willingness to bare all physically and emotionally create the hook that makes such a brooding character study work. McQueen certainly deserves credit as well for working with them to create captivating performancesThe subject matter of "Shame" is not an easy one from a filmmaking perspective as well as a cultural one, but McQueen does an honorable job with it. He recognizes which traditional storytelling practices he must sacrifice in order to truly capture sex addiction tonally and emotionally.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out moviemusereviews.com
"Twelve Monkeys" is an intense sci-fi thriller that while strung together with great skill is particularly mind- numbing. A combination of time travel and both dialogue and camera-work that will have you thinking you're just as insane as some of the characters, this is one of director Terry Gilliam's most complex projects, although for Gilliam, complex is a relative term."Monkeys" stars Bruce Willis as Cole, a man from the future sent on a mission to 1996, right before the outbreak of a virus that will kill off all but a percent of the world's population. He's not supposed to change the past, but merely gather things to understand it, which hopefully includes a sample of the virus so an antidote may be found. To explain in any more detail would require way too much explanation, so I will leave it at that. Let's just say he goes back and forth a lot with little to no explanation. To satisfy curiosity with the other stars, however, Madeleine Stowe plays a psychiatrist whose fate slowly intertwines with Cole's and Brad Pitt plays a mentally insane person Cole first meets at an asylum.The film features Gilliam's signature hand-held camera-work and tilted angles which creates a sense of the insanity and uncertainty of what exactly is true and what imagined. There are so many forces and characters at work in this film and nothing ever grounds it enough to make any kind of sense. You get where it's going and where it ends up, but nothing is clearly spelled out. Nothing. Gilliam would prefer to leave you confused and many people will be.As confusing as it may be at times, that's not to take away from this film's many strengths. Willis and Pitt are excellent in these roles. While Pitt first appeared a bit unnatural as an insane person with tics and such, he really transforms himself as the film goes on. Willis, as he is best at, shows a tremendous amount of sensitivity and fragility despite being a hard- nosed character. The script does lend him a hand with this in that he's not a typical action protagonist, he's more a really troubled man with a tough guy demeanor. Don't fool yourself into thinking this is action sci-fi. This is more ala "Blade Runner," although it would be a crime to compare the two beyond that.The script is strong from David (and Janet) Peoples, who also had a hand in "Blade Runner." It really is hard to discern what he did versus what was Gilliam's, that's how well these styles mix. There's plenty of symbolism that is far from subtle. Monkeys appear everywhere in this film and countless films are referenced and/or shown, particularly Hitchcock. This is clearly a thoughtfully crafted film and it paces itself very well too. While more themes would have made it a more resonant sci-fi film, instead it prides itself more on being stylistic and at that it succeeds.
"Patton" might not be the greatest war movie ever made, but it's without question cinema's finest character study. It's a portrait of a man painted so vividly that I bet -- at least since 1970 -- that there are far more historians whose research emphasis is on Gen. George S. Patton than any other war hero/major military figure. Hollywood has given us any number of unique and enigmatic characters, but none so compelling and quickly gathering of our sympathies as Patton.Patton was an American general in World War II, but more specifically he was fighter, a soldier a man who believed in war as part of human nature. He was also a poet and a war history romantic. He was prideful, he was vulgar, he was both loved and despised. The list goes on, because that's how incredibly complex Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North's character is as well as the layers of depth George C. Scott gives him.Scott refused his much-deserved and won Oscar, but he insisted he didn't belong in an elite category. What he didn't really consider was that sometimes an actor, usually a character actor, comes across a role so perfectly suited to their talents, a part that wouldn't be the same done by any other actor, that greatness happens. Scott found that role. Few actors ever do. He plays Patton with such command yet the more Patton realizes his fallibility, Scott withdraws ever so slightly, bringing the character a tad closer to earth each time, but never losing that essence of pride and self confidence."Patton" is a long movie and you spend much of it just craving for Patton to do or say something. From his eternally quotable opening monologue before a backdrop of the American flag onward, we can't see or hear enough of the man. He's utterly fascinating. He speaks American war ideals like they're fundamental truths about the universe. Hippies would be ready to die for their country after listening to that, no matter how many swears he uses. And he never appears crazy. In fact, throughout the film as Patton's commanding officers reprimand him for his behavior including hitting a soldier, we find ourselves wondering "why doesn't anyone else see this man's brilliance?" He's not nice, but he's right. The idea of Patton as a war man and not a politician plays out then throughout the rest of the film.Honestly, whenever Patton's not on screen and specifically saying something, the film is uninteresting. There's one terrific action moment where Scott, angry at the incompetent British in Morocco, goes outside with his pistol and tries to shoot two German planes down. After that, the war scenes are nothing but random explosions and images without any narrative relevance to the story. In a nearly three hour film, it's fair to consider all the scenes where the best part of the film plays little or no role a bit tedious and pointless.It's impossible to describe in a review the many depths and levels of Patton's character. There are many elements in the story that evolve from and revolve around the man he was that little can be summarized. The most basic piece of this character to understand is that despite how convincing and successful he was as a military figure, his wily and off-kilter ways were always at odds with that success. Essentially, it reveals the many dimension of Patton and the many dimensions of war that require more than just a "blood 'n guts" attitude.
What Sonny and Sal thought would be a quick bank robbery turns into something more-- that's the premise of "Dog Day Afternoon." At the same time, however, a film that convinces you that it falls somewhere within the lines of conventional crime drama, also turns into something much greater and infinitely more meaningful than that. It takes you deep into the psyche of a desperate man turned criminal and simultaneously broadens the scope to critique society.You can pretty much tell from the start that Sonny (Pacino) is not a run-of-the-mill bank robber. He knows a lot about banks, but he has a nervous, frenetic energy about him. The film wisely dives straight into the robbery, not setting us up to know any of Sonny's motivation, which is slowly revealed and even then not clearly understood over the course of two hours. The writing is so terrific in the way that it starts with a small event but then expands and becomes richer through small, dialogue-heavy scenes. "Afternoon" sort of has the soul of a work for the stage in that sense, which makes it unique immediately.Sidney Lumet is just an absolute master of the craft. Much like in "12 Angry Men," he uses strategic camera-work to convey time, intensity and pressure. He wants to get you sweating like the characters, unsure of what might happen next and paranoid about it. You wait for something to go horribly wrong, yet instead you are subjected to learning about the interesting lifestyle and behavior of Sonny."Afternoon" in a sense becomes both an individual and group psychological study of a particular situation in which there is a very clear conflict with very clear implications. From the cops negotiating outside the bank to the ladies trying to pass the time inside, the circumstances of the event have a definite bearing on the characters and also our experience of the film.It's not a traditional film involving a bank robbery and that's easily the best part of this film. It is more than just the mystere surrounding bank robberies. Instead of painting a cool portrait of a professional criminal, it jumps into the mind of an average person who might actually commit a random crime to get money. Instead of nearing its climax with some sort of police break in and fight, it takes a much more reasonable turn. At the very least, "Afternoon" deserves respect for being a great film despite un-fulfilling our Hollywood bank robbery fantasies.
After watching "Police Academy" for the first time, I'm amazed at how more six sequels were spawned from it. There's very little original and very little funny about this film of misfit cops-in-training, but somehow it warranted more ventures. The only explanation I can surmise is its memorable characters and incredibly diverse cast.There are a lot of characters in "Police Academy," some funnier than others, but ultimately too many for any of them to gain our sympathies. The potential with some of these characters is pretty good, but picking 5-7 instead of 10-12 could've made for a real band of likable cadets and officers. Instead the characters are sort of wedged into the script for a few dull laughs where their individual quirks fit best.There's Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), the troublesome rebel trying to get kicked out who serves as the main character for all intents and purposes and Lt. Harris (G.W. Bailey), the nasty instructor he drives up a wall. There's his love interest (Kim Cattrall, formerly the infamous howler from "Porky's"), the only normal cast member and his hand-picked best buddy Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow) -- a human sound effects machine.Let's not forget the gun-crazy Tackleberry, the pudgy mama's boy Leslie, the gigantic musclebound Hightower (former NFL player Bubba Smith), the quiet and squeaky Hooks, womanizer George Martin, accident-prone Fackler, Police Commandant Lassard, the rough but sexy Sgt. Callahan and Lieutenant's cronies Copeland and Blankes. Writers Hugh Wilson, Neal Israel and "Police Squad!" writer Pat Proft clearly have no idea which characters will be a hit and which won't, so they cram them all in.Naturally, we pick our favorite characters and hope to see more of them and these characters help us stay sane, give us something to look forward to. In general, however, most of the jokes they are involved in are nothing more than amusing for a couple seconds and very few actually have the set-up and payoff that comedy is built on. The only time that actually happens makes for the best scene in the movie where a prostitute mistakes Commandant Lassard for her customer.In general, there are so many better screwball comedies from the '80s -- like the ones Pat Proft would later work on -- that "Police Academy" ends up really low on the totem pole. Watch all the John Hughes comedies before considering a taste of this one.
Bruce Willis has proved himself to be an ageless wonder. Although the roles he has chosen of late ("RED," Old Joe in "Looper," "The Expendables 2" and playing the original G.I. Joe in "G.I. Joe: Retaliation") suggest he's playing the "aging action star" card, his box-office draw has been consistent if not downright reliable.So why, exactly, does the fifth "Die Hard" movie make him share the screen with John McClane's until-this-point-non-existent son? Did 20th Century Fox think it needed to pass the torch to a younger, blossoming action star in Jai Courtney? The answer is essentially irrelevant, because "A Good Day to Die Hard" offers plenty of reason for this to be "a good time to let this franchise diehard." I was a fan of 2007's "Live Free or Die Hard" despite its obvious shortcomings, but "Good Day" neglects the very reasons the franchise has survived to this point. The only thing making it akin to its predecessors is McClane surviving absurd falls and copious gunfire, but as the franchise has shown us before, there's a fine line between exaggeration equaling entertainment and exaggeration undermining a film's credibility.That fine line is simply a matter of how good the rest of the movie is. That's "Good Day's" problem. Writer Skip Woods shoulders much of the blame. Honestly, anyone who had a writing credit on "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" should be blacklisted, but what can you do? The plot exists completely independent of the John McClane character, for one, meaning that it could've been a generic action film featuring just about anyone, given a different title, and not caused anyone to bat an eyelash. Admittedly, part of the character's shtick is that he's always in the wrong place at the wrong time, but the script has to practically shoehorn him into the film.John ends up in Russia where his estranged son, Jack (Courtney) has been arrested. He plans to testify against a man named Komarov (Sebastian Koch) for a shorter sentence. Komarov is a political prisoner believed to have valuable information with damning evidence of corruption against a politician named Chagarin. Truth is that Jack is C.I.A. and the U.S. has an interest in protecting Komarov. John, however, distracts his son with his presence and consequently blows Jack's operation. Together they must figure out Plan B.So John's just along for the ride this time and also to get some bonding in with the son he was never there for. The tension and humor that arise from their dynamic prove anywhere from frustrating and pointless to slightly amusing. Overall, it's extremely cliché.Great action scenes can heal all narrative wounds, at least for die-hard action fans of the literal and figurative variety, but for a franchise known for pushing the limits of creative stunts and flying shrapnel, "Good Day" offers very little to "ooh" and "ahh" at, just a lot of John and Jack jumping through glass and falling several stories. The film's grand finale has potential, but director John Moore ruins it with slow-motion (and CGI doesn't help).Moore ("Max Payne," "Flight of the Phoenix") makes a few shots looks really great and he's generally competent in this film, but the final action sequence involving a McClane helicopter escape leans hard on digital effects and given the film's other failures, proves totally anti-climactic. And yes, that bloodcurdling slow-motion All these criticisms seem irrelevant when you take the time to consider how this fifth "Die Hard" movie does nothing for the John McClane character. I think an "old John McClane" movie, a satisfying final chapter, could exist and reconcile aging and badassery, but this film was downright afraid of the subject. I've never been less excited to hear "Yippee Kay-yay" come out of Bruce Willis' mouth. He's just an accessory in this movie and it's almost upsetting. Sure, he proves to Jack that sometimes Daddy knows best, but the humanity of John McClane, the first action hero to get beaten and bloody and do it the hard way, he's nowhere to be found. In a franchise this long-running, that's not acceptable.~Steven C Thanks so much for reading. You can find more at moviemusereviews.com
You won't find a more visually immaculate film than "A Single Man." Gucci frontman Tom Ford's film debut is something out of an inch-thick fashion magazine. His eye for beauty and sensuality might be unparalleled in Hollywood with just this one entry. Applied to the story of a man torn apart inside with the loss of his lover as he tries to get through a normal day, "A Single Man" gets directly inside its protagonist's head with a barrage of emotion-evoking imagery. Although it sometimes feels like a cologne commercial, it's a remarkable first effort and a touching story commanded gracefully by Colin Firth. Firth stars as George, a British English professor living in 1960s L.A. whose partner, Jim, (Matthew Goode) has died in a car accident. Months later, having never been fully able to mourn Jim's death because he wasn't invited to the "family only" funeral, George finds the daily grind of his lonely life unendurable. The film takes place on the day during which George has planned his suicide and the emotional roller coaster that just one day brings between sensory reminders of Jim and other feelings of desire suppressed by his melancholia.Taking place in a day in addition to a series of short flashbacks, "A Single Man" isn't an eventful film, but more an artistic approach to grief and wrestling with the past. A smell or an object brings on a new memory where Ford slows the film down and focuses on some sensual or sexual detail that he lets linger before the camera, all while Polish composer Abel Korzeniowski pours on some gorgeous strings. The stirring melodies of the score are so crucial to the success of a script that relies so much on storytelling through visual detail where otherwise silence would prevail.Surprisingly for a rookie filmmaker, Ford seems to have mastered the close-up. He's fascinated by eyes and lips (as well as the nude male form) and although the film is not explicitly sexual, the tension is so thick. George encounters co-workers, strangers and a young student (Nicholas Hoult) in particular that are attractive to him and we connect with this subconscious thought because of Ford's technique. Gay or straight or somewhere in between, he draws such incredible attention to the beauty in his film and plucks an innate sexual chord in the minds of the audience. The sexuality is beautiful, touching a times -- not forced and visceral -- all shown through very deliberate and specific shots. You see exactly what Tom wants you to and you're with him from shot to shot.Not every sensory moment feels deeply connected to the story and so "A Single Man" does seem to meander at times, but Firth's performance never lets us stray from the emotional journey he's enduring on the inside. From the first heartbreaking flashback where he gets the fateful phone call to his thoughts about the handsome young Kenny who has developed a crush for his professor, there's never a moment when we're closed off to George. Julianne Moore, playing George's longtime friend and one-time fling, pulls off the same feat in her brief screen time, reminding us that even though George is gay and his circumstances unique, loss, loneliness and being unable to put aside the past are universal obstacles on life's journey."A Single Man" is an art film, not a drama where the conflict is visible and explicit, rather internal and quiet. It is a film visually driven by pristine art direction, sets and costumes in addition to the beautiful cast members. It is a must-see for anyone with a taste that leans toward independent film, in particular imagery and visual symbolism.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Let's say that for every 10 "Twilight" fans, at least one is guaranteed to give "Cosmopolis" a go for no other reason than Robert Pattinson. And among those "Twilight" fans dumb enough to mindlessly try the film out, at least 9 of 10 will despise what they see.David Cronenberg rather faithfully (from what I understand) adapts Don DeLillo's socio- economic commentary rolled into a film about young billionaire Eric Packer, who goes on a long limo ride across New York City for a haircut. What he fails to recognize, however, is that he was completely wasting his time; "Cosmopolis" has no business being a movie.Cronenberg's clean and tight approach to the film can't be denied its technical kudos, but everything he films is emotionally anemic. "Cosmopolis" has no story; its characters are talking heads and its scenes just a collection of political gospel and esoteric ideologies. Not an ounce of this film goes into giving its characters souls, and the more you hunt in search for just a sliver of one, the less attention you pay to the themes so fundamental to the film's core. If you can focus long enough in any given scene, you'll pick up some thought- provoking nuggets, but our natural curiosity as an audience is to look for the story behind the highbrow dialogue. Doing so, however, distracts from paying attention to all that can be praised about this material.Therein lies the reason Cronenberg should have left the novel alone. Ideas like the ones presented in "Cosmopolis" deserve time to simmer. If I had read the book, I certainly would have taken the time to re-read portions of it to process the commentary on capitalism rather than thinking at multiple times throughout the film "oh, there are rats, that's a symbol for what this film is trying to say about capitalism!" With the exception of Packer's newly made wife (Sarah Gadon), the cast of supporting characters suffers a similar fate in spite of some big names in Juliette Binoche, Paul Giamatti and Jay Baruchel. By the time you can begin to so much as chew on the ideas raised in one of any of the several scenes in which Packer meets with a new character in his limo and talks about big-time stuff, that character is gone from the film completely. You never get a moment to catch up so that you can be in step with what's going on.Providing further distraction from understanding anything that's said in this movie is how Cronenberg  as he always does  charges this film with sexual and violent tension. He's not adding any that's not already in the story, but he accentuates it. Consequently, moments in the film will yank you out of your perpetual state of philosophical processing and snap you back into the moment of the film, usually a violent outburst or a quick cut to a sex scene. That's part of what makes Cronenberg a revered director, but in this case it's what makes "Cosmopolis" such a tough watch.For those hoping to see what Pattinson does as a top-billed star given weighty material, "Cosmopolis" proves to be an unfair judge. He seems comfortable with the bizarre style of dialogue, but the character and the story are so empty that the film can hardly be considered a fair judgment of his would-be dramatic prowess.As with any work of art steeped in its ideas, the more you sit with it or re-experience it, the more you're likely to warm up to it, and I have no reason to believe that will not be true of "Cosmopolis." At the same time, a majority of viewers will likely not be equipped with the experience of processing this language as the film necessitates, and the first run-through (obviously the most important) suffers drastically as a result.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Rock 'n roll embodies what we want out of our movies from time to time: letting loose and having fun: throwing aside order and morality for a time, however brief. In the '60s, rock music was the essence of such "rebellion" and "Love, Actually" filmmaker Richard Curtis and his latest film, "Pirate Radio," capture the rock 'n roll spirit without dishing it out in the form of some "educational" period film.The cast rocks the boat in this light-spirited comedy. Bill Nighy struts his comedic stuff once more for Curtis along with other veterans such as Kenneth Branagh as the politician scheming to take the boat off the air and Emma Thompson in a brief role. The up-and- comers on the list include "Flight of the Conchords" co-star Rhys Darby, Jack Davenport ("Coupling" and "Pirates of the Caribbean"), Nick Frost ("Shaun of the Dead," "Hot Fuzz,"), Rhys Ifans, Gemma Arterton ("Quantum of Solace") and "Mad Men's" January Jones. The lone American is the multi-talented Phillip Seymour Hoffman.In spite of all the many characters, there are no vignettes like in "Love, Actually," so the film gets much more chummy with the viewer: you feel as if this is exactly what life would be like on a boat full of people whose job it is to just play rock 'n roll music and have a great time. We come at the boat through the eyes of an innocent young man named Carl (Tom Sturridge) who is about to get a full taste of the rock 'n roll life style, especially when it comes to learning about the opposite sex. In this way, "Pirate Radio" is like a more care and drama-free version of Cameron Crowe's ode to rock, "Almost Famous."The film lacks purposeful movement despite the small, non-threatening antagonism of Branagh and Davenport's characters trying to do their job and shut them down, but then again, the main characters don't have much purposeful direction either. They're on a boat playing rock 'n roll and making suggestive comments on the air to thousands of people. Numerous scenes could be best described as "dance breaks" where Curtis cuts off and on the boat between the guys on board having a blast and the everyday people listening in and dancing as a '60s rock staple plays on the soundtrack. It's aimless and silly, but that's exactly the point.You don't get to know all the main characters too intimately, but Curtis humanizes them in several scenes with jokes, games and buddy-buddy insults that don't drive the plot but make "Pirate Radio" an easy watch and a true comedy, not something that happens to be funny but insists on being dramatic at its core. But the film still has plenty of heart, the kind Curtis has become known for. The relaxed sexual attitude of the film like the near-heartbreaking scene when Carl thinks he's getting lucky with the young Marianne (Talulah Riley) only she's fallen for the celebrity of the rotund but charming DJ Doctor Dave (Frost).And like any good movie about music, the soundtrack makes a big statement. Although sometimes more overt than subtly complementing the mood or story (like Leonard Cohen's "So Long, Marianne" and The Turtles' "Elenor" directly after scenes where characters with those names are introduced), the feel is dead-on for this laid-back movie. Those obvious choices also make the eternally true point that there's a song for every moment in life, which is why rock 'n roll didn't die in the face of those that tried to defeat it.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
"The Usual Suspects" starts out just like a crime film, but evolves into an almost classic mystery. It's the kind of film you need to watch twice in a relatively short period of time to truly understand the script's mastery. I've seen the film twice, but years apart, so my insight into the tremendous cinematic achievement of director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie is there but limited."Suspects" is derived from a concept of a line-up of hardened criminals who have been brought in not with any evidence, but just because they are "the usual suspects." Their union, however, soon finds them all on a job that ends up with a giant boat explosion and only two survivors, one of them being only one of the criminals, "Verbal" Kint (Spacey) a constantly rambling cripple who must explain the entire situation to the police. The story is told almost entirely from Kint's perspective, which already adds a shade of suspicion to the plot.The film lines up in strong cast with Spacey including Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benecio Del Toro and Chazz Palminteri. Their characters, especially the criminals, all add an interesting dynamic to the film, keeping all the scenes interesting when the greater mystery is really the film's greatest asset.McQuarrie has lined the script full of gems so carefully that when he unloads one of the best twist endings in cinematic history, you are slapped across the face and filled with absolute glee. There's no other way to put it. Credit for this also should go to Singer and Spacey. There's no question that Singer's direction keeps up the intensity. It romanticizes the criminal lifestyle a bit, but it's necessary. Spacey's incredible portrayal of Kint, not only in his mannerisms but in his dramatic highs and lows keeps the storytelling engaging too.You simply have to watch this film and then watch it again. Then you will unquestionably like it to some degree. If you need a heavy dose of action in all your crime films, that degree will be lesser. This movie does rely heavily on script and character to keep your attention. However, as far as pure mystery goes, you can't beat "The Usual Suspects."
It's exactly not easy for a period film to feel magical, and this is something "The Cider House Rules" achieves almost instantly. No single element of the film feels completely original or totally inspired, but the entire package crafted by Lasse Hallstrom and John Irving has the fairy tale quality that Oscar contenders are made of.Component number one: the voice-over narration. Michael Caine, who plays Dr. Wilbur Larch, is a narrator comparable to Morgan Freeman in "The Shawshank Redemption," and that's not a comparison to be drawn lightly. Caine's words (credit to the script noted) set the ideal tone for this kind of a drama, and the story of an orphan who grows up and longs to experience is its lucky recipient.Although his origin story comes in fairy tale fashion, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) isn't some child with a special gift or a misunderstood outcast; he's just seemingly fated to not find foster parents. Consequently, Dr. Larch takes Homer under his wing and trains him to be a doctor at St. Cloud, the obstetrics hospital/orphanage in middle-of-nowhere Maine where they all live.Life at St. Cloud is isolated to say the least, and as much as Homer enjoys being a role model to the boys there, he's not ready to just assume the mantle of doctor that Larch has prepared him for. The arrival of a young couple seeking an abortion (St. Cloud had a reputation for performing them illegally), World War II pilot Wally (Paul Rudd) and his girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron), inspires Homer to see life beyond St. Cloud.The archetypes of "The Cider House Rules" seem all too familiar, but Homer isn't your typical clueless, naive young man whose world view gets him in trouble though he inspires. Instead, when you consider Homer's regular interactions with women and their anatomy, it's clear he's anything but prude. His sudden departure with Wally and Candy is not an act of rebellion, but of pure curiosity.There's a lot of Peter Parker in Maguire's performance, though to be fair "Spider-Man" came three years after "Cider House." Homer is almost foolishly self assured, and Maguire dials down the wide-eyed wonder you might expect from his character.If we're going to talk performance, however, it's Caine who takes the cake, and deserves his Oscar win. Larch is a loving father figure to Homer, overprotective at times and even hypocritical, a tad jocular and mischievous, but passionate about his work. As our elders so often do, he fails to recognize that Homer needs to experience the world in his own way, even if Larch's wisdom is worth being heeded.Homer's time as an apple-picker and lobster-wrangler seems far from an enviable existence, so it's tough to completely empathize with his choice to abandon St. Cloud, but his blossoming relationship with Candy provides the ultimate justification in love. Homer experiences the loss of innocence he never had in his time living in the cider house, whether it be learning from the workers who he lives with or discovering love through his intimate affair with Candy.During Homer's excursion, there's no question that something will call him back to St. Cloud. "Cider House" can't get away with hiding anything given its classic story structure and obvious tropes, but it can infuse everything with genuine emotion, and that's where it succeeds. In terms of original thinking, "The Cider House Rules" does explore notions of family. Whereas most films lean on traditional family values in terms of themes and eliciting emotion from the audience, there's a notion in "Cider House" that suggests that the biological notion of family isn't all it's cracked up to be, and in some cases can even be detrimental to our well-being. At the same time, Homer learns that role models  people who care about us wholeheartedly no matter our circumstances  are the real necessity. Even romance takes a back seat in this notion.Director Lasse Hallstrom presents this story in straight-forward fashion. His strength can be found in the way his style works so well in tandem with Rachel Portman's uplifting score. You could almost say that the tone of the movie dupes you into believing it's Oscar worthy, but because Irving provides such a solid story for the rest of the production, there's no trickery involved. "The Cider House Rules" is a triumph of writing to be certain.A pleasant drama aside from a few "challenging" moments, "The Cider House Rules" has that unmistakable quality of greatness, even in its predictability. It stands as testament to how the familiar can sometimes be a great thing.~Steven CThanks for reading! visit moviemusereviews.com
Imagine Bill Murray's suicide scenes from "Groundhog Day" as a futuristic science-fiction movie and you (sorta) have the groundwork for "Edge of Tomorrow." High (yet familiar) in concept, "Tomorrow" puts a needed twist on alien invasion films, succeeding by telling a story much narrower in scope yet still big in terms of storytelling stakes.Tom Cruise, rolling with sci fi yet again after last year's solidly entertaining "Oblivion" stars as Major Cage, a high-ranking officer for the United Defense Force, a global military power created in the wake of an alien invasion that has seen Europe taken over by "Mimics," extremely dangerous beast-insect hybrids with a penchant for world-conquering. Against his will, Cage (who has never seen combat) is dropped off at UDF's Heathrow Airport base on the eve of a massive military operation. The operation is quickly compromised the morning of the battle, and Cage dies, but somehow he wakes up the day before. He dies again in battle, and wakes up again, and the cycle continues. He eventually discovers he has harnessed the enemy's ability to reset time, and he must use it to defeat them."Edge of Tomorrow" resembles Ducan Jones' "Source Code" only it swaps out thriller/mystery elements for straightforward action. "Tomorrow" has no twists or surprises, but it makes its way from plot point to plot point with enough panache to keep your blood pumping. Writer Christopher McQuarrie along with Jez and John-Henry Butterworth have crafted a basic three-act film that wouldn't necessitate applause under normal circumstances, but under time alteration and a complex sci-fi context circumstances, that's neat and tight work.Whereas one might expect the film to take a misstep or step back in the second act after the novelty of the time-altering premise wears off, "Tomorrow" doesn't. The screenplay's million-dollar device here is to play with how much the audience knows, shifting from complete knowledge in the first act to keeping us in the dark the second. As Emily Blunt's Rita, a soldier who was the hero of a previous battle with the Mimics, factors more into the story, the movie begins showing the action from her perspective instead of Cage's, as if the events on screen have happened multiple times already but we don't know it. It's a drastically different form of suspense that really works.Blunt, by the way, continues to shine as a leading actress. Rita is well beyond stereotypes of sci-fi leading ladies, as she's self-determined, a bit of a brute and integral to the plot. Whereas her previous time-traveling effort in "Looper" was more supporting, she shares the lead in Cruise after her introduction in this film. Cruise also continues his mini-renaissance of sorts. His name doesn't translate to box-office dollars the way that it used to, but ever since "Mission Impossible  Ghost Protocol," he has reminded everyone why he's one of the best leading men in Hollywood, even at age 52.In the midst of the many well-functioning elements of "Edge of Tomorrow," it's easy to forget director Doug Liman. The "Bourne Identity" and "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" director has among Hollywood's most capable action hands when he's working with the right material. He doesn't do anything too flashy but he keeps the action intense and helps the story barrel forward. He has plenty of fun with the repeated sequences, such as a scene when Cage undergoes a painstaking training process and gets killed countless times because he's not the quickest at picking up combat technique.Great sci fi films change the genre. "Edge of Tomorrow" isn't that kind of a film, but it does the next best thing: merge two familiar concepts that have never been put into the same film and present something familiar yet fresh. Rather than going for the giant alien invasion, this story is smaller, more focuses and more intelligent. It could try bigger ideas and bigger concepts on for size, but it does a lot of things very smartly and very well.~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
Lance Clayton's (Wiiliams) son Kyle (Sabara) is a perverted and disrespectful jackass. He's obsessed with pornography, despises music and movies entirely, is flunking his classes and most of all, he hates his dad. Lance is a failed writer trying to keep his job as a high school poetry teacher and his co-worker girlfriend. But all that is about to change after a bizarre accident.Written and directed by Bobcat Goldthwait, director of numerous comedy shows such as "The Man Show" and "Jimmy Kimmel Live," "World's Greatest Dad" is an unlikely black comedy that will surely twist anyone's perception about what it means to be a genuine person.Williams give one of his best leading performances in maybe as much as the last ten years. He pumps Lance full of his trademark charismatic wit, but he's far from the character trying to be funny. The emotions of a man whose life is on the brink of failure going through a change as tumultuous as the one he endures is are varied and I think Williams plays them all nicely.The pride of "World's Greatest Dad" is the script. Goldthwait weaves a story that stretches our belief a little much but with great intention. Once you get over the hump and understand why many of its characters are more like caricatures, it's easier to imagine this bizarre scenario is real. Goldthwait laces this film with so much rich irony that his direction alone elicits laughter. The Obama-like photo of Kyle that appears on numerous occasions represents so much that just having it in frame it is part of the humor and even the poignancy.Non-traditional and a bit cliché at points, "World's Greatest Dad" is not perfect, but the undertones and intention behind the events of the film is where it makes its statement. It poses a moral dilemma to the audience that it resolves in a way that most people wouldn't consider as resolution, but it definitely works for this quirky dark film.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
I first heard of these books when I saw my younger brother reading  them. I got curious and when I saw they were making a movie was sure to  read the first three before seeing it. Right off the bat, I can tell  you that if you are a completely possessive fan of these books you  might be rather disappointed by this movie. The movie condenses books  "The Bad Beginning," "The Reptile Room," and "The Wide Window" by  slicing the first book in half and placing the other two inside of it,  like a sandwich. Of course in order for this to be possible the story  has to change to make it work, so some elements are not factual.  Combine this with Snicket's usually clever details in the book having  to be cut down and very loyal fans are going to be disappointed. The  movie also adds in a subplot that the first three books do not possess,  but that the later ones (according to my brother) do, so I was a bit  bothered by having that element ruined if i choose to read more of the  series.  I, however, understand the difference between books and movies, and  think that on the whole they succeeded in keeping the tone and  uniqueness of this series. Carrey as Olaf is wonderful and adds  something to a character that seems to be rather dry in the books and  the children are believable and easy to sympathize with. While humor  was scarce, the tone of the books is more clever than humorous anyway.  Overall my only issues are plot-wise and how this creates a choppy feel  to the film, but I don't know of a way it could have been done better.  The movie was well done with(as many are saying) excellent scenery,  costumes, etc., yet nothing made this film completely amazing. It is  however, worth the time and money and one should definitely read the  books. ~Steven C
A skeptic of "Alien" would quickly dismiss it on premise alone as unoriginal and gimmicky. Yes, it could be described in one way as "Jaws" on a spaceship, but director Ridley Scott takes a solid script from Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett and turns it into something remarkable and memorable, something more than just run-of-the-mill. What you have instead is the most popular and revered extra-terrestrial/outer-space thriller film of all time.Premise alone is not enough to make this movie work. 7 crew members on a giant mobile space station of sorts are kept from returning home when they receive an unidentified signal that they are required to answer and land on a strange planet where they pick up some killer cargo: an unknown alien species. The rest is a fight for survival on a spaceship. It's particularly bare, but Scott does something truly special with it by starting with the basics.From the opening minutes of the film (all silent, like much of the film), Scott patiently shows you the terrific scenic design work and paints a haunting portrayal of space akin to "2001: A Space Odyssey," which Scott himself has credited as an influence. One of the biggest flaws of all films in space that have come since is that they fail to capture the essence of space and its strength as a thematic element. Scott's focus on the context of space really allows the desperate emotions of the characters to show and creates an empathy for the situation. These people are completely alone, they are facing a dangerous unknown and morality is not a force in outer space. You don't think about those things in most other sci-fi/horror films, plain and simple.The characters are not as strong as the directing and set design, but Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is the first heroine/protagonist to emerge in the fray of a film. She is not established as the focal point until much later yet Weaver pulls you into her character quickly.Scott also masters suspense in this film like any good horror film should. While the "Alien" franchise has since taken to all out battles and action sequences, Scott takes the budget restrictions and makes the film better because of it. Seeing lots of a giant man in a rubber alien suit or an animatronic alien robot is not going to keep your viewer's credibility. I still think Scott actually showed too much of the alien, but for the majority of the film, the alien's rare appearance makes the drawn out suspense really work. You're just waiting to catch a glimpse of this thing (a technique employed most recently in J.J Abrams "Cloverfield")The cherry on top though is simply the thematic resonance. My expectation for a film like this to make me think at all is very, very low and "Alien" blows away that expectation. I expect to just be thrilled and scared a bit, not to weigh the pros and cons of being a species with a sense of morality. This film is terrific and I hope Scott will find his way back to science fiction before he calls it a career.
I don't have anything against talking animals. I love Disney movies like the rest of them. I'll take talking toys, bugs, bears, penguins, fish, you name it -- but an elite force of special unit guinea pigs in a live action setting is not something that screams fun for the whole family. No doubt that kids will get a kick out of mindless physical humor with chase scenes, explosions and high-tech gadgetry, but considering 2009 was full of terrific animated movies from "Coraline" to "Up" to "Cloudy with a Chance Meatballs," "G-Force" is a complete waste by comparison.A team of genetically enhanced talking guinea pigs works for a secret division of the government. When their plan to stop a mad man (Bill Nighy) goes sour, they're shut down and the guinea pigs end up at a pet store, where planning their escape and still managing to stop the bad guy will be their toughest challenge yet.Written by The Wibberleys ("National Treasure" co-writers), "G-Force" is another being a hero story only with balls of fur and consequently a lot of "that's because I'm small or furry or an animal" jokes. The big mistake, in my opinion, is combining live action and CGI. I think they could've made this film work all animated, but they chose the much cornier route. As a result, the film just looks worse and they cause themselves problems such as why the guinea pigs are talking CGI creatures but the dogs and squirrels in the movie are ordinary dogs. When the film goes "Transformers 2" at the end, it just makes things worse."G-Force" certainly has no lack of action. The plot moves quickly and the film is watchable. It's one thing to be bad and another to be bad and dull. "G-Force" is not dull, but it doesn't earn many more compliments. It's mostly the humor that backfires and attempts to write in subplots of g-pigs wanting to date other g-pigs. I must, however, compliment voice casting. Penelope Cruz, Nic Cage, Sam Rockwell and Tracy Morgan have great, distinctive voices. I thought Rockwell was particularly great at find a style that would really register as the hero of the group. He's the hardest voice to identify if you're an adult who enjoys playing that game in movies that demand no other thought like "G-Force."~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"The Promotion" is not a great or memorable comedy, but it's a brave one. Brave in that it doesn't give you what you expect from a comedy about Sean William Scott and John C. Reilly vying for the same promotion in a supermarket chain. The expectation is physical humor, gross-out shenanigans and general mayhem. What you get is a much more understated comedy that's built upon that foundation but ends completely different. Some will find this violation of expectations refreshing -- others will end up let down and bored.Scott and Reilly are assistant managers for a fictitious supermarket in Chicago. Richard (Reilly) is a recovering drug addict that has just transferred from Canada, which makes him a threat for the manager position of a new location set to open up in the future. It's a job that Doug (Scott) was a shoe-in for and one he was hoping would get him and his wife (Jenna Fischer) out of their thin-walled apartment and away from their banjo-playing sex fiend neighbor. Both are men in their early 30s trying to get to the next level and both are willing to do what it takes to get there.Normally, this is where the comedy goes chaotic with the rival asst. managers pulling obscene and childish pranks on one another, but not in "The Promotion." The immaturity is there, no doubt, but in more realistic fashion: the lying and cheating is a bit more subtle. The laugh factor might take a shot, but the conflict escalation stays strong even if the lid doesn't quite burst like it ought to.Creator Steve Conrad (writer of "The Pursuit of Happiness") deserves a pat on the back for this effort. His film is not the entertaining gut-buster most would make it out to be, but it's still funny. It just doesn't go out on a limb for some of the cheap jokes and slapstick of its blue-collar comedy predecessors. There's still foul language like Doug cursing at the gang kids hanging out in the store parking lot and perverted humor like when the store's Latinos convince Richard to ask one of the women about a supposedly excellent "sauce" that she "makes." It's there, but not as outlandish.The real persuading factor with "The Promotion" is its unspectacular but mildly poignant ending. Conrad actually has something intelligent to say in his film, or at least a proposed new way of looking at things. This is where those other more hysterical films comes up with some bogus, cheesy and marginally amusing ending to cool down the hijinx. "Promotion" makes a clear choice between the two possible endings to this story and offers up a unique explanation for it. That's a positive way of defying genre conventions.The entertainment threshold is certainly capped or limited by Conrad's approach, but it's applaudable in numerous ways and still enjoyable. It's scaled back and if you're open to that idea, it works. No person can check all expectations at the door upon watching a movie, but "The Promotion" will benefit from the open minds of viewers who choose to have them.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
"Blades of Glory" might as well sell itself as a live production called "Ron Burgundy and Napoleon Dynamite on Ice." Stars Will Ferrell and Jon Heder do nothing to escape the comedic shells that have consumed their careers and while the results are sometimes funny in that cozy, familiar way, it's all rather stale, especially when thrown into a typical sports underdog plot line.The film applies both the styles of Heder and Ferrell to the world of professional figure skating, which the writers must have thought was ripe with comedic opportunity. Instead, it ends up being full of spots to crack homophobic jokes and bathe in the comedic awkwardness of guys touching guys. Essentially, the two world-renowned skaters' hostility costs them their careers, leaving their only chance to skate again up to a loophole in the skating world that says they can compete as an all-male pair.Ferrell is at his most stereotypical playing a Chazz Michael Michaels, an ignorant, childish and narcissistic sex-addict, not all that different from when he made a cameo as another Chazz in "Wedding Crashers." It works sometimes because it's Ferrell doing what he's best at: tossing out creative insults and flaunting his unfit, harry body, but with years having past since "Anchorman," it's a tired act. Heder, who hasn't found much luck post-Napoleon Dynamite, doesn't get any luckier playing Jimmy MacElroy, a wimpy, whiny child skating prodigy. These comedians aren't channeling their talents into new characters, they're merely spitting out lines in attempt to be funny because their characters are written to their strengths and not to be unique, or entertaining for that matter.The most likable thing about "Blades of Glory" might be its supporting cast. While there's always the Saturday Night Live junket (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler play Tanya Harding- esquire antagonists), Jenna Fischer of "The Office" plays the love interest and Craig T. Nelson makes the most amusing appearance as Michaels and MacElroy's coach, a role he made famous on television in the show "Coach." Nick Swardson, a Happy Madison product, is also quite enjoyable as an effeminate psycho-stalker of MacElroy.There's a decent amount of good material, like Arnett chasing Ferrell through Montreal on ice skates or Ferrell ruining the on-ice kids show that employs him when he begins vomiting inside his costume, but there's nothing exciting or new to latch on to that makes the film more than simply worthwhile. It's easy to watch, but it's certainly at the bottom of the pile for Will Ferrell and others.
If you read the plot summary for "Mad Max," you've just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the film. You've also found out that "Mad Max" takes place in post-apocalyptic Australia, which will be helpful because otherwise you won't have any idea what's going on. The film, made in 1979, tries really hard to be Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" (1971) only that film, in all its strangeness, actually makes sense and leaves an impact. This film does neither and ends up being a car/bike stunt-filled romp that crashes like every vehicle in the film does.The first thing wrong with "Mad Max" is that it tries to sell itself as a revenge tale when no vigilante appears to take revenge until the final 20 minutes. If the first hour were condensed to 20-30 minutes and then the final 20 added on and then another hour added after that, "Mad Max would be a cool action film with a great vigilante protagonist. Instead, Mel Gibson has to wait around and act like a sissy for 2/3 of the film and then have a sudden epiphany to seek revenge. I've yet to watch the sequel "Road Warrior" and I have to admit I'm excited for it only because I want to know what he does next. This first film was mostly a waste of time.George Miller does some great action stuff here, but his over-the-top symbolism is absurd and the unbearable cheesy reaction sequences every time a character discovers something horrifying like a burnt hand or what have you completely ruins those moments. Its a terribly cliché B-movie technique.There is absolutely no thematic value or subtle critique of society in this film no matter what you might think. A great action sci-fi movie at least makes a point, but the gratuitous violence done by random, weird bikers doesn't say anything of value. Even the villain Toecutter feels modeled off Alex of "Clockwork" only uglier and completely unimposing. The PG violence just does not allow the violence of this gang to settle in and get a reaction from the viewer, it just cheeses it up if anything.I'll give credit for the amount of stuff the film crew blew up and crashed into things and Miller does a great job making you feel the intensity of the collisions. Everything else is mediocre at best and then after an hour of mediocrity, you get something good and the film ends 20 minutes later. I'm just crossing my fingers "Road Warrior" will fulfill the expectations of where this film ends, otherwise that's more time wasted. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
As much as you want to dismiss "Top Gun" as one of the cheesiest movies ever, it simply cannot be done. There might not be a lot to love about the film, but I challenge anyone to find something to hate about it.The story of Pete "Maverick" Mitchell (Cruise) and his partner "Goose" (Edwards) as they are selected to attend the Navy's top air academy for dogfighting is classically structured. There are so many archetypes (the mission gone wrong, the rebellious pilot, the instructor-student romance) that "Top Gun" has both an eye-rolling quality and yet a comfortably familiar quality. It's so easy to follow that you get bored through most of it, but you never once stop rooting for Maverick and Goose and you laugh at the completely implausible yet successful courting tactics employed by Maverick on his love interest, "Charlie."Another thing that can make a movie fun that "Top Gun" has plenty of is music. A rockin 80s soundtrack that can't be beat, from "Danger Zone" to "Take My Breath Away," the film is partially as lovable as it is because even if what you're watching is boring, what you're listening to is fun."Top Gun" could be a totally forgettable film, but it is that innocent, charming quality that lets it get away with the fact that everyone's who hasn't seen it thinks it is one of the best films of the 80s, when it is by no stretch of the mind in that category.
We all face an existential crisis at some time or another, just usually not when we're seven, which will likely be the mean age of children watching this newest non-Pixar non- DreamWorks animated feature. No, "Rango" won't challenge kids to contemplate their role in the cosmos, but that's precisely the predicament of its main character, a theatrical lizard who finds himself  as many animals in animated films do these days  thrust out of domestic bliss and forced to reckon with the untamed and unforgiving nature of the wild natural world. But in addition to all its verboseness and abstract homage to classic Westerns, "Rango" equally dishes out top-notch physical humor and creative characters for the young ones to lap up, even if they're not exactly of age to, as the film puts at least once, "ruminate."We don't learn much about Rango's life as a pet lizard. In fact, his name is not even Rango; he adopts it as his identity during his adventure. We do see him create his own theatre productions with the random items in his tank and he pretends that they give him feedback and criticism. When he determines that his latest show needs some intense conflict, he finds himself flung from his tank and on the side of the dry desert road. At the advice of an old armadillo (Molina), he seeks out water and stumbles upon the town of Dirt, a classic Wild West locale full or critters and experiencing a nasty drought.Johnny Depp quickly loses himself into Rango, a character that's somewhere between his take on Willy Wonka and his turn as Hunter S. Thompson. Depp churns out an outstanding animated protagonist, one who is equal parts boisterous and insecure. As the ultimate outsider in Dirt, our lizard hero has an epiphany: he can reinvent himself out here. He takes up his new name and makes up a fantastical tall tale and then with a pinch of luck, becomes the toast of the town and gets anointed sheriff. All seems swell, but something's up in the town with regards to the dwindling water supply and the local critters are getting restless. Rango must truly be the hero he masquerades as.The creatures of Dirt are fascinatingly animated. They are gritty and unpleasant looking, but awing in their detail. Rango's facial expressions even out-Depp the man behind them as embodied in the scrawny asymmetrical lizard. The animators do a particularly fine job of creating the hot and dry climate of the desert, enough so to recommend that the film is best enjoyed with a beverage in hand. It's so effective that it magnifies the problematic nature of this simple predicament done hundreds of times before. Hidden underneath it all somewhere has to be an environmental message, but not an overt one and not the main lesson to learn from the story.The language and texture of the film might be decidedly adult, but the conventions of the story and the degree of action aims specifically for children. Rather than aim for a middle ground, "Rango" somehow takes the highest road and the lowest road simultaneously. The dialogue and the situations are sophisticated but the physicality of the characters and the high-flying Western frontier action still plays to a child's understanding. This only proves that "Pirates of the Caribbean" director Gore Verbinski has a real gift for all-ages entertainment.In addition to Rango's existential quandary, children will not understand the cinematic homages either, particularly to spaghetti Westerns. One of the film's most affecting scenes comes at the moment when our animated hero, as they all do, hits the lowest of lows after he's exposed as a "fraud." Rango has a run-in with "The Spirit of the West," an instantly recognizable figure who has some old-fashioned advice about toughness and walking tall on the path you're given. It's a tender moment as what has been considered a bygone era of cinema plays an important thematic role in such a modern mainstream story."Rango" doesn't quite capture the degree of humor and emotional depth that the Pixar greats of the last few years have, but it's a fun adventure with exquisite animation, tasteful characters and a good heart, which puts it as an above-average offering compared to others of its kind. Adults will simply marvel at the intellectual boldness of this pure and simple kids movie and rightfully so. Only with a Pixar gold standard in place does "Rango" come across as flawed; otherwise it's an absolutely pleasant watch from start to finish.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The first warning sign of a bad superhero-esquire action movie is one that gets released in February. The distributors of "Jumper" clearly knew they had a rotten egg on their hands and released it in the month that only turns out a successful romantic comedy once every 5 years. They were very right, as "Jumper" fails to do everything a successful film of the genre has done."Jumper" is a film about a boy named David (Christiansen) who discovers he can teleport at age 15, runs away from home and robs banks to keep himself independent and then runs into problems when he finds people are out to kill his kind (yes, there are more than one) and those "hunters," led by Rolland (Jackson) have been fighting a war with Jumpers since forever. And of course David's childhood crush Millie (Bilson) gets caught up in the mix.The premise is classic comic book, a mixture of "X-Men" and "Underworld" a war waged between two groups, one with special powers, over the ability to "play God" in terms of being in many places at nearly the same time. The concept is not new, but it's not stale either, but the failure of the writers to take the "origin approach" that has made superhero films successful today, makes "Jumper" hollow and uninteresting.Christiansen is a great actor, but not exactly successful post-Star Wars, so his move to take the role seems justified. Had the film been created better to give his character more depth and actual audience empathy, Christiansen probably would have done a great job with the part, it's just unfortunate the film tells the story in a way that is confusing and well...jumpy.The concept undoubtedly leads to unique action sequences, but there is no significant linear motion in the film; it seems to be just getting started when it ends. That's okay--if there's interest in what happens--but no interest in any of the characters or their dilemmas makes it really hard to care what might lie ahead in the battle between jumpers and "paladins" as they are called.Basically, David does some stupid stuff, gets Millie involved, gets himself into more trouble and then there's a lot of teleporting and electric shocking going on. It's a pretty insignificant mess considering no effort is made toward the characters--the most important piece of a better than good action film. So other than some action sequences of note, a cool concept and one that pulls some of its own interest for at least the first portion of the film, "Jumper" falls way short for today's action/sci-fi/superhero movie standards.
The buddy cop comedy sub-genre has been limping about Hollywood as if shot in the leg from an awry 9mm bullet. Now it's been found by the duo of Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, the pair behind "Anchorman," "Talladega Nights" and "Step Brothers," whose brand of contemporary idiot humor has been steadily met with compounding criticism the last few years. But the combination of these two seemingly stale styles works somehow in "The Other Guys," even if it's not a total revitalization for either party.Ferrell's humor has led to the comedic veteran being liked or loathed in most peoples' opinions. Detective Allen Gamble borrows a bit more from the Ron Burgundy character profile that made Ferrell a household name in 2004 only much more modest. Both rely on the childlike innocence or unawareness that Ferrell handles best. Consider his most recent exploits, "The Other Guys" is refreshing. Pairing him with someone unpredictable in Mark Wahlberg was also a wise move. Wahlberg is the Type A of the twosome: angry, impulsive and bordering on wackjob. He operates on one level while Ferrell bounces up and down, occasionally going to his level and sometimes understating it nicely. It's a much more effective co-star than John C. Reilly, who offers too much of the same style as Ferrell, which in "Talladega Nights" and "Step Brothers" caused Ferrell to be the Type A guy.The two play detectives Gamble and Terry Hoitz, two NYPD desk jockeys who are, of course, totally mismatched. Gamble was promoted from accounting and Hoitz demoted from security. When Hoitz smells a big case surrounding a Bernie Madoff-like investor (Steve Coogan) that might put him back in the action where he feels he belongs, he forces the oblivious Gamble to step in with him.Fitted with even so much as jazz saxophone transition music, "The Other Guys" is a spoof at heart. Instead of the cheesy explosion that the pair survives in the nick of time, these guys get knocked off their feet and writhe on the ground in pain, with Ferrell shouting about blisters on his hands and the misleading nature of movie explosions. This additional "objective" of needing the film to serve as a spoof forces a bit more creativity out of McKay and Ferrell's writing. The usual improvised shenanigans wouldn't cut it here.The supporting cast in "Other Guys" is much more cameo-like than in past McKay/Ferrell movies. Rather than get wrapped up in giving other characters adequate screen time, the focus stays on Allen and Terry and their chemistry. Although it undercuts characters such as Eva Mendes as Allen's hot wife and Michael Keaton in a surprising but welcome comedic role as the police captain, it focuses the humor better and doesn't let it get to eye-rolling levels too often, at least as far as dumb characters are concerned."The Other Guys" definitely starts out stronger than it finishes. The biggest laughs are at the beginning and fade at the end as happens all too often in comedies that worry too much about resolving an uninteresting plot at the end of the film while also burning out recurring jokes (such as the Toyota Prius that Allen drives having a prominent place in the film).It's far from a Ferrell/McKay renaissance and it certainly won't leave you clamoring for more twists on the buddy cop comedy, but the two sides find a chemistry together that however brief, refreshes in a year light on good laughs.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Let me be forthright: this is an 8/10 on the entertainment scale, coming from someone who as a child, rented the original animated series over and over again every time his parents took him to blockbuster. This is not an 8/10 quality movie, but it gets that rating because it might be the most visually entertaining movie made to date.I remember nearly fainting when I saw the first teaser for "Transformers." That shock and awe factor certainly plays a huge role in enjoying this movie. If you thought Michael Bay made explosive movies before, try adding CGI to the mix. On the eye candy scale, we're talking the equivalent of Belgian chocolate here. Seeing the transformations happen and being teased a little more with them each time generates all the audience interest this film needs. Those who dislike Bay's over-explosive style will find more to critique here, but in all honesty, the man does a fine job giving us the entertainment we paid for.More interestingly, the trick that writers Robert Orci ("Mission Impossible III" and Bay's "The Island") and Alex Kurtzman have to pull of in this film is immense: take a film concept greenlit for entirely action and commercial-oriented purposes and legitimize it as much as possible with a plot. Even though it's obvious how hard they try, they deserve props for even making it somewhat feasible. For example, they try and swing it that the discovery of a frozen Megatron in the '30s is responsible for all our modern technology since because they studied how he worked. Hey, it's creative.The background info, which is given to us outright, is that the Transformers home world of Cybertron was destroyed by Megatron, leader of the Decepticons (bad guys) and the only device capable of creating new Transformer life ended up on Earth -- which no Transformers knew about until the movie started. The Decepticons want the device to create a world for them to rule and the Autobots (good guys) and their leader Optimus Prime want to destroy it so no evil can be done with it. Earthlings, who happen to be caught in the middle, have to suck it up and deal. Because no film would be any good with just machine characters, Orci and Kurtzman create Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf), your average teenager who gets sucked into the mess because as it happens, his great-grandfather discovered the frozen Megatron. He in turn sucks Mikaela (Megan Fox) into this mess because what fun is a guy running around getting hot and sweaty if he doesn't have an incredible gorgeous woman to get hot and sweaty with? Then there's a supporting cast that is so overkill it's ridiculous: soldiers, computer hackers/defense intelligence people, agents of a secret government branch, the list goes on. All that matters is they make the film barrel on like a flame-emblazoned blue mack truck.Then there's the attempt at humor, which succeeds when it isn't forced there and comes naturally out of the fact that there are giant robots hanging out in suburbia. Maybe the film's best non-action scene is when the Autobots go to Sam's house to get his grandfather's glasses and they attempt to hide from his parents. Otherwise, the humor is poor because with a film this plot and action driven, it only awkwardly interrupts the flow.The last mighty effort in the writing is to develop the thematic content. There's the idea of sacrifice and courage that come along with the hero's journey and are meant to please parents forced to take their children, but there's also the underdeveloped but interesting notion of weather humans are worth protecting as the Autobots do. That's rich with potential, but they don't sell us with it. But hey, we'll take the effort, because anything more than incredible visuals is icing on a movie like this.
"Forbidden Planet" has a lot of the elements of corny '50s sci-fi movies. It shows off its special effects in masturbatory fashion, features a robot, loads the dialogue up with esoteric science babble and portrays its one female character in misogynistic fashion (oh wait, that's all '50s movies). But "Forbidden Planet" doesn't simply trying to cash in on fans of "Flash Gordon" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still." Buried beneath it all is an ideal mystery plot with an intelligent payoff.The film follows a space crew investigating the sudden silence on Altair IV. Upon landing which they were warned not to dothey discover only Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) have survived (and let's not forget Robby the Robot). The intrepid Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen), Doc (Warren Stevens) and the playboy Lt. Farman (Jack Kelly) investigate and find that Morbius is hiding something from them."Forbidden Planet" is a special effects showcase, sometimes to a fault as scenes are designed almost exclusively around the movie magic, but compare it with the excessive CGI carnage of today's blockbusters and it's not something of which you can be all that critical. Besides, the weapon design, costume design and set design are all cohesive and tasteful, and in some cases marvelous.The plot does take a long time to get somewhere. A lot of the plot gets lost in writer Cyril Hume's aforementioned display of gadgetry and in the romantic subplot between Altaira and just about everyone else, but it ends up being worth the wait. The mystery at the heart of the film doesn't have an contemporary counterparts, and most films targeted at a genre audience like this one don't sneak in powerful human themes. No doubt Hume honored Irving Block and Allen Adler's "Twilight Zone"-esque story in doing so. In terms of acting, Pidgeon, playing Morbius, the man who keeps that secret, sells us with his passionate performance, especially at the end.Like all great sci fi, "Forbidden Planet" also plays with the notion of what's unseen. Perhaps Ridley Scott took some notes from director Fred M. Wilcox when he made "Alien," because the film hints at a frightening beast that it never shows and manages to wield a lot of suspense doing so. And you know it's legit, because clearly special effects and even makeup were not convincing enough in the mid-'50s to deliver a powerful creature reveal. Even though what comes you know won't measure up to your imagination, Wilcox has your imagination working, and that's the key.Also, the film's electronic soundtrack (eons ahead of its time) has to get a lot of credit (especially for the suspense part). You expect the usual cheesy suspense strings in '50s films, but "Forbidden Planet" retains an aura of mystery to this day I think in large part to a score that doesn't telegraphic any of the plot's moves.Although long stretches can be disengaging, and everything surrounding Altaira is pretty stupid, "Forbidden Planet" has its place in the canon of influential science-fiction movies. When you consider that the film's producers probably just wanted to make "an outer space picture," the end result is more than we could ask for.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The grittier and slightly more realistic alien invasion film "Battle: Los Angeles" poses and addresses the intriguing question of how the military would respond in the event of a full-on attack at the hands of an unknown enemy. The answer? Clichés; tons of them. Round up the troops, grab whatever clichés you can find so we can get the hell out of this cliché, and under absolutely no circumstances should you leave a cliché behind  unless it's for the greater cliché. Whatever hand-held camera prowess director Jonathan Liebesman has is almost entirely drowned out in these and other unfortunate scripting choices. The film's exceptional marketing led many to make early claims of "the 'Black Hawk Down' of alien invasion films," but "Battle: Los Angeles" is not the intriguing possibility of an alien invasion film from a military perspective; it's a military film in which aliens grace us with their presence. I get that the military won't lend its assistance to films that portray it in a negative light, but "Battle" borders on propaganda in many instances. The overarching theme of the film can be described as nothing other than "the military will fight for us, sacrifice for us and never give up, even in the face of probable oblivion." Without question, "Battle: Los Angeles" would've been a runaway hit in 1950.Any connoisseur of disaster films will tell you the best of the genre make you care about and feel for the characters. Adopt that as a rule of thumb and "Battle: Los Angeles" rates poorly by default. That's not to say writer Christopher Bertolini, whose last script was "The General's Daughter" in 1999, doesn't put emphasis on character backstory, because there's plenty of it, it's just shoddy and overrun with soldier/war clichés (the lieutenant's wife is pregnant, one guys is about to get married, one guy is suffering from PTSD, one guy is getting over the loss of his brother who was killed in the Middle East, one's a young kid who's still a virgin and then there's Staff Sgt. Michael Nantz (Eckhart), who is about to retire and wrestles daily with the demons of the men who died under his command in Afghanistan. If that all sounds novel and touching to you, you have some serious movie renting to do once you get out from that rock. Even Eckhart, who really sells us hard on his leading man ability here, can't overcome the stuff he's forced to say.The invaders (other than making a Predator-like clicking noise) end up being more intriguing than the human characters because the film effectively paints them as mysterious and frightening. Science-fiction fans will quickly lose interest in the trodden war story characters and become much more fascinated with who and what these aliens are and how they operate. In most cases, focus on character development would be applauded, but Bertolini and Liebesman seem to have misjudged how effectively they developed them. There's too much downtime in the action for them to talk to each other, bicker, share their emotions and make poor jokes at each other's expense. Add screen composer Brian Tyler's elongated undertones a la "Platoon" and the scales are tipped toward an embarrassing form of melodrama."Battle: Los Angeles" talks itself into intolerability at times. Like that friend you had in middle school that seemed cool but just wouldn't shut up and thus became irritating despite the best of intentions, every time a character opens his or her mouth in this film, it gets worse. The action pauses much more than necessary and the space gets flooded in with emotional speeches, wisecracks and stuff we're supposed to find touching. All this would be a bit more effective if the magnitude of the situation came entirely across, but despite Liebesman's eye for action shot composition, it never does. The scope stays too narrow on our military friends and the film never develops the sense of life-threatening urgency that makes the disaster genre so effective in general.I've no doubt that if Bertolini spent half the time he took writing things for the characters to say and invested it in creating moments for the characters to interact with each other fundamentally, "Battle: Los Angeles" could've been much better. I'm all for solo scripting duties, but another more experienced writer needed to be on board it seems. Rather than let his characters grow organically, he imposes their backstory upon us, which also becomes painfully more obvious with inexperienced actors of which there are many in the film.From a visual standpoint, "Battle: Los Angeles" commands attention with hard-hitting action and engaging scenarios, but for a film that so clearly appears to follow in the footsteps of some of science fiction's finest films ("War of the Words") and more progressive offerings ("District 9″), it departs so drastically from that pedigree with the military-heavy approach. Science fiction usually serves as a social or political allegory, not a motivational poster for societal values such as courage and determination. Regardless, rubble, carnage and mysterious aliens ought to be enough to get the job done, but they're not.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
How refreshing to see Adam Sandler not playing some character where he's a foul-mouthed East-coaster with no regard for other people that for some reason has an emotional side. "You Don't Mess With the Zohan" might not be comedic gold, but it's much fresher than anything Sandler has put out in years.What makes "Zohan" different is that Sandler plays an Israeli, in particular a super-human Moussad agent who has spent his whole life fighting Arab terrorists. For the first time, some semblance of Israeli culture has actually been brought to the big screen. I have to mention that I'm familiar with Israel and have met many Israelis, so what I brought to this movie was much more than what an average movie-goer would. With that said, Sandler definitely spoofs Israeli culture in a friendly way while also catering in a way toward American/national audience that would still be seen as funny and not merely an "inside-joke." The movie is definitely funnier if you are on the inside, but it's still unique and true to Sandler's ridiculous fashion no matter what.Sandler and co-writers Robert Smigel (SNL) and Judd Apatow (no intro necessary) decide to give us a story that reverses archetypes--instead of the protagonist who dreams of being a hero, Zohan, an incredible physical specimen (and absurdly so to all ends) dreams of being a hair stylist. But forget the plot, it's just an excuse to put Zohan in situations where the writers can create ridiculous goofs for him. I'm going to go into detail about the Palestinian terrorist side of the plot because it's just dumb. Don't see Sandler films if you require solid plot structure in all your movies.In terms of Israeli-Arab conflict, the film does address it directly, trying to make the point that in America the fighting between both sides disappears. It doesn't lean any particular way and it definitely equally makes fun of both groups. It's more or less a depiction that pays no real mind to sensitivity, staying objective by just making fun of Middle Easterners. Some would actually be bothered by the film, but I think many would like it too. It's just the kind of conflict Sandler invites.I wouldn't call "Zohan" great comedy, but Sandler's humor is sort of revitalized in this more transformative role. It's also the first comedy to really use digital effects impressively, like when they play hacky sack with a cat. It ends up being another ridiculous comedy, but with a little more wit in terms of characterization.
"The Spectacular Now," based on the novel by Tim Tharp, does us the unusual favor of depicting teenage relationships without any romanticism or moral agendas. It's a little surprising that it was adapted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, writers of "(500) Days of Summer," because that film definitely exaggerated its core romantic relationship, but what these films have in common is their avoidance of fairy tale endings.I won't spoil the end of "Spectacular Now," but it's indicative of the rest of the film: open- ended, morally ambiguous and full of raw, human connection. Sutter (Miles Teller) is a party boy senior in high school fresh out of his best relationship yet with a girl named Cassidy (Brie Larson). Incapable of being alone, when he encounters Aimee (Shailene Woodley), a girl in his class he never knew existed, he sees her as a project of sorts and convinces her to tutor him in geometry in order to spend more time with her. Eventually, of course, he becomes smitten.Sutter's intentions are a little vague, so at times it's painful to watch Aimee, the shy, quietly beautiful bookworm, fall under his spell, but the reality of high school relationships is thus. It's difficult because most people who watch the film have been there and made these mistakes, but that's part of the authenticity of the story. The bigger elephant in the movie is Sutter's alcoholism. It's rampant in the film, but goes almost entirely unaddressed. Aimee accepts Sutter's drinking habits and encourages them time to time as well. This is hard to understand and accept as a viewer, but speaks volumes to the film's attitude on the whole. The entire film we wait and wait for some kind of underage drinking accident or for drinking to become part of the conflict, but it doesn't. The story doesn't want to preach; the drinking is part of Sutter's character and tells us about what's going on with him on the inside. Director James Ponsoldt communicates this quite well, no doubt aided by his experience directing the 2012 Sundance hit "Smashed," about a relationship between alcoholics.Ponsoldt makes much of "The Spectacular Now" feel natural. Scenes between Teller and Woodley have such a relaxed, true-to-life feel. Regardless of whether their dialogue veered from the script or not, their comfort on screen and with one another is evidence of Ponsoldt's ability to work with talent. "The Spectacular Now" has the look of a typical coming-of-age film, but something about the script and Ponsoldt's direction makes it feel extremely atypical. In terms of the story and screenplay, it's the way the adult characters interact with the young people. The traditional roles parents (Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kyle Chandler play Sutter's divorced parents) play in the lives of teenage main characters doesn't subscribe to the same, often melodramatic dynamic present in coming-of-age indies. But while Ponsoldt, Neustadter and Weber have treated Tharp's story with a heavy dose of maturity, it doesn't mean the behaviors of all the characters reflect the same maturity. In fact, it's the lack of maturity in a lot of cases that makes the film so honest. It's troubling for us to watch the bad things that we expect to happen unfold on screen, like the indie coming-of- age equivalent of the horror movie character who opens that stupid door, but it can be liberating to let go of the concept that filmmakers should be moral arbiters of the story they're telling. It's like parents who let their children learn the hard way.Living in the moment is a message most people get when they walk away from a coming-of- age film, but "The Spectacular Now" treats that as square one. Sutter is all about living in the moment, he has the whole "live while you're young" thing figured out, and the movie tells a story that complicates our understanding of what it means to live in the present.~Steven CThanks for reading!

There's a reason that the only Academy Award won by "The Third Man" went to Robert Krasker for cinematography. Of all the film noir I've seen, this night-shrouded mystery is the most visually superb. Forget the crisp dialogue or the magnetizing performance of supporting actor Orson Welles -- the picture quality of Sir Carol Reed's masterpiece is its paramount attribute.Taking place in Vienna post WWII, "The Third Man" follows pulp novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) on a trip to meet his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) in Vienna, only Holly soon learns that Harry has died in an accident. Looking for answers, Holly discovers that there's more to it than he realized and that Harry might not have been the person he thought he was. Trevor Howard and Alida Valli co-star as Maj. Calloway, who leads the investigation into the truth of Lime's death and Anna, Harry's former lover whom Holly falls for.Darkness pervades nearly every scene as Holly inches closer to the truth. Coupled with Reed's keen eye for dramatic camera angles, the film maintains suspense throughout, often times leading us to believe danger lurks at every turn when nothing all that visually exciting is taking place on screen (until the infamous final sewer sequence, where the film makes its biggest visual statement.)For 1949, Reed and Krasker capture an indescribable beauty in the shadows of their film, one easily comparable to today's movies despite light years of technological advancements. Without color, film noir has to make a visual statement with vividness of light and it's really just tremendous how successful Krasker is at making that statement.Orson Welles is the perfect actor in the film's most mysterious role. His Cheshire cat smile and his drastically altered world view make him fit flawlessly into the film's dark universe. His presence sort of wakes you up in a film whose actors are talented but lack a clear signature, one that draws you to them characters. He brings a much needed thrill to the movie.When it comes to shots that stand out in your memory, "The Third Man" is loaded with them. Plain and simple, it's why this film is remembered and remembered fondly 60 years later.
Ben Affleck's second feature film as a director -- if nothing else -- proves he's no fluke. In all the ways his sincere and revealing debut "Gone Baby Gone" succeeds, so does "The Town." Both are Boston-based crime dramas that are both touchingly dramatic at times yet gripping at others. More impressive with his work on "The Town," however, is that it proves he could just as easily go on to direct an action blockbuster as he could an Oscar-winning drama.It starts with the cast and the performances he gets from them. In 2007, he helped Amy Ryan to a supporting actress nomination, and that's ignoring the other talents in the film such as Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan and Ed Harris. In "The Town," he gets Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner in his first major film since his breakout in "The Hurt Locker" and Jon Hamm in his first major film since TV's "Mad Men" took off. He also gets a pair of up-and-comers in Rebecca Hall and "Gossip Girl" star Blake Lively. And that's not to mention Pete Postelthwaite and Chris Cooper. Next to "Inception," it's the best ensemble cast of the year.Based on the Chuck Hogan novel "Prince of Thieves," the film follows a team of bank robbers from Charlestown, an area notorious for grooming the best at intercepting armored cars and taking down banks. As with "Gone Baby Gone," also based on a novel (by Dennis Lehane), the city of Boston and the people and culture are as important to Affleck as the plot. He's sure to let shots of the Charlestown bridge and Fenway Park soak in amidst the ever-building pinch the main characters are in.Doug MacRay (Affleck) and his buddy Jim (Renner) and a couple others pull off a bank job in the opening scene, but when it doesn't go exactly as planned, they're forced to kidnap the bank manager (Hall). To make sure she didn't see anything and can hand them on a platter to the feds (led by Jon Hamm's Special Agent Frawley), Doug trails her, only to find himself falling for her."The Town" is one of those crime dramas/bank-job action films that while not revelatory for the genre, executes everything well and sticks to a character-driven story in order to stay meaningful. Perhaps the reason it works so well is because it floats in between the drama, never becoming too much of a guns 'n robbers flick, but also not slipping into crime melodrama for too long. Affleck's performance as MacRay acts in accordance; it's tastefully understated and he lets go of the machismo that has marred a few of his previous roles.The film also has an unexpected but much appreciated sense of humor. In a mile-a-minute crime drama/thriller, you don't expect to laugh the way you will in "The Town," which speaks even more to the writing and Affleck's versatility. Even if there are some plot conventions and no-surprise characters (as good as Hamm is, he's playing every other quick-witted FBI guy in films), the dialogue is sharp, the story is exciting and the way we are so easily able to see things from MacRay's perspective as the bank robber who wants out makes up for any use of convention as a crutch.There's no doubt that if "The Town" becomes a success that studios will seek out Affleck for some more high-profile projects and it will certainly be interesting to see how he handles material not rooted in Boston sub-culture. As long as he continues to get such memorable performances out of his actors, he'll be doing things on the other end of the camera for a long time to come.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
After "Jaws" launched him toward eternal fame in 1975, Steven Spielberg's follow-up film would tackle a bigger cultural phenomenon: UFOs. "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" was only the beginning of the director/producer's love affair with the possibility of life on other planets and the first to capture the magnitude of what first contact would be like with aliens in the era of emerging special effects.But let's take a look at a film released just before it, in the same year (1977) in fact. A little film called "Star Wars." More than 30 years later it might not be fair to compare to the two, but the truth is that one film was about producing a big-budget cash-eating spectacle while the other was fulfilling the dream of a filmmaker to tell an amazing story in a world never before imagined. "Star Wars" has heart and "Close Encounters" has nothing but our attention.It's hard to knock a film made before I was born in an era where I can't appreciate it for what it was at the time, but there are a lot of fundamental storytelling principles simply left out of this story that one cannot overlook. Visual effects, cinematography and Spielberg's knack for crafting great cinematic moments aren't enough to cover up barely existent character motivation.I've read that Spielberg has regrets about the ending of this film, that his main character, Roy (Richard Dreyfuss), wouldn't make the choice he makes in the end. I have to agree -- and it's symptomatic of his entire film. Roy is a normal suburban Indiana family man who we don't know much about. Then his truck stalls and he has a close encounter with some kind of UFO. Suddenly he's a madman, being haunted by images of a mesa, ruining his familial relationships. He's driven as if by some other force to go all the way to Wyoming to figure out what it's all about.Spielberg has us at that last bit of figuring out what it's all about. Roy, on the other hand, and the mother of a child who was "abducted" (Melinda Dillon) are just inexplicably possessed and driven to madness by a vision of a mesa. Roy going crazy and throwing dirt into his kitchen window or randomly sitting in the tub with the shower on for hours keeps our attention, but there's little sympathy going on because we really have no idea who he is. The ending scene of the film is much the same way. It's this drawn out scene of VFX spectacle and flashing lights and John Williams music but it's only a climax in that awing sense and in finally delivering what the film has been hiding from us the whole time. It is not a climax of great character realization (or at least epiphany that makes sense). It can be completely basic, like Luke Skywalker trusting the force, believing in his destiny and then becoming victorious, but it still has to be there and resonate with us in some way.I certainly recognize some of the brilliant scene work Spielberg does throughout parts of the beginning and the latter half of the film, but there's a reason this is not a classic for all generations: great movies, especially sci-fi films, tell stories that transcend bad special effects or any other inhibitors and "Close Encounters" is about making a suspenseful film, not telling a deeply human story.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
For the most part, hockey movies have been treated the same every other sports comedy or drama  with an underdog story and plenty of in-game footage. Enter "Goon," a comedy that depicts the sport for all the guts and little of the glory. Not since "Slap Shot" has a hockey flick been this violent and verbally assaultive. Sean William Scott stars as Doug "The Thug" Glatt, only Doug is anything but his new moniker. Big and meaty on the outside, Doug's a veritable teddy bear  soft-spoken and loyal. His fists, on the other hand, are considerably more audible. After a D-league hockey player climbs out of the box to go after his friend, Ryan (Jay Baruchel), Doug knocks him out cold and catches the eye of the team's coach. Despite not being able to skate, the team brings him on as the enforcer, the guy sent out on the ice to rough other players up to retaliate for dirty hits.In hockey, all teams bring in more aggressive players whose skills consist of picking fights, checking bodies into the boards and if they're lucky, causing problems in front of the net. "Goon" attempts to examine what being that kind of role player is all about, and it's not pretty.With a screenplay from Baruchel and buddy Evan Goldberg who wrote "Superbad" and "The Green Hornet" with Seth Rogen (among other films), "Goon" is mainstream funny with an indie sensibility. When Doug signs a minor-league farm system contract with a team in Halifax, the cast of absurd characters triples as his new teammates are straight up degenerates. The crude humor that follows echoes the thankless, dirty, unfiltered nature of the sport, or at least the aspect that "Goon" wants to tap into."Goon" starts to get a little aimless despite the improved humor once Doug and the Halifax Highlanders try and turn things around. His only motivation is to come into his own, as his family of Jewish doctors doesn't approve of his new career. He has a love interest named Eva (Alison Pill), a teammate who hates him named Xavier LaFlamme (Marc-Andre Grondin) and then there's a veteran enforcer on the verge of retiring named Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber) whom he appears destined to cross paths with by the end of the film.Doug fancies the idea of being an actual hockey player, not a goon, and that seems to be the driving question of this chunk of the movie. LaFlamme was supposed to be the next big thing before Rhea knocked him out cold in a pro game, and the would-be super star has never been the same player (not to mentioned resorting to doing blow off of hookers' backs). Doug is headed in the opposite direction, so there's a conflict there, but it doesn't extend beyond the realm of the obvious fact that they need to work together.Doug isn't exactly a flawed protagonist either, unless naiveté is a flaw. He's a saint compared to LaFlamme, and his entire relationship with Eva is about all of her problems because she has a boyfriend despite being really into sweet and innocent Doug. The two are adorable to watch, but their relationship has no bearing on the film and could've been cut entirely.Schreiber knocks his part into the boards as Ross "The Boss" Rhea, a grislier, more hardened version of Doug, perhaps a future Doug should Doug take up Ross' attitude toward the game. Schreiber give us a quiet but confident Canadian with a matter-of-fact sense of humor, a real transformation for the actor (who did live in Canada but when he was younger than five years old).Director Michael Dowse makes the best of the loud, dirty an hilarious script and the great talent that came with it, not glorifying the language or the violence but still showcasing it in such a way that it defines the tone of the film. His opening shot of a splash of blood hitting in the ice in slow-motion captures the inherent tradition, humor and somewhat despicable nature of violence in hockey.~Steven CThanks for reading!

For at least a decade now, the first name in animation has been Pixar, with the Disney half of that combination generally omitted. Pixar's dedication to the best storytelling in both written and visual form as well as incredible creativity and cleverness has generally gone unparalleled, but plain old Disney Animation show it's catching up fast with "Wreck-It Ralph."The concept behind "Wreck-It Ralph" owes a lot to the "Toy Story" movies that started the entire CGI revolution, but the level of complexity and creative world-building required by "Ralph" puts "Toy Story" in the bargain bin. Creating a world in which video game characters exist in a virtual network of arcade games after the arcade closes takes some serious ingenuity, which not only do director Rich Moore, writers Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnston and the entire creative team have in spades, but they keep their foot on the creativity gas pedal the entire time.Based on the genre's track record, an animated movie overflowing with this much artistic production design would likely fail in some fundamental aspect of the story, but "Wreck-It Ralph" wastes no time establishing Ralph as a character you sympathize with. The concept of a video game bad guy who has feelings and gets treated poorly because his job is to be mean fuels the emotional journey of the story from the opening minutes, though credit also to the writing and the voice work of John C. Reilly for making it such a convincing sell.After throwing Ralph this successful pity party, the film shows off its abundance of imagination and cleverness. As we see "Game Central Station" for the first time, essentially a power strip where the characters of every game can mingle, we get most of the film's famous video game character cameos. Because the film is still constructing this elaborate universe, we also get treated to several brilliant moments in which instead of traditional CGI, we will see a clip of the scene as if it were happening on an 8-bit arcade screen.The genius of "Wreck-It Ralph" in this regard simply can't be understated. It's easily the most creative and genuinely hilarious animated film since "Toy Story 3," and if you discount that, then all of recent memory. Gamers will love the countless early references and most adults in general will find the beginning of "Ralph" to be the best part. The script clearly takes the strategy of dropping in most of the easter eggs at the front end so it can win audiences over quickly and focus on the core narrative in the later acts. At this point, the humor in the story also shifts to something more geared at kids, though it never stops pumping the creative juices.Determined to win a medal so he can prove to everyone in his game, "Fix-It Felix Jr.," that he's a true hero, Ralph abandons his post as building-wrecker and searches for a way to prove himself (or just get his hands on a shiny medal). He sneaks into the first-person sci-fi shooter "Hero's Duty" and when that plan goes awry, he accidentally ends up in the candy- coated racing game "Sugar Rush" and becomes entangled in an entirely new conflict after "Sugar Rush" character Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), an outcast in her game, steals his medal.The plot does get a bit complicated, but the film remains dedicated to its characters throughout and doesn't ever get too lost. Even Ralph goes from a character we pity at first to someone who's rather flawed in how he just wants to be treated like a hero rather than earn it. Naturally, the situation in the world of "Sugar Rush" provides the ultimate test for his character. He and Vanellope strike a deal so he can get his medal and so she can win a spot as a starting racer in "Sugar Rush" despite being a glitch in the game.Setting the majority of the later half of the movie in the candy world of "Sugar Rush," the creativity comes in the form of creative junkfood jokes such as donut cops and an abundance of candy puns, as well as Ralph and Vanellope exchanging childish insults. It can get overbearing, but something clever and hilarious lies in wait around every corner to cancel the cheesy stuff out.The sheer force of this film's vision and inventiveness has the power to mask pretty much any knock you might consider holding against it, and it doesn't substitute creativeness for visual quality either. "Ralph" looks excellent, with props to the way that film's retro arcade characters move like 8-bit game characters despite being in CGI."Wreck-It Ralph" doesn't quite have the same degree of heart as Pixar's best offerings, but considering the extremely commercial nature of the concept, the fact that it does pull heartstrings at all is something that will make you think even less of films like "Cars 2." Ralph's arrival at self-realization has somewhat of an obvious trajectory, but it's not as clear cut as the moral lessons presented in most animated movies. There are some powerful turns in the emotional narrative that you don't expect from a movie that combines the shooting of deadly alien bugs and little tween-age girls driving edible race cars.Ultimately, "Wreck-It Ralph" offers something we just haven't seen (outside of "Toy Story") since the dawn of the CGI era: a near-perfect merging of the somewhat mindless and shiny commercial appeal common in lesser family films and the creative and visual brilliance and committed storytelling of the genre's absolute best.~Steven CThanks you for reading!

When you watch "Catfish," your first inclination will be to doubt its authenticity. There's no way Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost just randomly began filming Ariel's brother Yaniv and his online friendship with a 9-year-old artist and it happened to evolve into this fascinating story, right? Well, whatever you think of the movie's self-involved documentary style, what it reveals about the online world we live in is both culturally and humanly powerful, and the more you surrender to the truth of it, the better it is.You don't need to know much going in because it's a documentary, but Yaniv "Nev" Schulman is a photographer in New York City who specializes in dance photography. One day, he receives a painting of one of his pictures in the mail and he learns it's from a 9-year-old girl named Abby. Nev starts to commission pieces from Abby and they develop an online friendship. Soon, however, they make a discovery that leads them to be skeptical of Abby, and Nev, Ariel ("Rel") and Henry begin to search for the truth.Nev becomes deeply involved in this online friendship, connecting with Abby's family including her mom, Angela and older sister, Megan, who is extremely attractive from what can be seen on Facebook. Nev starts to become really close with Megan, which adds a layer of romance into this online thriller of a story.The Internet and social media have never been more prevalent in a film as they are in "Catfish." Schulman and Joost also employ techniques to remind us of how steeped in the digital world we are. Much of the time you're looking at a pixelated computer screen at messages, images and words being typed. There's also the use of Google Maps to show how the three of them are traveling. We're so familiar with Facebook and Google Maps that they can evoke certain feelings when utilized to tell this story in a compelling way."Catfish" stands out from other documentaries in that it's not about an issue, there's no secondary footage and no one is being interviewed in a formal way. It's much more like a found footage movie in the way that the people behind the camera are part of the story and the purposes of the camera's presence are known to all involved. That's probably a large part of why people resist embracing it as authentic; we're used to seeing this style in fictional movies.The direction enhances what's already a compelling story. We yearn to know the truth once we discover there's reason to think Nev's very believable situation is in fact just a facade. As evidence begins to mount, it becomes no less intriguing because we have to know exactly what's going on and more importantly, the truth of the "who" of what's going on.What awaits is something you'd never expect. At one point you wonder if it won't take a turn for horror  it's that suspenseful. Instead, something powerful emerges that speaks to the world we live in today as well as the connection between the online world and the human experience.At this point, it sounds weird to call "Catfish" generation-defining. But as it continues to age, it will only be seen more and more as the film that hinted at what life has become now that so much of our world and thoughts and feelings exist in a digital space. I watched this film just three years after it came out, and already we have a huge real-world example in the Manti Te'o girlfriend hoax. That should be a pretty clear sign that "Catfish" isn't fake and that this exists in our world."Catfish" will continue to be an important film the more and more that we use the Internet to forge our identities (no pun intended) and try to make meaningful connections with others. For now it seems like a rare occurrence, something factually vague in which blame should be primarily placed on the one who has been deceived for not being skeptical, but it's easy to say it would never happen to us. Just imagine as more and more children are born into the online world and how inextricable their online identity will be with their real-world one. It will only be harder to discern truth from fiction.~Steven CThank you for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
Good storytelling and high school comedies seem to never go hand-in-hand, especially when MTV is involved, but "Election" breaks that barrier. Sure, it helps that it's more dark comedy and involves adult topics and situations, but Alexander Payne has crafted a film that surpasses high school clichés. He skillfully juggles four highly developed protagonists at once, three of them high school students, and manages to squeeze something more than a coming-of-age story out of them.Adapted from a novel by Tom Perrotta, "Election" centers around the titular event, in particular one for high school president. Overachiever Tracy Flick (Witherspoon) expects to run unopposed, but student government adviser Jim McAllister (Broderick) strongly dislikes her after her affair with another teacher, one Jim was friends with, got the teacher fired. Disgusted by the idea of her getting another something she wants without consequence, Jim inspires the injured quarterback of the football team, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), to run against her. As if that weren't enough, Paul's younger sister Tammy, a sophomore, decides to run when her best friend ditches her and starts dating Paul.Payne's screenplay calls for a lot of narration among these four characters. We get inside their heads to learn of their conscious desire for why they're running or in Jim's case trying to ruin Tracy, but what we see on screen, of course, are some major subconscious motives. For example, everything going on in Jim's personal life -- his inability to get his wife pregnant and his eye for his recently divorced friend -- bleeds into his conduct at school. His narration says life was going good, when we see he's already making the choices that will lead to a foreshadowed end. Payne executes narrative here the way it's supposed to be done. It might seem overwhelming with four characters, but the transition is logical and often times clever.These are four great characters too, with the perfect actors in their parts. Each is given a clear portrait, characteristics that we like and dislike. Jim is an excellent, award-winning teacher with a sound moral compass, then again he denies issues in his personal life. Broderick's boyish looks but good dramatic skills have always helped him play double-sided characters. Tracy is ruthless and cares way too much, but we see her lonely side too, her fear when she crosses the line as portrayed well in her inner-monologue by Witherspoon. Klein plays an excellent Paul, dumb and naive, but well-intentioned and lovable. Then Tammy, with her rebellious exterior, seems to be the most honest.Unlike most high school comedies, the dark nature of the humor in "Election" keeps the events of the film mostly unpredictable, the surprising actions taken by the students and Jim throughout the story to get their way can be startling, unsettling or even emotional at times. This isn't your typical high school revenge story, the characters make choices based on their personal lives, their deep character issues, not strictly for laughs or because their "jock" or "goody two-shoes" stereotype calls for it. Payne establishes that this film is really about the democratic ideas of the election, the choices we make in our lives and the underlying moral or morally questionable desires that guide them in sometimes irrational ways. Whether in high school or older, we still make those choices all the time. To Payne, we can actually find meaning in high school drama in addition to humor.
Life in Germany during the Berlin wall tends to get overshadowed cinematically by that war during the 30s and 40s. While countless films recall a plethora of WWII stories, few, and certainly none in recent memory recall the 1980s. "The Lives of Others" takes us to this critical time in history and really strikes at the global relevance of what was going on.The film is German filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's first simultaneously written and directed project and it recalls the days of the Statsi in East Berlin, who made it their business to know everything about anyone that might be disloyal to the socialist state of East Germany. A high profile couple of a writer and an actress become of interest and Wiesler, the main character, is in charge of listening in on their lives. Wiesler becomes attached to the couple and when their appears to be some anti-German Democratic Republic activity going on, Wiesler has a moral crisis on his conscience.The film is not as much a moral dive into the voyeuristic tendencies of human beings, but it certainly calls on those elements as an entry point into the minds of the characters being spied on as well as Wiesler. It's more about identifying what "doing the right thing" really is. The concept is certainly not abstract or foreign (no pun intended) to film, but in the fresh historical context of Germany in 80s, it sheds a different light on the subject.Donnersmarck handles this film with grace. He has some really powerful images and great edits (the opening sequence is flawless in alternating past and present clips) and in general tells a very quiet, basic story without any intense drama in a way that keeps you interested in what's going on or what will/will not happen to the characters. That's really something and I'm sure this film won't be the last he sees of the Academy Awards.
The concept of war in their own backyard is a foreign one to most Americans. With two tragic exceptions, no blood has been shed on American soil in wartime since the Civil War. "First Blood" is a thrilling fantasy in that regard, turning the Pacific Northwest into the Vietnam jungle and introducing a character so deadly and skilled yet so mentally unstable that he manages to elicit both sympathy and total fear.John J. Rambo (Stallone) is a dangerous case of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder drifting his way toward Portland after learning that no one who survived Vietnam from his unit is still alive. At first he's quiet and complicit -- a perfect role for Stallone -- but when he starts getting lip from a small-town sheriff (Brian Dennehy) who arrests him out of pure dislike, his abuse by the police awakens painful memories and he violently escapes, using the wilderness as a hideout from the relentless and prideful sheriff, declaring "war" when they draw first blood.Stallone creates his second iconic character in Rambo, a role fitting for his limited acting range: He must either say nothing, be violent or act completely insane. Still, the character is cool, intimidating and his unfair treatment in the film manages to win our support and sympathy. He is terribly misunderstood and completely dangerous; an exciting combination for a main character."First Blood" is not a great example of suspenseful and exciting film-making, but Rambo's raw, untamed survivor-man appearance and the fact that at some point in the film you know he's bound to go berserk, keeps the film interesting. That and the fact that the colonel who trained Rambo (Richard Crenny) keeps dropping these giddy one-liners such as "I didn't come here to rescue Rambo from you, I came here to rescue you from him." The acting is mostly sub-par, with even a young David Caruso giving some of the worst and most awkward line deliveries I've ever seen. Dennehy is good but his character is so completely stubborn and ignorant that he hardly counts. Regardless, the acting does nothing to enhance the movie -- it's success is all about a great, simple concept.Rambo is completely uncomplicated, not even delving into Rambo's Vietnam experience other than a few quick flashbacks and his one monologue to Colonel Trautman. It could have made the film better, but a dangerous war vet taking out small-town American cops when it wasn't even his fault is genius fodder for an action movie and even some food for thought.
There's no way to watch "Following" and not conclude that Christopher Nolan would become something special. Someone who can weave that much complexity into a film with a cast of few and in the course of just 69 minutes clearly has a knack for the film-making thing."Following" might not amount to a whole lot other than being the evidence necessary to secure financial backing for Nolan's even more chronologically elaborate follow-up, "Memento," but it holds its own. If "Memento" is Clue than "Following" is Clue Jr. There are fewer characters, fewer loose ends to tie up, but the same desired effect is achieved.The story begins with a young man (Jeremy Theobald) explaining to someone how he began following people. An aspiring writer, he's fascinated by people-watching (and to some extent we all are), yet he admits he broke a few of his personal rules and therefore got caught up in the ensuing story.One of the men he follows too far is Cobb (Alex Haw), who confronts him in a coffee shop. Before the young man knows it, he's beings swooped up by Cobb, who has a knack for trespassing and "robbing" houses (he doesn't take much). A total loner, the young man becomes his sidekick of sorts.From this point on the film jumps out of order. Scenes from the end of the story are jumbled in with scenes from the beginning and scenes from the middle, with our only visual clue being the length of the young man's hair. This is where the noir-style thriller comes in and justifies Nolan's choice to shoot in black-and-white. The film seems like it will be a social experiment gone wrong, but "Following" evolves into a thick mystery.After a thorough brain-scrambling, Nolan delivers the pay off by revealing twists one at a time. There are even twists on twists, quite the skill and daring for a first feature film. An amateur without a true gift would fail to dupe or impress anyone, but Nolan does both.In order to make this climax work, Nolan does sacrifice a bit. Scenes we should have been paying attention to have no other compelling reason to keep our interest even though we'll wish we had kept it when the credits role. Part of this is because he only had amateur actors, part is because the scenes only exist so that the ending makes sense and leaves no margin for error.It's easy to see why Nolan has risen to elite filmmaker status in just 12 years of feature film-making (to this point), and there's no doubt cinephiles will be following him for many years to come.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Sofia Coppola chose quite the challenge for her debut as a writer and director, a film based on the novel "The Virgin Suicides" by Jeffrey Eugenides. A portrait of suburban life in the '70s, "Virgin Suicides" tells (among other things) of the ripple effect that one suicide can have on a small town and a family ill-equipped to deal with it.The film focuses on the five Lisbon sisters who lead a very sheltered life thanks to their parents (Kathleen Turner and James Woods), but it's told from the perspective of the high school boys who were enchanted by these five blond-haired "angels." Coppola does a superb job mimicking that effect for the viewer; we constantly feel on the outside looking in when it comes to these ladies, obsessing over them in a way or at least fascinated.For the most part, "Virgin Suicides" is a coming-of-age film, but one that makes its sad ending very clear, which casts a sort of shadow over the nostalgic feelings and cuteness that suburban America period films are known for. Coppola creates a contrast in tones in that much of the film centers on these gooey moments (such as the homecoming dance) yet there's an undeniably tragic undercurrent. It draws a clear connection to the fact that teenage depression was largely ignored or at the least misunderstood at this point in time with the false hope that the sparkling naivety of the '50s and '60s would continue to last. At the same time, the film doesn't speak only to a specific period of time. The goal is not just to serve as a cautionary tale that shames the parents of that generation for not "getting it" and warns current parents to be less overbearing. The more universal parallel is how we as outsiders react to a tragic situation like the Lisbons and handle ourselves as a society and as individuals when a shocking occurrence tries to shake us from the complacency of our lives. These are times when "It'll never happen to me/us" takes much more drastic convincing.The portrayal of Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon, both in the script and in the performances of Turner and Woods, does provide some cautionary examples of how not to parent, but specifically shows how out of touch parents can become. When the youngest commits suicide and sets the whole film in motion, she jumps from the second story window and strikes a pointed fence. The first response of the parents is to remove the fence.However, the film does not show the grieving process of the Lisbons and keeps us on the periphery of their situation from an emotional standpoint. We know about as much as the boys spying on them narrating this story from the present day, which despite depriving us of a deeply emotional experience, does make the point that the real focus is on the reaction of others to this tale of woe. "Virgin Suicides" serves as a tough reminder about how we distance ourselves from tragedy regardless of how connected we are to those involved. The level of our ignorance to such issues has improved vastly, but in the history of humankind, coping has never been "easy."~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The follow up to the 2004 box office surprise "National Treasure" is  everything you'd expect. Thank goodness. It should come as no surprise  that the conspiracy-based code-cracking mystery adventure is still just  as hot as it was in the "year of "The Da Vinci Code."" There is nothing  new, nothing special or unexpected about "Book of Secrets" only Ed  Harris replacing Sean Bean as the rival treasure seeker. That, and the  addition of Helen Mirren as Nicholas Cage's mother to strengthen the  film's female roles thanks to leading lady Diane Kruger's utter  mediocrity.  The film has all the same history mystery you remember, the national  (and now international) landmarks, the witty inserts from Justin  Bartha's character Riley, and of course the preposterous plans for  Benjamin Franklin Gates to get whatever he's after. In other words, if  you're looking for something different, more clever, or intellectually  stimulating, read the Da Vinci Code again and don't bother with this  film. If you want more quirky, ridiculous, treasure-seeking fun that  picks up right where the last left off, this is your ticket. ~Steven C
Give Rodrigo Cortes credit: movie aside, few people could stand the thought of 90 minutes in a box with Ryan Reynolds. Not to jab at Reynolds' talent, but most of his roles wear thin during the course of a movie and you can actually empathize with Paul Conroy. A Michigan- based truck driver, he's on a routine delivery in Iraq when he gets kidnapped by some insurgents and buried in a wooden coffin with seemingly nothing but a cellphone and a lighter. We don't get to see the kidnapping part, just the coffin, which makes for the film's challenge: make lots with little.Good thing for the cellphone, as there's no story without it. Buried not too far underground so that he can get a signal and communicate with his captor as well as anyone else he chooses, much of the conflict scoots by on our imagining of the voice on the other end; it's our chance to escape the claustrophobia of the film.Personally, a shorter film with a bit more claustrophobia would have been more effective. Cortes makes us grow just as restless and impatient as Conroy, who conveniently has anxiety issues permitting outbursts of swearing to provide some needed noise, but "Buried" loses the effectiveness of its premise a bit with some of the social commentary of Chris Sparling's script. The film would have escaped as an effective mood piece with cries of a acclaim for Cortes had it focused solely on a guy in a box trying to save his life. Instead, Sparling dips us in and out of his criticism of the system and how its image to millions ranks higher than saving one individual life. A valid argument all things considered, but a bit counteracting to the purposes of "Buried" in terms of thrills.Cortes scores points visually and in terms of suspense. Each light-emitting item in the coffin creates a different "color" and as such it affords him some creative wiggle-room to more directly influence audience reaction through lighting. On a couple occasions he pulls away from Reynolds and breaks the illusion of the audience being right there in the box with him, presumably allowing us to get some much-needed air, but his fear of torturing the audience into an irritable state gets the best of him.Not a stretch here to say that Conroy lands as probably the best performance of Reynolds' career. He makes a few snarky comments here and there lest we forget he's the guy in the box, but as he pleads with voices on the other end to pick up the phone, come save him, or stop being a bleeping idiot, he's most importantly relinquishing control. Reynolds rarely plays characters who don't dominate the scene or desire being the center of attention. Amusing because Paul Conroy is that kind of character exactly, just in a more literal way. As such, kudos to Reynolds for not completely milking that attention for egotistical purposes. We could have done with half as many outbursts and phone calls that end in hyperventilation (seriously, how much air is in that box?), but never once do we dispose of our sympathy for Paul and his situation.That's key, because "Buried" excites 'til the very end. Rarely does a film build up as much doubt about the ending and legitimate confusion about whether or not Paul will suffocate or be saved. While the social commentary plays into that answer and costs "Buried" some points in terms of being a terrific thriller, Cortes has created an incomparable ride that had so much potential to go wrong but swerves artfully around most of it.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Alien invasions are a dime a dozen these days. Studios feel self-assured that the public takes note on the calendar every time a movie promises to lay waste to a major metropolis at the hands of angered or ruthless extraterrestrials. So with studios trying to one-up each other by expanding the scope of skyscraper carnage, what a peculiar choice for Joe Cornish to go microcosm and set "Attack the Block" in a small sector of South London.Budget limitations might have capped Cornish's threshold for mayhem, but based on the tone of his film, he wouldn't have used bigger funds to up the scale of destruction. He offers us "Attack the Block" as character and horror-driven counter-programming to today's invasion blockbusters.The alien menace in this film is markedly different, as are its protagonists, an inherently unlikable gang of South London teens. While they're mugging a woman (Jodie Whittaker), a strange creature crashes on the street right next to them. When it lashes out, the boys promptly kill it and then drag it to the drug dealer (Nick Frost) living in their block in hopes of finding out what it is and upping their street cred, but soon after, several shadowy beasts with glowing blue teeth fall from the sky and bound after them.Most of the action takes place in or around the block, and few people other than the central characters get roped into the invasion. In that sense the film plays out more as a horror film in which the gang (and coincidentally the woman they mugged) must fend off and outsmart the creatures, who are trying to pick them off. Cornish balances suspense, action and gore to keep the genre a bit more ambiguous.What's most impressive about the story is that the characters grow on us over time. Normally it's hard to care about the characters in a horror or alien invasion film unless they are well developed, but here's a case in which the characters truly develop as the film wears on and by the end we're quite fond of them.John Boyega as the gang leader, Moses, steals the show. He has the look and temperament of a young Denzel Washington. Although we never truly understand who he isat least not until near the endwe sense the pain behind his eyes and his life's frustrations as he stands up to the aliens. Other characters, notably Pest (Alex Esmail) serve to add comedy and diversify the personalities to make the film more interesting.Parts of the film drag and much of what happens could be deemed predictable, but Cornish puts a certain spirit into the film, not to mention a greater social message about how to treat other people that most big-budget films tend to graze over. Combined with some fun stylization to the action and events, this is the kind of film that's easy to root for, even if its far from mind-blowing.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Our ultimate expectations of a romance film are hypocritical. On one hand, we expect a grounded film: real people in real relationships with real feelings doing not necessarily sane but at least rational things in the name of love. On the other hand, we relish in fairytale depictions of love and the idea that true love finds a way and other poetic notions such as soul mates. "Crazy, Stupid, Love" fights this battle longer and to more extreme degrees than anything before it. Those with the fairytale soft-spot will take to it instantly, but even those who tip their scales in favor of believable romance will find something that resonates.Heartfelt and natural performances from a range of excellent actors yanks this out of the rom-com nebula and into something seemingly more tangible. With talents lesser than Steve Carell, Julianne Moore, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, this would not only be a rom-com, but also the flamboyant marshal of the rom-com parade. Although powerless against the cliché moments and improbable romantic gestures of Dan Fogelman's script, they add incredible emotional realism to his smaller, more intimate moments.Carell stars as Cal Weaver who in the opening seconds learns that his wife, Emily (Moore), wants a divorce. After throwing himself from their car when learning she had an affair with David Linhagen (Kevin Bacon), he goes home and prematurely squeals the news to his babysitter, high schooler Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who happens to have a crush on him. His 13-year-old son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo), also overhears  and he's got a crush on Jessica.Once again, with generic rom-com mainstays in place, bringing a sense of realism to this convenient and nearly farcical romantic chaos would've been almost impossible. Carell has his character on lock down, blending his "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" and "Dan in Real Life" characters into an earnest yet loony portrait of a middle-aged man learning to float after his lifelong stability gives out on him. Moore deftly navigates the territory of a woman in midlife crisis who's emotionally unsatisfied but completely unsure how to handle it. In contrast, Robbie is so completely far from a typical 13-year-old boy it's insulting. If his relentless pursuit of Jessica ever finally clicks in any form of the word, it's not until the very end and the fact that it basically works at that point is nothing short of magic.Then there's Jacob (Gosling), the handsome (I'm underselling him) womanizer who takes a dejected Carell under his wing and teaches him the ways ("Karate Kid" references abounding) of the bar pick up. He's such a smooth natural in his role he could pick up someone watching this movie despite their knowledge of being played. Jacob's backstory (why he's at this bar every night picking up women) ends up a casualty, which was really a big mistake, but Gosling has such a strong way with transparency that we believe all Jacob says or does. There's no doubt that he actually feels something for Hannah (Stone), even if it materializes way faster than it should.Quickness and exaggeration are two of the chief factors of "Crazy, Stupid, Love" that threaten to derail it in the eyes of those looking for grounding to their romance. Cal's gut reaction to his wife's divorce request, not trying to rectify the situation instead of bailing for the bar, seems hasty. After learning well from Jacob and becoming a ladies' man himself, his attempts to get Emily back don't gel, perhaps because they come at the ushering of his unrealistic 13- year-old son. Especially when the film reaches it's big revealing climax, the rash reactions and failures to communicate get really frustrating."Crazy, Stupid, Love" dashes willy-nilly between moments of emotional realism and romantic exaggeration and realistic humor and comedic exaggeration, enough to make your head spin. After all, this was directed by Glen Ficarra and John Requa, the team behind "Bad Santa" and "I Love You, Phillip Morris," both of which go extreme and dark places for laughs yet try to stay human.So how does it all  for the most part  ever manage to unscramble? The performances are truly the key, but the film's success comes down these intimate, down-to-earth moments throughout, like when Emily calls Cal without knowing he can see her from the backyard. These quieter moments give the actors a chance to shine and Fogelman's dialog has some real bright spots too. These moments help build support for the characters, a support and general liking that mostly doesn't tear apart throughout the absurd and unrealistic moments. It's a completely wild ride between two drastically different approaches to romance, but considering that all the contrast and paradox only bolsters the title "Crazy, Stupid, Love," it has to be considered a success.~Steven CVisit my site, moviemusereviews.com!
"Stand by Me" is such an excellent coming-of-age story that I almost wish I'd grown up in the '50s. I can only imagine then, for anyone who has, the kinds of emotions through memories that the Stephen King novella-turned Rob Reiner film must evoke. Still, anyone who's gone through puberty can appreciate the adventuresome innocence yet underscored maturity of "Stand by Me."Taking place in the summer of 1959, the film is a childhood memory retold by Gordie Lachance (Dreyfus) of when he was 12 (played by Wil Wheaton) and he and three friends named Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) journeyed away from their Oregonian small town to find a missing teenager's dead body and fulfill an absent sense of adventure.Leaving behind their troubled home lives, the boys soon discover something else when they're out on their alone with only their own decisions to guide their actions. They make these choices together, quarrel together, look out for each other's backs and bare themselves emotionally in front of one another. You get the sense that if adults took this same journey that events would not have unfolded the same, with each man looking out primarily for himself. A boy, however, has nothing but his friends to help save him from a world that wants only to swipe his innocence away. That's the real power of childhood that this story unearths as it tries to understand that golden hue over our memories.Incredible, then, is Rob Reiner's achievement at making such a mature film about so much more than childhood with only children as the main characters. He captures these young boys on camera in a way that makes them appear like tiny sages helping us make sense of our own past. Having come only from rock mockumentary "This is Spinal Tap" at this point in his career, it's incredible the kind of performance Reiner gets from these boys.Young star Wheaton is instantly the boy we identify with most: he's quiet, doesn't pick on anyone, but commands the respect of his friends. Feldman, child star of the '80s, sheds his nerdy "Goonies" character to become the daredevil of the group, which he manages to excel at. O'Connell plays the scared fat kid who gets picked on the most and Phoenix, giving easily the best performance of the four, is the tough kid with a good head on his shoulders who is really sensitive inside. There's no doubt that if Phoenix hadn't died tragically in the '90s that he would've become a major acting force as an adult. John Cusack makes a cameo as Gordie's deceased older brother and Kiefer Sutherland also appears as Ace, the leader of a gang of teenagers who are also after the body, but this film belongs to the young ones through and through.Giving the children their authenticity are writers Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans. These are normal pre-teenage boys above all else: they fight and pick on each other, have temper tantrums and occasionally break down into tears. Beautifully constructed is the metaphor of children following railroad tracks to an inevitable and shocking discovery.Stories about growing up are commonplace in Hollywood, but none will impress you like "Stand by Me." It's the only film starring children that serves adults first and that places it in a folder in history where it might never be touched again. It's really a treasure of a film.
One of the running jokes throughout "The House Bunny" is that several characters call Anna Faris' character Shelley vapid, and she takes it as a compliment. I would venture all the creative minds behind this film would react the same way. "The House Bunny" is shallow, inconceivable and so formulaic that even its bimbo protagonist could apply it correctly to a math problem -- but it knows it, has fun with it and manages to come off cute.Anna Faris plays maybe the most extreme dim-witted main character ever to grace the screen, but she does so with utter conviction. Her performance is unflinching and completely dedicated to the horrible stereotypes and dumb humor that despite not inducing many laughs (minus a few acceptably clever puns), she manages to win our favor because she actually looks as if she means it. Faris has created a full, complete and complex character out of one of the worst Hollywood stereotypes in existence. Major kudos to her.Produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison (yes, some of his usual cameos appear in the film), "The House Bunny" is another image obsessed teen/college girls' movie from the writers behind two of the best films of the genre: "Legally Blonde" and "10 Things I Hate About You." Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith clearly know how to write girl-driven comedies in a way that doesn't insult most movie-goers taste. "House Bunny" is about the closest they've dipped to that level however, at least compared to the other two films.The film is about a rejected playmate who, now homeless, gets a job as a house mother at a local sorority that is dying and full of rejected girls. As par for the course, she uses her shallow ways to give the girls and their house a complete makeover from rejects to hotties (despite our bewilderment as to who's footing the bill). Her services include how to flirt with boys in way that terribly degrade themselves and insult the men they're after, using water bras and exploiting their bodies for philanthropic (a word Shelley has trouble with) purposes. The turnaround, however, causes the girls to lose sight of who they were (we were wondering about that too ... ) and come to a conclusion at some point that they can in fact be beautiful and smart -- imagine that.It's like when Olivia Newton-John comes out at the end of "Grease" and embraces the bad girl sex symbol look and we all shake our heads because that's not how it's supposed to be. For much of "The House Bunny," there are some serious messages that girls under 16 do not need to be mixed up with and though it tempers them with the "middle ground" attitude, it doesn't -- like most formula comedies -- do so convincingly in the end.Makes you wonder what an actor like Colin Hanks is doing in the middle of this trashy pop girls-night flick, but in honesty he's a relief with all the fake tanning, Juicy-wearing stench that overwhelms the film. But to be honest, the cast of girls here is rather talented: Kat Dennings ("The 40-Year-Old Virgin"), Bruce and Demi's daughter Rumer Willis, pop vocalist Katherine McPhee and Emma Stone of "Superbad," who shows the most promise of all these young actresses with her convincing performance as Natalie, the house leader who wants the best of both worlds -- she's a lovable nerd and a risk-taker. As horribly processed and packaged as "House Bunny" is, it certainly has the guts and talent to stand by the risqué morals it's built on.
The Prohibition-era "fight" between gangster Al Capone and G-man Eliot Ness over the streets of Chicago is the stuff of legend. For this reason, director Brian De Palma's next big mob-themed follow-up to "Scarface" is quite a challenge. Capone is an enigma of sorts: the closest thing to a tall tale that history has to offer. Casting Robert De Niro was an excellent choice in attempt to do the character justice, but "The Untouchables," as entertaining and suspenseful as it is, never fully captures the tone and magnitude of Capone and 1930s Chicago.Feds and gangsters flick would be a better way to describe "The Untouchables" than organized crime drama. Anyone expecting a Godfather film or "Scarface" should lower those expectations to the level of '30s-themed action movie. Kevin Costner stars as Ness, leading a team of feds called The Untouchables who decide to go straight after the mob. They consist of an accountant (Charles Martin Smith) a rookie who's a good shot (Andy Garcia) and the wise veteran (Sean Connery in an Oscar-winning role).For a mostly fictitious account of Capone's arrest, you'd think De Palma would pull out all the stops and that his film would glamorize the heck out of the mob and juice up the story to make it as cool as possible. He does a lot of nice aerial shots like the very beginning and the whole cast has lots of fun with guns, but it's the characters that feel a bit cold. Costner is just okay as Ness. Yes, his character is supposed to be a moral by-the-books type who eventually embraces the slightly less legal means of getting the job done because the ends justify the means, but he could us a bit more flavor. You do like him though by the end of the film at the least.I don't know what Connery does that well to earn an Oscar. I think the Academy was like most people with regards to Connery in the '80s: smitten every time he shows up on screen without a license to kill in tow. Malone is an ideal part being that he's wise, skilled and also reckless -- and David Mamet also gives him the film's best lines -- but there's nothing that suggests he's more than a likable character mold.The best scene in "The Untouchables" can be looked at in one of two ways: either as a fantastic modern ode to a classic war film (the silent Russian film "The Battleship Potemkin") or as "well that was great, but it wasn't original." I'm somewhere in between. The train station stairs make a beautiful backdrop for the firefight that's not unlike the final scene of "Scarface," and De Palma's slowing down of the action makes it all the more enjoyable, but there's a lingering sense of wanting something truly one-of-a-kind.What Mamet's script does best other than good action fodder is provide a sense of whether or not someone is really untouchable, whether or not the law truly protects anyone. Capone lived above the law for so long and Ness loses a ton of men in his restless pursuit, having to bend the law at times in order to continue it. Capone's arrest does suggest that we all have to answer sometime when we don't govern ourselves by a set of principles.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
A little before 2000, Disney began to phase out its animated movie musicals. It wasn't that people stopped wanting enchantment at the movie theater, but rather a cold, hard fiscal decision: the films continued to gross less and less and newer ideas for family entertainment were capturing audience attention and dollars. Undoubtedly, however, Disney wanted back into the musical business, to create a nostalgia market and perhaps re-create the golden years of the early '90s. After the traditionally animated "Princess and the Frog" failed to revitalize business for classic fairy tales, Disney took to the story of "Rapunzel" and gave it a modern twist, calling it "Tangled" and giving in to CGI entirely. Here, it seemed, was the formula for fairy tales in the 21st Century. Confident in its success, Disney took another classic tale in Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen" and slapped an adjective title on it to give it a contemporary feel. "Frozen," however, throws ever further back to fairy tale musicals than "Tangled," which tiptoed back into the lyric-laden waters with some help from legendary songster Alan Menken. With "Frozen," Disney has definitely let itself go (yes, that's a pun on the film's biggest track) with a film full of magic and princes and princesses and musical numbers.Anyone who grew up in Disney's animated prime or simply recalls it fondly will feel instant kinship with "Frozen" and its dainty, fair-skinned, doe-eyed heroines, charming heroes and beloved animal companions, coming together in a story of family, adventure, danger, betrayal and true love.Princess sisters Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) shared a close bond as children, but when Elsa's magical frozen touch nearly took Anna's life, their parents  the king and queen  vow to isolate and Elsa to control her powers. They also wipe Anna's memory of her sister's magic, so she grows up wondering why Elsa has shut her out. When Elsa comes of age to inherit the throne, the castle finally opens its doors, but Elsa loses control of her powers during the coronation and an eternal frost sets over the entire Scandinavian kingdom of Arendelle. Terrified of what she can do, Elsa banishes herself to the mountains and its up to Anna to find her and a solution to her frozen enchantment.Anna comes in a similar mold to Rapunzel, the beautiful heroine who is a little clumsy and awkward but also wacky and exuberant. She fawns over Prince Hans (Santino Fontana), whom she meets at the coronation and falls for quickly, but she's otherwise full of self- determination and bravery. Elsa is more poised and pragmatic, until she sings the aforementioned "Let It Go" and embraces her abilities.The heart of "Frozen" is a story of sisterly love and dedication, as well as finding one's courage in the face of great fear, but it of course has all the trappings of a contemporary family film. Disney pulled a good deal of misdirection in the marketing, highlighting Olaf the living snowman (Josh Gad) and the wintery adventure of Anna and her escorts, the ice peddler Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his trusty reindeer, Sven. Absent was any hint of a mushy love story and singing. But even the commercial ploys of the film surpass expectations. Olaf, for example, is unlike any comic relief character in an animated film that you could think of. He has some running physical gags such as his carrot nose and how his body moves independent of his head, but Gad gives him a completely different sense of humor  some combination of wide-eyed wonder, witty observational humor, cluelessness and more. You can see the influence of screenwriter Jennifer Lee ("Wreck-It Wralph") in some of the film's humor for sure.Lee co-directed with Chris Buck ("Surf's Up," Disney's "Tarzan"), who knows his stuff in terms of making action-oriented, environmental digital animation. There's lots visually going on in the film between the ice powers and snow-covered action sequences, all of which look exceptional."Frozen" does seem to walk a line in the story in terms of being cliché and defying convention. A lot of plot points and outcomes are predictable in spite of a few small twists and the characters, especially Kristoff and Sven, are a little formulaic, with brief moments of originality. On the other hand, for example, there's not a clear, malevolent villain in this movie. There are bad characters, but Disney almost always establishes an evil figurehead. In "Frozen," much of the conflict comes from the characters' fear and how this magic is keeping everyone from being happily ever after. At least that's different. The original songs from "Book of Mormon" composer Robert Lopez and wife Kristen Anderson-Lopez don't rival the Menken glory days, but they do go for that style in a few instances ("Do You Want to Build a Snowman?", "For the First Time in Forever") in addition to some more modern-sounding Broadway-style tracks ("Love Is An Open Door," "Let It Go"). In terms of where the songs go structurally, a few feel more like interruptions than positive additions, but it's fair to allow some time for Disney to get back in the musical swing of things.Disney has taken a big step forward in making its musical fairy tale brand relevant in the digital age with "Frozen," and though they should exercise a bit of caution before stepping on the accelerator with these kinds of projects, there's no question we could all use this kind of enchantment a bit more regularly.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The story being told in "Searching for Sugar Man" is 15 years old, yet it didn't become a documentary until 2012. Seeing as the film centers on a man who never received the fame he deserved until long after the fact, that's quite fitting.The story behind "Searching for Sugar Man" is not one of those totally unbelievable true stories, but it has that same power. Filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul reveals this story just a little bit at a time, not giving you any sense of its full scope so that learning the simple truth is most effective.The artist known as Rodriguez is presented to us as a drifter from Detroit, an elusive folk singer whose music and voice were praised by the producers of his two records, "Cold Fact" (1970) and "Coming From Reality" (1971), both of which flopped. We're then introduced to two South Africans, music enthusiast and writer Brad "Sugar" Segerman and journalist Craig Bartholomew Strydom. As it turns out, Rodriguez's music made it to South Africa during the boiling point of apartheid, and "Cold Fact" was equal to any album of any superstar artists of that same era, even though no one knew anything about him except that he supposed killed himself on stage. Segerman and Strydom both sought answers and eventually discovered each other -- and Rodriguez.Before we get into the investigation/search for Rodriguez, Bendjelloul paints this abstract, mythic portrait of the singer/songwriter and plays a number of his tracks, which indeed sound like they should've been famous in the early '70s. We become fans in our way and become intrigued with the mystery of what happened to Rodriguez. When they do track him down, it feels revelatory."Sugar Man" turns out be an unusual underdog story. The elusiveness of fame is a major component in what makes it so compelling, in that Rodgriguez was almost an absolute nothing, but the more people who hear his story, the more supporters he wins over. His humility in combination with his raw talent is enough to persuade anyone to wanting to support Rodriguez and his music.My only complaint with the film is an avoidance of the question "why didn't he become famous?" It's clear he had all the tools and some of the best in the business supporting him. Did he not get enough airplay? Did no one promote him well enough? The elephant in the documentary, so to speak, is that he went by Rodriguez, and Latin music basically didn't exist at that time. Nothing about his music would tell you he was Mexican, but is it possible he hit a lot of barriers because of prejudice toward his name? One interviewee mentions his name briefly in that context, but the film doesn't go anywhere with it.Moving, fascinating and impeccably told, "Searching for Sugar Man" is a rare feel-good human-interest documentary that stands out among even the most meaningful and difference-making doc work being done today.~Steven C Thanks for reading! visit moviemusereviews.com for more
There is nothing one can do to prepare for the homo-erotic ridiculousness of "Bruno." The boundaries of R-rated comedy have been pushed and pushed over the last ten years and "Bruno" is the point on the scale in which we realize just how far we've gone. The shock value of deeply committed character actor Sacha Baren Cohen's newest project makes his last film, "Borat," seem PG-13. Good for some of the most outrageous laughs, "Bruno" will literally force you to pry your fingers from your face in order to watch the film. As for Cohen's biting satire -- "Borat" remains the sharper and more dynamic.One of Cohen's three characters along with Borat from his old HBO series "Da Ali G Show," Bruno is a gay Austrian fashion reporter who loves the limelight and, well, being a homosexual. Much like "Borat," Bruno journeys to America, this time with the dream of becoming famous after his show is cancelled. That takes him to Los Angeles, where, accompanied by his assistant Lutz, (Gustaff Hammarsten) who secretly lusts after Bruno, he attempts to do whatever he can to become the most famous gay movie star in the world.To achieve his goal, Bruno cooks up a series of absurd ideas, including interviewing celebrities, creating his own TV pilot, trying to make a sex tape, trying to solve peace in the middle east (the philanthropic route) and even adopting an African baby who he fittingly names O.J. "Bruno" essentially becomes one attempt to dupe the public or celebrities or what have you after another. It is when Bruno arrives at the conclusion that he must be straight to be famous that the film makes it attempt to broadcast the homophobia in America.As someone with tremendous respect for the way "Borat" really made a satirical statement with every scene (in addition to having a more focused plot), "Bruno" didn't live up to the intelligence factor I expected. The film is a bit too helter-skelter: it doesn't commit to any message or series of messages like "Borat" did. There's a dash of exploiting our celebrity- obsessed culture, a hint of trying to make Americans ashamed of what they'll do -- specifically to their bodies -- for fame and only in the second half when Bruno starts asking interviewees how he can become straight does the homophobia factor play in. "Bruno" just gets too caught up in making our jaws drop instead of picking and choosing those spots and giving us something to think about.There's a slight sense that Cohen's act has tired out, but the character seems like it has a lot new to offer, and that we should be getting something more thought-provoking and less provocative. Bruno is just not as lovable -- he lacks a flaw like Borat's ignorance/naivety -- and the film tries to make up for it by piling on crude and unabashed humor. If a bit more time was taken to establish his character and why becoming famous is so important to him, "Bruno" would easily measure up to Borat (and not imply genital size)."Bruno" is another hysterical romp from Cohen, especially for those who particularly love his candid camera/Punk'd type scenes getting real reactions from real people. The humor is very in-your-face and pretty much nails down all the ridiculous things that garner people fame in this sometimes very sad country of ours. At the same time, if Cohen and his writers could have channeled the discomfort they knew their film would create into an insightful experience for the audience, "Bruno" would be another instant classic. Instead, it's a raunchy, gut-busting and "uber-gay" comedy stunt.
Considering a witch nearly baked them in an oven and ate them, it makes sense that Hansel and Gretel would grow up to be witch hunters. OK, maybe not quite, but it's at least more reasonable than Abraham Lincoln being a vampire hunter.With that perspective, there's a bit more logic in place backing "Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," but the film might as well be "Barack Obama: Dragon Slayer" based on how director and co- writer Tommy Wirkola fails to take advantage of this workable premise.Wirkola, the Norwegian filmmaker who made the Nazi zombie horror film "Dead Snow," tries to utilize the same irreverence and unserious tone that earned that film some critical recognition, but the sheer absurdity of undead Nazis translates better than some ambiguously 19th Century supernatural witch hunt.After their parents abandoned them in the woods as children, Hansel and Gretel escaped the clutches of a witch and presumably (we don't see the epiphany happen) dedicate their lives to being witch-hunting orphans who travel all over the world killing and burning the ugly hags. When they're hired to investigate a series of nearly a dozen child kidnappings, they uncover some secrets about their past.It's hard to tell if Wirkola and co-writer D.W. Harper were trying at all to make "Hansel & Gretel" a slick, cool action movie or if they wanted it to play as an exercise in absurdity. Either way, talented stars Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton look completely out of place in the title roles. It's uncomfortable to see them acting this poorly, to the point where the film might actually have been better if two no-names from one of those straight-to-DVD blockbuster knockoffs had been cast instead.Wirkola clearly strives to make the movie gleefully violent and hilarious, but that tone and approach only works when you can buy into the more fundamental parts of a film and "Hansel & Gretel" is a sloppy smorgasbord of action, '80s fantasy, gore and steampunk tied together by the thinnest of story lines.Every element of the plot gets the most basic, glossed-over treatment based on the assumption that the audience will find witch-hunting sufficiently entertaining. The combat sequences themselves have an amusing edge, with Hansel and Gretel chasing after feral witches and using all manner of weaponry to blow them out of the sky, but it purports to be much cooler than it actually is with gratuitous swearing and denigrating one-liners. Hansel and Gretel, for example, make jokes at the expense of other characters, but in actuality they're just as culpable.It starts with how completely one-dimensional our heroes are. Hansel and Gretel possess no qualities other than badass and snide. Hansel is a diabetic thanks to the witch who force-fed him candy as a child, but while that's clever, it doesn't count for character, and neither do Gretel's nightmares about what really happened to them as children. Both amount to insignificant plot devices. There's no exploration of the brother-sister dynamic or any kind of internal or interpersonal conflict. These are not the hallmarks of "serious" films, but rather essentials to storytelling, so the movie is not being avante-garde by scrapping them.Famke Janssen plays Muriel, the evil witch with the grand plan. She's supposed be formidable and feisty, which she is in a physical sense, but her character's sole motivation is her plan  to make witches impervious to fire  so Janssen is left with nothing to do except ham it up in every scene. You can imagine that doesn't leave much for veteran Peter Stormare as the town sheriff or Thomas Mann as an obsessed fan of Hansel and Gretel's.Then there's Edward. Edward is an ogre who looks like a cross between and Richard Kind and the dad from the '90s TV show "Dinosaurs," who fits into the story the same exact way Sloth factors into "Goonies." He's either embodies the best or the worst the movie, depending on how you feel about the rest of it."Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters" is carnal, surface filmmaking  a cake made entirely of frosting. Sure, it might be decent frosting, but unless you're a frosting junkie it's essentially inedible. People who like that kind of glitzy display might spoon it up in all its artificiality and appreciate its flippant attitude, but most audiences will be too self-respecting to indulge.Peppered throughout this attempt at carefree supernatural action-adventure are clichés at every level from the dialogue to the use of narration and the score. It's clear the movie is trying to follow a formula and utilize techniques that have proved successful in the past, but you just can't ignore the essentials like "Hansel & Gretel," as doing so completely exposes the film for the action-packed genre film fraud that it is when it attempts to employ those techniques but falls flat.If somehow you can fall under "Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters'" spell, you might just be enchanted enough to enjoy the film in its short run time given how it sticks to its guns, but don't count on being so easily beguiled.~Steven CThanks for reading!
Some films lose something in translation. "Ghost in the Shell" pushes a lot of philosophy, and sadly when you're stuck with a dubbed version streaming on Netflix, the wooden "expression" behind the dialogue fails to truly communicate these sophisticated ideas. The artistic and almost meditative direction of Mamoru Oshii comes across without interference from cultural boundaries, but "Ghost in the Shell" is tough to follow from the American perspective and its potential for poignancy shut out thanks to bad voice acting and general language translation.As far as how one would animate a futuristic film steeped in technological references and with a story populated by cyborgs, Oshii quite honestly nails it. Masamune Shirow's manga clearly focused on the question of what makes us human and Oshii's direction so perfectly captures the combination of human and mechanical elements. From the captivating title sequence as we see the "birth" of our hero, Kusanagi, there's an immediately striking contrast and blend of natural and manufactured beauty. Almost all the settings and directorial choices reflect that balance as well.Kusanagi is a cyborg police officer in a future where most people's brains and souls or "ghosts" exist in mechanical bodies. She and her unit are on the case of a renowned hacker called "The Puppet Master," who ultimately challenges what she believes in. I wish I could explain with any depth, but most of it was lost on me.Kusanagi draws you in as a cyborg protagonist. Oshii paints her as this fragile doll of sorts, with lingering shots expressive of deep thought which we might not normally believe a cyborg capable. Although her behavior outside of that deep dialogue is mostly mechanical, we care for her rather instantly.She can also kick some ass, which is important in this film. The action is much grittier than usual anime fare but with the same artistic flair you'd expect from the genre.Occasionally some long scenes without dialogue and just music come into the picture to allow focus on the well-animated world of Section 9. The pause doesn't help matters of focus, but it does highlight the undeniable strengths of the film: the technical aspects and the animation.I would honestly have to watch this film again to understand it, so perhaps a higher score would come with a second viewing as it warrants this many stars on art and direction alone.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Where do Britain's finest actors go when they retire? The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur, India, apparently. A who's who of mature British talent, "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" could be considered a more British "Love, Actually" or " Valentine's Day" for seniors, minus the sinister commercial intent.The film follows several British retirees who read of the restored titular hotel in India and for various reasons determine to vacation there. The place turns out to be in dire need of renovations, but its charismatic manager, Sonny (Dev Patel), charms them into staying, not that they have much choice in the middle of India.The main character is Evelyn (Judi Dench), a recent widow who has sold her home to pay off her debt. She narrates the film, but her story doesn't necessarily get more attention than any other. Along with her is Graham (Tom Wilkinson), a respected judge who used to live in India as a boy, Muriel (Maggie Smith), a rather racist retired housekeeper in need a speedy and inexpensive hip replacement, Doug (Bill Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton), a couple in need of affordable retirement, Madge (Celia Imrie), who seeks love in her later years and Norman (Ronald Pickup), a Lothario who just won't quit.Naturally, the trip becomes life-changing for all of them, changing their perspectives and notions about life even after all these years living a certain way. Even Sonny has his own subplot involving his girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae), of whom his mother does not approve.Based on the Deborah Moggach novel "These Foolish Things," Ol Parker's script is a pretty straightforward setup with an obvious payoff. It's only a question of which of the hotel guests will fall for each other. All of the other twists come drenched in predictability.There's only one way for a film to overcome such severe formula, and that's with loads of talent capable of of convincing us to care about it. Like a group of British all-stars, perhaps ... Each actor brings such gravitas to the film and vulnerability to his or her character that you feel for and sympathize with all of them to some extent and take interest in all the interweaving plots turning out as formula says they will. Even though the film is a two-hour juggling act, there's a lot of truth to what "the formula" has to say, even if you feel like you've heard it before. The fact that these are senior actors provides not only a change of pace for the ensemble romantic comedy, but also their wealth of life experience helps subvert the clichés. Even if each actor can't relate to personally to the part, he or she probably knows someone that could literally connect with or understand their character.Dench is a particular standout as a character dealing with loss. She doesn't let it consume her character and seep into her acting choices, but plays Eveyln as someone strong-willed yet ultimately still vulnerable. The dame never disappoints. Smith also stands out as she plays a despicable character whose change of heart is convincing enough that you manage to like Muriel in the end  a lot. And considering this cast of acting giants, Patel never gets overshadowed and reinforces why he deserves to be considered as more than "the kid from 'Slumdog Millionaire.'"John Madden is also quite the veteran, and he brings that extra sensitivity. "Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" doesn't slip into some comedy with old-people jokes despite the number of opportunities the script allows for him to do so. Unfortunately, the film is never really all that funny, just funny in that cute "look at those seniors" sort of way. Why films like these can't just omit the geriatric humor altogether is a bit dumbfounding, but with the target audience being seniors, perhaps it helps them relate more to the film.It goes without saying that "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" should be required viewing for anyone over 65, but it has some valuable things to say to a younger crowd as well, even if the delivery method has been done to death in other forms.~Steven CThanks for reading!

She might have been a rom-com darling for most of her career, but there's no mistaking now that Cameron Diaz is a natural bad girl. Sure, part of it might have to do with survival of the fittest; raunchy R-rated comedies are the new cool kid in class and those who can't play that game will find themselves jobless. But Diaz might have even upped her stock with her performance in "Bad Teacher," a movie that's unapologetically crude if not to the fault of absurdity. Nevertheless, foul-mouthed middle school teacher Elizabeth Halsey makes for an amusing character study (no worries, you can skate by on the cliff notes).Writers Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky have essentially taken the laundry list of what qualities constitute a good teacher and ensured that Elizabeth embodies or does the opposite. To top it off (no pun intended), her motivation throughout the entire film is to raise enough money to afford breast implants, or as her character would be more apt to say, "a new pair of t***," so that she might be able to woo the attractive and wealthy new substitute (Justin Timberlake). Entire films have been built from shallower foundations, but for those bothered by issues of plausibility, "Bad Teacher" will be offensive in more ways than the many it already intended. How someone of Elizabeth's nature ever got a teaching position in the first place will be the one question that crosses the mind of every viewer at some point during the film. Once you get past that whole in logic, it becomes easier to appreciate the way "Bad Teacher" allows us a chance to imagine what the world's worst teacher would be like.Elizabeth is about to finish her first (and only) year at John Adams Middle School somewhere in Illinois and wed the "man of her dreams" only he and his mother are on to the fact that she only wants him for the money. Her plan having failed, she returns to "JAMS" as a means of keeping herself (and her poor lifestyle) afloat. Her return reignites the gym teacher's (Jason Segel) advances and a rivalry with her polar opposite, the spunky learning-lover Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch). Other than Diaz, Punch is the only one who seems aware of how absurd the film is and consequently she pushes it further with her delightfully quirky performance.The depths to which both Elizabeth and Amy will stoop to get what they want or ruin the other have no limit. Their schemes are cleverly concocted, though they're along the lines of your typical high jinks. Putting aside that their entire story relies on an unusually large suspension of disbelief, Eisenberg and Stupnitsky show a knack for writing easily digested crowd-pleasers. The array of other supporting characters could be described as either run-of-the-mill or perfectly adequate. Timberlake makes few waves as a socially oblivious dork who as it turns out has a passion for dry-humping and John Michael Higgins delivers exactly what's expected of him: acting like John Michael Higgins. Phyllis Smith brings her "The Office" character over to this film with a measure of success, but only those unfamiliar with her will be impressed.The small ounce of a "good message" comes with a slight lowering of Elizabeth's superficial expectations after her grand plan unfurls. The natural thought here would be to completely ignore any sort of moral responsibility to end on a warm and fuzzy note considering all previous material dismisses it anyway. Yet some sort of Hollywood obligation must have nagged for awhile. Forget Elizabeth, the fact that Segel's character Russell would want anything to do with her beginning, middle or end of the film says a lot (though quite little) about his character.The R-rated comedy trend continues to thrive with "Bad Teacher," though for better or worse it's hard to say. Calling it a guilty pleasure comedy might be the most apt description, as even those who really enjoy it will admit just where it falls on the preposterous spectrum. Considering many previous Cameron Diaz vehicles have fallen into the guilty pleasure category too, maybe the actress has been in her comfort zone all along.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com
Jazz music and psychology create a furious cinematic swell in Damien Chazelle's "Whiplash," a striking breakthrough effort that will have toes tapping and pulses racing. Centered on a 19- year-old aspiring Jazz drummer pushed to his limits for better and for worse (usually worse) by a merciless instructor, "Whiplash" tells a simple story of how far one's willing to go for their dream, and what inspires and motivates greatness.Miles Teller stars as Andrew, a first year student at a music conservatory with a clear-cut dream: become the next great jazz drummer. His talent catches the eye of Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) the conductor of the school's revered studio band, a no-nonsense teacher who pushes his students to their breaking point through cursing, screaming and insulting them, and he particularly enjoys directing his questionable tactics toward Andrew.By and large, Fletcher's methods inspire Andrew to push himself, but not without instilling a certain fear and anger in both him and the audience. The tension becomes powerfully thick whenever the two are in the same scene and any time Andrew makes the slightest mistake that will certainly invoke Fletcher's wrath, it's a gasp-worthy "oh crap" moment. Chazelle easily gets the audience under his finger in this way, but it's Simmons who really gives him that power.Simmons has been a beloved character actor for more than a decade, in large part due to his mouth and exceptional line delivery. The role of Fletcher plays to these strengths while allowing him to access a more sinister and dramatic side. In other words, when he rips off a comic insult in this film, you're also laughing out of nervousness. He's every strict, terrifying, bigoted, foul- mouthed teacher, instructor, coach or boss you've ever had (or that's ever been on screen) rolled into one and that has a profound influence on the film's suspense.Interestingly, executive producer Jason Reitman (director of "Up in the Air" and "Juno") has a lot of influence too, and that goes beyond that he likely recruited Simmons for the project. Chazelle likes to use a lot of sequence shots (such as all the student musicians opening their instrument cases one after the other) to create a rhythm to the film, one of Reitman's hallmarks. That said, it should by no means diminish the work Chazelle has done. He balances this with a lot of other techniques (the opening shot, for example, is a long take) and weaved together the film takes on the characteristics of a carefully orchestrated piece of music.Music has always played a crucial role in the creation of cinematic suspense, so a suspenseful film about music naturally has to take this relationship to another level. That's where the focus on percussion makes a difference. There's the obvious piece in that the drums are the pulse of the band, so the connection to our own physical response to the film is apparent. Also, and maybe slightly less obviously, there's a lot happening visually, so it's much easier to convey the intensity on film. Chazelle films Teller playing from just about every possible angle and distance, which ought to tell you that Teller's own drum skills were definitely put to the test. The suspense also impacts jazz standards "Whiplash" and "Caravan" and other pieces heard in the film, making them infinitely more gripping because of what's at stake for the characters.A surprising third act twist takes the story to another level and elevates a script that otherwise might've gotten too satisfied with simply highlighting the moral dilemma Fletcher and Andrew pose. There are weaker components too like a side plot involving a love interest (Melissa Benoist of "Glee") and a little stuff with Andrew's father (Paul Reiser) and extended family, but they help break up the intensity and also show that Andrew's pursuit of greatness doesn't exist in a vacuum. "Whiplash" works by being both niche (one small story taking place in the little-seen world of competitive collegiate jazz) and yet universal, while employing a multitude of sensory components both visual and aural to creating an engaging, accessible and entertaining film. Chazelle will surely have a number of encore performances to follow, while giving us an all-time great one from Simmons.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more
No brand of humor has its own unique fingerprint like that of David and Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft. Their one-of-a-kind spoofs leave a distinct comic stamp and while it might not be the funniest stuff out there, it's certainly in a league of its own. The sight gags, background jokes and literalistic humor abound once more in the second film based on their "Police Squad!" series entitled "The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear." It might try and squeeze a bit more than called for in attempt to outdo the original "Naked Gun," but it still remains an entertaining and painless 85 minutes.Lt. Frank Drebbin (Nielsen) and the love of his life, Jane (Priscilla Presley) return once more and this time -- it's political. Drebbin must stop an oil and nuclear energy pundit played by legendary singer Robert Goulet from thwarting a doctor's (Richard Griffiths) recommendation to President George H.W. Bush for investment in alternative energy sources, namely solar ones. It's beyond hysterical nearly 20 years later that this film tackles an issue with even the slightest relevancy to today.In the background is the ongoing love story between Frank and Jane, and awkward romance has long been the staple of Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker comedy. Zucker and longtime collaborator Proft cram in as much as possible and cross their fingers that they'll get more laughs than eye rolls. The one knock on this sequel as compared to its predecessor is the forced-ness. Whereas the plot of the original really took its time to set up the gags and tie them closely to the plot, there's a lot of joke-manufacturing. The plot has entirely become secondary in this movie.There is a sense that Zucker and Proft recognize this, which helps the film a lot. When Frank is at "The Blue Note," a night club for pathetic lonely people, he orders "the strongest thing they have," so of course the waiter brings him a body builder. Frank sees the man and of course changes his mind, saying he'll "just have a Black Russian instead." The waiter nods, but then looks at the camera, quickly shakes his head "no" and the film continues. That's all the indication you need that these writers know exactly what they're doing.Nielsen, however, continues to be what makes "The Naked Gun" series stand out above other multi-sequel spoof movies. No one sells the spoof humor like Nielsen can. He turns your typical lame dad pun into actual comedy. For every forced gag that goes rotten, he manages to keep things moving and distract the audience from them with his first rate deadpan.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
The timeless narrative of people who do bad things getting what they deserve has become so entrenched in the way we look at books, movies, television and more. For that reason, many who finish "Arbitrage" will find themselves rather bewildered.Richard Gere plays millionaire Robert Miller, an extremely successful business person with a loving family who is ready to sell the company and pass control to his daughter (Brit Marling). But just as she starts to sniff some her father's fraudulent activities, an accident threatens to bring Robert's world crashing down.Nicholas Jarecki writes and directs this story of a desperate man's attempt to do whatever it takes to keep his life and reputation intact in spite of his transgressions, but his rock-solid script also highlights how everyone wrapped into his mess isn't all that different.Jarecki does a fantastic job with Gere, creating a character who objectively is a crook, but through the lens of the story is someone we can sympathize with. He just wants to maintain status quo and not see his empire crumble on top of him. The script portrays him as a man who feels he has no choice and does so quite effectively.Gere hasn't given that many performances in recent years, but it's tough to imagine this isn't one of his better ones since "Chicago." He doesn't have many knockout moments, but considering you don't totally hate this character given the circumstance, he must be doing something right.Tim Roth does a nice job as a detective on Robert's tail who is also a bit desperate to bag a man who he knows to be a crook. He starts out as that pesky investigator who finds all the holes in Robert's alibi, but he struggles to have enough to make an arrest.The narrative rides on the simple "will he or won't he?" plot as far as whether Robert gets caught or manages to survive the ordeal. It keeps the film engaging, but Jarecki could've done more through the direction to add tension and suspense. "Arbitrage" is definitely missing any kind of distinctive visual style or tone, so a lot hinges on the script to maintain the intensity of the plot. Fortunately, it never drags despite not even coming close to its threshold for excitement."Arbitrage" takes a refreshingly gray approach to what for many viewers will be black-and-white issues. The only pure, good character is Marling's Brooke, the daughter, who wants her father to explain himself, but even she becomes complicit in his deceit after awhile. We know that in life, the good aren't always rewarded and the bad punished, but contrary to that reality, that's how we prefer our movies. Jarecki isn't afraid to serve us that cold reminder in artistic form and it makes "Arbitrage" a standout. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
A return to the "Alien" universe from the man who originally envisioned it? Hard not to sign up for that adventure, even knowing that "Prometheus" appears to be quite far from an "Alien" movie. This film dares to ask bigger questions about creation and the purpose of life while thrusting us into an un-fathomable sci-fi mystery rather than a moody horror opera set in space. Yet for every way it is different, "Prometheus" also feels like director Ridley Scott's homage to his own work, as if he too was fascinated with the lore he helped create."Prometheus" begins with the slow unraveling of a world that despite the irony of phrase, feels vaguely familiar with all kinds of technology, stasis pods and the on-foot exploration of an unknown planet. The film completely propels itself on fascination, hoping that its audience has a strong scientific curiosity and a nose for wonder and imagination. The impact of "Lost" writer Damon Lindelof on the script is apparent, as with more knowledge comes more questions, questions that sometimes get in the way of themes and character building, but never stop awing.The Prometheus (the ship) expedition is essentially launched on a hunch. Scientists and archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered ancient drawings of a giant man pointing to a star cluster in ancient civilizations all over the world that couldn't possibly be connected unless they referred to a creator. They believe a race of "Engineers" live on this planet (a moon, specifically), LV-223. Dying billionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) funded their quest in hopes of unlocking the greatest discovery in human history.Unlike the Nostromo, Prometheus has a much larger crew, so there are many more stories to focus on and people to care about. In addition to Shaw and Holloway, there's the ship captain (Idris Elba), the resident android, David (Michael Fassbender), and Weyland Industries overseer Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) among others. As they explore the pyramid-like structure they've discovered it becomes clear that there are multiple agendas going on here, which anyone who's seen "Alien" would be prone to suspect.The scope and scale of "Prometheus" and the way that this world is silently explored at the beginning echoes "Alien" rather closely, except that rather than narrow into a story of a dangerous alien on board a ship, the scope of "Prometheus" only continues to grow, with questions mounting on how these films  33 years apart  ultimately connect. The answers are more exciting than profound, but the tension makes the ride worthwhile.Like Ripley, it's not until the final act that Shaw truly emerges as the main character we want to root for. From start to finish, it's really David who fascinates the most. Fassbender gives another brilliant performance. His obvious hidden agenda complicates his character in our eyes, and for his cold and calculating manner, there's still a creepy amount of internal processing going on. You get the sense that things interest him, that he's driven by the same quest for knowledge of his human counterparts, and it makes him eerily human. He is, in a sense, a microcosm of the greater idea at play of mankind meeting his maker, as he is a creation of his peers, who look for answers about their creation. There's a brilliant exchange between him and Holloway about how we create because we can  no other reason  yet as a sentient creation, it's a maddening explanation for existence."Prometheus" should age well with these questions, as repeat viewings will eliminate the seemingly endless quest to figure out what's going on and temper the abundant flaunting of production design and visual effects that can at times disorient the viewer. Without those distractions, the script's brighter moments and thoughts will shine through much more.There are no chinks, however, in the visual spectacle that is "Prometheus." Everything is so believable, pristine and fascinating. Whereas "Alien" left so much to the imagination, "Prometheus" just keeps feeding it, and that's the fundamental difference in the film as far as tone and genre. "Prometheus" goes into much more high-concept science fiction whereas "Alien" is predominantly horror. As such, those who loved "Alien" for its horror qualities will likely be the group most disappointed by "Prometheus." Both films, however, contain lasting and memorable visual imagery.Why so much comparison between the films? Well, "Prometheus" invites it. After all, the letters of the title appear line by line almost exactly as they did in '79, first thing in the film. You can call it "Alien DNA" if you like (based on comments made by Scott and Lindelof), but story-wise it's truly a prequel as it sets up/provides and explanation for the beginning of "Alien." The reason Scott and Lindelof have avoided the direct nature of the word "prequel" is because of the tonal difference in their film and how "Prometheus" is driven by different (and much bigger) questions.It seems that over the last three decades, Scott's curiosity about the universe he and H.R. Giger designed in 1979 only grew. Rather than return to the "Alien" world to re-invoke the moody and atmospheric tone, he returned to it in hopes of expounding upon the lore that he had left so wide open with the fallen ship and the Space Jockey.Pardon me for going way meta right now, but Scott's journey back is for similar reasons to the characters of this film: a desire to understand its origins. His results are not all that different from their discoveries either, as "Prometheus" is striking, daunting, tense and messy, yet the prevailing drive of it all is a never-ending fascination.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Rounders" is a star-studded drama that glorifies the game of poker and over-dramatizes the heck out of the gambling lifestyle, all while dishing out "poker is life" metaphors like $5 dollar chips and providing an overdose of slick and arrogant narrative dialogue by way of the prince of the east coast, Matt Damon himself. Call it an exaggeration, but that's exactly how "Rounders" creators David Levien and Brian Koppelman up the ante in this film. If you're a poker lover, you'll love this film and if you're not, well you'll still probably enjoy it, but not as much as a real rounder would.Levien and Koppelman, who debuted with "Rounders" and have since teamed up for a variety of mobster and especially gambling related films (including TV show "Tilt"), are masters at jazzing things up. While "Rounders" doesn't exactly delve into the glamorous side of gambling, it acts like it does and it packs some excitement into a film that would otherwise be just another movie about guys with gambling problems trying to repay debt.Matt Damon and Edward Norton star as Mike and Lester aka "Worm," two boarding school buddies who bottom line know how to win at poker. Mike, the true protagonist, is the more- level headed one (he's in law school and with a girlfriend (Gretchen Mol)) but he is still an ambitious gambler who finds himself losing everything to a neurotic Oreo-loving Russian mob dude played by the multi-talented John Malkovich. His buddy Worm is fresh out of prison, having done time for credit card fraud, and he has no other goals but to play more poker to make the money he needs to pay off previous gambling debts. Mike has quit poker, but he feels the itch and wants to help his friend.The cast also includes John Turturro, Famke Jenssen and Martin Landau, all actors who could get top billing in a film today. While they're all good, it's Damon and Norton that are able to really work the slick and snappy dialogue and also play it up for drama and not just kicks. These guys create some serious problems for themselves about halfway through the film and keep facing moral dilemmas despite their seemingly unstoppable poker prowess. It actually gives the film a lot of strength despite the pompous air it gives off.By the end, however, "Rounders" does turn back around and become more about the cool, edgy side of gambling, leaving a lot of the deeper questions out to dry while it hits you with what it thinks is an intense ending that proves to be too long and morally objectionable. Not that anyone is the authority on morals, but the film goes for the tagline mentality of "play the hand you're dealt" and not "hey, you should stop gambling because you're $15,000 in debt. Despite realistic turns throughout and giving off the vibe that it's going to be more down to earth, the film goes for the super-smooth finish and it just feels like a waste. Other than getting long toward the end, though, it's certainly entertaining as slick usually is and the two star vehicles really help the film stand out.
No matter the premise, a film puts itself at a disadvantage when it calls for a one man show. Sam Rockwell, as talented as he is, cannot generate enough interesting conflict with nothing at his disposal but the skin-tingling monotone voice of Kevin Spacey. In other words, films like "Moon" have to work twice as hard to keep our attention and more importantly, capture our imagination. Creator Duncan Jones' first feature-length film makes an ambitious attempt to pull off this challenge, but it doesn't fully get there.The echoing theme in outer space movies is the silence, loneliness and its consequent madness. With only Sam Rockwell as astronaut Sam Bell, the expectation is "Moon" will repeat those themes and the hope is it will shed new light on them. There are a few snippets where it does get us to begin contemplating existence in a new way, but it doesn't meditate on these ideas enough, doesn't let them cook.Sam Bell is a space worker on the dark side of the moon in the near future when Earth is harvesting moon rocks for Helium 3, a new fuel/energy alternative. Bell is contracted for three years to oversee four rock-harvesting machines. At the time of the story, he's nearly completed his three years and eagerly awaits going home to his wife and daughter when an accident happens leading to a startling discovery.I've always been a fan of Sam Rockwell. He's done a great job balancing comedy and drama in numerous films such as "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" and most recently "Frost/Nixon." He brings the same talents to a quiet "Moon." However, "Moon" doesn't give him a lot of opportunity to stretch his dramatic talents despite being the only role in the film; his character is thinly developed, his motivations never clearly spelled out."Moon" has an opportunity to paint a beautiful but tortured picture of life in outer space, but little of Jones' visual imagery really sticks in our minds. A film with so few roles should really be advanced in the way of visual storytelling, should pry deep into the soul of its main character through image, but that's a lot to ask from a novice filmmaker. Instead, he's busy fighting the audience's assumption that the Spacey-voiced computer assistant, GERTY, will inevitably turn evil. You can't spend all your efforts trying not to be too much like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and not identify another force of antagonism. Jones also struggles a lot in the beginning editing scenes together, trying to keep the film's pace up until the discovery.There is quite an inspiring idea behind "Moon," once the true nature of Bell's situation is revealed, but it never hits us the way Jones wants it to. There's simply not enough conflict despite Rockwell's best efforts to keep our attention and the space visuals are not as awe- striking as they need to be to counter that disadvantage as well. "Moon" is a unique movie, but it's a very long and lonely hour and a half.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Jason Reitman has been the creative force behind two of the warmest, funniest, modern- savvy and thought-provoking comedies in the last five years ("Thank You For Smoking" and "Juno"). He continues this tradition with "Up in the Air," one of if not the best film of 2009, which looks at life with a view from the top, the perspective of a man who lives out of his suitcase -- and packs light. Devoid of commitment and responsibility in everything down to relationships, the story of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is cleverly smooth and will make filmgoers everywhere appreciate their own baggage.Ryan Bingham fires people for a living. Gutless bosses outsource their layoffs to the company he works for, so he travels the country dropping traumatic news on countless people. As a frequent flyer, he has a secret goal of reaching 10 million miles on American Airlines. To him, the airport is home; he has no committed relationships or friendships and he gives lectures on how those are the things that weigh our lives down. Who better to play a free-wheeling middle-aged bachelor with a soulless job than Clooney? His suave looks and comic delivery make him an enviable and intriguing character despite that we'd never want to spend all that time in an airport let alone make people miserable every day.Bingham's life of traveling bliss gets an upgrade when he hooks up with fellow businesswoman Alex (Vera Farmiga), who shares his same passion for traveling nuance and sexually charged witticism. At the same time, a young up-and-comer in his company (Anna Kendrick) threatens his way of life when she proposes online video conference firing. In an effort to prove that would be a bad idea (and save his lifestyle), Bingham convinces his boss (Jason Bateman) to let him take her on his next set of trips so she can see what this work is really about.Loosely adapted from a novel by Walter Kirn, Reitman and Sheldon Turner whip up a script that's smart and hip yet familiar and easy to follow. It's somewhat predictable, but in a good way -- never cliché and all in the spirit of the story's message. Bingham's unique and isolated lifestyle serves as an ideal example for jump-starting a discussion of what's most important in life -- ultimately whether happiness can be achieved if life isn't shared. The other characters provide other perspectives on this same essential question and further complicate Bingham's own emotional journey as he questions his long-held beliefs.Reitman's genius as a director is in guiding us along fluidly through this contemplation. Being his third very good film, "Up in the Air" is now proof that no director takes his audience from comedy to heartfelt drama as seamlessly and gracefully as Reitman. The script is naturally funny, playing off our familiarity with airport travel for a variety of jokes, yet the next scene will be when Bingham's firing someone and suddenly all this tension builds and sympathy and pity pours out of the audience for these poor people losing their jobs whom Reitman handles with such sensitivity given the tough economic context this film is being released in.Other impressive elements of the film include Anna Kendrick's performance as Natalie, a recent college grad who is a hard-nosed efficient type on the outside with an emotionally sensitive interior. Her trip with Ryan reveals to her that not everything in life can be planned for nor should it be. Kendrick handles one of those potentially cliché young person roles with class. She's multi-dimensional including throwing her own bit of humor in with the many emotional highs and lows her character experiences. Farmiga also proves no marquee name was necessary. She's sweet, a bit sassy and holds her own against the magnetic Clooney."Up in the Air" could fall into a rut of being all about travel humor and how always being on the go affects a person -- or it could be about what it's like having to fire people day in an day out, but all these elements are instead tied beautifully together to remind us how valuable relationships can be, no matter how big or how small. Reitman and this wonderful cast not only entertain us but also deliver that message as well as it's ever been delivered.~Steven CVisit my site at moviemusereviews.com
The only thing bigger than Julia Roberts' chest in "Erin Brockovich" is the heart this film has. While it is a drama, it would be more apt to describe the plot as a struggle, because it's all about fighting for what you believe in and overcoming the odds and all opposing forces. Nothing bad actually happens in this movie, at all, but it's the complications, the setbacks the moral struggles along the way that make it shine."Erin Brockovich" stars Julia Roberts in the title role in a film based on the true story of a twice-married mother of three who is desperate to find a way to make a living and provide for her family. After a failed attempt at suing for damages after a car accident, Brockovich turns to her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), for a job doing anything she can at his law firm. Reluctantly he accepts and soon Brockovich finds herself uncovering a potentially huge case.Roberts had to have been a no-questions-asked best actress winner after this performance. As Brockovich she is incredible playing multiple roles as the loving mother, the driven working-woman, the troubled lover, everything. The mood swings are effortless for her. Perhaps the best element of her performance is that she comes across as glaringly flawed, even if she is quite likable. Her lines are killer and delivered with command. Though some of her rants are over the top, they're really clever nonetheless.Finney's character is much the same way. He is really enjoyable to watch and gives a great performance even though his character never gets truly dramatic.This is just a great screenplay by Susannah Grant. It's almost completely devoid of melodrama and yet it tackles so many real life issues. Brockovich's struggle to balance her work with her family brings up an issue that can connect with anyone, although the feminist tones of the film obviously won't connect as strongly with men. Director Steven Soderbergh feels very distant from the film. Every so often a shot or sequence will be artistic, but he allows the story to tell itself for the most part."Erin Brockovich" is better than the average feel-good story. When there's little melodrama and great acting, a feel-good story becomes a great movie. Sports films based on true stories are feel-good stories, but they don't get nominated for best picture. While it may all seem too good to be true and the positive seems to trump the negative more times than it ought to, the film still feels very real and one that no one should miss.
Slavery is rightfully considered the darkest mark on America's 237-year history. It was the issue that defined 19th Century America, and one of many examples in humanity's narrative of the oppression of one people at the hands of another. "12 Years a Slave" is a brutal but necessary reminder of that evil. It is a film that sugarcoats nothing and struggles desperately with the entire notion of justice.Director Steve McQueen makes a big career leap with this biographical epic of Solomon Northup, a free black man and talented violinist who in 1841 was kidnapped and sold into slavery, which he remained in for 12 years before a fortunate encounter with an abolitionist eventually led to his freedom. McQueen has shown a deft hand for uncomfortable subject matters (his last film, "Shame," tackled sex addiction) and so slavery is something he seems apt to handle, and he does so with painful magnificence.As with "Shame," McQueen works diligently at transmitting the experience of his characters onto the audience, and so "12 Years a Slave" becomes more than a mental and intellectual exercise, but an emotional, full-body experience. It is eye-opening, heartbreaking, gut- wrenching and soul-shaking, the kind of film that will challenge you for a seemingly endless 2 hours and 15 minutes and then for a long time after you walk away from it.And that seems to be the idea. McQueen doesn't want anyone who sees his film to get too comfortable, because there's nothing comfortable about what African-Americans endured as slaves. All the beating, whipping, hanging, abusing, raping and degrading slurs occur with a relentlessness arguably unprecedented in film history. Every scene featuring one of these horrific things goes on just a little longer than we expect  or what Hollywood has conditioned us for  enough so that we must really internalize it and practically beg for it to stop. Rarely do these kinds of large-scope biopics ever feel as though they occur in real time, but McQueen gives us a number of scenes that do, and it has a serious impact.From the moment the drugged Solomon wakes up to find his hands and feet chained, the abuse begins. When he refuses to accept his newly given identity as Platt, a runaway slave from Georgia, he gets a brutal beating from his captors, and he continues to face violence the more he speaks up and/or demonstrates the qualities of a learned man. Solomon's decision process on how he should behave factors throughout the film. He must constantly weigh whether to hold steadfast to his identity and his beliefs at risk of provoking anger and getting himself killed, or to keep his head down and feign ignorance in order to survive.This balancing act in the face of all kinds of horrific circumstances comprises Chiwetel Ejiofor's career-making performance as Solomon. Solomon works hard for the two plantation owners in the film, Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Epps (Michael Fassbender), but he must lie and manipulate to save his hide (literally in some cases) and he never stands down when mistreated or falsely accused. Then there's the underlying element of Solomon's longing for home and family, his simple but powerful motivation throughout the film. Ejiofor elicits our sympathy with ease and conveys Solomon's inner toil at countless points throughout the film with complex emotions rather than riding the more dominant ones such as anger, fear and sadness, which John Ridley's script and McQueen's direction craft so effectively.Much of the film's stellar cast is difficult to praise, because they play such despicable characters. Fassbender is brilliant as Epps despite the character's countless flaws, and it's even worse because the script gives us a window into Epps' conscience, and we see him make the choice to fall victim to his pride and continue his poor behavior time after time. Even the seemingly "better" characters, aren't any good. Cumberbatch's Ford is a sympathetic and caring man, but one with no stones, as he accepts the slave system and does nothing to stand up to those who show true bigotry. The only praiseworthy supporting performance of a praiseworthy character is comes from Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey, a young slave woman who works hard and keeps her chin up only to be struck down time and time again. What she had to do as an actress is award-worthy in and of itself.McQueen pulls off what every true cinephile fantasizes about; independent directors bringing their non-traditional artistic vision to the type of film you'd expect Hollywood to make and consequently dumb down. This is not the Steven Spielberg with a sweeping John Williams score version of slavery; this is an the unapologetic, gritty, haunting and beautiful version.Many will argue against the authenticity of this version, that it is excessively violent and pointlessly so, that McQueen has exaggerated and amplified the horrible nature of slavery for the purpose of shock value. Taking such a position, however, comes from a place of fear. To insist that "12 Years a Slave" be less brutal is to wish slavery were less brutal. Real life does not cut, fade to black or a pick a gentler angle when it comes to hate and violence. The fact that McQueen dared to take such a stance with his film and that the producers all appear to have stood behind him based on the film's final cut, deserves to be lauded as an act of true cinematic bravery. Film is considered an escapist medium, but "12 Years a Slave" shows how powerful narrative storytelling can be when it is used to explore the deepest darkest corners of human existence, the things we prefer not to confront or talk about yet define us as much as anything. It is the kind of film that has the potential to profoundly affect your perspective as a human being and that happens so very rarely.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
Some things don't belong together. Most people, I think, would put human defecation and married couples rekindling their romance in that category. Just don't tell the Farrelly Brothers that, because such things are their bread and butter and they've slathered it up again for "Hall Pass."Two best buds, Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (SNL's Jason Sudeikis), have lust and female anatomy on the brain, like all men stuck in good but stale marriages, and their wives (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) have gotten tired of it. A friend suggests the ladies let go of the leash by giving their husbands a "hall pass," or a week off from marital obligations, including fidelity. Rick believes this might be some kind of tactic, but Fred convinces him to take advantage of it. Soon, the two set off to score chicks only to find they're not any bit near as capable as they might have been during their formative years.Perhaps the Farrellys felt the pressure to give in to the "middle-aged married couples talking openly about sex" wave of R-rated comedy. The film feels as if it has an obligation to be meaningful and make a statement about love. That's not the problem; there are some genuinely realistic and almost heartwarming moments in the film regarding its romance parts. The trouble comes when the Farrellys aim for big laughs, because their strength does not lie in weaving comedy into a romance, but manipulating a story to set up moments of raucous laughter. Those moments feel disjointed and these pivotal jokes don't pack the punch they used to back in the days of "There's Something About Mary." Comedy evolves faster than cell phones these days and the Farrellys have only proved they can't exactly keep up.Among the few things they understand perfectly is middle aged men trying to act cool; kudos to Owen Wilson for breaking his "free-spirited sexual hippie and/or moron" type casting and pulling off the awkward family man with zero sense of style or any semblance of "game." He and Sudeikis in their tucked-in Hawaiian shirts among other things successfully prove the Farrellys' hypothesis that 40-year-old married men suffer nothing short of de- masculinization after 15-20 years of marriage. Unfortunately, this frighteningly realistic portrait factors minimally into the film's entertainment value.More effective are a select group of gags and some extraneous characters. Richard Jenkins, for example, steals countless laughs as a friend of Rick and Fred's who still attracts the ladies over the years because he knows all the secrets. Outside of Jenkins, the Farrellys seem to have trouble grasping the idea that well-crafted characters and mindful casting can elevate humor much more naturally. Instead, you've got guys such as Larry Joe Campbell crapping in a sand trap.Shock gags like that simply doesn't work anymore. Audiences aren't surprised much these days, but that apparently hasn't discouraged the Farrellys or sent them back to the drawing board. Instead, their thought process says "ok, we just have to go bigger and dirtier next time." I'd like to give them credit for sticking to their guns and doing what they know, but it taints "Hall Pass," which might have otherwise been a fairly (Farrelly?) decent movie.Honestly, the Farrellys, being about that age themselves, have an intuitive understanding of middle-aged guys and this makes the pathetic escapades of Rick and Fred appear to have some actual intention. Their "failures" coupled with the Farrelly's "Law and Order" inspired title cards for each day of the hall pass make for the funniest parts of the movie and give it a vague sense of depth, but they can hardly outshine a slow beginning, forced antics and tired shock humor.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
In a post-9/11 era, moviegoers are no longer fazed by the idea that the government can utilize technology to the fullest extent in tracking and monitoring citizens. We also understand that this (debatably) infringes upon our civil liberties. Since then, dozens of films have warned us of the dangerous extent that technology can take us to, and that rubs off some of the sheen for government agency thriller-lovers trying out "Enemy of the State" today as opposed to over ten years ago.A great movie is never dated and "Enemy of the State" definitely is, with Will Smith's hunted character Robert Dean getting all angry at Gene Hackman's gibberish description of a GPS, which is secondhand knowledge for first graders these days. We all know the power of satellites and how the government can bug anything with a mic, tracer or camera. In 1998, we didn't. So there's little novelty to this movie for anyone well-versed in post-9/11 thrillers -- even for those who've seen more recent Tony Scott-directed films. "Enemy" must then hinge more on its story, which it didn't when it was released, and the story is just average. It's a bit unfair to what was probably a better movie in its day, but time is one of film's most challenging tests.Starring Smith when he was riding high off of "Independence Day" and "Men in Black," "Enemy" is about a lawyer who accidentally comes across evidence he doesn't know he has that would expose a giant murder cover-up by that National Security Agency. Naturally, the NSA, led by Jon Voight, wants it at any cost, and using all sorts of technology strips Dean of everything. This convinces him to start running, where he eventually crosses paths with a former NSA tech (Hackman), who represents his only chance of shaking them off.Though the originality of the film fades with age, what improves is the who's who in the cast. In addition to Smith, Hackman and Voight, small roles are played by Jason Lee as the guy who plants the evidence on Dean in the first place, Jack Black as a tech servant of the NSA, Barry Pepper as an NSA field op ("Saving Private Ryan"), Jamie Kennedy, Philip Baker Hall, Lisa Bonet, Gabriel Byrne ("The Usual Suspects") and Scott Caan ("Ocean's Eleven")."Enemy" is your typically fast-paced thriller with the government going after the lone fox. It's a bit on the longer side, but it moves quickly at most points. Its only a weak story as far as drama and relationship. Dean's relationship with his wife (Regina King) throughout all this and their history of him cheating on her with Bonet one time years ago pops in and out and breaks the over-arching concept that should be driving the movie: Dean wanting to figure out what the hell is going on. He doesn't seem to wise up to pursuing that answer until much later on.Dean's relationship with Brill, Hackman's character, also feels forced and pointless. They have a "I need you as much as you need me moment" in the second half of the film, but when Hackman doesn't even show up for the first hour, you can't legitimately believe it's true. At this point, the film almost tries to switch into buddy action movie when it's much better as just a techno-thriller. For 1998, the concept of a thriller where an average upper-middle-class lawyer suddenly gets thrust into a nasty chase with the government would definitely be an appealing one -- it would be an easy character and situation to empathize with. But while team heals all, it definitely hurts some movies and particularly those with weak stories containing patchy subplots.
We're now more than a decade into the modern superhero movie era, folks. At this point, we've just crossed the threshold of the "reboot phase," in which studios have either been forced or decided to re-imagine some of the 2000's major superhero properties. We saw "X- Men: First Class" successfully relaunch the "X-Men" franchise last summer and Sony is hoping to do the same in July with "The Amazing Spider-Man." Even the critical and/or financial flops of the 2000s, such as "Daredevil," "Fantastic Four" and both "Hulk" films have reboots in the planning stages.And then there's "Ghost Rider." After the first film met a rough reception from critics and audiences in 2007 and a few years passed without a sequel, it seemed that the story of demon-possessed daredevil Johnny Blaze would get a full makeover. Apparently not. Five years later we get "Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance," which puts Nicolas Cage in the seat of the Ghost Rider once again, but cleans the slate from the first film aside from a brisk debriefing on how Johnny received his curse. With the directors of "Crank" (Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor) assigned to add a boost of adrenaline, this could be considered at least a dedication to improvement, right?Nope. Although the action could be described as better and the visual depiction of the Ghost Rider improved and more fully realized, "Spirit of Vengeance" suffers from the same plot inanity as its predecessor, if not worse. It's an exercise in obnoxious filmmaking and warrants a label as the blathering mental patient of all superhero movies.Johnny Blaze is hiding out in Eastern Europe when a wine-slugging frenchman named Moreau (Idris Elba) comes knocking. He offers to rid Johnny of his curse if he'll track down and protect a 13-year-old boy being hunted by the devil (Ciaran Hinds) for a specific purpose. Johnny finds the boy and his protective mother (Violante Placido), who also made a deal with the devil in her life, and you don't need to know anything that happens after that.When there's no movement or kinetic energy to this "Ghost Rider," it falls completely apart. Neveldine and Taylor only seem comfortable when cars go fast, and there's not nearly enough of that in this script. The tone of the rest of the scenes, ones in which conversations and generic character interactions take place is a complete schizophrenic mess. You never know if Cage will deliver a trademark snarky comment or have a psychotic break. I'd say he hasn't been this bad in a long time, but snarky/psychotic is Cage's career in a nutshell.The film possesses that mad-dog insanity of the "Crank" franchise, but being outlandish and lacking self-seriousness requires a full commitment. "Spirit of Vengeance" tries to be serious on too many occasions that whenever it tries to be crazy nut-job funny, it fails. A scene involving a Twinkie offers the only nugget of humor, but in the context of the film it's completely useless. The dark, rough and devilish vibe of "Ghost Rider" does not gel with this sense of humor at all. It could, but the story is so horribly bland that it doesn't matter. Remember that pissing fire scene from the trailer? It makes even less sense in the movie.I will, however, give one ounce of credit to the depiction of the Ghost Rider. In addition to being more grisly and realistic thanks to improved CGI, he's truly menacing. Too bad he doesn't get enough of a spotlight; the real curse is when he turns back into Cage. The idea of Johnny trying to contain the Rider and keeping it from taking over him creates an intriguing "Incredible Hulk"-like dynamic that could've worked well in the story, but it only impacts one scene and Cage hams it up so badly that he ruins it.From a pure entertainment standpoint, "Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance" is only good when it's on wheels, the fleeting moments when the kinetic style of its directors can be effective. Hinds gives a nice performance as a crazy Satan, but the rest of the film fails to commit to the same level of delightful lunacy, and everyone knows you don't go half-lunatic.Fox's blind trust in The Dark Knight co-writer David S. Goyer and the others who helped on this script clearly didn't work out. Keeping the original film's director, Mark Steven Johnson, on as executive producer doesn't make much sense either. Their film comes off as a careless effort meant for nothing but to keep the rights to "Ghost Rider" from reverting back to Marvel, where they'd be in much better hands.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Often times a film lifts its star to new height, but every so often the film is the thing getting lifted by the star. Jeff Bridges' Oscar-winning performance as raging alcoholic and chain- smoking 57-year-old country singer Bad Blake places the film "Crazy Heart" on his shoulders and creates something compelling out of another film about a music star fighting inner demons and finding some kind of inspiration to push through to the other side."Crazy Heart" at times appears to be no more than a fictional re-imagining of the Johnny Cash biopic "Walk the Line." There's nothing original about a washed-up singer with a drug problem who finds a shot at redemption in the form of a beautiful woman (in this case Oscar nominee Maggie Gyllenhaal). In fact, Robert Duvall, who stars in this film, won an Oscar for basically the same performance in the film "Tender Mercies."Yet "Crazy Heart" works. It's easy to follow the simple story and Bridges plays Blake with so much tireless conviction. He wears down the audience with his believability to the point that no matter how badly you might want to see his character as nothing more than one of many aging alcoholic performers in cinema history, you simply can't help but resonate with his inner torment.Gyllenhaal complements Bridges earthiness with her own gravitas. Down to earth has always been her calling card, but in a basic story it is her ability to complicate the emotions in these run-of-the-mill scenes for a female lead in a music drama that elevates them beyond stereotypical.The music of "Crazy Heart" maintains the indie sensibility, which helps keep the film from falling directly in line with its predecessors. There's not a whole lot of thematic elements at work, so the script remains dependent on the music for its soul. Just about anybody could become a country fan for two hours as they watch this film because the music comes from an organic place. The songwriting for the film is superb."Crazy Heart" is the type of drama that makes you wonder about how lightly the term Academy Award-winning can seem at times. There's nothing wrongful about the two wins and nomination for the film, it just offers proof as to how sincerity and realism can turn even the most typical of films/stories into Oscar gold.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
A story of a man talking to a tall imaginary rabbit seems like a child's film, but "Harvey" is anything but -- in fact it challenges our tendency to dismiss it as such. It is a case study of a perfectly delusional but perfectly charming middle-aged man who despite those around him believing him insane, ends up making them drive themselves crazy.Based on Mary Chase's Pulitzer-winning play (Chase also had a hand in the screenplay), "Harvey" tells the story of Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart), who as mentioned appears to have an imaginary friend rabbit who accompanies him to the bars where he meets people and invites them to have drinks at his house sometime. He appears to have no job and his older sister Veta (Josephine Hull) is embarrassed by his behavior, enough to the point where she finally takes him to a mental hospital to be committed, where farce-like humor ensues.Stewart, who has always fallen nicely into roles involving naive people passionately committed to something, is an ideal choice for Elwood. He gives the role a dreamy quality few of the other great actors of the '40s and '50s could have. Elwood is warm, kind-hearted, complimentary and other than drinking a lot and talking to an imaginary rabbit, seems devoid of any other vices or character flaws.As the doctors and nurses at the mental hospital get involved, we learn more about Elwood. The film is like a psychological case study in which we become so focused wanting to know what is triggering his delusion that we miss the point. That is until Chase's wonderful script makes sense of it toward the end.The film has the vibe of a very straight play adaptation. My guess would be that little of script changed; there's a lot of expository dialogue in the beginning. There's also not a whole lot of interesting visual storytelling. About the best thing director Henry Koster does other than not actually show Harvey is include where Harvey 'is' in the frame of his shot, which as I read was suggested by Stewart. The film relies mostly on the talents of Stewart and of Oscar-winner Hull as the completely whiny and over-dramatic old coot of a sister and the thoughtful and simplistic wisdom of Chase's script that preaches that normality is relative and that kindness is the true measure of character.
The plight of the nerd has taken many forms in film and television over the years, but none so genuine as "Revenge of the Nerds." Amidst all the sex and party-obsessed college stereotyping and seemingly unrealistic projection of the high school nerds vs. jocks concept onto the college scene, these nerds are pretty likable characters and their pranks make for the most classic college movie scenes outside of "Animal House."Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards play high school best friends (and bonafide nerds equipped with ridiculous inhaling laughs) who struggle to fit in to the college scene. When the jock fraternity -- the Alpha Betas -- burn their house down, they kick the freshmen out of their dorms and somehow they all get stuck living in the gym. After fraternity rush only the nerds are left homeless, so to get out, they try and start a fraternity, eventually gaining charter status with Lambda Lambda Lambda, a historically black fraternity.At odds with the nerds are the Alpha Betas and their sister sorority the Pis. Both groups try and make life a living hell for the nerds, who decide to use their high IQs to fight back. They kick it off with the infamous panty raid, busting into the Pi house and stealing the girls' underwear while also installing surveillance cameras in bathrooms and such. Once you get over the hump that there's no feasible way for "Revenge of the Nerds" to ever take place and that jocks and nerds would never have a rivalry going in a college setting, this movie becomes classic. There's a lot of clever scene writing which completely makes up for the one-dimensional characters -- namely the jocks. In all other movies it would all seem completely stupid, but "Nerds" delivers with just the right attitude to not provoke your criticisms.The nerds and their nerd girl friends are also great characters. Lewis and Gilbert as the lead nerds are really quite endearing. There's a naivety in their performances that keeps them from turning into completely nerd stereotypes. Also, the writing team doesn't try the pointless technique of providing subplots for all the other members of the Tri-Lams. They might be stereotypes, but their comedic value is greater because they fill out the off-color picture of the nerds. Truthfully, there are so many ways "Revenge of the Nerds" could have slipped and become a mediocre movie, but for these reasons it remains one of the more memorable "college" frat movies of all time.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Common terms associated with movies about infidelity would be "lust," "passion" and "betrayal," yet all those things are suspiciously absent from Sarah Polley's infidelity drama, "Take This Waltz." Her film is about as anti-soap opera as you can get  careful to avoid melodrama and dedicated to sidestepping any and all conventional depictions of adult relationships in film.It seems odd to call Polley bold for showing it like it is, the way that she drags us through the head of her main character, Margot (Michelle Williams), who so undeniably loves her husband, Lou (Seth Rogen), yet cannot deny her feelings for Daniel (Luke Kirby), a man she meets while away for work who turns out to be her neighbor. However, when it comes to filmmaking, anything that deviates from Hollywood reality can make an audience uncomfortable, so it takes some guts to ignore that filmmaking impulse.Consequently, a good chunk of viewers will be turned off or frustrated by "Take This Waltz," losing patience with the inaction of its characters and pulling their hair out over the tension oozing out of the most casual character interactions. Yes, "Take This Waltz" can be so uneventful that it verges on pointless, but in time Polley's intentions become very clear.As Margot and Daniel get closer, they don't really get closer, and as Margot and Lou drift apart, they actually come off as in love as they've ever been. For much of the film, it's in Margot's head that the cheating is actually happening. Her thoughts and actions are not in sync and it becomes extremely difficult for us to find empathy for her because we feel as though she needs to act on her feelings, to either voice her displeasure to Lou or throw herself at Daniel. That's the Hollywood impulse calling.Polley continues to resist, and as challenging as it becomes to watch at times, her film comes out better for sticking to its convictions. As she clearly intended, a switch flips in a scene in which Margot and Daniel ride an indoor Scrambler as "Video Killed the Radio Star" plays, an in the loopy chaos of the scene, we (and Margot) find a certain clarity in understanding what's going on between the main characters.There's a definite phantasmagoria to Polley's style as well that while visually engaging contrasts a bit with what's otherwise such a nuanced, completely believable film. Several scenes play out like dream sequences, but we later can confirm they actually happened. She seems quite content to toy with our expectations and challenge what we think we know to be true about how love works. You couldn't cast a better actress than Williams with a performance that's so hard to pull off. We only identify with Margot because we see her humanity, but it's tough to understand her and in some cases even like as a third-party observer of her story. Williams should be lauded for volunteering for this experiment and selling it as well as she does, especially when you consider that Kirby is a total unknown and Rogen is a poster child for modern comedy, for formulaic comedies that are such a far cry from "Take This Waltz."The end of the movie is bound to bother a lot of people, while others will be intrigued at the choice and make peace with what Polley has to say because she frankly makes a good argument. Fidelity gets such a black-and-white portrayal in film and television, though maybe that's a societal thing because of its prominence in religious code. Nevertheless, she utilizes every tool at her disposal to present the gray area that we so quickly jump to deny and shudder to embrace.It's tough to really enjoy a film that doesn't emotionally click, in which we don't feel with our hearts that things should've turned out how they did, but Polley has such a beautiful directorial style and conveys her intentions so clearly that "Take This Waltz" warrants a certain degree of respect for its bold yet so honest and impressively perceptive take on love.~Steven CThanks for reading!

For the last decade, Luc Besson has been among the most reliable producers, writers and directors making thrilling, mindless entertainment, which makes "Lucy," a film about a woman accessing 100 percent of her brain capacity, somewhat ironic. In all seriousness, however, "Lucy" is a departure from the filmmaker's gritty, revenge-driven track record of late, though not necessarily a noticeable improvement.Like most of Besson's films, "Lucy" is a straightforward, concept-driven action movie: Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), an American in Taiwan, gets kidnapped by a wealthy organized crime boss (Min-sik Choi, of "Oldboy" fame) who stuffs a package of a new synthetic drug in her body for smuggling purposes, but the plan takes a turn when the package ruptures and Lucy begins experiencing its mind-enhancing effects. Consuming knowledge and experience cell growth at an unprecedented rate, she seeks to turn the tables on her captors.But while "Lucy" is a pretty clear-cut concept, the plot is rather messy. As Lucy begins to unlock more and more of her brain and power, she understandably becomes more than just revenge- driven and becomes obsessed with sharing her knowledge with Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman). The script ends up being 50 percent philosophical and theory-based, and it seems Besson is more fascinated with this idea of humans accessing their full brain capacity and what we would learn about our existence than he is with crafting a compelling story.What results is a film that talks an interesting and intelligent game but plays out in somewhat dumb fashion. In other words, "Lucy" is easily the most thought-provoking film Besson has made in the last 10 years at least, but it ranks behind many of those recent films in terms of being a compelling watch. Eventually, the concept of what's happening to Lucy's brain flies off the handle and we can no longer understand the science or theory behind it. The movie gets abstract and flat-out trippy in a way we haven't seen from Besson since "The Fifth Element." At times you have to wonder if he was watching too much Terrence Malick when he made this one.Johansson, of course, makes for an eternally watchable leading lady. Even when Besson injects a few emotion-driven moments that feel completely out of place, she makes the most out of them, as if somewhere inside the hollow vessel of her character is a multi-dimensional person. Even the casting of Freeman as the professor, who exists exclusively to explain what's happening to Lucy, adds a certain legitimacy to the film To Besson's credit, he manages to create enough thought-provoking moments to make "Lucy" feel like a smart and unique film. There are some big ideas within this concept and though he mostly scratches the surface, he manages to create enough of a hook to pull the audience into the movie. Although it plays out so differently compared to films like "Taken" and "The Transporter" series, Besson again proves to be innovative as far as surface-level entertainment goes.It's also tremendously helpful that "Lucy," like most of Besson's films, is short. At less than 90 minutes, it doesn't toil about long enough to let its faults drag it down. For everything it's missing, it's still efficient. That's the kind of low-risk approach that most flawed movies could stand to benefit from and that Besson had proved time and time again to be pretty reliable in delivering.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Think your parents are/were overprotective? Not after "Dogtooth." Giorgos Lanthimos' film, the first Greek film to be nominated for an Oscar in more than 30 years, imagines the pinnacle of what sheltering and censorship of children would be like to an absurd degree. A strange and ruminating film that is as fascinating as it is disturbing and unpleasant, "Dogtooth," in all its gratuitousness, embodies everything that a great film should.Told in a series of clips that use a few takes a possible, Lanthimos shows us life in this family's estate. The father (Chirstos Stergioglou) is the only one who ever leaves the premises, while the mother (Michele Valley) and three teenage children, two daughters and a son, stay at home. The mother is wise to it, but the kids only know the outside is dangerous (flesh- eating cats lurk around the fence for one thing) and they will not be able to leave until one of their dogteeth fall out. Of course when you're a teenager, they don't anymore.Lanthimos covers the gamut of technicalities in terms of how this complete cut-off from society could work effectively. Every time the kids discover a word that has something to do with the outside world, the parents explain to them that it's another name for something within the estate walls. For example, the "telephone" is salt and "zombies" are little yellow flowers. The real airplanes that fly overhead are explained to be nothing but plastic toys that occasionally fall out of the sky (and when one does, the kids run to claim it).The only thing the parents seem to have trouble controlling is human nature, which begins the calamity. The film opens with one of its more perverse facets. Every week or so, the father brings Christina (Anna Kalaitzidou), a security guard from his work, to the estate and pays her to satisfy the sexual needs of the son (Hristos Passalis). Presumably, the parents believe that boys need an outlet for their urges or else they will manifest them in destructive ways, which in this case would upset the very tidy life of this family.As an "outsider," however, Christina brings with her some troubling influences. She somewhat seduces the eldest daughter, who's smitten by her as she would be any guest to the home given the rarity of that occurrence. This, however, brief in the film, influences the eldest's behavior pattern and sets off a series of events.Lanthimos treats his film as an exhibit or exhibition of sorts. Choosing shots carefully and sticking with them for lengthy periods of time, the family becomes a case study. Jumping from scene to scene, the plot thrives on our curiosity as to why the parents have done this and in one what ways it has altered the psychology of the children. Most scenes either show how the parents maintain this grand illusion or how the children come up with games to keep themselves entertained.Yet "Dogtooth" leaves its imprint in some explicit and uncomfortable sex scenes as well as a few instances of the father delivering discipline as he sees fit. Although these scenes are not unjustified in some ways because you have to be a bit sick and twisted to run your family like this, I would definitely argue that it's gratuitous and largely for shock value.The reason "too much" applies to "Dogtooth" comes from its lack of context. Lanthimos expects us to infer motivation for why the parents have set up this world and these boundaries, even so far as crossing ethical lines to maintain it. We see results that create these compelling and complex characters, but do not dive deeply into the psyche. "Dogtooth" serves only as a scarily affecting showcase meant warn us about the dangers of censorship and what can occur when manufacturing family and a lifestyle.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Festering somewhere in the chaos of "Sucker Punch" is an exotic narrative twisted into an epic adventure waiting to be born. But Zack Snyder has pulled his bun out of the oven way before he's given it time to rise. A multi-layered rock fantasy that could find a permanent home on MTV2, Snyder's premature brainchild is a mind**** of a film; literally every fantasy in his mind and that of creative dorks like him (boys and girls included) popped open like a champagne bottle spewing glorious slow-motion foam everywhere at the hands of one not strong enough to control it. Snyder fills his canvas with everything he or we could possibly imagine, but with nothing except visual motifs to tie it all together."Sucker Punch" feels like a personal project Snyder should've kept locked up a little (okay, a lot) longer. Sure, after "Dawn of the Dead" and the financial surprise that was "300," he earned himself a creative license with Hollywood dollars long before the few filmmakers who ever earn that kind of power usually do. Snyder, however, jumped at the chance to work on his own story way too soon. Narratively the film is missing connections between a lot of its dots and the characters, while likable, possess zero back story and consequently have no motivation. To be as brief as possible, after Snyder's music video prologue for a remix of Annie Lennox's "Sweet Dreams" that explains how Baby Doll (Emily Browning) got sent to a mental institution thanks to her nasty stepfather, she discovers the hospital appears to be a front for a burlesque show/brothel run by Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino) and namely the asylum director, Blue (Oscar Isaac). Girls Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) are performers, but Baby Doll steals the show as she's found a way through losing herself in dancing to unlock a dream world that can help her and the others escape. This dream world creates fantastical missions again Nazi zombies, giant Samurai, dragons and more that help them get what they need in reality to make their escape.At times, I truly believed a book adaptation of this story would be perfect. It would allow the time and opportunity to enter the head of Baby Doll as well as her detained friends and give time for Snyder's ideas to germinate. As odd as this sounds, Snyder would've done amazing work with this film had he adapted it from a well-crafted novel that already made sense and didn't leave its audience with fingernails upon scalp. His execution rates better than almost any director with action, but his talent is just that so far: execution (and I don't mean that with morbid sarcasm).The one cooked-through element of "Sucker Punch" is what you'd expect from Snyder: the action. The visuals are jaw-dropping. The only thing missing would be a little gravity or even the slightest bit of logic justifying the bizarre scenes for each dream world escapade. These fight scenes draw inspiration from any movie you could imagine, with one involving a castle, dragons and goblins that strongly echoes "Lord of the Rings." The hazy yellow world Snyder has created simply stuns and his style and perspective choices during fight scenes remain impeccable. You can't deny the man his incredible gift in this regard. He also knows how to support his visuals with music. It will be awhile before soundtracked films overtake or at least match composed films in this genre, but Snyder will be viewed as the godfather when it happens.It's tough to make it through a chaotic and abstract film that doesn't appropriately lay its foundation, so the rip-roaring visuals help. Some moments in the plot are in fact a bit more jarring than expected and elicit more of a reaction than I'd like to give the film credit for, but these talented young actresses help in spite of the hollow cores of the characters they've been handed.Where foundation and execution flip-flop for "Sucker Punch" comes from the creative seed. In that regard, there's a foundation for an film that could be revelatory, but Snyder's focus on the stylishness of the delivery slices it up into vague and incoherent chunks. It can safely be deemed a story championing self-empowerment, but we never feel that because of the seemingly random and abstract ways he dresses it up. Honestly, if Christopher Nolan had this in his brain and could've scripted it, you'd be looking at a hailed cinematic achievement. Snyder just got ahead of himself. Some people will recognize the potential had Snyder waited and really tailored the story perfectly, but most will see the randomness and lack of control.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" will disturb you, bother you, probe you, intrigue you and confuse you to no end. It is abusive in its use of human vice as a means of showing society at its worst. But while it's hard to take, Kubrick's science-fiction social commentary is simply one of the best examples of how film can tell stories and make valuable points in ways that other media simply can't.The film takes place in a future Britain, which Kubrick portrays with a retro-'60s twist that only makes sense for someone envisioning the not-too-distant future from 1970. The main character is Alex, a teenager living a lifestyle of pure anarchy, focused on excessive violence, or "ultraviolence" as he an his cronies coin it. It's a gang culture and Alex believes in it, that is until his "brothers" set him up and get him caught and stuck in prison, where he makes an effort to get selected for a special treatment that is said to cure him of his evil ways and allow him to go back into the world immediately despite his prison sentence. The result is by far more ethically questionable than Alex's previous actions and Alex finds himself as the poster boy for an attack on the government.Kubrick's depiction of this dark and dangerous world is never without distinct purpose. Every scene is memorable, every camera angle or movement significant in some way or contributing to the mood of the film. The use of classical music both as an element of the film and as a major part of the plot is absolute genius. Music, especially Beethoven, seemingly the most harmless aspect of a stained character in Alex, becomes the most influential in the film and also is Kubrick playing the same trick on us as gets played on Alex.Malcolm McDowell as the eerie and controversial "protagonist" steals most of the acting thunder. After all, he is the narrator, but this is without question a work that feels dominated most by the ubiquitous presence of its director. He even went out of his way to create inconsistencies in the film's continuity.Kubrick explores the very indecipherable nature of both good and evil and how it is conditioned in society. The film also serves as a critique of higher establishment, specifically government, telling people how they are supposed to live, though ironically a minister seems to offer some thematic advice in saying that all men have choice to be good or evil. "Orange" is the kind of film that has many layers that can be visited and revisited. Its science-fiction element makes it timeless as well - we can always ponder its questions about the future. Ultimately, however, no matter how much access you have or think you have into the film's insights, it still leaves an impression. There are so many memorable scenes and while most of those might be difficult to watch, they're deeply affecting and fascinating. The combination of visuals, music and ideas simply shows film's great contribution to thought and social ideas.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
I come from the group that has never read the Stephenie Meyer books and knew little about them other than the general idea of love and vampires and such. I had put off watching "Twilight" based on reviews, what I heard and my gender, but finally -- nearly a year later -- gave in to my curiosity over what the craze is all about.Now, I understand it. I don't like it, but I understand it. "Twilight" and the book its based on is romance -- melodramatic dialogue-filled romance about dangerous/forbidden love, something that's been a major literary force for centuries. Combine that with human infatuation with vampires and there's perfect reason for "Twilight" to be a success.That said, the storytelling of "Twilight" is not all that good, speaking about the film at least (still haven't read the book). Bella (Kristen Stewart), moves from Arizona to the Pacific Northwest to live with her dad. At her new school, she develops a quick crush on the mysterious Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a pasty-faced TD&H beaux from a family that is equally strange and equally as covered in distracting pale make-up. Bella, however, is a little odd herself. For reasons we never totally understand, she's drawn to him and willing to trust him a bit quickly as she discovers he's not exactly human. Edward, however, is much the same. The on-screen chemistry of Stewart and Pattinson gets an A, but the chemistry of their characters in the story gets an F for fake.Once things get rolling and we get over the fact that we don't fully understand why they're suddenly in love with each other, "Twilight" becomes more interesting. Until then, however, it's all sorts of awful. Never mind the low-budget visual effects and shoddy stunt work that look like something I've seen on the WB -- that's a whole other issue. The problem is there's no source of antagonism in the story for the first hour and change. Edward keeps telling Bella she should stay away from him and be scared of him and Bella wants to know why. Then she figures it out and he tries to scare her off some more. The conflict is inner tension entirely. People's thoughts only make for good conflict in books -- it doesn't translate onto the screen the same way. Melissa Rosenberg, who wrote a few episodes of hit teen show "The O.C." and the dance flick "Step Up," doesn't seem to have generated any creative ideas to make this story work more visually. I can't speak for her adaption of the source material, but I can rightfully say the movie is not inspiring or captivating until an external force (a few bad vampires) enter the picture.So "Twilight" has to sell hard on romance, which is what it's all about anyway. This is the specialty of director Catherine Hardwicke, who directed the intriguing teen drama "Thirteen." The intimate scenes between Edward and Bella, which are supposed to have a tentative, awkward feeling to them given the nature of their relationship, is really felt in her work. She's definitely keen on the whole connection between vampires and sensuality. Stewart and Pattinson are both great selections for the film. Both weren't just lucky casting choices -- they have definite careers ahead of them.What the movie needed to actually be entertaining to a bigger audience is a director with a better sense of action and suspense. Edward climbs a fair amount of trees with Bella on his back and it's more reminiscent of Brendan Frasier in "George of the Jungle" than anything released in today's visual effects era. "Twilight" ultimately takes too much time establishing itself and the rules of its world, not showing them to us quickly in creative visual ways that give us a sense of the fantasy we think we ought to be enjoying. It's like the "Mad Max" films with Mel Gibson: the first film ends just as it gets interesting and the second film is the one most fondly remembered. You only get a sense by the end of the film what the "Twilight" world is all about. I imagine "New Moon," the second installment, will be somewhat better by this same concept (and also with a fantasy-grounded director in Chris Weitz). Problem is, "Twilight" didn't convince me any future films will be better enough.~Steven C - Visit my site at http://moviemusereview.blogspot.com
Be prepared to have your annual "movies are never as good as the books" conversation with family and friends, because Stieg Larsson's worldwide best-seller "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" has come to theaters (this time without subtitles).Wanting to honor the beloved source material, Sony placed this American version in the hands of serial killer mystery expert David Fincher ("Se7en," "Zodiac") and Oscar-winning writer Steve Zaillian ("Schindler's List"). The move pays off, because "Dragon Tattoo" is about as good as it possibly could be given the challenges of the adaptation.The multi-faceted story deals primarily with Mikael Blomqvist (Daniel Craig), a journalist being sued for libel who temporarily steps down as his magazine's editor and quietly accepts an offer from a retired businessman named Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Under the guise of writing Vanger's memoir, he is to investigate the unsolved mystery of Vanger's missing/presumed dead niece, Harriet, a case over 40 years old. In need of help, he comes across Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a strange young woman with expert hacking skills who passionately takes up the job due to her own troubled past.Much like its Swedish predecessor, this adaptation strives to pack the bulk of the novel into a "reasonable" runtime without boring its audience to death. Zaillian compresses the hundreds of complex details of the cold case at the film's epicenter into easily digested chunks, yet merely having to do so always produces no better than satisfactory results. Oddly enough, saying the script doesn't derail the film or damage the story and its characters is the highest of compliments one can pay it in this case, and that's what it does.But it's Fincher who elevates this film, with no offense intended toward Niels Arden Oplev, director of the 2009 effort. Fincher is a master of his craft, and that means a considerable amount when dealing with a film so densely filled with plot points that other elements (like character development) can get lost.Although no adaptation of this novel could possibly convey the lengthy passage of time and the obsessive nature of Blomqvist's search for the truth, Fincher provides an abundance of tone, especially in reflecting the frigid temperatures of northern Sweden. He and his "The Social Network" and "Fight Club" cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth make it so every golden ray of sunlight on the desolate island feels as warm as it looks. Only directly blasting cold air on you from the back of your seat a la a "4D" theme park attraction would be more effective.The film's editing job is also top notch, overlapping audio and video to smooth over the exorbitant location transitions and maximize suspense in the scenes that cut back and forth between Lisbeth and Blomqvist. In fact, the movie finds its best groove in these scenes.Also crucial to depicting the book are the issues of graphic content, namely violence and sadism. After all, the translation of the original Swedish title is "Men Who Hate Women." Fincher embraces the book's sexual and disturbing nature as evidenced most basically in the marketing campaign. He also doesn't shy away in the film's most difficult scenes, giving them the brutal and sordid edge they require to honor the message of Larsson's novel. Although it feels wrong to call them tastefully done given the subject matter, it's true.Mara's performance mirrors Fincher's vision in many ways. There's no expectation of pity for Lisbeth, yet neither is she a hollow shell who completely bottles up her feelings. She bares it all in this film in every sense, giving herself to the performance. Rather than ham it up a notch to get some Oscar attention, she sticks with her interpretation of the character and makes for a rather unforgettable Lisbeth Salander.Craig is also a perfect Blomqvist, though his character lacked something distinctive, perhaps due to the script not giving him many moldable moments. A similar fate befalls many of the characters, which just emphasizes the need for Fincher's work and the talent of his actors all the more. Stellan Skarsgård as Martin Vanger, the current CEO of the Vanger Corporation, does perhaps the best job of utilizing his screen time to create a compelling character."The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a busy movie, and understandably so. Larsson's story deserves its integrity preserved the way it was in this version (only minor omissions and one major change), even at the cost of something that could have been more emotional and moving. Putting the book down and looking at this as a mystery/thriller, it's a consummate offering for the genre. Those unfamiliar with its source material will find it a bit slow at points and not as clean as a thriller written directly for the screen, but will still enjoy the payoff thanks to the professionalism of Fincher and Zaillian.A book and two movies later, rather than saying "the book is better," it should be said that "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" thrives the most in its original novel form. Some books lend themselves to film better than others  this isn't one of them. Given this movie took it out of its ideal state, its a good thing it turned out how it did.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com
Horror films always seem to take place in the present, which is understandable, considering one decade or century isn't necessarily scarier than the next (in the traditional sense of fear). It also costs more money to dress up a film in a particular era. So if it weren't actually scary or interesting, "The Woman in Black" would at least be commended on its early 20th Century setting and expert set decoration."Harry Potter" star Daniel Radcliffe turns out to be pretty non-essential to this resurgent horror effort from Britain's Hammer Films, unless you count the spotlight he brings to it. His character, Arthur Kipps, serves only as a means to explore the mystery of the Woman in Black.Rather than riding the trend of supernatural planes and paranormal occurrences, "The Woman in Black" is a tried and true ghost story. Arthur Kipps is single father who lost his wife during childbirth. The trauma has leaked to his professional life, and so to prove himself to his employer he must train out to the country and settle the affairs of Eel Marsh House. As it turns out, "settle the affairs" means something completely different.Very little of the history/mystery of Eel Marsh House is given to us through expository dialogue, which is quite refreshing for a horror film. Perhaps it's because writer Jane Goldman ("X-Men: First Class," "Kick-Ass") is over-qualified for the gig of adapting Susan Hill's novel. Ciarán Hinds' character, essentially the only man to welcome Arthur with open arms, could have been a convenient excuse to explain that Eel Marsh House is haunted, but instead, our own knowledge that this is in fact a horror film is all we need to mount the tension and start to draw conclusions about what's going on in this small town.As such, "The Woman in Black" builds slowly and quietly, creating a pesky suspense more terrifying than any of the jump scares. The countless times Arthur goes up and down the stairs and out the door and back inside Eel Marsh or slowly walks into new rooms where he previously saw a ghost is maddening and even frustrating, yet it's far from boring. Director James Watkins uses the hauntingly gorgeous set decoration to create even more suspense.The nursery where a traumatic event occurred in the house featuring all kinds of wind-up toys is an incredible and creepy sight. Watkins will focus in on the beaded eyes of dolls which look like they are watching Arthur because the candle light reflects in them as he moves. In general, the period decor is thick and rich, and Watkins wields it to his advantage.The movement throughout the house also moves the plot along. When Arthur sees something he goes to explore the room, as if the Woman in Black wants him to discover her story. Arthur is also alone at this point, so there's no needless dialogue to summarize what he's uncovered. In fact, large portions of the film are completely silent other than the swelling horror music.While any actor could have played Arthur, Radcliffe does well in the role. It's implied given the script does not include any scenes of him trying to flee, but he doesn't have any exaggerated scenes of being afraid or freaking out; he's actually a rather refreshing horror protagonist. Most of the time the person goes into some room because it's a horror movie, but here you actually believe Arthur would go in the room because he's not dumb and has proved to be a bit more brazen than most.There aren't any shocking twists or reveals in "The Woman in Black," but the very slow and calm approach to the mystery allows the conclusion to be riveting anyway. Any viewer with decent observation skills will start to put the pieces together fairly quickly on who the Woman in Black is and why she's haunting people. Instead, it's what her feelings are toward Arthur and what will ultimately become of him that are slightly ambiguous.The ending is one of those shockers that ends suddenly, like in a Sam Raimi horror film. It's not impossible to predict, but part of it is rather unexpected; it's superior than most neatly tied-up horror endings.In fact, "The Woman in Black" is superior to most horror offerings, though certainly the period setting and the subtlety of the story rank as its best features.~Steven CThanks for reading!

In the marketing for "Seven Psychopaths," CBS Films wants you to count  the film's seven stars, but the one real psychopath (and I mean that in  most positive and endearing way possible) that matters is writer and  director Martin McDonagh, whose sophomore film and follow-up to "In  Bruges" is a cockeyed stroke of genius.  Sticking with what the marketing tells us, this is a film about a  couple dognappers who steal a mob boss's Shih Tzu and get their friend  and girlfriends wrapped up in the mess. What it doesn't tell you is  that Colin Farrell's character is a screenwriter working on a script  called "Seven Psychopaths" and all he has so far is the title. Oh, and  Farrell's character is named Marty.  If you can't tell where this is going, let's just say that "Seven  Psychopaths" is one of those films that reserves a special place for  movie junkies and cinephiles. Everyone will find a great deal to laugh  at (especially Sam Rockwell), but only a certain percentage will have a  gleeful appreciation for the meta-narrative at work.  Luckily, you don't have to identify as a film nerd to enjoy "Seven  Psychopaths." The film is by no means exclusive or inaccessible, it  just reaches another level of storytelling and maniacal brilliance if  you can make those connections. Beyond that layer, the film offers a  potent combination of semi-gratuitous violence, loony antics and some  stirring poignancy. Throw the meta layer back in, and you have the  equivalent of if Charlie Kaufman's "Adaptation" had been directed by  Guy Ritchie.  The film begins with Marty, an alcoholic writer, looking for  inspiration for his seven psychopaths. His first psychopath is inspired  by the Jack of Diamonds Killer, a guy running around Los Angeles  killing off mid-to-high-ranking mob men. Funny then, that his nutty  friend Billy (Rockwell) should happen to steal Bonny, the precious Shih  Tzu belonging to Charlie (Woody Harrelson), a sensitive yet unforgiving  mob boss. Charlie is able to track down Billy's partner, Hans  (Christopher Walken), and the trio is forced to make themselves scarce.  If you're still using the poster to count, then you're probably  wondering about the other three "psychopaths." Well, one is a true  psychopath, and that's Zachariah (Tom Waits), who responds to an add  that Billy put in the paper to try and help Marty find more  inspiration. Zachariah has a fascinating story of little consequence to  the film, about how he and his wife decades ago went on a serial killer  killing spree, gorily offing renowned American killers including  Zodiac. His wife left him, however, for getting too soft.  As for the ladies, they have actually no bearing on the movie at all.  Abbie Cornish and Olga Kurylenko amount to wasted talents, which is  only bothersome because of the marketing (or, I suppose, if you're a  hardcore feminist).  The four main players, however, give some of the best turns of their  careers. Rockwell has never been funnier playing his cocky persona.  Billy is so blissfully and purposefully ignorant of reality and never  lacks for surprises. Harrelson, having played many an oddball and many  a hard-ass, effectively blends both in Charlie. But it's Walken who has  one of his best roles in ages. Hans has all his marbles; he's even a  sweetheart, he just plays it abnormally cool in certain situations.  Whereas Marty overreacts to the danger this wild premise brings, Hans  handles it as if he expected it. Consequently, his humorous lines and  moments really cut the tension.  Somehow, McDonagh makes "Seven Psychopaths" completely hysterical and  off-the-wall crazy without completely shattering its believability. The  characters, though psychopaths each in their own way, are carefully  grounded and humanized. McDonagh gives them each something we can  connect to emotionally, something we can identify with, in spite of  their irrational quirks. The film occasionally takes some sharp turns  into eye-opening dramatic territory, but it doesn't result in the  jarring tonal nightmare you would expect that to yield from lesser  auteurs.  And there's still this whole other stratosphere that the film enters in  the screenplay within a screenplay context. Marty sets out at the  beginning to write a film about peace and love that features  psychopaths and violence, or something completely oxymoronic to that  affect, and McDonagh finds a way (in his interpretation), to make that  happen.  "Seven Psychopaths" seems likely to face a fate similar to "In Bruges"   not a whole lot of renown amongst the general public, but heaps of  praise from those who ingest films on a regular basis. This one  definitely has more appeal (more stars, set in Los Angeles, etc.), but  both films have similar sensibilities. McDonagh has a real knack for  playing around with clichés and expectations. He twists them around  into something delightfully unexpected that despite seemingly outwardly  silly, is quite meaningful, shocking and doubtlessly entertaining.  ~Steven C
There was a day when Vince Vaughn used to do comedies. That day was only five years ago, but it seems like ages since a trademark Vaughn tirade caught laughs like a fishing net. His talents are squeezed into "The Dilemma," a drama that masquerades as a comedy using the guise of Vaughn and comedian Kevin James. The film never recovers from this marketing trickery, namely because it still tries to punch in the humor anyway.There are certainly worse subjects to center a comedy around than infidelity, but just because that's not domestic abuse or something that can be prosecuted by law doesn't make "The Dilemma" any more entertaining. Vaughn's Ronny does find himself in some humorous predicaments, but it always comes back to his choice on whether to tell his friend Nick that his wife (Winona Ryder) is cheating on him.The contradiction in tone here has no remedy. Screenwriter Allan Loeb seems to have a grasp on drama, but the humor never works the way it ought to in a film with Vaughn and James that so clearly touts itself as capable of delivering laughs. Channing Tatum shockingly delivers the funnier moments as an insecure tattooed bachelor named Zip, the one sleeping with Ryder's character, Geneva.Ron Howard, in an odd film given his resume, doesn't seem to embrace the true tone of the script either. He throws in some scenes depicting the lies that Ronny tells to his girlfriend Beth (Jennifer Connelly) to cover up the information he learned. They intend to add a visual humor element but feel completely out of place in mainstream comedy. In fact, one could argue that "The Dilemma" might have been more effective envisioned as an independent film or something in that style. Indies have a way of mixing drama and humor and "The Dilemma" could use a lesson or five in making that hybrid work.Vaughn's experience in some independent films and non-traditional comedies actually makes him a good fit for Ronny, someone who we must sympathize with in order to stand watching this movie, which in fact does stay watchable. It's only when the film requires him to be mainstream comedy funny that he falls flat as protagonist.Despite wrapping you up in how the events will unfold, "The Dilemma" suggests nothing of substance to its audience. It's like eating bland candy or drinking flavored water: sure, you can do keep ingesting it, but you know you're not getting anything from it other than empty artificial flavoring. Tolerable filmmaking doesn't imply a satisfactory film experience. As much as "The Dilemma" certainly speaks some truth about relationships, it does so most matter-of-factly and in constant violation of expectations in terms of the level of humor.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
You can't really make a case against "Rubber." You don't have to like it, but you can't exactly criticize it. The film opens with a man (Stephen Spinella) climbing out of a car trunk and delivering a monologue straight to the camera about how the stuff that happens in movies happens for no reason. Why is E.T. brown? No reason. Why do people fall in love in movies? No reason. In "The Pianist," he asks, "how come this guy has to hide and live like a bum when he plays the piano so well? Once again the answer is, no reason."The point of Quentin Dupieux's"Rubber," in which a tire named Robert rolls around a desert- area town and explodes people's heads with its mind, is to justify this very principle, that nothing that happens in a movie needs logic or explanation. It's rather blunt in delivering this concept to the audience, but if you find yourself asking "why?", you already have your answer  no reason.Spinella's Lieutenant Chad and his partner the accountant (Jack Plotnick) then hand a bunch of random people binoculars so they can watch this movie about Robert the tire, seemingly unaware that they are in the film and not simply casual observers. We then watch Robert become an animated object and discover his ability to explode things through sheer force of will, with occasional cuts to the people watching him through binoculars."Rubber" only gets weirder from there in order to make it clear that nothing should be seen as unexpected or illogical. Dupieux as a storyteller seems to be somewhat obsessed with the way we see and perceive films, how we draw story elements together in our minds as well as when and why we choose to suspend disbelief at some moments but not at others. He has thrown together the most random story he can think of and done everything in his power to trick us into thinking there's a point or something logical driving it. The point, of course, is "no reason."To his credit, Dupieux executes his trickery with some serious skill. The way he films this tire rolling through the desert and going on this random killing spree gives Robert a degree of personality, like how an excellent nature filmmaker finds a way to tell a story with animals that's not necessarily there and convinces us of it.Still, at times "Rubber" is so intentionally purposeless that it loses even the purpose of exploring purposelessness. (Are you still with me?) We've been trained to perceive story and logic, and as such it's hard to watch a film that wishes to exploit that fact. As much as you might want to respect Dupieux for this deconstruction, it's really tough to enjoy his movie outside of the satisfaction one gets from not having to think or care about a movie because it's not thinking or caring either. At the same time, many a mindless film has been more enjoyable."Rubber" is a bizarre experiment in independent filmmaking and a film you'll likely never forget you saw. With its short run time you're about as likely to regret watching it as you are to be indifferent or even glad that it helped you kill some time. Dupieux shows definite promise as a filmmaker with an odd perspective; at some point he's bound to strike gold.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site, moviemusereviews.com
Even an outrageous stoner comedy can successfully appeal to a wide audience with a little ingenuity. "This Is the End" could've stopped at being a comedy in which a bunch of friends are faced with the apocalypse, but what really makes Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen's film work is that there's a big glass window where a fourth wall ought to be."This Is the End" takes advantage of those who count tabloids and celebrity news amongst their guilty pleasures, creating a sense of being shown behind the curtain and feeling on the inside just by having all the actors play themselves and making sporadic jokes about their real-life careers. As the film goes on, the actors become characters more than they actually play themselves and the authenticity wears off, but part of what makes the movie so effectively funny is that it peels off certain layers that 99.9 percent of other films (not labeled documentaries) have, regardless of how closely these actors all resemble their actual personalities.Rogen and Jay Baruchel star (again, as character versions of themselves) as old-time best friends drifting slowly apart. Baruchel comes to Los Angeles to stay with Rogen, who insists they party with his other Hollywood friends including Jonah Hill, James Franco and Craig Robinson. It's not Baruchel's scene, but he puts up with it. At the party, however, the Earth begins to shake, fires erupt everywhere and sinkholes form in the earth, including right outside Franco's house. A number of actors and celebrities playing themselves in cameos die, including a coked-up Michael Cera and other A-listers whom under normal movie circumstances we aren't used to seeing get killed off just like that.Baruchel, Rogen, Franco, Hill, Robinson and a crazy, reckless Danny McBride end up (for the most part) the lone survivors and board themselves up in Franco's house. Their attempts to figure out how to survive become the comic material from that point forward, along with some satanic twists. Meanwhile, their attitudes toward each other rear their ugly heads and cause even more friction.This all sounds like a thought-out, creative, original comedy plot, but some will see it as nothing but a dumb comedy masquerading as something innovative. Rogen and Goldberg are up to their same-old humor: masturbation jokes, random references, lewd physical humor and penises abound. But they innovate just enough to give their shtick a fresh coat of paint. Comedy trends and actors come and go; if these Apatow disciples want to remain relevant beyond this first decade, this is the kind of creativity that will be required of them. Simple, clever and effective.The film is garbage as a take on the apocalypse; it's all about the social scenarios that emerge from it. The few action sequences and visual effects scenes are borderline horrendous, but it doesn't jump into these dumb stoner-movie parts until after sufficiently building up the character-focused parts of the story.That said, it's hard to buy into the bromantic heart of "This Is the End" unlike previous movies featuring these guys ("Superbad," "Pineapple Express," etc.). Rogen and Goldberg assume because the actors are playing themselves that this establishes a relationship dynamic between Seth and Jay to the point that we're willing to root for them to overcome the riff they endure in the film. That, or Rogen and Goldberg just didn't care. Either way, their films usually succeed more at creating sincere relationship moments and they end up empty in this one."This Is the End" marks a successful experiment at twisting familiar genre tropes into something novel. It's not as well-rounded of a comedy, but it doesn't lack for moments of hilarity and it's certainly the best this crew has done in a while when it comes to stoner comedy.~Steven CThanks for reading!

It's a bit alienating and confusing at first, but "The History Boys" grows as the relationships between the film's characters do. The result is a rather different film about education and the search for success as well as identity.About a group of young British Oxford and Cambridge hopefuls who are being trained by their teachers to achieve this goal, "History Boys" is a film portraying young people at school that is the farthest thing from American, and that's a good thing. No characters fall into obvious stereotypes and they are all highly intelligent, gifted individuals. The boys aren't being educated to be smart, they're being challenged in their thinking and subsequently being challenged as people.The subplot and controversy of the film is an incident involving misconduct between a student and the boys' primary teacher, Hector, played by Richard Griffiths who is most famous for his role as Uncle Vernon in the Harry Potter series. Homosexuality or the questioning of sexuality and sexual drives and the desire to please others that one is fond of (in the broadest sense) is a major undertone and many times a player in the film's events. It's a bit confusing, but it adds something more material to a film that often times seems to be footage of well-read individuals discussing literature. Anyone who is turned off by scholarly behavior and thought could not possibly enjoy this film because they'd feel bored and alienated.The actors, all men mostly, are superb in the film, but Frances De La Tour while a definite supporting character carries her own power on the screen. The acting and characters are really the most important element of this film. It takes not time to establish its characters and relationships-you have to see them develop and insinuate them based on character interactions throughout the film. Since the film is mostly talking, there is a lot of opportunity for that.While the viewer does feel very much on the outside of the plot, the actors and characters do tend to keep the interest level up and the ending is very nice and effective. The result is something much more meaningful and not nearly as gimmicky as the title "The History Boys" suggests.
The mobster flick mixes with show business in "Get Shorty," the mob comedy from "The Addams Family" director Barry Sonnenfeld. The two (mob movies and Hollywood) have always gotten along well together from "The Godfather" to "Goodfellas," so "Get Shorty" taking the humorous business angle is only a natural evolution. Starring John Travolta hot off of "Pulp Fiction," it's an enjoyable film for those who love movies and those who love the mob."Get Shorty" is mostly about the former. Chili Palmer (Travolta) is a loan shark/shylock who flies out to Hollywood to collect a debt and partly to avoid his new boss, Ray Bones, the perfect jerk with a foul mouth played by Dennis Farina. In LA, Palmer meets producer Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) and becomes fond of the movie business, offering to help Zimm get some lenders who've invested in one of his films off his back.There's some strong irony between the movie business and mob movies, e.g. Chili pitches the story of why he's out in LA as a movie idea to Zimm who thinks he's got something, but its the rock solid performances of Travolta, Hackman, Farina and Delroy Lindo that sell you on "Get Shorty."Film-lovers will appreciate many references from "Touch of Evil" to "Three Men and a Baby" as the movie takes plenty of shots at the industry. Those more into the mob angle will enjoy how everyone's out to get everyone -- some for legitimate reasons, others because they want in on the movie business. It displaces the gangster movie from its cozy home in New York, Boston or Miami and drops it into the glitz of Hollywood where it fits well seeing as the industry is not exactly the cleanest."Get Shorty" is not overly impressive, maintaining interest through its performances and our wondering just when one of these guys is going to up the stakes and off someone -- such are the thrills of a mob movie. Its lack of a definitive objective and therefore constant evolution into a story about something other than what it started as definitely holds it back, but not beyond of the point getting to enjoy it. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
The first thing to know about "Adventureland" is that although it was directed and written by Greg Mottola ("Superbad") and it has Bill Hader in it, it is in know way in the mainstream vein of Judd Apatow-brand comedies. It's not outrageously dirty or over-the-top hysterical ever. It prides itself on humor through character and the natural awkwardness of life. Taking place at a theme park in Pittsburgh in the 80s, it's a modern-spirited but definite period comedy.Period comedies seem to always revolve around coming-of-age stories. There seems to be a natural connection between the nostalgia of an era and reflecting on personal choices and the pivotal moments of growing up. "Adventureland" is an 80s period comedy, but it's not necessarily a coming-of-age story. The protagonist is James (Jesse Eisenberg), a recent college grad, who while inexperienced in the ways of romance, at least knows who he is and what he wants from life in the long term. He's not growing up, but he's facing some harsh realities after his dad gets demoted and he can no longer afford that summer trip of a lifetime to Europe with his best friend.His only option is a summer job working at Adventureland, where he meets his colorful and strange employers (Saturday Night Live's Hader and Kristen Wiig), a new dork friend named Joel (Martin Starr, who has played minor roles in bigger comedies) and of course the laid back but emotionally distressed girl of his dreams ("Twilight" phenom Kristen Stewart). So what looks like a bum summer turns into a chance for James, a nerdy, awkward virgin, to reevaluate things.Mottola clearly was meant to direct this kind of a film. "Superbad" was a springboard for him to make something a bit more natural. "Adventureland" doesn't complete veer around summer romance clichés, but it has a distinctly more natural, less contrived sense of humor than "Superbad." It never resorts to male genital jokes, for one. Eisenberg and Stewart give very identifiable performances. They're scarily real rather than overly cliché. It's a bit tough to believe that a college graduate could be so stupid about handling girls, but his charm wins you over. A lot like Michael Cera of "Superbad," Eisenberg will either win you over or irritate you. Stewart was a phenomenal choice for Emily, whose family troubles have pushed her into a romance with a married man (Ryan Reynolds). She just has the look and plays the part of a naturally beautiful girl who really wrestles with who she is. Her character is probably written best in what is in general an awesome script.Like other period comedies, "Adventureland" celebrates music and house parties and relishes in amusing outfit choices. Having been so bogged down with modern young adult comedy, "Adventureland" is really the first film since "Dazed and Confused" in the 90s to go back in time. Since the 80s are back in style again in many ways, the 'historical' element makes it kind of refreshing and unique despite some stylistic choices both directorially and comically that are clearly reminiscent of today's movies.This is a surprisingly good movie if you don't expect "Superbad 2." It's much more real and even has a bigger heart. It's about being at a crossroads and trying to make the most of a situation while figuring out exactly where you're going. In hard times like today, it's a way of looking forward positively by enjoying a re-imagining of the past.~Steven C Vist my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Here's my theory on how Paramount and Hasbro teamed up to make "G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra." With the help of the film's creative team, Hasbro designed an entire Toys R Us aisle's worth of G.I. Joe action figures and accessories, everything from subs to jets to tunneling vehicles to Joes in accelerator suits as well as swords and guns and toy explosives. Then they put all those toys in a room lined with tinted glass and filled it with at least a dozen 8-year- olds with diagnosed ADHD and instructed them to have at it. On the other side of the glass were Michael B. Gordon, Stuart Beattie, Stephen Sommers, David Elliot and Paul Lovett, the film's writers, who tried to roughly translate the kids' make-believe story lines into a semblance of a plot."G.I. Joe" might be the most offensively terrible and amateur big-budget action flick I have ever seen. It's like driving through an automobile scrapyard rigged with land mines. The action, although intense and sometimes "cool," is so gratuitous that it's rendered completely ineffective. There are dozens of characters all of which are tied to some kind of pointless subplot that reveals their past but only makes them more shallow because it doesn't reveal anything about them as people, just characters. The dialogue also exists solely to explain the gadgets, the plot and move from Explosive Sequence A to Explosive Sequence B and the rest are dumb filler lines like "nice shoes" or "We're going to France? I like croissants.""Joe" starts off with two American soldiers, Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) who are sent on a mission to safely deliver these nanomite warheads (weapons filled with microscopic termites that can eat through cities). En route, a mysterious group of fighters led by The Baroness (Sienna Miller) attempt to steal it. They fail, of course, so that later after Duke and Ripcord get discovered by General Hawk and the G.I. Joe team, they can burrow into the base and try to steal it again, this time succeeding. The Joes figure out the big evil plan and then go to Paris as well as the Polar Icecaps to stop it.Although not great films, I enjoyed -- from an entertainment perspective -- Stephen Sommers' previous flicks "The Mummy" and "Van Helsing," but "Joe" is atrocious. Whatever eye for cool-looking sequences he has is wasted because there's way too much. Nothing sticks out as being "it was really cool when they did ___" because every sequence tries to be that way. Action scenes have to work like any other; they need to build up to a climax and resolve in some mildly intelligent manner. Otherwise, it's like watching the grand finale of a fireworks display only the finale is the whole thing and it's two hours long. The finale is not nearly as cool if it doesn't build and create anticipation. Sure, say that "Joe" is "just supposed to be an action movie" but it doesn't even adhere to those standards.It's pointless to even contemplate delving into the absurdity of the film's plot. Half the events defy the laws of physics and characters too-narrowly escape death, but that's the least of this movie's problems.One of my stars goes to the creative team that designed all these gadgets and vehicles and such. They're clever, they make sense (usually) and they're pretty cool on the whole. The problem is that the movie goes through them like a one-year-old with toys: Play with it for two minutes, throw it to the ground and go pick up that other new shiny thing. Hours of imagination go to waste here because we never get to savor the creativity. The CG work is pretty good on a small scale, but there are a lot of wide shots that look like bad TV effects shots like the desert and even the G.I. Joe base at times. I, as an average film-goer who only knows what green screen is, should not be able to tell when and when it's not used the way technology is today."G.I. Joe" is loud, obnoxious and unsympathetic. It's a new cool kid that walks onto the playground and says "I'm gonna be awesome" and does something like assume it's worthy of a sequel. I'm not spoiling anything here, after all, the film is called "The Rise of Cobra" and the Cobra doesn't rise until the end of the movie. The clunking giant is actually named like a prequel for goodness sake, and that pretentious attitude is offensive when you're not a particularly good movie.Action movies are like candy and in that metaphor "G.I. Joe" is like asking you to eat all your Halloween candy in one sitting. Candy is awesome, but not when you eat it all at once, don't appreciate each kind and then get sick.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Jonathan Glazer's "Under the Skin" can't be judged by it's  well  skin. Scarlett Johansson starring in a science-fiction film will lure unsuspecting men into watching this movie, pretty much exactly like Johansson's character lures unsuspecting men into her van and back to her "place." So the most important thing you can do going into "Under the Skin" is to temporarily forget all the conventions you expect from movies.Glazer's film is quiet, slow, brooding and, frankly, creepy. He demonstrates a large degree of patience as a filmmaker that will unnerve a lot of viewers. As such, the casting of Johansson is the lynchpin; she's the kind of actress you can watch reading the phonebook silently to herself. She brings the necessary curiosity to her other-worldly character tasked with using her sexuality to kidnap lonely men.At least that's what it seems like she's doing. Whereas most science-fiction films have to explain themselves through excessive dialogue (think Christopher Nolan's films, for example), Glazer and co-writer Walter Campbell, who based the film off of Michael Faber's 2000 novel, provide no context whatsoever. At least a little portion of everything that happens is left completely open to interpretation.It seems we are meant to view and experience the world the way Johansson's nameless character sees it. At first, she is very methodical about her task, lacking any empathy or any of the characteristics of the human form she wears. Eventually, however, her perspective appears to change and she veers off her path to explore what it's like to be human.Glazer creates a portrait of working-class Scotland that starkly contrasts with the (limited) science-fiction imagery. The atmosphere he creates for the film makes Scotland appear like another planet. Nature plays a small but ever-present role, and Glazer's unconventional approach, namely in holding still on a number of seemingly irrelevant shots, forces you to look at everything differently. It's part of where the creepiness settles in.Because so much of "Under the Skin" remains a total mystery throughout the entire film, it's not until after the credits roll that what Glazer set out to accomplish can be realized. At that point the film's themes and ideas can be looked at objectively without agonizing over what "information" or "truth" may or may not be revealed. Essentially, the film uniquely calls attention to what makes us human, specifically the relationship between our insides and our outsides.While the message is profound, it's not one that's clearly or easily heard, and the film's delivery is certainly not optimized for its entertainment value. There's something awe-inspiring to its beautiful and creepy yet poetic nature, but in reality, you can't substitute anything for being engaged and wrapped up in a story. Parts of "Under the Skin" definitely do, but not in a way that will resonate with a majority of audiences.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more
It's been awhile since we've seen a good cat-and-mouse thriller done old school, and that's exactly what "Public Enemies" is. Merely trade in your usual summer crime movie full of thieves in ski masks wielding uzis for ones wearing suits and fedoras armed with tommy guns and suddenly you're getting entertained Great Depression-style. "Public Enemies" is a neat crossover between the action-packed thrillers of today and the mob movies of yesterday, and one that comes to us well-armed with the talents of Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and a master of the thriller genre: director Michael Mann."Public Enemies" is about 80 percent action thriller, 20 percent biography of infamous '30s bank robber John Dillinger (Depp). It gives us a colorful character portrait of Dillinger as a care-free crook with a sense of humor, but its main goal is to give us a handful of flashy crackling gun fights. It's not an intimate or dramatic character study that makes us think twice about what it means to be America's most wanted; the intention is to develop Dillinger enough so that Depp can make him an intriguing personality for us to follow on this 140- minute "catch me if you can" adventure. So check your Oscar-caliber expectations at the theater entrance.Depp is a perfect fit as Dillinger, a man who lived in the moment, doing only as he wanted and hearing only what he wanted to hear, even when it was "you won't get away with this forever." He's a likable criminal type, not unlike a clean-shaven and articulate Jack Sparrow. Basically, he makes life hell for the Bureau of Investigation (it's his example that will later add the "F") and the chief detective on his case -- Melvin Purvis (Bale). He's the silly rabbit that keeps getting away, and Bale -- in a strong but unremarkable performance -- vows to hunt him down.This isn't unfamiliar territory for director/writer Mann, whose thriller "Heat" was basically a more sophisticated modern version of the cat-and-mouse story with two other stars on opposite ends of the fight (De Niro and Pacino). Like that film, "Public Enemies" has a lot of exciting and dramatic nighttime action scenes. The gunfight at the Wisconsin getaway with the guns lighting up the cold night air is most memorable. Mann more or less film this movie like someone who's been here before. His only weakness is overuse of hand-held camera shots. In a period piece, you'd expect a filming style that would be a little more classic, framing every shot perfectly, but Mann insists on this modern technique that does sort of shatter the bubble of being in the '30s in spots. There is definitely a sense at times that these are just modern people playing gangster dress-up -- it's not a flawless recreation of the era.I'm unaware of the historical truths surrounding Dillinger and his cronies "Pretty Boy" Floyd and "Baby Face" Nelson, or even if he had a relationship with a Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), but all their roles and the facts that may or may not accompany them are of little consequence to the enjoyment of the film for those who aren't crime history buffs. Billie is the best example of a character rendered ineffective because the movie cares little about her (despite Cotillard's talents). She's just there because every no-good gangster/mob guy has a girlfriend, which isn't great, but it's fine because it gives us another side of Dillinger and he's what is supposed to make the film stand out.Keep in mind that "Public Enemies" was released in July and not December and you should enjoy it -- it's an action thriller done '30s gangster style, not an Oscar-contending biographic crime drama. It wouldn't be unfair to expect a bit more character conflict or development for all characters and actors not named "John," but it's definitely appropriate summer movie fare.
Men playing women is far from unheard of in film and especially the theater, so why does "Tootsie" feel so original? Perhaps it's the fact that based on the plot, it's intended to be deceptive cross-dressing, or maybe it's simply because Dustin Hoffman is such a prominent male actor that it gave the concept a renewed intrigue. Either way, there's no doubt that "Tootsie" played a role in redefining character acting in movies.The film stars Hoffman as Michael Dorsey, an actor who has been out of work and according to his agent, played by the film's director Sydney Pollack, is impossible to work with. To prove everyone wrong, he takes on the guise of Dorothy Michaels and lands a part on a daytime soap opera. Not only does being a woman change Michael's perspective, but he also happens to fall for the show's leading lady (Jessica Lange).Hoffman truly steals this film. He's incredibly convincing as Dorothy while also nailing the ignorant, conceited fool that is Michael. While the script could better show how his dual life changes his perspective as a man, Hoffman makes the most out of it. His versatility is astounding. "Tootsie" also brags an impressive supporting cast that aside from Oscar- winning Lange includes Bill Murray as Michael's odd roommate, Charles Durning and Teri Garr.As a comedy, "Tootsie" is not exactly laugh-out-loud funny. There are some classic lines, but most of the jokes comes from the plot itself and how the events unfold. As a drama, it sort of acts as the first film to make feminism a central theme. The goal of the film in one sense is sort of to address feminism, or at least what at the time was sort of the growing movement among women to claim back their independence and womanhood. By creating a character who is a man both literally and figuratively walking in a woman's shoes and surrounding him with a couple women characters struggling with their independence, the writers have set up an interesting perspective for audiences to look at the differences between men and women. Seeing men hit on Dorothy not knowing she's a man is humorous but also eye-opening.On the comedy/drama spectrum, "Tootsie" might clearly belong on the comedy side, but neither aspect of the film is too extreme. It's a comedy that tries to reveal some of the most basic struggles that people in the working world deal with every day that often aren't at the center of attention in both our lives and on the silver screen.
After vampires, movie studios these days love the apocalypse (or at least an alien invasion that could bring it about), so it was a matter of time before we started to get different riffs on Armageddon. "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World" brings doomsday into romantic comedy territory and the resulting story has all kinds of notes, from humorous to romantic to downright dramatic.It's a mess of moods fitting of the apocalypse, even if we prefer our films to be more uniform in their genres. Lorene Scafaria (writer of "Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist") tries to stitch them all together in her directorial debut, and while the seams could be less apparent, "Seeking a Friend" makes solid patchwork of some strong individual scenes and performances.Who better to lead a film about literally hopeless romance than Steve Carell, whose character Dodge watches as his wife (a cameo by Carell's actual wife, Nancy) bolts from the car and runs away forever as soon as Earth's prognosis hits the radio. Thus begins Act I, the comedy portion of the film.Scafaria does a conscientious job imagining how affluent 40-somethings as well as other types would react knowing the world was set to end in three weeks time. Dodge tries initially to keep some sense of decorum by going to his job at an insurance company where the 10 remaining employees gather perfunctorily and the job of CFO is up for grabs. His cleaning lady continues to come and clean. His friends (among them a couple hilarious small roles from Rob Cordry and Patton Oswalt) try to keep up appearances, but boundaries of taste and fidelity have virtually faded. Dodge resists letting conventions dissolve into nothing, though he's far from optimistic. That's where Penny comes in.Penny (Keira Knightley) is a self-proclaimed serial monogamist and eternal optimist who's rather harsh on herself. She and Dodge have been neighbors, though only through recent have they come together. As it turns out, Penny has much of Dodge's misplaced mail, and when she returns it, he finds a letter from his high school sweetheart  the one that got away  expressing how she always felt he was the love of her life. When riots break out in the city overnight, Dodge decides to wake Penny up and flee town with her, and when they do, she encourages Dodge to try and track down his biggest regret.When the road trips starts, the comedy element of the film lingers, but the trajectory is romance and drama with some lighthearted moments interspersed. Scafaria at least spares us a cheesy build up as far as Dodge and Penny's chemistry, so the romance doesn't spoil everything with predictability. In fact, much of the film you're likely to root for Dodge finding his old flame just to see what happens.The comedy is quite brilliant when it's there, so it's a shame Scafaria abandons it. At the same time, the choice seems natural for a movie taking place right before Armageddon, especially one that's end game is definitely romance. Carell and Knightley need a chance to interact one-on-one in order for the whole thing to work.Both actors are excellent, with Knightley infusing some actual dramatic talent into the kind of movie you would never expect her to do with her period piece background. She and Carell get a wide range of moments to play with and they bring the heart and emotion to the film. It's tough to say if two random actors would've produced as believable a connection and chemistry.At the same time, for all their prowess, some scenes feel strangely out of place as far as tone. On at least two occasions, Penny begins to cry, and while Knightley really sells us on it (you honestly believe her in a scene in which she is finally able to phone home and talk to her family one last time), but the waterworks are squeezed in. I wouldn't doubt that this would happen in a real-life apocalyptic scenario, but in a movie it's awkward. It ultimately makes Penny's motivations (which should be very clear-cut with the world about to end) a little convoluted."Seeking a Friend" finds moments of utmost sincerity and wrestles with some intriguing notions such as whether or not our instincts for partnership would or would not be heightened in a doomsday scenario. As a whole, it offers film's most realistic look to date at how normal people would behave in this situation, yet as the romantic and dramatic elements build, some character motivations and feelings come into question, even though the actors are so convincing.Boiled down, "Seeking a Friend" offers a true change of pace for the genre led by two strong actors you'd never expect to work together. Maybe that's part of why it's tough to completely get on board with what's going on with the characters emotionally, though there's little doubt they elevate the material. And it's strong material too, but the entire package could have been neater.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site moviemusereviews.com
Dreamworks' "Madagascar" films have never been about trying to impress with lifelike animation, opting not to even compete with Pixar in that regard. Instead, they create very geometric, blocky characters that while uninspiring do echo the goofy and care-free nature of the films. "Madagascar 2: Escape 2 Africa" is an execution of fun. It relies on its clever, memorable creatures in order to compete against other animated films that constantly break animation barriers and tell inspiring stories. It's not state-of-the-art, but it's probably just as effective, at least as far as the profits are concerned."Madagascar 2" marks the return of Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman (lion, zebra, hippo and giraffe respectively) right where the first film left off (in Madagascar), although that's hardly important to understanding the movie. Knowing the first film only helps you get more quickly back into believing them. As these former escaped NYC zoo animals leave Madagascar, their inherently flawed plane crashes on an African tourist reserve stocked with animals like themselves, including Alex the lion's (Stiller) mother and father.The wit of these pampered city animals struggling in the wild continues as the characters learn lessons from their fellow animals. Marty (Rock), for example, meets a herd of zebras exactly identical to himself and he struggles with what makes him special. Family values, however, are still second fiddle to devious penguins swindling New Yorkers (who the writers slam on a lot) touring the plains and Nana, the dangerous old woman beats the stuffing out of people. It's all hijinx. Nothing is hysterical, but altogether it's quite amusing. It also never bores at 90 minutes long.The film is better than its predecessor, probably just because so little time is needed to reestablish the characters. The story picks up quickly and thrives off the characters that made the first one work. There's also a bit more to the story with the background characters being more than just lemurs. More of a full world is imagined in this one. It might not be a beautiful world, but it serves its purpose.
Let's be real, nobody actually wants to be 17 again, but it makes for decent comedy. "17 Again" borrows on that classic age reversal concept as made famous by "Big," "Freaky Friday," and "13 Going on 30" only it's aimed at guys. I know, hard to believe that's who would like this movie most, especially with "High School Musical" pretty boy Zac Efron in the leading role, but it's true.I don't know much about screenwriter Jason Filardi, but I'm betting the guy was like me in high school -- a dork. Maybe not a Grade A dork, but a dork no less. "17 Again" is littered with "Star Wars" and "Lord of the Rings" jokes as embodied in supporting character Ned ("Reno 911!" star Thomas Lennon), an unmarried black-card carrying nerd who sleeps in a landspeeder bed. I mean, somehow a lightsaber duel gets incorporated into this movie -- a lightsaber duel.You especially know a dork has written a movie when the main character was a talented jock who dated an attractive girl in high school. Mike O'Connell (Matthew Perry) gave up his future in high school to marry his pregnant girlfriend, now his wife with whom he's recently been separated (Leslie Mann). Without his sweetheart, being out of touch with his kids and after failing to land a critical job promotion, Mike starts to regret his life choices until a creepy old janitor at his old high school gives him a chance to do it over again.Now a teenager (Efron), Mike pretends to be his pal Ned's son and Ned uses his wealth to pull strings and enroll him back in high school where he forms a new connection with his two kids, his son Alex (Sterling Knight), the victim of jock pranks and his daughter Maggie (former teen star Michelle Trachtenberg), who's dating the school jock/bully/jerk (Hunter Parrish of "Weeds.") Eventually he starts seeing a lot of his wife, which makes for some awkward comedy. Mann delivers a great line reminiscent of her husband's (Judd Apatow) comedies as she explains to Efron that this is not some kind of cougar or "mother i'd like to" situation.The movie does lean a bit much on the comic device of Mike forgetting he's supposed to be acting like a teenager and not his kids' parent. There are one too many random righteous adult speeches. The gimmick works a few times, such as once instance when he lectures to some stereotypical girls who are saying suggestive things to him about respecting themselves only to give up and say "this is another father's problem." Other than that, we're reminded this is a re-treaded comedy concept.What's most likable is that the film understands it's built on convention. It doesn't try to break that formula, but it catches us off guard a few times by not carrying out any overused plot device completely by-the-book, which at least suggests that Filardi, director Burr Steers and producer Adam Shankman who's churned out a good number of successful formula-like films, were trying to go for quality. After seeing this film, "Hairspray" and "Bedtime Stories," I'd feel pretty good about going to see or at least renting any other Shankman-influenced film.And I'll even admit I was slightly impressed by Zac Efron.
Watching "How to Train Your Dragon" on DVD, I had my first (and what could well be my last) case of 3-D regret. Watching the young viking Hiccup soaring on the back of his new pal Toothless the dragon made me seriously wish I'd seen the film in theaters and yes, in 3D, a medium that I've stood soundly against with exception of "Avatar." Its absence, however, is evident in DreamWorks' breathtaking "Avatar"-similar story of dragons and vikings misunderstanding each other.Much like "Avatar," "Dragon" tells a classic story of rivals only between man and beast in this case, which hearkens to our mistreatment of animals, but that's a lesson for another day. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a sarcastic young viking who wants to be "cool" and demonstrate the strong and fearless viking traits, but he's scrawny and as a result isn't anything like his his dad, tribe leader Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler). When Hiccup captures the most elusive of all dragon breeds, he thinks his days as a loser viking are over, but when he finds his prey, he can't bring himself to slay the beast and ends up befriending it instead."Dragon" highlights how the misunderstood protagonist tends to be the most effective in animated/family films. As a "black sheep," we sympathize with the character and over the course of the film that grows to empathy, which strengthens when the character has a reversal of fortune. In this case, Hiccup's friendship with his dragon-friend Toothless, leads him to learn things about dragons that can tame them and uses these techniques during dragon training to appear to have outsmarted the beasts. Then comes the accidental event that causes Stoick to more or less disown his son and after that, you're fully invested in the story.The humor in "Dragon" is much more minimal than say, "Kung Fu Panda" and certainly "Shrek," but what it lacks in laughs it makes up for in truthful storytelling, terrific visuals and overall cuteness. Among writers/directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders' best decisions ranks the one to make the dragons a lot like dogs in their expressions and behavior (when they're not shooting flames at people). Toothless' concept design gives him the versatility of scary and super friendly and ultimately we learn to like him quickly.Conventions in storytelling only go so far, but when they're adorned in great visuals and given a unique context such as the viking world (as historically awkward as that is if you know anything about vikings), they seem fresh and more importantly, serve as effective entertainment. Although the heart of the story will be gone for the upcoming sequel just on the basis of how the movie ends, this creative team will no doubt find a way to get the job done.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"Trading Places" is a modern-day "Pygmalion": a couple old codgers make a bet on whether or not they can turn a homeless con artist from a petty thief to a proper wealthy businessman and the opposite to a prim and proper wealthy young gentleman. More than an opportunity for comedy, this social experiment premise offers genuine insight into class prejudice. So even if the film doesn't go entirely topsy-turvy, its poignancy -- an accomplishment so rare of the comedy genre -- warrants "Trading Places" a must-see of '80s comedy.Then-Saturday Night Live stars Dan Akyroyd and Eddie Murphy star as Louis Winthorpe and Billy Ray Valentine, respectively, as pawns in the wager of the Dukes, played by famous yesteryear actors Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche, two wealthy old commodities traders who are cheap, greedy and self-centered bigots. Winthorpe runs the Dukes' business, but when he has a run-in with Valentine, the old men see an opportunity and strip Winthorpe of everything from his job to his fiancée and they give it all to Valentine.Although the men making the bet are pretty terrible people judging mostly by their feelings about "N-words," the experiment is a timeless one: Is a man's moral fiber in his genetics, or is it merely a product of environmental circumstance that can be changed like a set of clothes? In the case of this film, can you take the man out of the ghetto and take the ghetto out of the man? Can a man of utmost principle be turned into a depraved lunatic? In the early 1980s, the new era of Civil Rights was barely 15 years old. Racial prejudice, economic prejudice -- these things were just beginning to improve, and even today they need work.No other film can boast two SNL stars and a social conscience, which makes "Trading Places" so special. Akyroyd is at his best as Winthorpe and Murphy gives one of his least eccentric (yet still humorous) performances. For opposite ends of the spectrum, they fit well together in this film. I've laughed harder at numerous more '80s comedies than this one, but the smarts that back up "Trading Spaces" keep it in the upper-echelon. But a story with the potential for a social statement needs a director who sees that ideas as being of utmost importance. Esteemed '80s comedy directory John Landis has this covered from the very beginning with shots of wealth, poverty and the city of Philadelphia where the film takes place all intermingled. The film is very subtly about these greater social issues, but it's definitely about them.~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.com
If you've ever wondered how cool it would be if a superhero movie was combined with an espionage thriller, "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" is a dream come true. It's as much "The Rogers Ultimatum" as it is an irresistibly cool blockbuster, and though a totally different film than the quality origin story of "Captain America: The First Avenger," it's an even better one.If you didn't think Marvel Studios' cinematic universe (now loving referred to by most as "the MCU") could get any more complicated, guess again. "Winter Soldier" turns the entire thing on its head, with major implications for future Marvel films as well as the Marvel TV show "Agents of SHIELD." Without spoiling anything, the premise is that there's some deception going on within the ranks of the Marvel world's most powerful organization.In response to the Chitauri invasion in "The Avengers," SHIELD has moved full speed ahead with Project Insight, a plan to launch of series of satellite-controlled helicarriers capable of instantly eliminating major threats anywhere in the world. This much power, however, doesn't gel with Captain America's beliefs, and he and SHIELD are a little at odds with each other.Keeping Captain America's second solo adventure conjoined with SHIELD's narrative and characters such as Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) gives this film more weight, as though it's a sequel to "The Avengers" as much as it's a sequel to "First Avenger." It makes sense too, as the context of Captain America (Chris Evans) finding his place and his role in a modern world necessitates SHIELD's involvement, as Cap is a "man out of time" with no public persona in the modern day. As much as the script dives head first into a thriller, it never loses sight of Rogers' personal journey, which is an impressive feat.Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who crafted "First Avenger," were handed this totally different concept and yet make it work so well on so many fronts. It's the best screenplay in terms of plot that Marvel Studios has put together in its brief but impressive six-year history.Behind the camera, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo prove Marvel Studios knows exactly how to scout directing talent, putting its faith in the directors of TV comedies "Community" and "Happy Endings" to make an action-packed, violent, high-stakes superhero film without a shred of doubt. The Russos' eye for stylish, wow-moment action shots exceeds their sense of humor to the point you'd hardly believe their own credentials. The film surprises constantly with how many ways an indestructible shield can be used as a weapon, and Anthony Mackie's Falcon puts other Marvel sidekicks to shame (looking at you, War Machine).Mackie makes an instantly likable addition to the cast, so much so it's almost a shame he didn't get his own headlining hero, such as Marvel's Black Panther. Something similar could be said for Frank Grillo as Rumlow. Robert Redford's added gravitas as SHIELD bigwig Alexander Pierce will still be a pleasant surprise even after the movie is over.The complexity of "Winter Soldier" is pretty astounding, especially because it works. Part of it is a sequel to "First Avenger," part of it is a SHIELD move, part of it is an "Avengers" follow-up, etc. "Winter Soldier" succeeds in all of those roles and in incorporating so many elements, from character development to big-time action to big twists and turns. That level of ambition generally results in generic praises of "highly entertaining" mixed with "messy" or "convoluted." This film blends them together with few visible seams."Winter Soldier" is probably a better film than "The Avengers," but the giddy factor of having all those main characters in one movie is hard to make up for under even the best of circumstances. A more worthy discussion for this movie is just how well the previous Marvel films set the tone for this one to do something bigger and bolder.We're familiar with the characters, with SHIELD, with the Marvel universe, so much so that Marvel Studios recognizes we already are bringing a lot to the viewing experience before the film ever begins, so it can bend the rules a bit. Courteously, it does not do so in an exclusive way. Even if you haven't seen "First Avenger," this film catches you up to speed; it's the additional layers of enjoyment for fans of different engagement levels that makes the franchise work so well. "Winter Soldier" would still be wildly entertaining without it, but it wouldn't fire so impressively on all its cylinders.If the film itself weren't enough, it leaves a distinct imprint on the rest of the MCU and makes the possibility of "Captain America 3" all the more exciting.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

Oliver Stone's had a string of busts lately, but "W." could be the reversal of the ambitious political filmmaker's fortunes. Rushing a biopic about a president into production to be released before its main character had even left office seems about as risky as "World Trade Center," but the end product is a surprisingly interesting character movie.Quickly on his way to stardom, Josh Brolin plays 43rd president George W. Bush, often looked at as the butt of an 8-year political joke full of "Bushisms" and the orchestrator of a "misunderestimated" military campaign in Iraq. Brolin nails the voice and mannerisms of the recent president, even playing him in his college years, but more notably he colors in the portrait of a man driven by convictions and a desire to make something of himself despite the emotional burden of having the old silver spoon in his mouth.Much like his interpretation of Bush's personality, Stone sticks to his gut and decides to tell just a few parts of Bush's story. He identifies the legacy of Bush's presidency (like it or not, the war in Iraq) and makes its conception in 2002-03 the main focus of the modern scenes in the film and then jumps off at several points back into only the essential snapshots of Bush's life leading up, with emphasis on his rocky relationship with his father, President George H.W. Bush (the sagely James Cromwell) whose expectations Jr. could never meet.What's factual and what's exaggerated, especially the extent of the communication issues between George Sr. and George Jr., is impossible to know, but Stone and longtime collaborator Stanley Weiser, who wrote the script, stick to it and it makes for a compelling subplot. As with many character pieces -- and often what keeps them from being good films -- no true plot line exists, but "W." still remains compelling as it asks you to draw conclusions about the president based on the trials of the man: daddy issues, alcoholism and his overall grotesque manner.Armed with a cabinet of huge stars as various iconic Bush Administration figures, "W." has an impressive cast: Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney, comedy actress Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush, Ellen Burstyn as Barbara Bush and an almost unrecognizable Thandie Newton who's terrific as Condaleeza Rice. Bruce McGill, Toby Jones and Scott Glenn also star. A filmmaker has to be really careful with such recognizable characters and Stone and his crew with these talents pull them off wonderfully."W." is not a politically biting film and maybe those interested in sharp political perspective will feel cheated, but better an interesting character study than two hours of Hardball vs. O'Reilly Factor going back and forth making sure that the film is unbiased or sticks to one side of the spectrum. The film features Bush's strengths as much as his weaknesses as president and leaves you with a sense of who he was and what he accomplished in his life and as president, even if it's still contentious.
Wish that today's romantic comedies full of superficial blabber and polluted ideas about love and sex would just -- shut up? Hold on to your ten dollars and rent the Charlie Chaplin classic "City Lights," a heart-warming romance and physical comedy -- where no one talks.It seems like the era and even the idea of the silent love story has been long gone and forgotten. Relationships and courtship are full of drama, selfish sexual desire and prejudices and attitudes about what's attractive. In a modern context, "City Lights" can be viewed as an hour and a half trip back to innocence.The already famous Chaplin returns to the screen in "Lights," his first silent film in the dawn of the "talkie" era. Chaplin once again plays the Tramp, this time befriending a suicidal drunken rich man and taking a fancy to a blind flower salesgirl. As a social commentary, Chaplin picks on the snootiness of the upper class and their fancy parties that only mask their unhappiness, as well as championing those who are not as wealthy but don't create social prejudice. But "Lights" is a love story at heart.Maybe it's only because he knows she won't judge him by his appearance that the Tramp is immediately infatuated with the blind flower seller, but his unblinking kindness toward her is just heart-warming. As he tries to find the money to pay for her rent, (leading to some hysterical scenes, namely a boxing fight) you know deep down that he'll never fully be repaid for his kind deeds. That is until the classic ending that could win even the coldest of fish over with its simple but perfect execution.There's plenty opportunity here for us to laugh at the Tramp too, but it's just not what you take away most from "City Lights.' You can name the classic comedy scenes without problem, but the impression does not follow them. It's the beautiful story of two seemingly nobodies who treat each other with unconditional kindness amidst a city of superficial and judgmental people that makes you stop and wonder. The fact that in all honesty we still search for that ideal today despite an even greater setting promoting the opposite, and that's what makes "City Lights" a classic. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
"Chocolat" sounds like a gooey foreign love story, but it's actually a fable with classic story archetypes and a hint of magic, all of which finishes pleasantly with a tender morsel -- err, moral.It's about as sophisticated as chocolate, which is not very sophisticated, so "Chocolat" is as easily digested as it is open to criticism for a lack of heady drama. Nominated for five Oscars, one would think it dwells in intellectual territory, but "Chocolat" comes from the heart -- and possibly the stomach. "The Cider House Rules" director Lasse Hallstrom sees these charms and wisely makes them the focal point of this likable film.Juliette Binoche stars as a mysterious but likable woman name Vianne who comes to a small, bland and morally rigid French town run by the Catholic church and opens a chocolate shop with her imaginative young daughter. We know only that "the wind brought her" to this town -- her past remains a mystery, which creates that slightly magical tall tale effect. Within the first fifteen minutes her shop is open for business and she's successfully predicting what each customer's favorite treat will be. Binoche exudes the charm the role requires but never sacrifices sophistication despite not having a clearly established back story.On the opposite end of the spectrum sits Alfred Molina as Comte de Reynaud, the moral authority figure who immediately sees Vianne's shop as an affront to his town and its Catholic principles. Cold on the outside but clearly soft on the inside, of all the Oscar nominations, somehow Molina's performance -- in my opinion the film's best -- was overlooked.Vianne's chocolate creates quite the stir, improving one couple's love life, inspiring a wife (Lena Olin) to leave her abusive husband and reuniting a old woman (Judi Dench) with her grandson. In a more serious film, this would all seem quite convenient and unlikely, but few viewers will fail to notice that chocolate is a metaphor here for something bigger. It embodies that blurred line between what is temptation and what is healthy possibility. That metaphor provides a strong moral fiber for "Chocolat" which turns out to be what makes it a fine film. It has a tendency to dull a bit in the middle and the entrance of Johnny Depp late into the run time despite his high billing confuses more than helps the story, but overall "Chocolat" is rich in its simplicity. When the young priest, Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor) delivers the closing words of the film at Easter Mass after appearing as a peculiar and weak character throughout, the story's message becomes abundantly clear and the intention and wisdom of the film shine through."Chocolat" could easily be construed as critical of organized religion, Catholicism in particular, but Pere Henri's speech beautifully connects the film's call for embracing life with Christian philosophy. It's a timeless message with timeless components, but the unique premise and setting make "Chcolat" a fresh tale of great wisdom.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
GOOD MORNING, Vietnam!Those are the words that open up DJ Adrian Cronauer's (Robin Williams) broadcast to all soldiers in southern Vietnam during the war, the beginning of a time block filled with hilarity and setting a humorous tone to a very harsh war. That's what the premise of the film by that title is all about, and how Cronauer's non-traditional radio and rock 'n roll music choice caused a stir on the Vietnam airwaves.Barry Levinson's film is humorous, but it attempts also to be very serious in addressing censorship and the fact that so much of the war's actual events were kept undisclosed from the soldiers. The comedy is the most successful part, simply because Robin Williams is a fast-talking runaway train of humor. While the rest of the film isn't as effective, it certainly makes an effort. "Good Morning, Vietnam" has a chance to take on more serious meaning, but it does so very casually and without true intent to be serious. After all, the genre listed is comedy, so that's what the film is.While some scenes, like the montage to "What A Wonderful World," present a harsh irony and really show the war for what it was versus how it was perceived, those scenes get lost in the not as serious jumble of scenes and other scenes that are more serious but not nearly as effective. The conflict with Cronauer and those telling him he's wrong is probably the more effective of the drama compared to commentary on the war."Good Morning" is still a film that should be watched. It accurately shows a time and place in world history while not being a traditional take on it. You can enjoy the humor and see the war for what it was and that's a good feat for a movie.
Like any average film, star power and great acting can help out a lot. George Clooney, Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson are unquestionably the reason for "Michael Clayton" catching viewer interest. Without them, "Clayton" is an overly complex and far from forward corruption thriller.Some credit, however, is due to director/writer Tony Gilroy, previously known for penning the Bourne movies. "Clayton" is told in a similarly calm, but suspenseful fashion. Gilroy is sure to show his characters in a variety of character-revealing situations, taking advantage of opportunities to juxtapose dialogue that doesn't necessitate images with images that don't necessitate dialogue. It keeps the spotlight on the actors (namely Swinton's character comes to mind) and keeps viewers' attention.Clooney stars as the title character, a law firm's "fixer" with a reputation for getting the job done. He gives a performance that is very him yet much more subtly so, which makes his bigger scenes towards the end more effective. Swinton plays the representative of the defendant in the film's case who is represented by Clayton's firm. She is a phenomenal nervous wreck of a character. Wilkinson plays a most intriguing role as the case's attorney who is manic depressive, insane and simultaneously genius. Wilkinson blends these colors to show these aspects incredibly well.Though certainly hard to follow, the talent keeps "Clayton" interesting and the plot delivers in the end. While some parts of the film seemed unaddressed, the overall idea comes together and makes sense.
In this his eighth feature film, Quentin Tarantino has made it very clear what he's all about. The auteur's hallmarks litter the frames of "Django Unchained," the closest he's come to making a film in the style of his favorite genre (arguably, but it's not really a contest)  the Spaghetti Western.Watching "Django," it's clear how comfortable Tarantino is behind the camera in this Southern-set Western environment and with the characters he has created/molded based on his many influences. It would be a surprise to learn that this film was anything but one of the easiest filmmaking experiences of his career from a creative standpoint. He's a master of genre filmmaking, of giving his audience exactly what it wants (and at this point his fans exactly what they expect), and "Django" is consequently a breeze to watch.Jamie Foxx plays the titular hero, a slave who in the film's opening is purchased somewhat violently by the German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). The two strike a deal that if Django helps him track down and secure the bounty of three men whom only he can identify, Schultz will not only give him a cut, but help him find and rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). In the process, Schultz trains Django to be a good shot and a quick draw.It's Schultz who dictates pace and tone of the first half of the film, however, not Django. Just as he did for Tarantino in "Inglourious Basterds," Waltz dominates every scene he's in during this first act, dancing loquacious circles around all the other actors and using his charm and wit to turn the tension and conflict into putty. He's not as impressive as he was in that Oscar- winning role, but that could easily be attributed to the fact that his character is a good guy, not malevolence in its purest form.Django as a character comes into his own in the final act of the film when all the cards are on the table, or as would be more appropriate to say in a Tarantino film, the you-know-what hits the fan. That's not even a semi-spoiler, by the way, because it's Tarantino's M.O.  you know not to panic if you're over two hours in and there hasn't been all that much bloodshed. Anyway, Foxx thrives when Django is finally "unchained," but he's written rather curiously until then. His motives are simple enough (love and vengeance) and being a former slave the sympathy card is in play from the first shot of the film, but he's not written to be the most likable of heroes. He's a quiet partner for much of the movie who begins to slowly speak up more, and the things he has to say are brash and frankly a bit cocky. It's clear he'd rather start shooting sooner than talk, which will make you antsy up until the trigger gets pulled, in both a good and bad way.Tarantino doesn't wield as much suspense in "Django" as in other films. The stakes were so much higher in "Basterds," for example, perhaps due to the wartime, undercover nature of the plot and the involvement of Nazis. This made his lengthy scenes and fluffy dialogue keep you even more on edge, which happens in Django but not with the same sense of urgency. Instead there's a lot of racial tension, and while that adds an interesting side commentary, it doesn't have any bearing on how the events will ultimately unfold."Django" is also much more predictable than Tarantino's pervious films, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. None of the turns of events will be shocking, especially if you've ever seen a Tarantino film before. A lack of surprises always lessens the impact of a film, but there's a certain comfort and pleasure in knowing what's around the corner, because the result is absolutely satisfying.The biggest wildcard of the bunch is Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie, the Mississippi plantation owner who Django and Schultz discover owns Broomhilda. Not appearing until late in the film, we don't get to spend much time getting to know his character, so when he flips a switch it comes with a significant impact on the tone and the flow of the film. Still, there's not enough depth there for Candie to be a true villain, just a colorful one. Samuel L. Jackson is terrific as his housekeeper, Stephen, as well, but his and Candie's character arcs are disappointingly short. While Django is always motivated by Broomhilda from the start, there's no antagonistic thread that runs from beginning to end to make the payoff more than just carnally satisfying.As a piece of entertainment, if you're a fan of genre films, straightforward revenge-based premises or Tarantino, "Django Unchained" is nothing to complain about. It's expertly filmed, cleverly written, gloriously violent, funny and wholly satisfying. As obvious as it is in its methods from time to time, it never loses its stylistic edge and never falters in the mechanics of good storytelling. Tarantino is capable of being more clever as a writer and more dynamic as a director, but he puts all his best skills to use in "Django" and it doesn't disappoint.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Sometimes timing is everything in the movie world. If "Logan's Run," which premiered in 1976, had come out a year later, there's no way anyone would've remembered it in the midst of the "Star Wars" pandemonium that broke out in '77. In fact, Michael Anderson's sci-fi dystopia could've used a George Lucas/Industrial Light and Magic touch.It's not that "Logan's Run" lacks for imagination, however, as it's a colorful, abstract vision and Anderson is unafraid to milk the effects and the production design, even if it means exposing how cheap they look.Based on the 1967 novel by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson, "Logan's Run" takes place in the 23rd Century when what's left of humanity lives in domed cities with pleasure and happiness being the sole focus of existence. Not a raw deal, except for the fact that everyone's killed off at age 30 in order to maintain equilibrium. This "catch" causes many almost-30-year-olds to try and run, and it's Logan 5's (Michael York) job as a Sandman to stop them when they do.This world is more visually fleshed out than it is through storytelling. Everyone dresses in loose-fitting clothes of either red, green or yellow to indicate their age range and silver amusement park-like trains transport people between locations. Sex is also an open part of society, but for censorship reasons that doesn't quite come across.This dystopia is the focus of the first half of the film, and consequently it's superior half. There's plenty of date special effects to laugh at, but everything's too imaginative to not get excited or fascinated by it. The renewal ceremony for 30-year-olds hoping to be selected for a longer life is one of the most bizarre and delightfully unnecessary spectacles ever committed to film.But all along we know that Logan is the seed that will disrupt the system, so this rich, weird world begins to fade once we have the context Anderson feels we need to continue with the story. Logan is very happy with his role as a Sandman, but after exterminating a runner carrying the Ankh symbol, he's asked to secretly investigate by posing undercover as a runner. When he realizes he's about to have some years taken away from him and might not get them back, he turns into an actual runner. He seeks out Jessica (Jenny Agutter), a green girl who he previously saw wearing an Ankh and together they try and find the necessary channels to escape. On their trail, however, is Francis 7 (Richard Jordan), Logan's friend and Sandman partner.Sadly, when Logan and Jessica finally escape to the outside, the movie gets remarkably dull and the script even worse. The city is somewhere near Washington D.C., as we see the Capitol, the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial all covered in vines. Writer David Zelag-Goodman then wastes our time giving Logan and Jessica lines in which they wonder what life was like here long ago on the outside, a social commentary that's anything but subtle (or necessary). Considering our curiosity is all about what goes on inside the dome, this second act disappoints.In it, we meet Peter Ustinov's character, an old man who has been living in the House of Representatives. He's the only old man these people have ever met, but he carries no secrets for us. He's vital to this world and the story, but we never feel it because we have trouble empathizing in this regard with our main characters.But "Logan's Run" is still gutsy, over-the-top sci fi that would make Flash Gordon shed a tear. There's so much here that you want the film to explore that it never does (I would extremely welcome the planned remake from Nicolas Winding Refn starring Ryan Gosling), but the point is that you at least think about it. "Logan's Run" will definitely expand your mind and satisfy the biggest fans of dystopian fiction.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
Perhaps Ben Affleck should stay in the director's chair. If I had been asked to guess if Affleck would make a good director, I probably wouldn't bet my money on it, but I certainly wasn't going to hold it against him upon viewing this film. Now having seen the delicacy with which he handles this film, I have to say that he has a pair of highly capable directing hands."Gone Baby Gone" is a top notch under-the-radar thriller and another successful film adaptation of a Dennis Lehane (Mystic River) novel. Affleck has essentially helped plant Lehane's solid seed and done nearly all the work required to let it blossom. This is not one of those arrogant, chin-in-the-air missing child investigative mysteries--it is genuine and honest nearly the entire time. Affleck really keeps his impressive cast of characters on the ground and they are all played by talented actors capable of doing just that.The story follows independent detective Patrick Kenzie, played by Affleck's younger brother Casey, who easily surpasses his brother's depth and range of acting talent. Basically, Kenzie and his girlfriend (Monaghan) are brought on to help investigate the case of a missing four- year-old girl and what Patrick finds along the way begins to test his character. Kenzie is a thick-accented hard-nosed Bostonian who gets a lot of flack for looking younger than his age but keeps his worth based on who he knows in Boston. Ironically, the role is true to life for the younger Affleck, whose success has been impeded by his youthful appearance. It's a shame, too. Casey keeps the serious, introspective tone of the film alive and prevents it from getting too ridiculous at the end when the film takes some overused twists and turns as the mystery is revealed.The supporting cast, particularly the always-talented Ed Harris and the missing girl's mother played by Amy Ryan (who we will surely be seeing more of), was also outstanding and helped push across the very human feel of the film, truly its greatest strength. It stays very theme- focused and some excellent dialogue keeps the intensity up. There is some high quality trash talking in the film (thanks to Ben, probably) and that plus some of the scenes in the beginning portray Kenzie in a way that does not make him seem any more powerful because he's the investigator--a trait not common of thrillers.The film really stays close to its themes and makes it very clear, but not in an overstated or cheesy way. That is avoided because Affleck the humanity and realism are established so early in the film. Just looking at the actors gives off a working-class vibe. The small role actors and extras were not chosen because they were easy on the eyes and that's commendable and integral to the vibe of the film. From a technical perspective, Ben focuses the camera on people and the Boston backdrop a bit too and people and places is what real life is at its most essential. He picks the right moments to show characters and grasp their emotions and what they're likely thinking."Gone" will likely exceed your expectations, especially for Ben Affleck, but it won't go above and beyond anything you've seen before--it's not one of those genre-transforming films. Affleck just takes the story and brings it to its full potential in a way that is thoughtful and entertaining and that's all we can ask for from a director.
Sometimes the most genius films are the ones that draw the most criticism. "Burn After Reading" may never reach the elite of IMDb top 250 and confuse and bother a lot of viewers, but if that's you, then you simply have yet to watch enough Coen brothers films to understand and appreciate the deep intelligence that this film possesses though it acts like it doesn't have.Famous in their comedies for creating over-the-top idiots who concoct schemes way over their heads, the Coen brothers have made no exceptions with "Burn After Reading." This time everyone's missing something, usually the common sense part of the brain, but the trouble is caused by two gym employees (Pitt and McDormand) who come across a CD with CIA code on it belonging to an ex-CIA analyst (Malkovich), thinking they can blackmail him and make money.Surrounding all that are other characters vital to the story: Malkovich's wife (Swinton) and her lover (Clooney) who is having multiple other affairs regularly in spite of his marriage. Much of the conflict and plot in this actually revolves around the shambled marriages of these couples and actually not on the CD, which of course is all part of the point.Like all Coen brothers films, including their award-winning "No Country For Old Men," when you sit back and think about this film everything seems to click. It's difficult to explain without revealing the plot, but the important thing to keep in mind when viewing this film is that it plays on our perceptions of movies being great mystery thrillers that you have to try and figure out. You also need to remember that it's supposed to be a comedy. The Coen brothers will do everything to trick you into thinking it's more than just a comedy, but it's not.Comedy is also not a word used lightly. This is easily the funniest Coen brothers film short of "The Big Lebowski" and what's even better is it has guys like Pitt and Clooney playing complete goofballs unlike their usual typecast. This is easily the most enjoyable part of the film. Actors like McDormand, Malkovich and JK Simmons continue to provide the Coen brothers more great talent for their gem of a script.The Coen brothers want you to take "Burn After Reading" seriously and will use all of Hollywood's standard smoke and mirrors to align this film with your mental framework about movies (suspenseful music, dramatic and thoughtful camera angles, etc.) but the ability to step back and understand the directors' intent here is the key to loving this film instead of liking or being completely confused by it. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Hayao Miyazaki and his company Studio Ghibli are known widely as masters of sophisticated and creative hand-drawn anime, supreme imagination and heartfelt stories. "My Neighbor Totoro" is one of the first Miyazaki classics, ranking high in heart and animation but slightly lower on the fantasy end in comparison to his later work.Like many of his films, "Totoro" is set in the country. A young girl and her little sister move to a new home in the countryside with their dad while their mom is sick in the hospital. They come to believe their new home is haunted when the younger sister, Mei, discovers a forest spirit named Totoro, a large round creature resembling a bear with pointy ears and whiskers with an affinity for napping inside large trees."Totoro" is certainly the most child-friendly of Miyazaki's classics. There is no force for evil with the plot revolving around simple family drama. Only our curiosity at the world of forest spirits that Miyazaki withholds from us for so long in this film drives us to watch the entire thing. Sadly, this world does not blossom with imagination anywhere near the way it does in Miyazaki's later films. Totoro himself represents a source of comfort. For all intents and purposes he is merely an imaginary friend, a way for the girls to escape from reality and forget about their ill mother. A huge plus on the emotional side of things for this film, but not much good when it comes to filling our fantasy quota.The characters are some of the strongest people Miyazaki has ever created. The relationship between the two sisters holds the truth and humanity of the story. Even their father, who actually encourages their imagination instead of the expected "parent who tells them things aren't real" character archetype. The Disney English dubbing of the film does a terrific job in casting young Dakota Fanning and her sister Elle for the voice parts of Satsuki and Mei. Somehow in spite of their age they understand that these girls require a voice quality that it is much different from typical American children, for example. As siblings, this certainly made the connection between their characters even stronger."Totoro" has its classic scenes such as the one when Totoro shows up at the bus stop and Satsuki gives him her umbrella and when Mei chases some forest sprites into the woods, but the fantasy stops there. It simply is not integral to this story. "Totoro" is more of a country fairytale, something much different that the Disney cannon or the Wester cannon of children's stories and animation. It aims to tell a story of childhood and family with a slightly fantastical element to it rather than a wildly imaginative fantasy with family roots.~Steven CCheck out my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Al Pacino as a veteran homicide detective, Robin Williams as a killer, Christopher Nolan of "Memento" behind the camera -- everything's in favor of "Insomnia," a remake of a Norwegian film from 1997. Strangely, the fact that the story doesn't have clever twists and doesn't play out as a noir mystery like it starts out as is the only thing between "Insomnia" and greatness.Will Dormer is easily the last good character Pacino has played. He's tired, harboring a multitude of dark secrets and he's good at his job. He's on his way from Los Angeles to Alaska with his partner Hap (Martin Donovan) to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. When they spring a trap on the killer, some thick fog and a mix-up results in Dormer accidentally shooting and killing Hap. Knowing this would be the end of him, Dormer claims it was the killer who shot Hap. The guilt in combination with 24-hour sunlight that far north leads to a number of sleepless nights. Then it really gets intense when the killer (Williams) contacts Dormer and threatens to expose his secret.The dynamic between a criminal and a cop who don't want to work together but must if either is to come out of this mess unscathed is what makes "Insomnia" unique. Pacino and Williams come from two totally different acting backgrounds, so their chemistry keeps the tension for much of the film, which is key when the "whodunit" interest factor gets thrown out the window rather quickly. The story becomes much more of a drama and the suspense comes from whether they can dupe the local police, especially the naive and tenacious young cop Ellie (Hilary Swank) who idolizes Dormer and his work. The sleep deprivation factor acts as Nolan's creativity license. The story sticks entirely with Frank's point of view, so a number of tactics are employed to create that sleepiness feeling without going so overboard as to drive the viewer crazy -- or to sleep. Objects go in and out of focus and there's obviously a huge lighting factor for cinematographer Wally Pfister to handle. Pacino's performance, however, ties it all together in this way. It would have been nice if the insomnia was less metaphoric and more relevant to the plot, but there's no use trying to turn the film into something it's not. As much as we want murder mystery or something more akin to Nolan's "Memento," "Insomnia" is not that kind of film. Despite no wicked left turns in the story, at times "Insomnia" is a bit tough to follow. A lot of what's motivating Dormer happened off camera before the time of the story, so some of that crucial information gets squeezed out. The tension and the acting really sell the rest of the film, so these end up minor deficiencies. "Insomnia" is one of those rare instances where the talent and the production values really elevate a film that might not otherwise warrant the any serious acclaim.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Often times a change of scenery can make a big difference. Independent filmmaking has become as inextricably tied to relationship and family drama over the years as it has to New York City, Los Angeles and generic Suburbia. So taking place in Hawaii gives "The Descendants a unique presence, not that Alexander Payne's outstanding film requires a tactical advantage. The venerated filmmaker simply understands how this setting, in all its tropical beauty and paradisiacal allure, has something important to say about this story of life's many blemishes.Matt King (George Clooney) is a lawyer and a descendant of Hawaiian royalty, as are his many cousins. A huge portion of land in Kauai has been passed down to all of them, land they ultimately must sell or give back to the state. They plan to take full advantage of their birthright and Matt is the trustee who must ultimately sign off on the sale. But Matt has been having a rough go of it lately: his wife, Elizabeth, has been in a coma for several weeks as a result of a boating accident and her prognosis grows grim. As such, he has become the primary caretaker of his 10-year-old daughter Scottie (Amara Miller). He also has a 17-year- old daughter named Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) at a rehabilitative boarding school on "the Big Island."Matt hopes he can weather the storm. He harbors some resentment with regards to being a "back-up parent" thrust into the starting lineup, but realizes his marriage had been growing cold and distant; he's gotten his wake-up call and he's ready to make things right. But when bad news from the doctor forces him to fetch Alexandra home from school, she reveals that the big fight she had with her mother before the accident was because she'd caught her having an affair.At first, Payne and Clooney paint Matt as a father with good intentions but really poor tact, but this news transforms him from a bit of a scrooge to a more pathetic individual, albeit one you have to feel a bit sorry for, especially given how his daughters, other relatives, and Alexandra's beach bum pal Sid (Nick Krause) behave around him. Although its not clear for a while whether Matt simply wants to stalk his wife's lover, confront him, get revenge or just find peace of mind, it's an undertaking you sympathize with given the waves of emotion experienced by the character.Clooney, in by far one of his very best performances if for nothing but the fact that he cannot lean on his charms, expertly embodies Matt's whirlwind. His portrayal fully demonstrates Matt as smart and rational yet emotionally feeble and sometimes volatile. As he throws on his boat shoes to run down the street and get answers from his wife's best friend and closest confidant, the awkwardness of it all comes out (most obviously in his bizarre gait). Even in life's toughest and craziest moments there's a darkly comic edge, and "The Descendants" hits on that in addition to the full range of other emotions. No doubt Payne's co-adaptors of Kaui Hart Hemmings' novel, little-known but highly recognizable character actors Nat Paxon ("Beerfest") and Jim Rash ("Community"), had a hand in the sharp wit.But the real brilliance of the writing shows in the characters. Almost every one gives us cause for dislike or even hatred at some point, but each of those characters goes through a redemptive process and surprises us. Whether it's the daughters being obnoxious, Sid not knowing his place or even Matt's father-in-law laying thick blame on Matt, somehow they all find their way into our good graces by the end, which isn't an easy feat to pull off. That's testament to how much sincerity and humanity Payne brings to the film."The Descendants" will hit close to home for many and everyone will connect somehow whether with a character or empathy for the conflict. The very nature of Elizabeth, a woman unfaithful to her husband yet in a coma and on the verge of death, challenges everything we know about right and wrong, good parenting and bad parenting  it will awaken a change in perspective and what matters most in every person who sees it. The rest of the film and its many subplots just magnifies this, to the point that when Matt finally comes face to face with his wife's inamorato, you might be surprised at how you want it all to go down.Seeping in the cracks throughout is the Hawaiian setting. There's something about the tropical backdrop that elicits different emotions, that helps keep things in perspective when the drama ratchets up several more notches. Even something as simple as every male in the film over 20 wearing Tommy Bahama and khaki shorts enhances the story and the film's message. The beautiful Polynesian acoustic soundtrack can also not be understated in bolstering this effect.Great films reveal to us truths we've always known  whether in our minds or deep in our hearts  in a way that makes us feel as if we're realizing them again for the first time. "The Descendants" provides that unique light, in this case with some beaches and a few leis. Payne might have taken a long time off after "Sideways," but he came back with something more palpable, universal and undeniably great.~Steven CVisit my site! http://moviemusereviews.com
There is no brighter gem in movies than a love story told right. That is "The Notebook." Romance is central to hundreds of thousands of films, but few are told as well as this film tells it. Between Nicholas Sparks' heart-wrenching story, director Nick Cassevetes' attention to setting and mood and the acting brilliance and universally good looks of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, a bigger emotional punch is hard to come by.The film is a period romance taking place in the late 1930s and 40s about a teenage couple that meet and fall in love over a summer. It is told to us by Duke (James Gardner) as he reads it from a notebook to an old woman. (Clearly there is a predictability to who these two characters are.) Noah (Gosling) and Allie (McAdams) are from two different backgrounds: Noah is a working class live by your means guy and Allie's parents are loaded. Despite their undeniably chemistry they split ways after the summer. Although their lives begin going in different directions, you can tell they're destined to come back into each other's lives.A good love story draws you in to the main relationship, connects to you emotionally some way. "The Notebook" does this in numerous ways. The first is just the attractiveness of Gosling and McAdams. They are beautiful human creatures and their chemistry is impeccable both physically and acting-wise. They also are believable, which the entire film hinges on. Next, they actually act like young people in love do. Anyone who has been in love will identify with their relationship: the constant affection, the silliness--even the fighting. It's incredibly honest and though the script isn't immaculate, all those other elements cover up the rough patches of dialog, which any cheesy romance never accomplishes.Cassevetes plays a crucial role with his beautiful filming. Working with French cinematographer Robert Fraisse, each scene has distinct colors, beginning with the rich red of the opening sequence that more or less tells you everything you need to know about the film without more than a line of dialog. The way the love scenes are lit and the way the outdoors scenes are full of life bring out the tenderness and the youthful energy of Noah and Allie's romance and their reconnection.Romance is about execution, finding a way to avoid clichés or create an emotional pull so strong that clichés seem to evaporate seconds after they happen. There is so much opportunity for this film to suck you into what's going on and caring about what happens that few people will not feel as if "The Notebook" achieves all of that.
It may have been a long time ago and in a galaxy far, far away, but "Star Wars" became an instant classic by feeling so close to home, so human, despite that. In all the intricacies of its universe that fans and not fans everywhere can indulge in to whatever level they choose, it's really the basic story, the longing for adventure and the never-ending quest to discover one's destiny that makes "Star Wars" more than just the first real intergalactic science fiction film.Of course it all starts with the science-fiction. We are captivated by the world that creator George Lucas begins forming around us as the film progresses and we are instantly curious about all the lore that surrounds it. From the origin of the mysterious Darth Vader, lord of the Galactic Empire, to the stories of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Clone Wars, there is so much we want to know about. In addition, the special effects, stylized space crafts, lavish costumes, and excessive rubber that make up for a galaxy's worth of creatures all expand our imagination beyond what we thought was possible.Most importantly, we see it all through the eyes of a naive, baby-faced farmboy named Luke Skywalker, a soon-to-be hero in the making, a boy ready to be whisked into a world that we all wish we could be whisked into. Luke is our access point to learning about this world that we are awed by but do not yet understand. It is his character and his journey that makes "Star Wars" universal, and not just in the intergalactic sense.Topping it all off is a score by John Williams that simply redefined the role of music in film. His various themes and variations help draw yet another bridge from the film to our emotions. Though what we see in "Star Wars" is foreign, what we hear is somewhat familiar and comforting in a way."A New Hope" is far from perfect, seeing as George Lucas can't write anything but plot-driven and emotionally bland dialogue, but the "Star Wars" universe and the colorful cast of characters he put in it is something so special that some of those generally elemental things can be excused for the sheer creative genius. While what truly makes "A New Hope" special are the films that follow it, the seeds of brilliance were planted and well-cared for.
If there's one thing that the Coen brothers do best with their latest project "No Country For Old Men," it's prove to Hollywood that good crime films don't necessitate flashy action with awesome stunts or insanely intricate mysteries. This is also, in a sense, what the film speaks to."No Country" (which takes place in 1980) is about a man (Josh Brolin) who appears to be a poor southerner living in a trailer that comes across a drug deal gone wrong. He finds and takes a briefcase with a couple million inside. Little does he know that a serial killer (Javier Bardem) is on his trail and the film tells the story of this pursuit. Also in the background yet central to the film's ideas is the story of an old, small-time sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones who is trying to follow their trail. The Coen brothers make every shot count in the way these two men go about getting what they want and it's very straightforward--no tricks--there is nothing up the brilliant script's sleeve. In other words, what you see is exactly what you get with "No Country" and naturally the Coen brothers don't feel obligated to explain. It makes the film difficult to truly understand and appreciate with just one viewing, but once you stop worrying about what the characters are going to do and start paying attention to how and why they're doing it, that's when "No Country" really stands out as a film that undoubtedly speaks to this time and likely all time to come.
Stories of American soldiers  their bravery in the field, their struggles to return to civilian life  have been well documented by Hollywood. The first thing to think about, therefore, is what makes each a necessary or unique story to tell. "American Sniper" tells of the life and years of service of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL sniper who killed more enemies than any soldier in U.S. military history during his four tours in Iraq.Kyle (Bradley Cooper) was a Texas cowboy who at the age of 25 felt he could be of value serving his country and became a Navy SEAL. While in Iraq, Kyle was primarily tasked with protecting ground units from threats they couldn't see, meaning many of the people he killed were in a position to take the lives of American soldiers. Before he finally finished serving, his reputation as a legend proceeded him.That, in essence, is what makes "American Sniper" different from other 21st century war films. The other elements of his story make him just another soldier: a man who was willing to put his life on the line for his country, left his wife (Sienna Miller) and two kids for months on end to do it and wrestled with the side effects of post-traumatic stress disorder when he was home and after he quit. The film soundly and movingly depicts the life of this consummate soldier, but it glosses over the story's defining characteristic  that its main character is both a beloved hero and an elite killer.As a blue-blooded patriot, Clint Eastwood is both the perfect and maybe even the wrong choice for this film. Eastwood certainly shows us why he's been a good director for so long, in some ways reminding us after his recent string of critical duds. Yet he (and admittedly screenwriter Jason Hall, who adapted Kyle's memoir) evades a certain level of depth when it comes to the themes and issues this story presents. The film doesn't ignore PTSD and the hurtful effects that military life can have on a family, nor does it silence the point of view that war, specifically Operation Iraqi Freedom, is inherently controversial, but it does limit their influence on the film's message.Hall's screenplay walks the line when it comes to opinions on war. Put a Southern, conservative, God-fearing patriot in the same theater as an urban, liberal, agnostic and one might tell you "American Sniper" is an amazing, truly American film that honors those who rid the world of evil to keep America safe, while the other might say it casts an uncomfortable shadow of doubt over war as it relates to American values. A third person might even tell you it's nothing short of propaganda. Although it doesn't pick sides on war, "American Sniper" does choose to portray Chris Kyle as a hero, and therein lies the controversy. Not that Kyle wasn't a brave and good person, but that he's a hero for his actions. On one hand, while working closely with Kyle, his friends and family, filmmakers do not want to create something that would in any way be disrespectful to them. On the other, certain aspects of his story are conspicuously under-developed, with the emphasis on the action and suspense of the military action he saw.To avoid delving too far into it, I'll simply say that never before has a movie's credits sequence informed its message to the extent that "American Sniper's" does. It honestly complicates the movie, what the takeaways are supposed to be, and highlights a lot of the gaps in the storytelling, primarily how what we see in the Iraq scenes translates into the "legend" of Chris Kyle at home. The script merely hopes that lots of characters telling Kyle how they've heard this and that about him will convey the truth of it to the audience. Nothing that we see truly confirms how incredible of a soldier Kyle was.To go back to the surface layers, "American Sniper" holds interest and suspense extremely well. Eastwood's technique doesn't compare with the way Kathryn Bigelow powerfully portrayed soldiers in the Middle East in "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," but the level of intensity in both the action sequences and in the way Kyle struggles at home exhibit excellent craftsmanship. And neither is it dumbed down  Hall creates some sharp dialogue and plenty of humanizing, touching moments. Cooper is probably the best thing about the movie. Sporting a legit Texas accent and bulking up to look almost exactly like Kyle, he definitely shows his versatility. Most of his previous roles have showcased charm or paranoia; here he plays a realistic, humble action hero of sorts. In the non-action scenes, he could colors the Texan stereotypes with a complex psychological portrait."American Sniper" captures the essence of the contemporary war story in a way that allows contrary opinions to coexist, but it doesn't answer the question, "why Chris Kyle?" His story is compelling, probably more compelling than most, but "American Sniper" doesn't feel like the story of "the deadliest sniper in U.S. history" so much as the story of "a dedicated, courageous soldier who happens to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history."~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Seven Samurai" should truly be regarded as a classic. Compared to what little I have seen that came out of the 1950s, the storytelling here is truly epic. However, unlike many classics, this film didn't hit me like I expected from one of the consistently most highly rated films of all time. While there is great camera-work, great characters and engaging action, the film lacks the intimacy that a three and a half hour film ought to have. To its credit, the film is not too slow except for the beginning at times, but to say this film has a wide and trans- generational appeal is a stretch.The premise alone is classic and clearly oft-repeated. A village of poor Japanese farmers go out to hire samurai to defend their village from bandits. The first portion of the film is finding the samurai and introducing the main characters, planning and training the villagers. Why exactly the samurai agree to help these farmers is the film's deepest question. It would have been nice if that question really hit harder than it did.Among the memorables in the cast are Takashi Shimura as Kambei, the first of the samurai and Toshiro Mifune as Kukichiyo, the wild and outspoken one who is technically not a samurai at all. Director and writer Akira Kurosawa has these characters well-developed in terms of their personality and demeanor, but not as much in the sense of the audience identifying strongly with them (except, and notably so, Kukichiyo). Kukichiyo is a stellar character. You find yourself at odds with him at times and beside him at others--he's very admirable. These two mentioned characters, however, are the strongest in the way they are part of the theme.Kurosawa certainly should not be shorted in credit as a great director. Every scene is very precisely planned and executed and tastefully so. The action sequences are also entertaining. While I hate to make a comment like this, the lack of blood (due likely to budget issues) hurt the film for me. It doesn't have the same effect on me to see someone get stabbed or shot and not really see that. Graphic violence in this film would have really helped me to feel the impact of the situation and the true nature of the life-or-death scenario the villagers were put in. Their unruly behavior was helpful to that end, but it just didn't strike a chord. Still, the film raises some great questions, namely the aforementioned simply put question of "why?" Each samurai seems to have his own reason for wanting to defend a village that has nothing to offer him. The issues of class and moral conflict of selfishness vs. selflessness really do show in the film, just not pervasively. Everything was there in this film, just not the lasting emotional impacting, that resonating feeling a film like this ought to have. Perhaps that was due to length, though I think that only played a minimal role. I can't disagree with the majority that absolutely loves this film, but personally I didn't feel it. Maybe you will.
As I left "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," a woman probably in her 40s or 50s exclaimed into her cell phone how it was the worst movie she's ever seen. I rather liked it, though I'm definitely 20-30 years younger than she. That kind of split is evident of only a few films in cinema history: those that are radical and progressive. "Scott Pilgrim" is both."Scott Pilgrim," based on the comics by Bryan Lee O'Malley, marks the third major feature for director and co-writer Edgar Wright, whose "Shaun of the Dead" and "Hot Fuzz" practically turned the definition of the word "genre" on its head. "Scott Pilgrim" is five times as ambitious, a psychedelic montage of hyper-pop culture, fusing together romance, three decades of video games, fantasy and alternative rock. Are Wright and Universal crazy or dead-on?Our titular character, played by this generation's arguable embodiment in an actor, Michael Cera, is 22, lives in Toronto and plays bass in a band called Sex Bob-omb. He lives in his gay friend Wallace's (Kieran Culkin) apartment and doesn't pay rent and is easily smitten by ladyfolk. After dating a high schooler named Knives Chau for a little while, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) comes into his life. His desperate attempts to win her affections work, but she comes with baggage: seven evil ex-boyfriends (and yes, one girlfriend) who possess various powers and have formed a legion bent on killing him. He must defeat them all.Welcome to the cutting-edge of contemporary entertainment. You can call the current youth the "A.D.D. generation" and it might well be justified, but "Scott Pilgrim's" flashy style-heavy approach isn't to compensate for young people's warped attention spans, but to embrace new forms of entertainment made possible by today's multitude of stimulation.The film is foremost an homage to video game culture. If you love video games, "Scott Pilgrim" piles on the references from fighting games such as Tekken to bits from the Zelda games soundtrack. Scott's pick-up line to Ramona is about the origin of the name Pac-man. Wright's style draws on classic gaming imagery like low-bit CGI, comic book illustration, anime and more. Someone younger will gel with that, but someone older might find it total overload. If our normal, hum-drum lives took place in a world with video game or comic book rules, it would look like this for sure.Fueling it all is a wild imagination: at one point Ramona pulls a giant Donkey Kong-sized sledgehammer out of her purse, echoing countless fantasy games where characters carry around weapons but you never see it on their person during gameplay until it's being used. One scene even spoofs Seinfeld and other notable sitcoms, when Scott comes back to his apartment and a laugh track accompanies his interplay with Wallace. The scene ends and no more sitcom references. That's how quickly scenes come and go. The transitions are abrupt, with scenes going from one place to another sometimes in seconds. There are no drawn-out dramatic conversations, just bursts and vital snippets with occasional graphics and unique style shots.The style over substance argument reaches an interesting crossroads with "Scott Pilgrim." Although immensely fun and filled with wry humor and defied expectations, those who look for purpose in all the pop-up graphics and visual shenanigans will have trouble seeing the point in all this. There are times when the love triangle story between Scott, Ramona and Knives becomes lost in the video-game narrative of defeating the evil exes. "Scott Pilgrim" is a very good film not because it beautifully ties substance with schmaltz, but because it entertains in a fun, impressive and completely unique fashion.This is easily the first film to recognize the effect of cross-media: how images, special effects and music all converge for our entertainment. For younger audiences, these multiple media are part of daily life. Sound and imagery are synonymous, whereas the film and music industries were miles apart decades ago. This has nothing to do with age, but young people can process so much more at once, which makes "Scott Pilgrim's" appeal fresh and new.Those who prefer the cake over the icing will only be able to enjoy "Scott Pilgrim" to a point. But we're talking ground-breaking rainbow-colored frosting with sprinkles. No words can describe the kind of entertainment the film offers because it's just that new and fresh. All the way down to the film's openness with homo (and bi) sexuality as embodied by Culkin's excellent portrayal as Wallace, the movie is progressive and unconventional. There's certainly room to go up from here in terms of quality, but for now, the novelty of "Scott Pilgrim" and how in-tune it is with contemporary society warrants it much praise, even if it's not for everyone.~Steven C
Comic book writer Harvey Pekar would probably be the first to tell you that he only agreed to a movie about himself for the money. He denounces all things glamorous or idealistic and a moving biopic about his life would contradict him entirely. That's why Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini's choice to do an off-center biopic on Pekar in a quasi-documentary style is such a phenomenal direction for their film."American Splendor" features both Pekar himself doing a few on-the-set interviews and voice over narration as well as Paul Giamatti playing out key scenes in his life from befriending fellow artist Robert Crumb to meeting his wife Joyce (Hope Davis) to his odd string of appearances on David Letterman. It's not totally committed to one style over another which is its greatest strength and a bit of a weakness. Although it's so interesting to be able to compare the acting to the real people, at times it's distracting and breaks the illusion. For example, the real Pekar and his semi-autistic pal Toby chat on the movie's set while both actors playing them (Giamatti and Judah Friedlander) take five in the background.Rarely -- and certainly not this extensively -- does a film open itself up to scrutiny like "American Splendor" by allowing the audience to see both reality and its own fiction. Giamatti's performance becomes critically vulnerable with the real Pekar getting almost as much time on screen as he has, though he does do a good job juggling Pekar's many quirks from his dying voice to his tendency to add "man" to the end of every statement."American Splendor" also offers a few other unique directorial choices and sequences such as comic frames in the beginning to replicate comic books and including animated Harveys and thought bubbles into live action. These are generally effective, but they lack continuity. Each scene where traditional cinema is broken get its own treatment; the shift from biopic to documentary is the only constant.Consequently, we've never gotten acquainted with the focal character of another biographical film like we get to know Harvey Pekar. I think anyone who watches the film and happens to meet Harvey afterward would feel like they'd known him for years. Part of it is his natural, quirky predictability, but the other is Berman and Pulcini's decision to give us a healthy dose of the man himself.Much like his American Splendor comics, the story of Harvey Pekar isn't extraordinary or fascinating but down to earth. Pekar didn't want to be anything but ordinary and he just happened to really like the underground comic scene. The film honors that wish by being the same way, so taking the title of the comics and using it for the movie is more than fitting. It had to be a challenge to adapt someone's autobiographical comic and make a biographical documentary about the person who wrote said comic about himself, but Berman and Pulcini make it work and in a highly original and inspiring way. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
"Hot Fuzz" seems to get most of its fame from being the follow-up to "Shaun of the Dead" by director Edgar Wright and actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, but the truth is that this film is better and it stands alone as a great dark, action comedy without "Shaun."The first reason "Fuzz" is better than "Shaun" is because it's more accessible. Some people have stigma's against zombie movies and "Shaun" was sort of stuck playing off the characteristics of zombie movies. "Fuzz" is a small-town murder mystery wrapped in a horror film wrapped in a comedy. Sometimes all that makes it hard to take seriously, but when you embrace that it's all for comedic effect and stop caring so much about plot, it's all the more enjoyable.The film's main character is Nicholas Angel (Pegg), a top cop in London who suddenly gets transferred to the small rural town of Sanford because his diligence makes all the other P.Os look bad. Of course in Sanford, the citizens talk of "the greater good" and don't care much about proper law enforcement provided everyone's happy. Of course when "accidents" start happening resulting in people's deaths, all that begins to change.It doesn't sound exactly like a comedy on premise, but the clash of Pegg's big city super-cop personality and that of the ignorant Stanford citizens is a starting point for all of it. There is an onslaught of bizarre characters in the town who play up their small-town innocent mentality by making jokes, insulting each other or acting plain weird. This is where the skills of a supporting cast with Jim Broadbent and Timothy Dalton come in. Capped off by the humorously naive performance by Nick Frost as Butterfield, sort of Angel's assistant, there is plenty to laugh at whether it's the female officer's sexual explicit jokes to her all-male department, the "Andys" two foul-mouthed detectives, or the variety of slurring characters that only the townies can understand.All this time, "Hot Fuzz" builds toward an action movie spoof resulting in one of the more satisfying end sequences in any film, especially comedy. Usually comedies end in cheese as the writers tie up the more human elements of the story, but "Hot Fuzz" blossoms into the stylish action flick it wants so desperately to be given by the amount of "Bad Boys II" and "Break Point" references. Wright definitely has an eye for action and you could predict this based on his overuse of fast close-up jump cut sequences. This gives the end as much style points as it deserves spoof points.There really is some brilliance to the writing--all loose ends of the mystery are tied up and nearly all the jokes that are made in the film come back for another round of laughs in the end. You simply don't see comedies do that well anymore. So while it may come off initially as sort of gross, over-the-top, violent humor, it concludes on a satisfyingly witty note.
After a four-year hiatus to regroup and determine the future of the franchise, Disney and what was once its surprise mega-hit "Pirates of the Caribbean" series have returned in "On Stranger Tides." Hard to believe that this franchise evolved from the once-lambasted concept of a theme park ride being turned into a successful motion-picture blockbuster. After exhausting the "Pirates" world with two back-to-back sequels of titanic and rather disappointing proportion in 2006 and 2007, a break in the action to recalibrate Captain Jack Sparrow's compass was much-needed. The "new" course set by "On Stranger Tides" uses worn sails, but with a fresh wind of characters and more importantly, a more direct purpose.As promised in the end of "At World's End," Jack's looking for the Fountain of Youth if for nothing more than ships and giggles. First, however, he must take a side trip to London to rescue his old pal Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and subsequently the palace of King George (Richard Griffiths in a lovely cameo). There, he learns that his old pal Barbossa (Rush) has lost The Black Pearl as well as his leg and sold out to His Majesty's Royal Navy. He is to help the English find the Fountain before the Spaniards do. Jack, of course, knows the way there, thus continuing his ongoing role as an indispensable pestilence.After a familiar improvised escape, he crosses paths with an old lover, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), who he once deflowered before she was to take her vows at a convent. She mentions she has a ship he can borrow, only it turns out that it's her father's ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by none other than Blackbeard the Pirate (Ian McShane), a feared and soulless scourge with a minor in black magic. So much for smooth sailing.As overdone and cliché as the Fountain of Youth may be, it's perfect for the "Pirates" franchise and helps keep things very simple, something the last installment had more than a fair deal of trouble with. Only a few character subplots threaten to convolute the story, but all motivations lead to the Fountain regardless the reason. In fact, "On Stranger Tides" marks the first film to truly focus on Captain Jack. With Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters out of the way, the franchise can keep the spotlight on the reason it's gotten four films deep. Depp has nothing new in store for us as the true center of attention, but by continuing to underplay the trademark quirks and mannerisms, he continues to prolong the deterioration of the Capt. Jack act. Some might disagree, but it depends how much you liked him the first place.In terms of new faces, Ian McShane is impeccable as Blackbeard. Rush gave a wonderfully theatrical performance as the main villain in the first film, but McShane introduces the first true quantifiable force of evil the franchise has seen. Although his voodoo abilities and reputation for killing his men and bringing them back from the dead to serve as his zombie slaves are never entirely realized, he's the merciless villain this film needed. He never fully crosses into scare-your-children evil, but he could've at any instant and that feeling radiates from his performance. In general, this film aligns itself more with fantasy and traditional folklore than the supernatural like the previous film.Among other new faces, Rob Marshall as the franchise's new director does serviceable work. The "Chicago" filmmaker chews the scenery well and creates effective moods and tones, but the action could have been a bit more inspired, especially considering the series' reputation for sword-fighting ingenuity.Marshall's best work and the film's best sequence deals with mermaids, not the singing and seashell bra type, but seduce you with their looks and then try and devour you with fangs type. Quiet, suspenseful and culminating in a full-on action sequence, the mermaids constitute the one completely fresh element of the film. Their cove is the lone stop on the journey as well, so it's the only aspect of the plot that creates that classic seafaring adventure feeling akin to Homer's "The Odyssey."Not much else deviates from the formula, so those hoping for a resurgence in the series or something as good as the first film, "The Curse of the Black Pearl," will remain wishful thinkers once again. It's hard to imagine where the series could go next without retreading over old ground or just introducing new characters for the sake of it, but Captain Jack Sparrow remains one of the few reliable comforts of blockbuster cinema, and any adventure with him at the wheel will struggle to be a total waste of time. "On Stranger Tides" makes just enough adjustments to the series to make for a successful installment.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Even when John Hughes makes a mediocre film such as "Weird Science," the nature of his intent still shines through, to the point where you can't necessarily fault him for anything except not making a better one. "Weird Science" serves as the ultimate 1980s high school nerd fantasy, one in which babes see social awkwardness as a turn-on and bullies and extortionist older brothers help themselves to large servings of humble pie. The movie truly doesn't need to be anything more, even in spite of the shallowness of its characters and general disregard for logic.Anthony Michael Hall (in his fourth Hughes film in three years) and Ilan Mitchell-Smith star as two losers who determine that if they can't get girls the "old-fashioned" way that they can use their computer smarts to play Frankenstein and create the ideal woman. After some illegal hacking they pack her with a high IQ (and an appropriate breast size) then hook a doll up to a machine. One crazy storm inside their house later and suddenly there's Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), who's every bit as stunning with a type A personality as a nerd could possibly imagine or desire.The story then goes the unexpected route. Lisa, equipped with mad street smarts and magic powers, literally takes over the driver's seat and the young Gary and Wyatt for a wild ride. After helping them loosen up a bit, she determines they need a few tests to find the courage they need to stand up to bullies and go after the girl.Hughes determines that Lisa needs no rhyme or reason other than causing an appropriate amount of mischief so the boys can learn a valuable thing or two. She's the fairy godmother of this fantasy; it's one thing to stand up to your parents, for example, and tell them you're going to a party, and it's another to have a hot model do it for you (and cause your father to forget who you are). Hughes basically sticks it to everyone who made his life crappy during his teens, though to be fair, he recognizes the nerd's shortcomings and doesn't paint them as heroes. Hughes has always played things close to the chest, filming most of his movies in the Chicago suburbs where he grew up, even naming the high school in "Weird Science" after the main road where his actual high school was. In this film he has absolute loony fun with his usual tropes, going as far as turning Bill Paxton, who plays Wyatt's militaristic older brother Chet, into a steaming pile of crap that looks like Jabba the Hut.Fans of the more romantic side of Hughes, who love his candid nature toward portraying high schoolers, might find "Weird Science" to be the wild mutt of the family with its irreverence, and high level of silliness. It could be considered the "cult favorite" of the Hughes collection and that's fine. It definitely caters to those who can relate to being a socially outcast teenage boy and not too many others, but by no means is it a slip-up for the coming-of-age master. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Personal and human interests butt heads in "Three Kings," a Gulf War action flick from David O. Russell. Following the Gulf War cease-fire four soldiers (Clooney, Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Jonze) plan to take gold stolen by Saddam Hussein during the invasion of Kuwait so they can live well for the rest of their lives. What seems like a simple operation turns life-threatening when the soldiers run into a group of Iraqi refugees in desperate need of their help.If "Three Kings" hadn't been released years before George W. Bush and the Iraq War, it would've made a heck of a propaganda film. Much of the movie's inner-conflict is created because of the discord between the greedy self-interests of the soldiers and their difficulty simply turning their backs on Iraqi refugees who would surely be killed by Saddam's soldiers without them. The film calls on the humanitarian responsibility of countries such as the United States. In 1999 that's just a thematic message, but in the context of 2003 or later, it would definitely come across as political.But politics aside, Russell's film is a very real one. "Three Kings" is more than just good suspense and a decent amount of thrilling explosions for this reason; it offers important moral questions and portrays soldiers as more than just men trained to "kill (insert any number of derogatory nicknames for Muslims here)." The characters are flawed men governed by self-interest, but they are challenged and tested throughout the film as we all are at times, just not within the context of danger and war.Clooney, Wahlberg and Ice Cube all convey the inner tension fairly well, although the film still thrives mostly upon action and suspense rather than dramatic performances. Russell does make some excessive or bizarre choices, such as a C.S.I-like graphic of one of the character's insides -- guts and all -- after he sustains a bullet wound, but Russell mostly exercises good taste."Three Kings" is an effective morality tale set in a modern war context and fitted with gunshots and explosions. It's solid film with something good to say.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
There's not a lot of mystery in romantic comedies, aside from perhaps "who's the baby daddy?" which is coincidentally not too far off from the hook Adam Brooks uses in his film "Definitely, Maybe."There's a comfort in the romantic comedy formula, in the predictable end of a tried romance. We derive a bit of pleasure as a romance plot drags us along the string of "will they or won't they?" even though we know in our hearts what will happen (because if it doesn't happen, our hearts will be broken and the movie will get bad-mouthed)."Definitely, Maybe" does as good a job of any rom-com at doing just that. We are sucked into the story with a premise nearly identical to CBS sitcom "How I Met Your Mother," in which young Maya (Abigail Breslin) presses her father, Will, (Ryan Reynolds) into telling the story of how he met her mom. Seeing as the couple is a pair of signatures away from a divorce, he's not thrilled at the prospect of reliving those moments, but for our entertainment, he indulges.The catch, of course, is that the story involves multiple women, and Maya must guess which one turns out to be her mother. Thus begins a long story that begins in 1992, when young(er) Will sets out for New York City to work on the Clinton campaign and leaves his serious girlfriend, whom he refers to as Emily (Elizabeth Banks), behind.The '90s American history backdrop definitely gives the film its own flavor. Brooks eventually tries to draw an analogy to the former president, but it's half-hearted. Nonetheless, Brooks uses the opportunity to take an amusing jab at President George W. Bush among other humorous moments of hindsight and it's a welcome aspect of the story.On the job he meets the copy girl (Isla Fisher), April, one of the mother candidates. She's into rock music and edgier guys, and despite an attraction, things never seem to fall into place for them.Then there's the woman referred to as Summer (Rachel Weisz), a sophisticated and confident aspiring journalist Will becomes particularly passionate about and eventually starts dating.So will it be Bachelorette No. 1, 2 or 3? Brooks definitely spent some time crafting this story to constantly bounce back and forth between the women as Will encounters them at multiple points in his life, constantly casting doubt over each one. The three actresses are stellar as well, so it really helps that even if you pick side, you kind of like all the characters for different reasons.Reynolds holds up well as a romantic lead. He's a rather passive participant in his own love life, which is a bit frustrating but endearing. You genuinely root for his happiness despite fully understanding just why his love life has been so flawed. The impact it has on Maya is also sweet in all its obvious nature. She becomes as engrossed in the story as we do, though with a child-like innocence. Eventually she realizes that love really is as complicated as they say.The riddle doesn't last nearly as long as it could, but for a romantic comedy it lasts longer than most. At some point the characters have been so fleshed out and certain details put in play that you can start to put the pieces together and figure out exactly how it will end. To Brooks' credit, however, he made what will be seen as a popular choice."Definitely, Maybe" hits all over the rom-com spectrum if the left end represents fabrication and tons of cheese and the right is honesty, realism and poignancy. There's a rather cloying scene in which Will and April hang out on April's birthday after her boyfriend ditches her for a gig and the tension is forced and painful, but there are also some extremely normal relationship dynamics at play in Will and Summer's relationship.The film does the balancing act of fantasy and reality quite well. If all rom-coms were brutally honest, we wouldn't see many of them if any off the indie circuit. "Definitely, Maybe" is pretty much mostly sincere, however, and it's mystery hook  though contrived  is sorta certainly the key to making it all work.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Vampires have been hands down the most popular subject of "monster" related films and books for centuries, their popularity going as far back as the early 1700s though their origin much, much earlier. "Blade" is what happens when classic vampire lore meets 90s action movies, a fusion of stylized action and vampire myths. Yes, Blade--the vampire hunter-- carries a shotgun that fires off silver stakes. While stylized action and certainly vampires are nothing new, together they pack an highly entertaining punch.The Blade universe is a modern one where vampires live among men, turning them to vampires only at a rate that is enough to ensure their survival. But one of these turned vampires, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), wants more for the vampire race and studying an ancient vampire bible, learns of a way he can awaken a blood god that would turn the world population into vampires. Standing in his way is Blade, (Wesley Snipes) a vampire-hunter who is born a sort of half-vampire (his mother was bitten during pregnancy) and possesses all their skills with none of their weaknesses. Hating the creature buried inside him, Blade is motivated to kill them, straight up.Blade is one of those mysterious, dark, cold and emotionless protagonists. That makes Wesley Snipes perfect for the role. It helps to have not so good actors in these stoic roles because they play them better than anyone else (take Keanu Reeves in "The Matrix" for example). While Blade of course is forced to get in touch with his emotions in the film, this of course is not of our concern. What is of our concern is that Snipes kick a lot of ass and look cool doing it, which he certainly does. Sometimes quite humorously, which is always a plus of stylized action. The only other performance worthy of mention is Kris Kristofferson who is typecast as the grumpy old human vampire hunter who makes all the gadgets and would rather shoot himself than become a vampire.Stephen Norrington (whose biggest credits include creature effects work for James Cameron's "Alien") brings Blade's world to life. Norrington brings you everything you could want in a vampire action movie, even if you don't know what that is yet. It's sleek, cool, very bloody and moves at a strong pace. For one thing, "Blade" doesn't get dull. David S. Goyer, who wrote the script based on the relatively unknown Marvel Comics character, gives you exactly what you expect from an action script without going overboard on the one-liners. The intrigue of the vampire lore he's created is enough to help you get by the few annoying parts that come up in addition to the unnecessary swearing that was likely included solely because the action would guarantee an R rating anyway."Blade" is not a consummate action hero movie, certainly not by 21st century standards the way the market for these films has exploded and produced some incredible films, but it's fast-paced, entertaining and full of goodies for people who like action and vampire mythology. The special effects are strong for 1998 capabilities too, which doesn't hurt. Basically, it's enough to emerge a winner despite some bad acting and its predictable action hero plot and script. Not even just a winner, but some of that predictability still scores big points even if it's familiar because the movie is very cool.
Robert Rodriguez wowed all kinds of moviegoers in 2005 when he brought Frank Miller's "Sin City" to life with a unique visual flair that honored the graphic novels. For years, moviegoers clamored to return to Basin City, and nearly a decade later, finally got their wish. It seems, however, that nine years is too late  Rodriguez has reduced this once promising franchise to the mindless pulp of his "Machete" films and other recent efforts, while still trying to make a worthy sequel to the original hit that never quite connects.Like the original movie, "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" interweaves a few disparate but connected plot lines into one film: a talented gambler named Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) pushes his luck against Sin City's powerful Senator Roark (Powers Boothe); Dwight (Josh Brolin in the role originated by Clive Owen) gets entangled in the schemes of an old flame (Eva Green); and all the while dancer Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) plots her revenge for the death of her beloved Hartigan (Bruce Willis) and Marv (Mickey Rourke) looks for bad dudes to mess up.The cohesion is really lacking in "A Dame to Kill For," with no seemingly core narrative or logical stopping and starting place for each vignette. It would have been different if each little scene was totally captivating, but the tension isn't there. The magnetism of the writing, the stuff of great pulp fiction that made the original "Sin City" what it was, is inexplicably absent. It's just vapid noir styling.Perhaps the core of the issue is a lack of a main character. The film opens on Marv, the definite fan favorite, with Nancy floating in and out of various scenes at the saloon throughout the film. Gordon-Levitt's Johnny is easy to love but disappears for a huge portion of the film and Dwight's subplot has the most intrigue but he might be the least likable. It's a total hodgepodge. Even stylistically, "A Dame to Kill For" loses its edge. Rodriguez abandons any notion of subtlety. Every scene has some piece of color, completely deluding the artistic significance of using it in the first place. The violence also jumps between gruesome, bone-breaking physicality and purely unbelievable cartoonish gore. The latter discredits the former almost completely; once a film descends into camp it can't really climb back out. Rodriguez has definitely settled for camp.The film's performances give it enough value to pass for entertainment. Gordon-Levitt's charm suits him well in this role even if his subplot proves unsatisfying; Rourke fits Marv effortlessly; Brolin gives a dark complexity to Dwight; Green is able to make a performance in which she spends half her screen time nude into an alluring character whose power goes deeper than skin. Their challenges lie in Miller's misguided adaptation of his own work. The film's countless supporting roles fair no better."Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" isn't bad so much as a tremendous disappointment after a nine- year wait. If it had completely severed itself from the original, the comparison wouldn't be warranted, but there's enough direct sequel material that it should, in theory, live up to the style and gravitas of that film. Instead, Rodriguez looks to have phoned it in just to give fans what the satisfaction of a sequel. Maybe this film would've been more passable if it came out in 2007 or 2008, but after so long a wait, it can't be considered a worthy follow-up. Some of that is obviously due to the novelty wearing off, but it shouldn't be this hard for Rodriguez to make a gritty, compelling noir film with a wild, savage unpredictable edge.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Kathleen Turner stars as a romance adventure novelist who ends up on a romantic adventure of her own "Romancing the Stone." Naturally, fans of romance adventures will most enjoy this one, but to its credit there's a good balance of action to make this film enjoyable for just about everyone."Romancing the Stone" is a writer's fantasy about a writers' fantasy that comes true. Screenwriter Diane Thomas must've been something of a hopeless romantic herself to create Joan Wilder and have her live out a story similar to her books. Wilder is a single woman in her 30s living with her cat who finds out her sister has been kidnapped and that the ransom has been sent to her randomly in the form of a treasure map. Joan flies to Columbia where another man interested in the map sends her off into the jungle instead of straight to her destination where Indiana Jones more or less in the form of Michael Douglas as Jack Colton finds her and helps her begrudgingly.The film certainly capitalizes on the popularity of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" only targeting itself at women. Joan is a naive and hopeless beauty-in-waiting and Douglas the rebellious adventurer who helps her for initially selfish reasons that turn into romantic ones. Their chemistry is a bit forced, but each fits perfectly into his/her role that we easily approve.From an action sense, director Robert Zemeckis, in his first major film, keeps the film light but suspenseful enough to keep our interest. Considering the writing calls for cat and mouse the entire time as Joan and Jack run from the corrupt the Colombian police officer Zolo and his men as well as Danny DeVito, a lot hinges on Zemeckis' creativity to keep the constantly recycling scenes of fleeing from gunfire feel more pressing each time until the climax. He also brings a healthy sense of humor that makes the movie easier to enjoy, knowing that even its maker wants this to be nothing but light-hearted entertainment."Romancing" is predictable adventure with even more predictable romance, but Zemeckis finds a way to make it inherently more likable than even Turner or Douglas as talents do. In a film where there would be plenty to role our eyes at, Zemeckis graciously spares us the trouble. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
A spoof is never a bad idea, but it requires wit and the Wayans brothers don't have it. Think back to the films that made the spoof a genre ("Airplane" and "The Naked Gun") and there you have a commitment to nonsensical but witty humor and most of all -- subtlety. "Scary Movie" might make a lot of people laugh with its literally balls-out mentality toward comedy, but the explicit drug and sex content is anything but clever. If the team of six writers spent half as much time making the jokes work for the plot instead of the plot working for the jokes, "Scary Movie" might have left a humorous impression on its audience. Instead, we leave feeling bad that we laughed at even some of the jokes in this movie because of how generally distasteful it is.Meant to spoof the wave of '90s horror films that brought back the slasher genre, "Scary Movie" combines the plot line of "Scream" with "I Know What You Did Last Summer" but fills it with goofy and/or stupid characters who make fun of these films' repetitive clichés.When watching this movie, you can tell that different jokes were written by different writers. At times, there's some actual cleverness, like when Shannon Elizabeth's character gets a standing ovation for a dramatic monologue in a talent competition, only she's actually screaming about her boyfriend who she sees being killed in the back of the auditorium. Another character taunts the killer by egging him on with descriptions of slasher clichés like "now I've broken my leg and I'm helpless!" That's the good stuff.Then there's other writers' humor: the killer getting high with a bunch of stoners, recurring female flatulence jokes and the gratuitous use of genitalia for a cheap laugh. It's like they were trying to sabotage whatever comedic intelligence they put into the movie because they didn't think people would like it otherwise.The characters are much the same way. Avoiding stereotype versus perpetuating it is a fine line. Some of them, such as Shawn Wayans' questionably gay athlete character, try so hard to make fun of clichés that they create new ones and others are just flat out tasteless jokes like the trans-gendered gym teacher who is preyed on for the sake of the ignorant people that find that stuff funny. On the good side is Cindy (Anna Faris), who gets on the map with her comedically believable performance. She plays up her stereotype of prude do-gooder but plays right into the best material i.e. the subtle jokes. Then there's Shorty (Marlon Wayans), the idiot stoner. I suppose the Wayans brothers have creative license to make jokes about black people, but there are so many that this humor forms its own subplot in ways, like it was intended to entice the black demographic that they worried the rest of the film wouldn't reach.For every three effective jokes that "Scary Movie" has, there's one horrendous one and that's how this movie negates itself. The franchise of spoofs that this movie launched (without having seen them myself) is certainly unprecedented and unwarranted.
You won't get an argument out of me that "Anchorman" is just a stupid movie. It just delivers stupidity with a barbaric yet ingenious sense of creativity that makes it the best comedy that a mind from "Saturday Night Live" has ever come up with.SNL writer/director Adam McKay didn't have to do much for this film, only assemble an incredible ensemble filled with some of the best improvising minds in Hollywood. Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell are just the highlights for what is a tremendously talented cast that sells you crap like it's gold and you buy right into it.Ferrell is Ron Burgundy, easily his best and most unique character of all time, an anchorman for a San Diego news affiliate in the 1970s who thinks he's the biggest thing ever/God's gift to women. He's remarkably stupid with an odd set of talents and an air like he's really smart and awesome. Carrell and Rudd are two of the other reporters: one a retarded weatherman and the other an over-cocky ladies man/field reporter that makes Burgundy look smart. Carrell's performance is golden although clearly written by someone with the decency of a ten-year-old. Rounding out the cast is on-the-rise female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) who balances out the ridiculous humor a bit and I also am partial to the immaculate Fred Willard who is the news director.Still, in all its shear ridiculousness, "Anchorman" shines. Its characters and random sequences never dreamed of before because they are so utterly preposterous work despite your inclinations for them to be horrible. That said, "Anchorman" is not going to work for everyone and amidst the trash that followed it it won't appear as totally original in the future. But nevertheless, the trials and tribulations of the lovable Ron Burgundy really work better than what happens to most stupid comedy protagonists when it comes to getting you to care. It's really Ferrell's best comedic persona and the only one he could revisit with any success.
The best way to describe "Bull Durham" is a pitch that starts as a fastball and then breaks out of the zone--how far out just depends on how long your bat is. The analogy might seem a bit much, but this sports comedy stars with a very catchy, natural humor about it, but it loses some velocity later on when it starts playing off as a romance drama. Whether the romance subplot works for you is obviously a matter of opinion, but it definitely threw me off.I really liked this film to start. Kevin Costner doesn't come off as a typical hotshot ballplayer- -that's not his role at all. He's quite good as a seasoned minor league veteran with an interesting perspective on the game. Susan Sarandon is also a really unique character in a sex-crazed older woman with a devout passion for baseball. Their characters make you think about the game differently and for a fan of the game, you have to like or at least find interesting what they have to say. Ron Shelton, well-accomplished writer/director of sports films from the late 80's-early 90s does a good job making this film much less formulaic. Gladly, there is not way too much focus on the game being shown on screen--there's just enough to make it a true baseball movie, but the movie revolves around the way baseball affects people, particularly those who love it but never saw any good come of it.In the film, Costner is Crash Davis, a minor league vet who is brought in to play catcher for the Durham Bulls to mentor their pitching prospect, "Nuke" LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) who has a "million dollar arm and a five cent head." The relationship between the two is humorous and eventually becomes serious after awhile as the film takes its turn for the dramatic.While I didn't particularly care for the film's portrayal of its female characters, Sarandon did make the film a bit more interesting than just a generic love interest because she's so fixed on baseball and strange things like romantic era poetry.This is not really a true comedy, and perhaps the slight dislike I have with the film is because of that expectation, but it's mostly the ineffective romance stuff. It's kind of overdone with all the saxophone music and other 80s stuff that happens toward the end. The best part of the film though is that unique dialogue about baseball. Costner has some killer lines and a fan of the game really starts to think about it differently which is a very cool aspect of this movie. By the end with the romance and all, I just wasn't totally sold on "Bull Durham to consider it a really good film. Instead it was decent, but something I'd still recommend, mostly to a sports fan.
"After Hours" certainly constituted a change of pace of Martin Scorsese, but maybe less so than you'd think. Despite ample laughs, a lack of mobsters and Cheech and Chong, the film still fits his library in exposing the off-kilter split-personality of New York City late at night and into the early hours of the morning. Scorsese has turned Joseph Minion's script into something preoccupied with urban culture and the twilight hours, when seemingly anything can happen.More unusual for a Scorsese film is the lack of A-list talent. Griffin Dunne headlines the cast as Paul Hackett, an average Joe who works as a word processor by day and never gets out at night. When he meets a beautiful woman named Marcy in a coffee shop (Rosanna Arquette), he decides he'll call her right when he gets back to his apartment. Although it's already 11:30 at night, she invites him over to her friend's loft in the SoHo district. Soon, the night begins to go strangely in Kafka-esque fashion, eventually spiraling out of control and driving Paul insane.To start, Paul loses his money on the way over and cannot pay the taxi driver. He then begins to learn some strange things about Marcy's life including her husband who lives overseas whom she writes every day. Eventually he realizes he's in over his head, loses his cool and ditches Marcy -- but it's not that easy as things start to come full circle.For a story hinging on suspending your disbelief regarding the number of coincidences and connections between characters, Scorsese provides the film a certain realism. The characters might all be crazy in some way, but their quirkiness feels natural. Scorsese recognizes that a lot of kooks live in NYC, but many of them are kooks with dreams and other definitively human characteristics. When Paul and Marcy meet in the coffee shop, Marcy points out the cashier and asks Paul if he thinks the guy is a bit weird. He's clearly practicing ballroom dance moves and aspires to be doing that professionally, not working at a coffee shop. That's essentially emblematic of New York City.As the strange and dark elements give way to comical lunacy as Paul's night gets worse and worse in improbable fashion, the film becomes more of a comedy and shifts its focus from a study of a city and its people to mainly amusement. The more coincidences and surreal antics that ensue, the more questions arise as to why Paul has become the Job of lower Manhattan and the more preposterous it all feels, which detracts from the deeper meaning.Yet Scorsese manages to ground this farce enough to keep it effective throughout. He does nice work with Dunne, who loses his cool a bit quickly and oddly at times, but manages to magnify our own reactions to the bizarre events unfolding before him.Fun is not a word that usually comes attached to a Scorsese film, but "After Hours" can be digested without shame and even without that pair of serious glasses that most viewers keep handy for one of his films. That said, those who bring them will surely find examples of commendable direction.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Teen pregnancy movies that are usually about as predictable as "Titanic" -- inevitably (barring abortion) the baby will be born. There's your ending. But no movie has handled it like "Juno." Not even 2007's summer hit comedy "Knocked Up" can claim it does the pregnancy plot better, or funnier. "Juno" and it's fantastic smart-mouthed, sarcastic titular character ends up telling a story about something bigger than unplanned parenthood. And as much as first-time writer Diablo Cody candy-coats just about every verbal exchange with fancy dry humor, it's her story that makes "Juno" a real winner.Juno is a 16-year-old girl who get pregnant because she and her long-time friend Paul were "bored." She's a rebel type who's into punk rock and slasher movies and she's fond of turning conversations away from social norms. Although she might seem like a stereotype at first, she handles her new problem like any of us would. 20-year-old Ellen Page ("X3: The Last Stand") gives us the humorous character portrait and so much more. We watch Juno become more than just a teenager in this film because of her ability to step back from the humor when necessary and show us real feelings."Juno" might seem like it's riding the label of independent comedy, but don't let its off-beat folk soundtrack or sketch-animated promotional materials dissuade you -- it's completely accessible to mainstream tastes. Director Jason Reitman who made success from a once independent "Thank You For Smoking" brings the same skill set to "Juno." Just like that film, Reitman demonstrates a great understanding of what the story is about at heart, even if that story is set to acoustic guitar and restrained vocals.What it's really about, pardon the delay, is love. "Juno" is a love story, an epiphany and a statement about love as seen through a life-altering event in a young girl, who despite her sharp tongue, has barely scratched at the surface of what life is. Bringing this home are the adoptive parents in the film played by Jason Bateman ("Arrested Development") and the lovely Jennifer Garner. They appear to be the ideal wealthy suburban parents for Juno's unborn baby, but their longing for a child, particularly Garner -- the obsessive parenting book- reading mother-to-be -- has overwhelmed their relationship. Garner gives a particularly touching performance: While most of the other adult characters like Juno's father and stepmother (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney) come with humorous quirks, her role remains the most dramatic, reminding us that a teenage girl being pregnant and picking who she'll give the baby to from an easy-saver is more than just good comedy material in real life. That's not to knock the entertaining but honest performances of Simmons and Janney. Both are hilarious, but both have their heart-felt moments.Cody impresses by taking a premise with a definitive set of consequences (teen pregnancy) and turning it into a good comedy and then some more. Although some of the fancy dialogue is off-target from the central plot, it doesn't dictate the story being told. Cody makes sure that the wit is only decoration that makes for a more entertaining take on what can be cliché dramatic events.
In the era of reality TV, we're used to the blurred line between fiction and non, but in the early days of television, the public was easily suckered in by the grandeur of that magical living room box. "Quiz Show" examines the public's right to the truth and perfectly captures an America bobbing in the wake of McCarthyism.Robert Redford brings his filmmaking pedigree to this adaptation of the Richard N. Goodwin book documenting Goodwin's (played by Robert Morrow) investigation that ignited the quiz show scandal of the late '50s. Paul Attanasio's screenplay weaves a story of TV bigwigs and little everyday men blinded by tastes of fame and money, along with the public deception they engaged in for their various reasons.The film begins predominantly with Herbie Stempel (John Turturro), a contestant on the popular NBC primetime game show "Twenty One." Herbie's long run on the show is about to come to a halt as the producers have seen their ratings plateau and want to bring in a new face to liven things up. Producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) tells Herbie he must throw the next show (in Herb's words, "take a dive") by flubbing an answer to a question as simple as who won the 1955 Oscar for Best Picture.Herbie is replaced with Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the unremarkable son of a wealthy Pulitzer winner with a mind for trivia. Enright and co-producer Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) propose an agreement in which they'll feed Charles answers to questions he already knows. He's rich, the public is enthralled and the ratings go up  everyone wins.The film builds this story for awhile until Richard Goodwin comes into the picture as a member of the legislative oversight committee for the House of Representatives. Goodwin senses something is awry with these quiz shows and slowly uncovers the truth."Quiz Show" isn't suspenseful from start to finish given it's clear the fraudulent quiz show operation will be exposed at some point, but what's fascinating to watch is how these otherwise small men in Stempel and Van Doren deal with the situation as it unfolds. How warped their egos have become after they agree to commit the "slight" transgression becomes a factor in the film. Are they good guys or bad guys, or more appropriately, how black and white is this situation, really?Equally intriguing is how Goodwin goes about interrogating all the parties involved as if private eye solving a murder. He demands the truth and it becomes apparent as hearings begin to be held that the public does too. "Quiz Show" paints an honest portrait of "the business" back in the '50s, the way that the TV people in that age were so dedicated to the dollar and justified everything as "it's what the people want." Things haven't changed so much, however. We now willfully indulge in contrived situations, believing that what the TV shows us is in fact the reality. "Quiz Show," even today, reveals to us that while we demand truth and honesty as consumers, we also long to believe and prefer it to skepticism because it's so much easier. In that sense, how much of a scandal was this really?~StevenThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more!
Who says all "based on a true story" movies have to take themselves seriously? Regardless of how true-to-life the events of "Pain and Gain" are, the film offers a ballsy take on a crime thriller, namely in being unafraid of comic territory.In what other circumstances would Michael Bay board a project such as this? OK, in total fairness, these are the types of movies Bay should be making, ones in which superficiality and outrageous acts of violence play an important role in telling the story. The characters are body builders, and delusional ones at that, drunk on an idea that the American dream is one for the taking (or maybe, more honestly, that money is good to have and worth taking by any means necessary).Mark Wahlberg stars as Daniel Lugo, a trainer with big ideas and a can-do spirit. Daniel begins to work out Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub), a wealthy business owner, and conspires to kidnap him and extort his entire net worth. To do so, he recruits 'roided-up gym member Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and the sometimes-violence prone Jesus-lover Paul (Dwayne Johnson). Between the three of them, they have enough brains to pull it off, but not enough to do it cleanly.Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have a lot of fun with the script, which takes liberties with the true story as chronicled by Pete Collins in the name of entertainment. As dumb as the film portrays Lugo and Co., they had to be smart enough to get away with it as long as they did. These guys aren't necessarily anti-heroes, but you don't find yourself rooting for them to succeed either. Viewers will most likely want them to get away with it long enough to be entertained, but short enough that the story feels real, because no way could things end well for these three. The script knows it, opening with the police going after Daniel and flashing back to tell the rest of the story."Pain and Gain" fits itself into a narrow intersection of sorts between crime drama, thriller and comedy. It's not an easy blend to pull off, but Wahlberg, Johnson and Mackie prove to be the kind of versatile talents capable of making it work. They've all had experience in all these genres (though Mackie is a stranger to comedy) and done so successfully, and there's no denying their star appeal. If only we had enough to get a real sense of who these men were. Their motivation, as provided in the script, comes off as phony. Lugo doesn't seem like the kind of guy who needs hokey self-motivation get-rich-quick seminars to justify his criminal behavior. These men likely did what they did from a darker, more desperate place than wanting the money for penile injections to counteract impotence (in the case of Mackie's Adrian). These things reveal the "what could have been" had the script gone the darker crime thriller route.Instead, we have the Bay route. Gorgeous women, physical humor and absurdity around every corner. "Pain and Gain" is a lot of fun in this regard, but it makes a sacrifice to do so. In ways, the interpretation plays out like a poor man's Coen brothers movie (there are even detached toes). It's a tale of characters getting way in over their heads and the depths to which they'll stoop to survive or perpetuate their delusional reality."Pain and Gain" goes on a bit long for something that again, leans toward comedy, and it has two distinctive acts that feel a bit disconnected as a result, but it remains tonally the same throughout, even in the way it mixes genres. And the humor comes in unexpected ways, avoiding the clichés of films about small-time crooks.There's lots to like about "Pain and Gain," even if the finished product would best be described as silly. The entertainment factor does a pretty good job of drawing our attention away from what would be major flaws in a traditional "based on a true story" thriller. Taking risks like this aren't easy or likely to work out, but there's enough here that "Pain and Gain" pays off.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" should be the gold standard for suspenseful film-making. Hitchcock made a name for himself on such technique in his films, but "Vertigo" is his crowning achievement. Although his other films deliver in this way, none do it with as much style, grace and pure technique, transforming a simple mystery into a thriller that toys with the human psyche.Starring Jimmy Stewart, whom Hitchcock previously collaborated with most notably in "Rear Window," this film is about a detective who suffers from acrophobia (fear of heights) and steps down from his job when an incident leaves him with a bad case of vertigo that is virtually incurable. He's lured back to the job, however, by an old friend whose wife is behaving strangely. As a P.I., John Ferguson follows her around and slowly becomes consumed by her.Much of the criticism of the film was initially blamed on Stewart's age (49 at the time), though history did repeat itself for Hitchcock when he cast a 54-year-old Cary Grant in his next picture, "North by Northwest." In hindsight, however, both films -- especially "Vertigo" - - don't suffer. As half-century-old classics, age hardly becomes noticeable.The reason "Vertigo" has gone on to defy its early criticism is technique. From the classic "vertigo effect" of zooming in and out simultaneously as Ferguson looks down from heights, to the carefully chosen lighting and color techniques that appear at pivotal points in the film, there are no chinks in the film-making. Most of these effects don't make their way in until the plot gets going, but it picks up the lag quickly. They also become more frequent as the plot becomes more mysterious than once imagined and the film moves from the mystery state to the psychological thriller state. Combine these eerie shots with a classic Hitchcock score of jarring dynamic shifts and it's hard to stop watching. Especially in the film's final hour, your mind races to figure out what's coming next and it doesn't disappoint.In a sense, "Vertigo" is Hitchcock's most poetic thriller. It is a series of carefully chosen images that convey a sense of deeper meaning to the viewer, who in turn interprets those clues as integral parts of the story, enhancing the viewer's interest and making the ensuing action more suspenseful. It isn't hard to come up with a mystery and plot twist(s) similar to this film, but it's untouchable because of how well it is executed.
Of the recent take over of Ferrell/Apatow produced comedy "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby" is certainly not the most charming, but it's not completely devoid of fresh humor.This time Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a redneck swept up in NASCAR fame. Bobby is not the most interesting character, but Ferrell demonstrates his diversity although the humor is mostly reminiscent of "Anchorman" or "Old School." To change things up a bit, however, Ferrell has added the talents of John C. Reilly (as Cal, Ricky's best friend) and character specialist Sacha Baren Cohen (as a French, homosexual rival driver). Even Gary Cole stars as Bobby's father. These actors bring some more interest and make for a nice change to the typical fare for these films.In general, the plot is rather flat and uninteresting, with only enough comedic bits in between to keep interest. Unlike the aforementioned "Old School" or "Anchorman," "Talladega Nights" doesn't seem to move forward on the legs of its comedy but instead relies on it like a crutch. Some comic scenes will have you laugh out loud, but others will have you wishing the plot was better and just move on already. The beginning is also rushed and choppy, which for a two-hour film implies that there was some indecision on the part of writers Ferrell and Adam McKay as to how to best tell the story. Overall, it seems that their talents would best be served outside the realm of race car driving - not much humor is found in the races themselves, only the culture of NASCAR and so the NASCAR scenes simply bore.
The love story takes many forms in film. Many would argue "Blue Valentine" takes the more "realistic" approach in that it depicts the fracturing of a relationship amidst a sea of flashbacks to more idealistic and happier times. "Blue Valentine" might not have a traditional happy ending, but that doesn't necessarily make it a depressing love story. Whereas many relationships happily succeed, others fail and others take less concrete and grayer directions. Derek Cianfrance simply paints a deep, complex and not-so-uplifting portrait of one such relationship.Perhaps "honest" would be more suitable a term than "realistic" in that marriages and relationships can take a variety of courses and the story of Cindy and Dean is one possible trajectory, even if it's one we wish didn't occur as often as it does.The film follows the present time line of Cindy (Michelle Williams) and Dean (Ryan Gosling) attempting to take a one-day vacation together amid an atmosphere of frustrations and some thick tension. They drop their daughter Frankie off with Cindy's father and travel to a hotel where they end up in an outer space-themed suite that sort of awkwardly sums up that they're in different places emotionally. Cindy has a lot on her mind and can't seem to relax, leading her to be sexually unresponsive, and Dean can't seem to approach her the right way about it, leading to his own frustrations. There seems to be a distinct effort being made to love each other, but there's an unquestionable hollowness or at least a disconnect.Peppered throughout but not in an obnoxiously non-linear way are flashbacks to when they first met and fell in love. Gosling's Dean shows some continuity between these two time lines, whereas earlier Cindy, despite being a bit standoffish consistently throughout, shows a completely different side, which is fitting for her character considering how out of love she really is in present day.Most impressively, the script creates empathy and sympathy for both characters; no one person is the victim or the enemy throughout. Both make mistakes, even if the scales tip heavily at certain points in the film. Unless you personally find your life to mirror one of these characters based on a past (or current, I suppose) relationship, there's no taking sides.The depth of Gosling and Williams' performances doesn't allow partiality either. Gosling certainly gives the more external performance with a quick temper yet a deep love that occasionally forces out his fragility. Cindy by nature bottles up her emotions and Williams manages to convey it all beautifully. Cianfrance effectively balances these two powerful acting forces entering their primes and lets you feel their relationship and their story. Successfully generating empathy proves here to be a valuable filmmaking skill. Cianfrance wields it properly and effectively in a film with just a few key events capable of commanding our attention otherwise. A gripping scene occurs when Cindy makes the determination to have her pregnancy aborted. The doctor (though kindly) describes what he's doing in vivid detail and you can't help but enter the mind of Cindy as she wrestles with whether she can go through with the procedure. It's potent stuff no matter what side of the debate you're on.Non-traditional love stories with un-Hollywood endings have a tendency to get preachy in the end, but "Blue Valentine" doesn't make any grand thematic statements. The inconclusive ending of the film suggests that we must find our own way to make peace with this "honest" outcome. The only obvious thing to take away is that it sucks; it sucks when these things happen and it's not necessarily any one person's fault  it's the relationship.Yet the film suggests it could be worse. A few other low-profile relationships in the film, such as the one between Cindy's mother and father, show how relationships often times continue when they shouldn't. Just because two disagreeing people stick it out together doesn't mean they did the right thing for their family. But no matter which lens you choose to look at the film through, Cianfrance and this talented group of writers and actors convinces you thoroughly to find that lens and use it.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The goals of today's reboots have been to update the originals with the special effects of the modern era and add complexity and depth to cinema's most memorable characters. This is only half true for Universal's long-delayed "The Wolfman" remake. The full-moon transformations of man to werewolf are enhanced with top-notch gruesome CGI, but the man behind the beast remains uncomplicated. This "Wolfman" is a classic monster horror film with a modern pulse. Clichéd suspense and generic storytelling are king, only they're accompanied by extreme gore and curdling special effect for a more 21st Century thrill.It takes a bit for "The Wolfman" to clearly establish itself as a typical monster movie. The story jumps right in with actor Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) being summoned back home to Blackmoor, England by his brother's fiancée (Blunt) because his brother has mysteriously disappeared. It's quickly after that we learn he's dead and suddenly Lawrence and Gwen have an affinity for one another. Then there's a quick side note assuring us Anthony Hopkins will indeed be creepy as the family patriarch, Sir John Talbot.After the initial werewolf shreds some guts and swipes off a few heads, it finally bites Lawrence the story really begins. Minus the trite dialogue using monster-related similes about how dangerous he is and how he doesn't know it and that Gwen should go before she gets hurt all while constant shots of the moon remind us of what will inevitably happen next, it's entertaining. The two very good scenes in the film happen toward the middle when Lawrence is captured and taken to an asylum in London. First he has a series of nightmarish flashbacks to childhood trauma as the staff tries those reputable ice bath and shock treatments. The best, however, is when the head doctor who believes him crazy wants to make an example of him before a lecture hall of colleagues and straps him to a chair while the full moon is set to show he's been cured. Of course that's not what happens at all. Comical gore ensues.Amid the typical monster shenanigans that result somehow in a wolf-on-wolf showdown, there are a few wasted talents. Emily Blunt is too good for this film and Hugo Weaving (Mr. Smith of "The Matrix" and V in "V for Vendetta") provides the film's only example of acting with subtext. Del Toro and Hopkins are more or less wasted although odd characters of questionable morals always come better from Hopkins than from just anybody."The Wolfman" is a big-budget monster horror movie and it deserves to be viewed with those kinds of expectations despite the reputation of its stars and the inherent trend of most films trying to reboot a classic going for the more serious, theme-driven stories. "Wolfman" just picks a couple interesting thematic lines and delivers them one more time just to sound legitimate. The film is entertaining despite the basic and surprise-less script. In a sense its shallow delivery is an homage to old-school horror films. It would have been nice to have gotten a more complicated retelling of the tragic tale of Lawrence Talbot, but it works just fine as a genre film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Acclaimed writer/director Billy Wilder strikes again with another humorous and romantic comedy in "The Apartment." But more important than another triangular love story from the "Some Like It Hot" creator is the actor he brought along with him: Jack Lemmon. Though "Hot" was his breaking out party, "The Apartment" really boasts the range of the funny, neurotic and charismatic Lemmon.In this film, Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, a lowly insurance worker hoping to climb the corporate ladder by "leasing" his primely located Manhattan apartment to four different company executives so they can entertain their mistresses. Baxter himself claims to be a humble bachelor, but his eye for the attractive elevator operator Fran (Shirley MacLaine) in his building tells us otherwise. Problem is, Fran's still in love with another man and that other man happens to be Baxter's boss, Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray).Lemmon defines lovable protagonist as Baxter. From his goofy nasal voice early in the film as he tries to satisfy all his "clients" whilst carrying a cold to his fast-talking enthusiasm as he courageously asks out Fran. It's almost too much when we see him alone in his apartment dancing from excitement or cleverly taking a hit to his reputation by letting his neighbors assume he's a playboy. Watching play second fiddle to Fran and Sheldrake's unsettled affair through much of the film is almost difficult because we want him to be the one finding love.MacLaine is marvelous as the down-on-herself, lovestruck Fran, the very beginning of what of course became a long and fruitful career. MacMurray is excellent too, playing a strong lead for being so late in his career.But it's Lemmon's performance and Wilder's lovable story that make "The Apartment" such a classic. By 1960, no one could keep audiences from knowing that the two leads would fall in love, but the key was finding a different way to get them there. Wilder also pokes fun at a what was a touchy subject in the era of the "perfect American family" in rich married men going on dates with younger women. It's that creative and light sense of humor hovering over all the drama that makes Wilder comedies so good.~Steven C Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
"Spartacus" (1960) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) were the two great epic war films of the 1960s. That said, the latter is superior, but not for the former's lack of trying. The backstory of "Spartacus" explains a lot: Executive producer and star Kirk Douglas fires director Anthony Mann and brings in his "Paths of Glory" (a phenomenal film) director Stanley Kubrick. Problem is, the eventually infamous Kubrick really had no experience working with anyone's work but his own, even if the script was written by blacklisted two-time Oscar winner Dalton Trumbo. Basically, Douglas did his best to make the most of "Spartacus," including the corralling of a distinguished cast, but it results in a very good -- not great -- film.For one, Trumbo's script is a crowd-pleaser, and I say that implying that it was for the '60s. Rarely does a war epic focus so heavily on the protagonist's romantic interest. As impressive as Jean Simmons is as Spartacus' lover and wife, Varinia, the subplot of these two slaves falling for each other has too much clout in a story that should focus sternly on Spartacus as the inspiring leader of a slave rebellion against the Roman empire. His love for Varinia ultimately makes him more likable, but it comes at the cost of part of the film's thematic boldness.Sadly, one of the scenes that was most interesting was not part of the film until it was remastered in 1991. In it, Laurence Olivier, playing powerful Senate leader Crassus, tries to seduce a young slave played by Tony Curtis as they are in the bath using a cunning metaphor. Naturally, this was deemed inappropriate by the Legion of Decency. Few scenes are as memorable as that one and only a couple of Spartacus' speeches on freedom are standouts as well. "Death is the only a freedom a slave knows. That's why he's not afraid of it" is one of just a handful of powerful moments in three-hour film.For Kubrick fans, this is that one asterisk in Kubrick's grand career. There's very little director trademark in this film and there is very minimal hands-on work. If anything, the cinematography --namely the shadowy interiors -- is most noteworthy. And interestingly, most of this was Kubrick's doing and not that of Russell Metty because of alleged disagreements.The unarguably great part of this film are the performances. Sir Peter Ustinov won an Oscar for his role as Lentulus, owner of the gladiator school where Spartacus is sold at the film's beginning. He is a comical man just trying to do whatever he can to insure he's buried head out of the sand rather than in. He's the pawn of the Roman powers and he earns much of our pity as the film wears on. Olivier is of course commanding the the Roman leader and Charles Laughton perfect as his rival senator, kind-hearted yet distinctly amoral.It might be Alex North's score that sums "Spartacus" up best. It's theme-driven music perfectly suited for an epic film, but feels completely out of context. Whereas Maurice Jarre's epic "Lawrence of Arabia" soundtrack captures the greatness of that film, North's is a reminder that "Spartacus" was an idea born in Hollywood and shot mostly in California. It just doesn't convey a sense of time or place, only that this film was made to be a head-turning film with thousands of cast members and extras. Once again, it is a film of tremendous talents, but only verges on epic greatness.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com **all facts in this review courtesy IMDb trivia page
Four years ago you never could've predicted that "Planet of the Apes" would be rebooted to critical and financial acclaim, let alone become perhaps the most promising franchises born after 2010. If "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" was a consummate origin story, then "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" is a consummate next step in a larger story, and proof that a movie franchise can evolve more gradually and still be grippingly entertaining.The sequel picks up well after the end of "Rise," which implied that a simian virus wiped out a large portion of the earth's population. At this point, the apes have established a village outside San Francisco and their intelligence has grown (as has main ape Caesar's vocabulary). When a band of human survivors stumbles across some of the apes, Caesar (played fabulously once more by leading mo-cap actor Andy Serkis) confronts the colony of human survivors (led by Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman) and issues a stern warning to the humans to let the apes live in peace. However, the apes' home is situated next to a dam  the humans' only hope for a power source and theoretically their only way to survive."Rise" writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver return and they've remarkably crafted a story as straightforward, suspenseful and emotional as the original (with some help from 20th Century Fox A-list screenwriter Mark Bomback). The entire movie we wait for the other shoe to drop as humans and apes must get along but don't entirely trust each other, and a few dark characters on both sides undermine the good guys: Caesar and Clarke's Malcolm.Caesar is the linchpin of this series. James Franco's character not being part of it says everything you need to know. The fact that the movie spends more time acquainting us with the ape characters than the human ones demonstrates that the creatives behind the film know it too. They should pass that information along to Paramount for the "Transformers" franchise.The story is packed with character-building, suspense, painful misunderstandings, betrayal, hope, violence and justice. You really feel the roller coaster ride of the story in your guts, a vicarious feeling that too few blockbusters create, even the really entertaining ones. Caesar is the kind of character that all blockbusters should have and he's entirely done in CGI. That tells you just how crucial good storytelling is to creating characters. They don't have to be human. Not to take anything away from Serkis' brilliance, but Jaffa and Silver should teach a class on screen writing that should be mandatory for the rest of Hollywood's big studio writers. They way they create empathy and stick to basic storytelling tenants in a crude yet effective way is so laudable. And undoubtedly Bomback ("Unstoppable," "The Wolverine") helped ratchet up the entertainment factor.Director Matt Reeves picks up on all these terrific moments in the script and nurtures them. He lets the plot breathe and gives it time to snowball, and by the time it does, the audience is so invested in the outcome that the ending doesn't have to be great, it just has to give us what we want, which it does. "Dawn" is also thematically stronger than "Rise," taking the idea of both apes and humans having both good and evil tendencies to the next level. It's elementary stuff about human (and ape) nature but in this premise it clicks especially well. Through the eyes of a growing civilization of apes and humanity rebuilding we see the chance for a fresh start for human and ape-kind in, which makes the conflict between them so maddening throughout the film yet also riveting."Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" propels the slow-build of this franchise to the point that it almost feels more like a first entry than a second. That's a good thing. So often franchises work in trilogies, but Fox could turn this into a four-film arc easily with the right story. So far, however, the scope has been kept small, allowing for character moments and that emotional connection. They will have an opportunity to blow the lid off everything, but hopefully Fox has learned a thing or two and will continue to make this about Caesar rather than just a war of apes and humans.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Amores Perros" is a three-vignette film that's not so much concerned about creating a harmonic epiphany among its three plot lines, but rather it aims for compelling stories with a brutally honest portrayal of life, love, sin and redemption. Getting a unified message out of the film is about as difficult as translating its title. Literally translated the title doesn't make much sense, but "amores" translates to loved ones or while "perros" literally means dogs but is also an obvious pejorative for lowly people such as criminals. The title can also be broken into "Amor es Perros" which means "Love's a Bitch." All of these are fitting for the film and their multitude is appropriate considering the open- ended nature of the truths the film preaches.Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga give us three stories from Mexico City that are biblical in nature, each named for the two focal characters of the given story. All the stories deal with violence in some way, crime, love and lastly, each has a vital connection to dogs. Each story is as complicated as human beings ought to be portrayed in film. The characters are people of great love and passion, but with great capacity for error and sin. The dogs in their lives serve as instigators of conflict, distractions, sources of comfort and more, taking the emotion of these difficult stories to the next level."Octavio y Susana" is about Susana, a young married woman with a baby who lives with her abusive criminal husband, Ramiro, and her brother-in-law Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal), who keeps asking her to run away with him. Octavio trains the family dog, Cofi, to fight and wins money that he uses to support her and convince her to leave Ramiro."Valeria y Daniel" is about a supermodel, Valeria, who is having an affair with Daniel, a businessman married with children. Daniel buys them an apartment announcing he's leaving his wife when a horrible car accident caused by the characters of the first story puts Valeria in a wheelchair. Both the incident and the disappearance of their dog, Ritchie, under the floorboards of the apartment tears at their relationship."El Chivo y Maru" is given to us in bits and pieces throughout the first two but eventually gets its own focus at the end. El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria) is the film's most complicated character. Seen in the beginning as a homeless man with a half dozen dogs who also doubles as an assassin, we learn that he left his wife and daughter to be a guerrilla fighter and landed in prison for 20 years, at which point he wanted his daughter to believe he was dead. After he was let out, the man who captured him gave him a place to stay and employed him as an assassin. During the story he tries to carry out a job while gathering the courage to see his daughter again.The summaries might be long, but grasping the compelling circumstances, complication and depth of each story is essential to understanding what "Amores Perros" is trying to do. The stories are meant to show us the many facets of life and human nature. The film is not trying to find that one common denominator, but the several. We're supposed to experience internally somehow that connection that makes all of the film's difficult stories clear, not be lectured on it by the filmmakers."Amores Perros" is not a film for people looking for cathartic satisfaction from movies. There is no moment of feeling "at one" with the film or that pleasant feeling when you feel all the loose ends are tied up. It's also one that animal-lovers should be careful with. There's a lot of suggested animal violence -- dogs that appear to be bloody and or dying. It's a tragic and beautiful (in the literary sense) comparison to the brutality of human nature in the film, but it's not one that's easy to handle.Most people, however, will appreciate the great storytelling and intensely interesting characters and events in this 2.5-hour film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Aardman Animations has probably been more consistent than Pixar, especially of late, yet the stop-motion powerhouse doesn't get half the attention. "The Pirates! Band of Misfits" didn't buck the box-office trend, but it proves that even with the most generic of premises, Aardman knows how to appeal to a diverse audience.Intent on winning the prestigious Pirate of the Year award, the generically named Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) scours the ocean in search of treasure with his deeply loyal crew of ham-loving pirates. When famed pirates Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) and Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek) burst his bubble, however, he becomes desperate. After hijacking the boat of scientist Charles Darwin (David Tennant), he discovers his beloved parrot Polly isn't a parrot after all, and could win him the fortune he seeks to make his Pirate of the Year dream come true. But to do so, he'll have to travel to London, where the pirate-hating Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton) awaits.If you're looking for a film that epitomizes British humor, "The Pirates" is exactly that. The jokes are silly, clever and come in rapid-fire fashion, many under the radar. Few animated films balance pure slapstick and wit the way this film does, which is a Hallmark of the best family films. "Despicable Me" is the closest recent example. Most films that do both deliver them in segmented fashion, whereas certain scenes are more physical for the kiddies and others smaller moments are for the adults. "The Pirates" can get both demographics laughing at the same time.That said, "The Pirates" doesn't deliver that many belly laughs for the adults. It prefers being quirky and totally silly and it commits to this style early and often. Characters such as The Albino Pirate (Anton Yelchin) spout the most absurd things out of their mouth, but because writer Gideon Defoe never yields, what could come off as bungling stupidity comes off as funny bungling stupidity. The film moves at a brisk pace, perhaps because a lot of the traveling by boat happens in 2D animated sequences on a treasure map (though one of the pirate's jobs is to throw red discs out the back of the boat so that red dots show up on the map). The major sequences move quickly into one another, fitting some positive character and theme-building moments in between. The result is a well-structured little film with plenty of big, physical adventure and a decent enough amount of heart.Nothing about the story is that emotionally moving, though Martin Freeman voicing Pirate Captain's No. 2 man gives it a good go as the only logical or thoughtful character in the entire film who often calls Pirate Captain out on his impulsive and ignorant behavior. Instead, "The Pirates" succeeds largely on its potent sense of danger, anchored by the terrifying Queen Victoria who couldn't have been equipped with a better voice than that of Staunton.Grant does surprisingly strong and practically unrecognizable voice work as the Pirate Captain, a character both likable and one you can only shake your head at some times. He's the perfect lead for a silly family film such as this. He's heroic and embodies good leadership qualities (hence why his crew adores him), but in child-like fashion he often forgets what's most important, which allows for an easy way for the kids to access the thematic points of the story.So much of "The Pirates," however, will go over kids' heads, though not in some inappropriate way. Rather, much of what makes the movie so funny is how it plays with pirate genre conventions and film conventions in general, which kids obviously have no concept of. Start to finish, it never ceases to find the clever thing to do or say.Simply, "The Pirates" will have audiences of all ages grinning from ear to buccaneer.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"The Jerk" is an easy watch, something you can take in quickly and get plenty of good laughs from. While it's not a comedy that strings together laugh-out-loud moments, it has its unique brand of humor grounded in both absurdity and plays on words. It's the kind of humor that's either a hit with someone or doesn't quite do it for them. The more you look back and recall lines and moments from this film, however, the more it grows on you. It's not about the big laughs, but the little things that make "The Jerk" special.Steve Martin stars as Navin Johnson, a man who grew up thinking he was black and eventually sets out to find his greater purpose. Johnson is naive, stupid, ignorant, but lovable guy, and the film shows how the people around him turn him into...a jerk. This is easily Martin's best character role. He does such a great job handling the subtlety of the humor without playing the absurd moments too over-the-top. He really carries this film. The odd humor manifests itself through jokes like when Johnson tells his girlfriend Marie (Bernadette Peters) what their time together has felt like, describing first day as feeling like a week, the second day felt like two days, etc. and when he writes home to his family and says "remember when I dreamed about having a big house with _____?" and then he describes with great detail all the absurd rooms in his mansion he could never have actually dreamed of as a child. It's all very original and will definitely appeal more to people who appreciate what makes each joke funny.So the writing, which is mostly Martin and the acting, which is mostly Martin, are the aspects of the film most worthy of praise. None of the other characters are really written well enough to add anything significant to the comedy, so its the Steven Martin Show. In fact, if you'd told me he did it based on a Saturday Night Live character I would have easily believed you. Either way, this is an odd but easy to love, easy to watch comedy. It's truly different and definitely stands out.
Consider this: a sex addict works at a colonial theme park, but on the side chokes himself at restaurants to prey on the financial charity of his saviors so that he can pay the hospital bills of his mother, who has dementia, and who ironically is also the root of his terrible lifestyle. This synopsis is both the best and dooming part of "Choke," a film based on another book by "Fight Club" author Chuck Palahniuk. It's creative, twisted and entirely unique, only it's also a bit too much for one film, barely able to make sense of itself let alone for the audience.Small-time actor Clark Gregg has his directorial debut in the film and his sophomore writing credit for adapting the novel for the screen. He's on the right path, but his film doesn't plant its feet anywhere. The main character, Victor Mancini (Sam Rockwell), is a crazed sex addict, an insecure jerk, a scam artist and a man with a deep love for his mother (Anjelica Huston), but rarely do we compute that he is all these things at once. His life is a whirlwind of the bizarre that is rarely unified except in the sense that we pity the guy in every aspect.It would be one thing for Victor to be a sex addict alone, a man to whom sex is a compulsion, where addict meetings are sometimes places to go to pick up girls. No films have taken us into the head of someone like that. It would also be something for him to be a scam artist just trying to pay the bills for his mother with Alzheimer's. But he's all of these things and so we never get to truly enter his mind. We get glimpses into all aspects, but we never see fully-developed moments. Just when we think we're learning more about his tormented past always on the run with his mother or the root of his sex addiction, we're ripped away and thrust into another scene.Still, the film makes us crave that deeper knowledge, and that is commendable in its own right. Rockwell, who has always been underrated despite strong performances in the past in films like "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" and "Matchstick Men," gives Victor the complexity he needs in that you can tell he's lost somewhere inside, even if you don't fully understand it. Huston is also compelling as a troubled woman with dementia whose past was really no better than her present."Choke" is also funny. Although non-traditional as far as comedies go, it provides a twisted sense of humor unlike anything you've probably seen. Gregg does good work here too. Despite the scenes being cut short, his quick flashes of women's breasts (pun there whether intended or not) as Victor passes and mentally undresses them set the deranged tone for the film as do the many clever ending shots of the scenes. They're creative and interesting, but they don't resonate and even confuse.
"Zack and Miri Make A Porno" might be the raunchiest comedy, well, ever, so how could it possibly be cliché? Somehow, Kevin Smith has found a way to push our censorship boundaries while simultaneously offering an off-brand but all too familiar romantic comedy as "sex changes everything" for Zack and Miri.That's right horny dudes that can't wait to get to the theaters to see Zack and Miri--bring your emotional side because you'll need it. Not to say romance dominates this film in any way, because in general this a film that is just flat out dirty and funny, but it certainly leaves a funny taste in your mouth because truthfully it doesn't work when it is used.Kevin Smith has made his career on his open-minded, thoughtful and delightfully dirty scripts and he certainly sets this film up along those lines. But then things take a turn for "Jersey Girl" at a few points and you really can't believe it. The best way to describe the schizophrenic behavior of parts of the film is to explain the juxtaposition of two scenes in the film that couldn't be more unalike and occur within seconds of each other. *SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD* In one scene, let's just say they're filming a rather dirty part of the porno and something completely appalling happens that will make you laugh hysterically and then Smith cuts right away to Miri finding Zack has abandoned their apartment. It really makes you uncomfortable transitioning from dirty high point to emotional." About the only thing it does is show how Elizabeth Banks can do both really well. She has a future beyond these movies, that's for sure.Other than the plot when the romance gets mixed in, there's nothing but good things to say about "Zack and Miri." Seth Rogen is in top form and he's a bit more down to earth in this film compared to his Apatow work which is nice. Craig Robinson (Darryl from "The Office") rounds out a nice ensemble cast that includes Justin Long, Smith regular Jason Mewes and a few names from the adult film industry. If you can handle the dirty, dialog-heavy humor, you'll agree that "Zack and Miri" is definitely a good overall comedy that is open to talking about pretty much anything.
Normally, movies stay out of the realm of "domestic drama," and for good reason: who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to deal with in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all classes and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it. That's not escapism -- the number one reason the average person turns to movies -- that's sad reality. Normally, divorce or custody is simply part of a greater story and affects the way we understand it or relate to its characters. "Kramer vs. Kramer" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so troubling. That's a challenge for both this film and its audience: turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel spiteful as the mirror is held up to our face. Writer/director Robert Benton definitely achieves both and in impressive fashion in adapting this novel by Avery Corman.The story, as one would expect, is quite simple: Big business advertising man Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) comes home to find his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him and their 7-year-old son Billy (Justin Henry). Ted then must quickly learn to be an active father in the boys' life and as soon as he does, Joanna brings a custody suit upon him.To make an Oscar-winning drama about something so generic and particularly dialogue- heavy first takes tremendous acting talent. You don't get much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is in his prime in this role: his first Oscar win after three other notable nominations. He creates a thorough character, one whose self-centered and quick-tempered ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the sole care-giver. Streep wins her first Oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who doesn't get much screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to leave as well as renewed sense of identity when she returns to take custody. Streep does so effortlessly. The young boy, Justin Henry, who at his age was the youngest competitive category nominee in Academy Awards history, plays the embodiment of all 7-year-old children exceptionally well.Benton's writing and direction takes these performances to the level where we see deeper into this family's troubles than we do our own and thus reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family. Benton's previous notable credits ("Bonnie & Clyde" and "Superman") wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can flat out write. Numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict. The first morning that Joanna is gone and Ted make's Billy french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in Americans' kitchens every morning.You'll rarely see a story as straightforward as "Kramer vs. Kramer" done better. There aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. The film then has to rely on its talents and they are all sure-fire, delivering a new understanding of a subject that's so familiar.
If Christopher Nolan wasn't already the most daring filmmaker of the 21st century, "Interstellar" seals the deal. Somehow, the "Dark Knight Trilogy" and "Inception" director manages to package theoretical physics, space-time travel and a doomsday scenario all in one film that even when it doesn't make sense, still strikes several nerves both in terms of spectacle and compelling storytelling."Ambitious" might be the easiest way to describe this 169-minute epic that makes "2001: A Space Odyssey" seem artsy-fartsy. And in true Nolan fashion, the ambition involves more than just the science, but in the way these high-brow concepts connect to core human themes and ideas.In a minimally explained but pretty graspable not-too-distant future, Earth is running out of resources to sustain the human race. The need to reinvest in agriculture has wiped out the entire field of technology, which is why Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is no longer a space pilot, but a farmer. But when his daughter, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) discovers some strange gravitational phenomena, it leads Cooper and Murph to NASA, where they discover an operation to find a new home for the human race in a galaxy accessible through a black hole just off of Saturn. When Professor Brand (Michael Caine) and his daughter (Anne Hathaway) offer Coop the job of piloting their mission, he accepts and leaves his family, even though he has no idea when he'll return  if he returns. At it's core, "Interstellar" is about the lengths we will go to for the ones we love, the choices we will make when guided by love, the least quantifiable force in the universe. A layer above that is the length humankind might go to survive, what we would or wouldn't do as individuals to ensure its continued existence. A layer above that is our purpose as a race and as individuals. Wrapped around this is a lot of science. I mean, a lot of science.As we saw with "Inception," Nolan gets way in over his head explaining stuff most movie-going minds simply can't grasp. If you thought characters in "Inception" existed solely to help explain stuff to the audience, "Interstellar" has a whole slew of these folks. Somehow, Nolan gets away with it, hoping you'll be blinded by your own curiosity and distracting you with the film's good looks.Technically, "Interstellar" could be studied again and again. There's so much to take in beyond the themes and scientific theories and the emotion of characters lightyears apart. Whether it's the computer animation of black holes, the editing of scenes on earth with scenes on a planet in an unknown galaxy, or Hans Zimmer's off-the-wall but powerful score, there's an abundance of technical detail that will undoubtedly be recognized come the Academy Awards. "Interstellar" is no less ambitious in these regards as well. Having the privilege of seeing the film in 70mm IMAX, the experience of the film compares favorably with last year's "Gravity" only more epic in scope.Nolan's philosophy behind the camera for the space scenes of "Interstellar" is to pick his angles and be patient. The major sequences get repetitive in terms of shots and last unusually long in some instances to deprive us of the instant gratification we've come to expect from traditional blockbusters. It creates the desperation of space, the feeling that every decision is crucial and one small thing can send everything spiraling into chaos. The storytelling allows for plenty of this too. Nolan and his brother Jonathan take their time for the first half of the movie, but deliver on the palm-sweating scenes that big movies like this necessitate. I will validate the feelings of those who struggle to take the leaps that that Nolans ask of us in this movie. Given the film is based on theory, it's hard not to question the likelihood of the events and to occasionally check out because you're not able to "go there" with the filmmaker. "Interstellar" has more of these moments than "Inception," but probably because the concept of "Inception" is already far-fetched unrealistic. That film played by its own rules, "Interstellar" has to play with the rules of the universe. Yet everywhere the Nolans take the story ultimately services the emotional story deep within the plot holes and incomprehensible events. The film's biggest "WTF" moment, for example, proves to be one of its most emotional. It's one thing when a film gets so big it loses sight of its characters, but that does not happen in "Interstellar," as you would rightfully expect from any Nolan film.At the same time, "Interstellar" also exposes Nolan's storytelling process, like taking a microscope to something beautiful and seeing the grossness of how it all works. The sheer magnitude of telling this story allows you to see the contrivances that make it all work, in the same way plot holes become more obvious in certain types of films. Everything from the purpose of characters to their names, like Murphy. The dialogue also reveals itself as fitting a category such as expository or theme-building. The use of the Dylan Thomas poem "Do not go gently into that good night" is frankly overbearing rather than something that subtly illuminates the film's ideas. On the other hand, look closely enough at the technical elements and they demonstrate what a triumph "Interstellar" is in that regard. While you could argue Nolan's storytelling ambitions exceed his reach in this film, you can't levy much criticism at the visual storytelling. Easy to say, perhaps, for someone who saw the film in IMAX 70mm as intended, but what other filmmakers are pushing the artistic boundaries of film on a multi-million-dollar blockbuster scale? James Cameron and Peter Jackson, that's about it. The audacity of "Interstellar" is therefore the best thing about it and the worst, but what a thrill to take this cinematic journey into rarely treaded epic filmmaking territory with one of the world's greatest cinematic minds.
It's hard to argue that "Apocalypse Now" is anything but one of the top three war films if not the best ever made. There's just nothing wrong with it. Sure, there might be parts that don't resonate as well and the film certainly doesn't broadcast its messages in the most direct of ways, but confusion has nothing to say to the film's breathtaking visuals and impeccable post-production craftsmanship.Francis Ford Coppola's non-"Godfather" masterpiece is a Vietnam update of the classic Joseph Conrad novel "Heart of Darkness." Capt. Willard (Sheen) is ordered on a mission to travel up a river in Vietnam to find a former army Col. Walter Kurtz (Brando), who has gone "rogue" and taken charge of a local tribe. Willard is ordered to terminate Kurtz ... with extreme prejudice. With a band of ordinary soldiers, he travels upriver on a patrol boat on a mission that drastically changes his perspective.It's funny, because what most people look for in movies -- great story, epiphany, great acting -- are not the strongest points of "Apocalypse Now." The film is a masterpiece of the more technical aspects of film as well as of direction. To start with, the cinematography is the most incredible of any war movie made before "Saving Private Ryan." The lights, the glare spots, the explosions and the jarring but effective changes in color palettes are so impressive that they tell a story in themselves and that's about the highest compliment that element of a film can receive.Sound-wise, helicopter blades dominate the first significant chunk of this film and they begin to haunt you as a sound of war and danger, not to mention the challenges of mixing sound when that noise is so overpowering. The way it's all strung together is bound to be under- appreciated considering how much is going on and that the plot demands a lot of our attention."Apocalypse Now" has a complex view of war that goes way beyond mere protest. In fact, it's not about war, but the good and evil inside of the persons stuck in the middle of it. It's about the choices humans make in dealing with the complicated forces inside them beckoning them to do one or the other and how war puts an incredible and terrible strain on that process.I watched "Apocalypse Now Redux," the 2001 re-edit of the film including nearly 50 minutes extra footage. Having not seen the original but knowing which scenes were added, I think the extra footage makes a difference. Scenes involving the stranded Playmates and the French woman who takes kindly to Willard add a sensuality to the film that brings a new layer of meaning to the journey of Willard and the young PBR crew. It make it all the more apparent just how out of place these soldiers were in Vietnam and why the US couldn't "win" despite more than adequate numbers.Although I make a point to emphasize the production elements of the film, the script by John Milius and Coppola along with Michael Herr's narrative additions is worthy of the utmost praise. The way Willard's journey allows him to understand more about the man he's after and pushes him into Kurtz's shoes is one of the clearer points of the film and the turning points are all based around it. Dennis Hopper's photojournalist character spouting off T.S Eliot poetry and Brando's improvisations murky the water a bit, but the impact is fierce as the film concludes and the incredible presence of Brando commands our attention."Apocalypse Now" has a lot to say and maybe too little time (despite the film's length) to say it, but few films leave the impression on so many artistic levels that this war epic does. Despite the beauty, Coppolla doesn't glorify war so much as make a bone-chilling and awing spectacle of it. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
They've done it again. The 2010 hit "Despicable Me" offered up a kind of family-friendly entertainment that only a cold-hearted cynic could actually despise. Its "Looney Tunes"-like slapstick offered light and lovable counter-programming to the visually stunning and emotion- filled animated films of the big studios such as DreamWorks and Pixar. In "Despicable Me 2," Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures apply the "if it ain't broke..." approach and have churned out a sequel that in every way lives up to its predecessor.This achievement isn't exactly staggering. As enjoyable as the first film was, it fell squarely into kid-focused entertainment with a hidden entertainment value for adults. The gags were mostly physical, immature and celebrated violence as a means to a laugh. Nothing has changed with "Despicable Me 2." Fortunately, the quad team of directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud with writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul works just hard enough to keep the "Despicable" shtick fresh.The film reacquaints us with Gru (Steve Carell) as he adapts to life without super-villainy while taking care of his adopted girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes. Suddenly, he's abducted by the Anti- Villain League and brought to their underwater headquarters by the eccentric agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig). They explain a villain has stolen a very dangerous serum of sorts and request Gru's help as a former super-villain. Gru gives them the cold shoulder the first time around, but naturally changes his mind. Teamed up with Lucy, they narrow their search to a local mall, where Gru discovers a man he thinks to be the famed and presumably dead villain El Macho (Benjamin Bratt).The villain of the movie remains a mystery though his plan involves kidnapping Gru's lovable minions. That said, plot doesn't hold much weight when it comes to enjoying "Despicable Me 2," as was the case with the first film. The movie instead rides on the success of its antics, be it slapstick or subtle, clever humor  or even a combination of both as is frequently the case.In terms of heart-warming family themes, "Despicable Me 2" opts for cliché. As a single father, Gru is highly motivated by keeping the young Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) away from boys and the neighborhood housewives are all intent with fixing him up. His girls, especially Agnes, are all excited by the possibility of having a mom, and looking around the options are ... pretty clear.Sticking to the mold isn't as easy as it probably should be, so props to Illumination Entertainment for matching the hype. As such, "Despicable Me 2" shouldn't find many detractors. At the same time, it remains a fun diversion in comparison to animated films from DreamWorks and Pixar, which (mostly) continue to innovate rather than stick to a formula while delivering a similar caliber of entertainment.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1" takes a drastic turn from the previous two entries of North America's biggest active movie franchise, but any fan of Suzanne Collins' trilogy could tell you that was coming; what doesn't change is the series' devotion to character-driven drama. In fact, it takes center stage.The games that defined the original "Hunger Games" and "Catching Fire" are long gone in this entry; Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has been taken to District 13, which exists entirely underground, where it has developed a massive operation aimed at revolting against the Capitol. President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and her trusted adviser Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) try to enlist Katniss as the Mockingjay, the face of the revolution, but she requires some convincing seeing as Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is in the Capitol's clutches."Mockingjay Part 1" takes on the tone of a political thriller with 13 and the Capitol engaged in a chess match and Katniss and Peeta serving as their respective pawns. This is dramatically different, almost a 180 from the previous installments  those films were about survival and the main characters' lives were at stake; this film is about psychological warfare with the entire world of Panem at stake. Although "Catching Fire" does transition into a larger scale, it still ultimately becomes about the games.Consequently, "Mockingjay Part 1" lacks in action and tries to make up for it in intrigue and suspense. At many points that suspense is quite effective, but screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong hope it will serve as a substitute for action sequences. Well, that's not how blockbusters work. Ultimately, the decision to split the book "Mockingjay" into two parts feels like the real culprit for the film's flaws. There's a ton of build-up, but very little payoff, probably because the payoff comes in "Part 2."Otherwise, director Francis Lawrence really makes the most out of the story. This is a darker, much more introspective film, and seeing as those darker, introspective moments in "Catching Fire" worked so well, he doesn't struggle making the jump with to more of them in "Mockingjay Part 1." He's careful to give the other Lawrence, Jennifer, the time she needs to communicate what Katniss is struggling with to the audience. The change in this film turns Katniss' motivation from survival to something bigger  to the choice she must make about leading this revolution. Her wants and desires start to get foggy and the film does a pretty good job of making sense of her, honing in on her protective instinct.The film also does really nice things with Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Effie (Elizabeth Banks). Before, they were colorful one-dimensional side characters; now, the way the start of this revolution has shaken them from their previous wants and desires comes through. We see a totally raw, emotional side of Effie, for example, that stands out among the better character components of the film. We also spend more time with Gale (Liam Hemsworth), seeing as Peeta remains rather distant from the plot of this third chapter.All the character development is lovely, but the lack of action really makes "Mockingjay Part 1" drag. Toward the end you can really feel the plot stalling and the movie selling us small parts of the book as big climactic sequences. In order to make what was actually half of a story feel like a whole story, certain liberties need to be taken or scene/sub-plots added (take "The Hobbit" trilogy for instance). "Mockingjay Part 1" doesn't really do that, it just tries to exaggerate what's already there."The Hunger Games" franchise continues to deliver multi-dimensional storytelling and character development (in an extremely mature way for a mass-appeal PG-13 blockbuster) with "Mockingjay Part 1," but it's missing the fun, sit-back-and-enjoy factor a movie of its kind ought to have. Even if you disagree that a huge event movie doesn't need to be action-packed, you can't disagree that this one feels longer and more dragged out than it needs to be given the summation of what happens. As slow as it might be, however, it should prove to be a pretty huge set up for a more exciting and satisfying finale.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more
After massively underestimating how to follow-up the first "Die Hard" film, John McTiernan was the one who took back the reigns ... with a vengeance. Although it deviates from the one-location danger scenario of the first two films, deciding to take a crazy hell-bent ride around New York City, it brings the winning elements that disappeared in "Die Hard 2" and brings them back while adding bigger action and suspense.After giving up control of the director's seat to Renny Harlin for the "Die Hard 2" in order to make "The Hunt for Red October," McTiernan, couldn't have been pleased to see the direction the franchise was going and it must've contributed to his decision to produce "Die Hard: With a Vengeance" almost five years later. It's a good thing, because if a third Die Hard had been greenlit by anyone else, the results probably wouldn't have been the same.Taken from a Jonathan Hensleigh script that was once it's own film called "Simon Says" and changed to fit the character of rebellious cop hero John McClane (Willis), "With a Vengeance" definitely feels like its own film. A few elements are carried over, such as the villain is the brother of first movie baddie Hans Gruber, whose name is Simon (Jeremy Irons), but the premise is unique to the franchise. Instead of one location like the tower in the first and the airport in the second, "With a Vengeance" makes New York City its playground and challenges McClane with riddles and time trials to avoid civilian casualties. It's different for the series, but Hensleigh works in McClane nicely and even gives him a bad-ass buddy in Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Zeus Carver, a Harlem electrician that gets dragged into McClane's mess and accuses everyone of being crazy "Pulp Fiction"-style.Most important is the return of a distinct antagonist. "Die Hard 2" did not have a strong villain and McClane's peril did not seem as pressing. If cinema has learned any lesson from the James Bond franchise, it's don't let your antagonist go faceless. "With a Vengeance" learns this lesson and insures itself by making this villain related to the one in the first film. Irons is great. Not Alan Rickman great, but great."With a Vengeance" is full of exciting action sequences from taxi drives through central park (on the grass, that is) to an explosion in the subway. The riddle-me-this thriller does seem forced, but there's certainly no lack of excitement and the twist halfway through makes it all well worth it.The only thing to dislike about the movie is it's harsh confrontation of racism. Jackson plays this white-wary black man who makes everything about race. The Lethal Weapon series has always been fine just pairing a white and black cop, but the script awkwardly forces this racial dialogue into "With a Vengeance" instead of making the tension between McClane and Carver just natural personality clash.But it's a big upgrade from "Die Hard 2," and for the other fans disappointed with the sequel, it apologizes for that quite well. I suppose "Die Hard" 'purists' who wouldn't approve of McClane having a "partner" in this movie or its riddle-oriented structure might not enjoy it as much of the original, but on the entertainment scale, it's easily on par.
Compelling figures make for compelling drama. Compelling characters who feel ordinary make for award-worthy drama. The script that David Seidler assembled into "The King's Speech" using purely research taps into a story that's simply gold: a British monarch, whom we are accustomed to view as having an inherent infallibility, with a speech impediment that makes him seem just as human as any of us. Director Tom Hooper might be relatively new to the game, but he understands his film's fundamental core  that we all have an impediment about which we are self-conscious, that plants seeds of self-doubt  and he seizes that empathy to create a universally delightful film.Hooper also must've had a bit of fortune to work with a production crew this keen. "The King's Speech" is dressed in pristine fashion. From set direction down to costumes, there's a surprising amount of beauty in every shot and so much to appreciate about the effort gone into creating pre-World War II England. Standing at the center of it all as the subject of this art piece is Colin Firth, who did so similarly in last year's "A Single Man" for which he was also nominated for an Oscar.Firth plays Prince Albert ("Bertie"), the Duke of York, who went on to become King George VI after his father died and his elder brother abdicated. Developing a stammer at a young age, he preferred to stay out of the spotlight. As he grew older and had a family with wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) and duty called, he needed to overcome it to be able to lead his people. Presented with the challenge of playing a proud figure of regality with a damning flaw, Firth succeeds through and through. Between himself and Hooper's direction, we are successfully led to identify on a personal level with this character of royalty. Yet as much as King George becomes humanized, Firth also captures that slight regal self-importance, that sense of what separates him from us, and in doing so he creates a fantastically rounded character. Bonham Carter follows suit: she presents Elizabeth as mostly wife, one concerned for yet incredibly supportive of her husband. Her priority is to show a sensible, humbled and relatable woman first, then a duchess/queen second.To connect us to the characters and story, Hooper zooms in and out of various levels of storytelling. Sometimes we are one with the king, feeling his emotions or at times literally seeing what he's seeing. Sometimes we take a step back from that, but still within the royal family's trusted circle, analyzing the characters by microscope. Occasionally it's a bit more passive as the story takes a more political turn. In the few instances when "The King's Speech" dulls, it's usually when that lens is in place. The story works best when its most personal, when we connect with it.Mostly that's whenever Geoffrey Rush graces the screen. As an Australian-born speech therapist with no medical credentials, Rush's Lionel Logue makes for the only "commoner" in the entire film. Although his methods are unorthodox and he has a terrific sense of humor, Rush transcends the "quirky genius doctor" type, as he understands the complexity of Logue's relationship with the king: the conflicting desire to be both humble before his majesty as well as an effective speech coach. The tension here derives from a fundamental difference in belief: whereas Bertie sees speech as a physical obstacle, Logue understands its roots are deeply psychological and tied into his personal matters. Naturally, a man of royalty would have trouble expressing private thoughts to a "common" man, but Logue breaks his shell, slowly but surely.In part, Logue gets the King of England to understand the importance of his voice as a symbol, as the foremost expression of individuality and as something he's entitled to possess and express. Although a king feels the strain of this importance hundred-fold, that message has value to everyone. Perhaps that theme seems elementary, but "The King's Speech" is brilliant because we experience it, we come to see that on our own in watching sublime actors humanize royal characters and a director who captures that humanity.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"The Lost Weekend" portrays alcoholism in such a harrowing and uncomfortable manner by todays standards; in 1945, with Prohibition fresh in the mind, it must have been nothing short of socially monumental in its portrayal of addiction.Having made the noir classic "Double Indemnity" just a year earlier, Billy Wilder brings some of that genre's striking visual style to this tale of a writer lost in an alcoholic fog. The mystery of "The Lost Weekend," however, is of an entirely different nature. Although Don Birnam (Ray Milland) has a straightforward problem, it's the solution that can't be found easily.Birnam is a conundrum of a character in that his actions and behaviors are so predictable yet so hard to sympathize with and understand. His motivation is clear as day: find his next drink, but his persistent lying and unwillingness to take steps toward recovery is ever the mystery to the sober among us.The script focuses on providing Wilder the framework to paint a portrait of alcoholism at its worst. If Wilder weren't so talented at his craft and Milland so utterly convincing in spite of the stagy nature of his character, "The Lost Weekend" would've been an exaggerated public service announcement at best.Wilder allows us to  with the very best of tactics available to him in the '40s  experience sensorily the nature of Don's condition. A modern take would likely have employed a trippy Terry Gilliam-style approach to more easily achieve that effect, but Wilder did not have the luxury, effectively putting the weight entirely on Milland.Don is at first quite detestable, but the more we see him, the more we begin to understand rather than scold his complete lack of self-control. Toward the end, Milland's performance verges on squeezing pity from us, but the film's strength turns out to be the shift in consciousness that it creates in all those who see it. No one could finish this movie and not understand alcoholism as a disease, not just a person's utter disregard for the wellness of themselves and those around them.Jane Wyman's Helen provides that entry point into the film, as does the way she clashes with Wick (Phillip Terry), Don's brother. Helen believes that with a little guidance Don can get better, but Wick sees him as hopeless. We know today which one of them is right, but it doesn't hinder the effectiveness of the debate between them. Through them we start to form our own opinions about if and how Don can beat his condition.Visually, however, not enough praise can be given to how Wilder approaches the film, especially the way everything fits into the frame so gracefully while being both suspenseful and hard-hitting. Even with the many scattered moments in which it drags, the film keeps our attention on Don's every move.Outside of the '40s, "The Lost Weekend" is more of a feat of strong visual storytelling and memorable imagery, but put the context back into it and you have a bold and daring film that makes a real statement. Regardless, there's plenty to praise about "The Lost Weekend." ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site, moviemusereviews.com
The moment "Moornise Kingdom" graces the screen, it is a Wes Anderson film. The first major sequence, the symmetrical exploration of the Bishop house, couldn't be mistaken for any other filmmaker's style  nor could the rest of the film, honestly. So if Anderson is just as divisively quirky as ever, why has "Moonrise Kingdom" resonated with audiences more than any of his previous work? Surely it can't just be the absence of any Wilson brothers.In the '60s, on the island of New Penzance somewhere in New England, Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) have run away together. Sam, a foster child, has "resigned" from the Khaki Scouts; Suzy, the fiction-loving elder daughter of the well-off Bishop family, feels isolated and ignored. Their innocent tryst sets the Khaki Scouts, led by Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton), Police Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Mr. and Mrs. Bishop (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) on a search of the island.Anderson wastes no time plunging into this story, to the point where you'll wonder if the film is nearly over when in actuality it's maybe halfway through. The simplicity of two 12-year-olds running away makes it rather engaging, but more importantly there's a sweetness to that notion that creates more of an emotional interest too.That's where you can start to see what makes "Moonrise Kingdom" arguably Anderson's best. It's like any other Anderson film in that it deals with family dynamics and the adult characters have serious maturity problems, but it stands out in that Sam and Suzy are the clear main characters. Something about Anderson's style, particularly with his dialogue, works surprisingly well with young characters, possibly because we expect a certain quirkiness and immaturity from kids that can sometimes come off as annoying from the mouths of adults. It's in part what made his breakthrough film "Rushmore" so good.Gilman and Hayward were cast exceptionally well too. Sam is incredibly smart for his age but has a naive confidence that Gilman pulls off as a dorky-looking kid capable of sharp facial expressions. Hayward, done up like young Margot Tenenbaum, has the look of a pretty young girl yet to come into her own who's rather reserved but capable of surprising things (like violence). They're an odd match, but they completely capture the notion of young, curious love that will guaranteed bring back those kinds of memories for viewers.The adults aren't forgettable, but in supporting roles it maximizes their funny factor. They're completely ignorant to the needs of the kids and though they chastise Sam and Suzy's romance, they fare no better themselves. We can laugh at them as well as with them. For those wondering about Willis, his reserved manner of speaking, even in action films, makes him a great fit for Anderson."Moonrise Kingdom" has a "Romeo & Juliet" quality to it as well, from the prologue that warns of an impending storm to hit New Penzance to Bob Balaban's other inserted transitions as the narrator. This contrasts but also enhances the film's cheeky tone: the relationship between the kids is the sincere and genuine core around which the rest of the film's quirkiness gravitates. We experience a vested interest in the outcome that's regularly interrupted by Anderson's shenanigans. It's a constant back-and-forth of cinema and fairy tale but not in a jarring sense, which is what has made Anderson a stand-out director of the last 15 or so years.Those who have always identified with Anderson and love most of his films might not find much difference between "Moonrise" and the rest of his resume, but those who struggle with "The Royal Tenenbaums" and "The Life Aquatic" to some extent will find something extremely refreshing about "Moonrise Kingdom." Frankly, it's his most accessible film (unless you count the family-geared "Fantastic Mr. Fox"): the story his most straightforward, his dry humor at its punchiest. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

This does not star Kurt Russell, but rather allows him what amounts to an extended cameo. This work is more centered around the "son of" story line than it is the actual super heroes themselves, thereby failing to deliver the appropriate level of entertainment, and contributing instead, that enigmatic substance known as "kid appeal." I expected more. But having said that, there is more to this work than meets the eye. The story is modeled after the old classic "B" science fiction movies we hate to love, but do. The effects are nothing spectacular, but are still above what you would expect, all things considering. And beneath the camp, lies a stronger feeling, reminiscent of a classic superhero story, yet it still fails to achieve the desired affect; if only marginally.It was entertaining and I still had great fun in watching it.This rates an 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.
Living in the modern era of overdone vampire stories, "The Lost Boys" makes for a worthy retro antidote. With films and TV shows full of characters who simply are vampires these days, "Lost Boys" reminds us how part of the allure of the vampire is the mystery and suspense created by not exactly knowing if someone is a vampire or even better  suspecting it.Although it doesn't take long to realize who the vampires are in "The Lost Boys," it doesn't make their reveal any less effective. The '80s hair biker gang led by Kiefer Sutherland as David has the trappings of an iconic cinema cult of renegades who revel in their immortality. The story holds out on reviewing their true form long enough for us to take them seriously. Brothers and main characters Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) serve as perfect entry points into this vampire-infested world of small-town California. After their mom (Dianne Wiest) forces them to move in with their grandfather, Michael and Sam each uncover strange things in their new town. After chasing a girl (Jami Gertz), Michael gets caught up in this mysterious gang and finds himself avoiding sunlight among other things. When Sam takes notice, he enlists the help of the Frog brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), two comic book geeks who moonlight as vampire killers."The Lost Boys" bathes in '80s film cheese. There's boy-sees-girl-across-the-room romance, a comic book store, a carnival, gangs ... the list goes on. The film epitomizes that decade in movies, which either makes it corny or classic. I would argue that as the plot thickens, it moves from the former to the latter.The key to the film's effectiveness is the slow unveiling of the vampires. The scene in the tree where they show Michael what he has become by turning into their vampire forms and attacking their pray has a massive impact. Although we never see the transformations in process thanks to budget issues most likely, the colored contacts, make up and Joel Schumacher's approach are enough to freak you out in all the right ways. The cumulative amount of blood and guts at the climax also adds that cult-classic horror camp that will put a stupid grin on the face of any of the genre's fans.Horror elements and vampires aside, "The Lost Boys" is 100 percent '80s through and through with themes of broken families, fitting in and losers saving the day. It undoubtedly inspired some of the films of the early '90s as well. In that sense, it's not just a fun film, but an important one.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
It might seem strange at first to say independent film has become mildly formulaic, but it's slightly true. The salvation, however, comes in the form of originality. "Thumbsucker" has a lot of both and the result is a satisfying but not overly empowering movie."Thumbsucker" pulls together a cast that is no doubt impressive. There's everyone from mainstream actors like Vince Vaughn and Keanu Reeves to not as marquee but respected talents like Tilda Swinton and Benjamin Bratt. Most of the characters are very original and interesting which seems to either result in great success or a lapse in identification with the story. For example, the father, played by Vincent D'Onfrio seems to have a little to no parenting skills and while it makes an interesting character, it's a bit discomforting to be at peace with a character like that actually possibly existing.The biggest Indie flaw is that there seems to be no thematic direction in the film. The ideas in the film are broad and precisely what the writer and even director are commenting on is too hard to pinpoint and the story unfolds. There is the thumbsucking habit, but there is also drug issues, fidelity, etc. It's not that there is no message, it simply takes more work to decode--the plot does not suggest to the viewer what things should be considered thematically. It takes some serious thinking to link all the many happenings in the film together.There are some really great moments and characters going on in "Thumbsucker," but as a whole there doesn't seem to be a specific motion to the film and it loses some of the charm that many family-centered indies often provide.
While the title of mob masterpiece most often goes to "The Godfather" for its stunning drama and dark beauty, something must be said for honesty. Those two points belong to Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas," which plays up the highs and lows of gangster life in cold truth, without any jazzed-up one-liners or thematic scores, with only honest-to-goodness storytelling and direction.Some crime films rely on characters killing or torturing people in crazy and memorable ways, but in "Goodfellas," when the only nutty character, Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), blows his fuse a few times, it feels jarring and unnatural, not cool or awing in any way. It's because to Scorsese, these people are real, this is their life, and a hit is a hit because that's how they do things -- there's not a production to be made out of it. The film, based on true events with much consultation from the real life people who were being portrayed in the film, focuses on gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and how the mob raised him and gave him everything he had, brought him the highest of highs and took him pretty low -- might have even killed him had he not entered the Witness Protection Program in the '80s. Scorsese isn't brilliant in this film. It's not visionary. Leave that for some of his other films -- this is just incredibly good storytelling. "As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster" is not a memorable line that pulls you in at the film's beginning because it was inspired writing -- it's Scorsese understanding how to take a script and bring it to life in the best way possible. The only truly artistic work being done is some of the camera shots and compelling angles. He finds the script's best moments and adds something to them. Otherwise, he is telling this story, he is making a cinematic homage to this incredible true story as penned by Nicholas Pileggi.Of course it helps that the actors he had to work with were top notch. Following him from "Raging Bull" among other films were Robert DeNiro and Pesci as Jimmy and Tommy. Both characters are easily provoked, sometimes irrational men with big mouths their hearts in the right place despite actions to the contrary. Pesci is particularly memorable between the "in what way am I funny?" and "deer paw" scenes, a deserved Oscar for great character work. As for Liotta, his great strength is swaying our opinion of him back and forth with his various infidelities yet natural charms -- it's a role that had Scorsese cast 15 years later would have gone to the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, so let that stand as some acclaim for Liotta. It is also this dichotomy of warm support and foul-mouthed matter-of-factness that makes us feel conflicted as we watch the entire film. It doesn't elicit pity for the mafia, but it certainly complicates the "wiseguy" stereotype, which I think is much of Scorsese's goal."Goodfellas" only lacks in an emotional or cathartic pull. Many times you wonder why this story is being told, but then you realize how incredibly well it's told and you acknowledge that it's some of the finest film-making out there, regardless how it makes you feel.
"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly" is cool with brains. Most other action films, especially westerns, are celebrations of cool, but this film masters cool -- heck, practically invents it -- and also applies it sensibly. Nothing is merely for cool's sake, it is for the sake of telling a story full of mistrust as well as one that searches for depth in the blanket adjectives of its title.Set in the West during the Civil War, the film identifies its characters right away: The Good, Blondie (Eastwood), The Bad, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly, Tuco (Eli Wallach). Each is after nothing but money, making the word associations merely relative to the principles that they live by. Distrusting of one another, they are soon forced to work together -- specifically Tuco and Blondie -- in order to find 200 K in buried gold, because one of them knows which cemetery it's buried in and the other knows which grave.Gold is also every word that comes out of Clint Eastwood's mouth. Although his body of work today is enough proof of his talent, he clearly owes much of his career to director/writer Sergio Leone. In this their third western collaboration, Leone knows what Eastwood's strengths are and he gives him some killer lines. Every man supposedly wants to be James Bond, but every American man should want to be Blondie. Every time he speaks, you know you're either going to be impressed or enlightened with his machismo and/or wisdom. Wallach is also invaluable to the film as Tuco. He keeps things interesting playing a money- grubbing rat. In a film of this length, he helps keep things from getting too serious and dull.Leone also hones his craft in this movie. His gritty close-ups and split-second gunfire shots give this film its style, suspense and power. There's some "it" quality to his film-making that is hard to describe, but every shot feels important or at the least cool. Distinct "chapter" breaks also contribute to the Western mythos/tall tale idea that has made the genre an important one of the 20th century. There is a clear journey-like story line that recalls what made Homer's "The Odyssey" one of the first great Western (in the global sense) literary classics. There is a clear objective with obvious obstacles, unlikely partnerships and plenty of surprises.If all that wasn't enough, there's the score. Ennio Morricone not only provides one of the most memorable themes in movie music history, but the timing of the music, the way it lifts the important scenes up into a realm of cinematic immortality is unlike anything before or since it. It's exciting and epic when it needs to and it's suspenseful and emotional when the action gets intense. With so much silence in this film, picking the right moments to break it is challenging, but Morricone nails it. And if it doesn't do all that for you, well, it's still cool."The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" proves that all three of those descriptors are relative. It's no great revelation, but it's interesting to see how you watch and form opinions of characters assigned to general moral stereotypes and then to see how those opinions are affected as the film goes on. If that's too deep, than at the least you can appreciate how cool everything is.
"Kung Fu Panda" is not your typical cgi product from the precisely calibrated Dreamworks animated animal film machine. While first glance at a trailer or poster will have you believing that the cgi family film powerhouse has simply extended its range to include the animals native to the far east, Dreamworks has just used those techniques to sell you a film that actually deviates from the formula with which we have become so accustomed. I wouldn't go as far as to call "Panda" innovative, but more so that it stays fresh amidst the over- processed films of its kind."Panda" stars Jack Black as Po, the overweight Panda who is the son of a noodle-making goose. While Po's father hopes to pass down the noodle-making business, of course Po dreams otherwise. He loves the world of ancient kung fu and his idols are the Furious Five, five kung fu-trained animals that serve to protect the village. When the kung fu palace's old master has a vision of bad things to come, a dragon warrior must be chosen to fight this evil and Po, trying to see who will be named, appears to accidentally get chosen. The first thing this movie does right is focus on Po. Po is lovable because he tries hard and dreams big despite his obvious flaws and his humor--via Jack Black--is the one part of the film that doesn't take itself seriously. As a result, Po is probably the easiest character to identify with in the entire cannon of Dreamworks animated films. While the voices of the Furious Five include Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu and more, and their master is played by Dustin Hoffman, these actors are purely supporting, proving they were brought in merely to sell the film. While some people might be disappointed, it's the right thing for this film. Po's journey is enough to focus on. While I expected Hoffman, for example, to really make the part his own, he stays very true to the written character. Any no-names could have played the 5 and considering the movie is still enjoyable despite it, that's a very good thing.Perhaps the most commendable aspect of "Panda" is its family-friendly comedy. There aren't more than 5 or so jokes that make you laugh really hard like the "Shrek" franchise does, but those movies were funny because they slipped in jokes for a PG-13 or higher audience. This film appeals to kids, teens, adults and the like without doing that stuff, by relying on already-present humor and not looking toward outside sources/pop culture references. In 30 years, it is possible this movie will be looked at by young audiences as funnier than "Shrek" because of this and it should. Boys and Men will also find this film appealing in its spectacular action sequences, namely when the villain Tai Lung escapes. The smartly conceived fighting choreography is probably the most underrated aspect of the film."Panda" may never be more than cute, clever and fun, but a G film should be without trying to sneak in inappropriate jokes. This is truly a film reminiscent of Disney's wholesome animated days when it was about just writing stories people had to like. The overdone values of believing in yourself and making something out of who you are don't feel overdone in this film--they feel right. Next to the unrivaling unique "Ratatouille," "Panda" is right there when it comes to family-friendly wide-appeal films.
The most brilliant thing about "The Godfather: Part II" is that Oscar-winning director Francis Ford Coppola has seamlessly extended the original, and when I say seamless, I mean that Coppola has created a sequel that looks and feels like the original and actually makes the first film better. If I could, I would go back and change my rating of "The Godfather" to an 11 and make this a 10. With the exception of the Lord of the Rings films (and even that series didn't win two best pictures), no sequel can say that it strengthens the original film and that's why "Part II" is so good.At an epic 200 minutes long yet rarely boring, "Part II" tells not only the story of Don Michael Corleone (Pacino) as he takes over the family, but simultaneously tells the background of Don Vito Corleone (DeNiro) who was played by Brando in the original. To the modern viewer, DeNiro feels like a gimmick, but this was his first prestigious role and he is quite convincing as a younger version of Brando's performance. Leading man Pacino is incredibly commanding yet again as Michael as this time we see the weight of being Don grow heavier and heavier on his shoulders. As usual, it's too difficult to explain the "business" plot of the film, which has plenty of double-crossings and twists that the pervasive feeling of paranoia that is so ingrained in the original continues quite masterfully in this film.The acting talent is across the board so good that you have to give casting team and Coppola some of that credit. This film had three best supporting actor nominees at the Oscar's for goodness sake. If the Golden Globes that year had the best ensemble category, this film would have won it hands down. My personal favorite is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. I would trust him with my life too.Everything about this film is so well done (especially the set design for New York, Italy, Cuba, etc) that it's hard to notice sometimes because you're so drawn in to the plot and following it. Coppola makes you think something tragic can happen at any second and when it does, it always delivers. The ending sequence is something that directors have stolen left and right when trying to make their ending just as powerful. While "The Godfather" has more memorable scenes and dialogue, this film is a masterpiece in its own right despite not having as much glitz as the original.Of course, in terms of themes, "The Godfather: Part II" continues to address the original's themes in new and meaningful ways. The themes of what family truly is and means get expanded upon and become so complex as seen through Michael's relationship with his wife and brother Fredo. The back-in-time plot arch with Vito sheds additional light on the "Michael" part of the film as well. All of it just makes "Part II" a rock-solid classic.
Calling "The Hustler" a sports drama would be a gross mis-categorization. Outside of the film's first hour, you barely even see the action on the table. Director Robert Rossen understands that how "Fast" Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) wins or loses matters nothing compared to whether he wins or loses, and what the consequences are for the character.Based on the book by Walter Tevis, Felson is a pool shark who has been traveling all over the country with his partner and "agent," Charlie (Myron McCormick) hustling dopes in pool halls and walking out with a lot of cash. He then decides to go after the legendary Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). After taking Fats for $18,000, he lets his pride (and more notably his alcoholism) get in the way and he loses everything right back.Trying to get up on his feet again, Eddie meets Sarah (Piper Laurie), a fellow alcoholic, and the two are inescapably drawn to each other despite their vices (and knowing nothing about each other). Their relationship is a roller coaster, but they seem dependent on each other for support. Eventually, Eddie sees a way back up with a new backer in Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), but it could come at a price.Newman's charisma practically twinkles in this performance that you can't help but be impressed. Of course the trajectory of the character removes that twinkle very quickly, but not in any way diminishing Newman's work. The character is a classic '30s-'40s character, a man with potential he throws it away all too often to booze and has a quick temper. Fitting then that Rossen filmed in black and white (the reason this film has two instead of zero Oscars). Rossen's character-centric storytelling echoes the best directors of the '30s and '40s as well. You could almost argue it's the last great film of that era rather than a great one of its own, but using "neo" would probably be a better fit.Unlike a "sports drama," Rossen's script (written with Sidney Carroll) does an incredible job of only saying what needs to be said. "The Hustler" can be a little tough to follow sometimes because it leaves out the more expository dialogue, but the script ends up sharper for it. Scott's Bert is a force in the final leg of the film the way he engages the themes of winning vs. losing and what it means to have character. Newman also impressively navigates the whirlwind of his character to hit on the more thought-provoking notes of the script.Laurie also has some navigating to do as Sarah, also a character who could easily slip into the mold of the '30s-'40s love interest who lets herself get pushed around by her out-of-control beaux. At times she does, but she shows a certain resilience and independence uncommon of female characters, even in the '60s. The added complexity of her own vices and problems is also impressive. She gets some great dialogue too and really takes command of some of the scenes with Eddie and Bert."The Hustler" lacks in suspense, something you wouldn't expect from a drama centered on a gambling man who risks it all, but it makes up for it in character as well as themes and ideas that even contemporary films centered on a sport or game almost never consider taking on.As much as "The Hustler" echoes the past, nothing has truly followed in its footsteps since, discounting the sequel, "The Color of Money." It has its own place in film history and cannot be grouped or categorized with many other films both in terms of the era it was released in and in terms of genre. In some ways, that makes it a classic by default.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
So many movie musicals fail to clear the biggest hurdle of adapting a show to the big screen: they are directed by stage-minded individuals who struggle to re-imagine the work in a three-dimensional world. But not Rob Marshall. The biggest strength of "Chicago" is its seamless, stylish and poignant transitions that connect both the stage world of the 1920s Chicago jazz club scene along with the city's cold, corrupt and two-faced reality.Though the plot of "Chicago" is interesting, it's a musical first and foremost. It's all about the glitz and putting on a show, despite the plot focusing on two women that are wannabe stars stuck on death row for cold-blooded murder. It's true excellence shines through in how the musical numbers (both lyrically and visually) expand on the story or reveal greater truth to it and its characters.The marquee actors are interesting choices for a musical. Catherine Zeta-Jones pulls off her character, the shameless and brutally straightforward Velma Kelly, better than the others. Zeta-Jones really owns her part. Renee Zellweger (the protagonist, Roxie) and Richard Gere (her hot-shot attorney, Billy Flynn) both find great success with certain aspects of their characters, but don't really command the roles. Zellweger is great with the naive side of Roxie as well as her cunning, sassier side, but the serious, more dramatic elements lack a bit for her. Gere is great as the attorney whose only care is his cut, but not as much the debonair performer. Worthy of mention are also Queen Latifah taking a dramatic turn as prison warden Mama and John C. Reilly who will steal a lot of your heart with his soft, innocent performance. Though so minor, his number "Mr. Cellophane" will stick with you. Still, it's the lighting, the costumes, the choreography and this great interweave of numbers with scenes that dazzle in "Chicago." The musical numbers grow so subtly out from the scenes and the fade gently back into the story to create this effect on you and steal your breath. The musical numbers also do not depart or distance themselves entirely from the important parts of the script. Every number has something to say about a character or event. The best examples of that are the scenes revealing how much of a swindler Billy Flynn is. Since Roxie becomes his puppet, the number uses a marionette theme to show how Roxie and the press are being controlled by how he spins things. The marionette costumes and choreography turn an ordinary song, "We Both Reached for the Gun" into one of the best scenes. It's so good that it would have just as much success on stage as it does in the movie.Without even having to explain this concept to you, screenwriter Bill Condon and Marshall are able to clearly demonstrate that the musical numbers are either imagined by the characters or are sort of third-person artistic re-tellings of the action going on in the story. They build on this understanding by creating these incredible transitions that make the music really echo what the film says about over-dramatization of life and how the events in the film, the press conferences, the trial--it's all a big show. Rarely does a movie musical come along and not only work just in terms of moving onto the screen, but also evolve and grow in this new medium.
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" is not an exercise in exciting murder mystery. The plot is generally unexciting and unoriginal. But all it needs to be is enough to give this ground- breaking mixture of animation and live action room to reach it's potential -- enough to make sure all the cartoon/human jokes could be made and all the muscles of the technology flexed. That's what makes "Roger Rabbit" fascinating the whole way through. You're almost left intrigued only to see if they're going to be able to pull it off the whole movie.Roger Rabbit is a Bugs Bunny rip-off who in this world is a working actor that has a trouble- making reputation. When a toon-film mogul named R.K Maroon wants to send a message to Roger to get his act together, he hires a P.I named Eddie Valiant, the film's whiskey-swilling film noir-esquire protagonist, to follow Roger's red-headed bombshell (and animated) wife, Jessica, who might be having an affair with the head of ACME, the man who owns Toon- Town -- where everything animated lives. When Roger learns of Jessica's "affair," it's not long before he's framed for ACME's murder. Valiant reluctantly befriends the rabbit and takes his case.One of the impressive things about the film is it obtained rights to both Warner Bros. and Disney characters. There are countless appearances and part of the fun is picking out which characters are from what. It's a tribute to the world of cartoons by projecting how cartoon characters would act if they were real. That's much of the humor right there of this inventive film. There's a unique cartoon-induced style to all the jokes, fusing the world of live action and 2D brilliantly together. It's in this spirit that a film like "Roger Rabbit" works and that a film just putting the two together for visual effect falls short.It's also a film for adults. A child would get some of the hijinx, but it's definitely not an appropriate kids film. It comes from the adult perspective on cartoons and plays off the maturity of an audience that grew up loving cartoons.The only thing the movie lacks other than a bit more of a creative plot structure is good acting. Christopher Lloyd is always a fan favorite (he skyrocketed director Robert Zemeckis' previous film "Back to the Future"), but Bob Hoskins is not leading man material. He's great at interacting with nobody (after all, most of his scenes take place with actors that were drawn in later), but there's the charm of star power missing from the film other than cameos by Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny."Roger Rabbit" is a classic in the sense that nothing else is like it and anything that's tried hasn't been as clever. Robert Zemeckis has made a career reinventing the way we see movies and this late 80s film marked just the beginning.
Anyone could market or even direct "The Conversation" as a mystery, but Francis Ford Coppola manages to reveal some of our human tendencies in his film just as well as he holds us in suspense. Voyeurism, like it or not, is a human characteristic. Modern day reality television proves both that point alone and simultaneously that "The Conversation" is an excellent film because it has only ripened over the years.Coppola's character Harry Caul, portrayed by Gene Hackman in one of his finest performances, is the embodiment of this guilty pleasure of spying on others whether covertly or casually. He's a professional wire-tapper, one of the best in the business, seemingly able to capture the most pristine recordings for all his clients even though he is rarely enlightened as to the purpose of his jobs. It's not too long before we learn that Harry is a devout Catholic who harbors a bit of guilt because his career founds itself on the don't ask, don't tell principle.The film open with what its title promises: a conversation. Harry has been hired to record a conversation of a man and a woman on their work break. The conversation seems inconspicuous, but the more Harry deals with his mysterious client and goes back to listen to the tapes, the more he begins to hear and infer from the conversation. He eventually comes to the conclusion he might have recorded a death warrant and begins to grow paranoid.Harry's complexity is the finest element of Coppola's script. The story develops slowly but Harry becomes a more peculiar figure in the viewer's mind as time wears on. At first it seems like he isolates himself for protection purposes, but his loneliness becomes more and more apparent. He constantly feels threatened and there feels like a layer of ice between him and his relationships in the film, especially two memorable scenes where he interacts with women.Coppola's elegant framing and precision pacing do the rest of the work drawing us further in as the story progresses, highlighting our own preoccupation with the truth behind this couple's conversation. We're made aware of our own tendency to twist words and misinterpret what someone is saying, not to mention how easy and commonplace it really is to essentially spy on someone and invade his or her privacy entirely."The Conversation" properly mixes drama with mystery while offering a complete character portrait and subtle social commentary. Most films don't have that many tools working for them but Coppola's masterful script does. No single element is consummate or overrides the rest, but together they make for a fine film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The Coen brothers have developed critical acclaim for making black comedies/awkward tragedies that depict small-time people getting in way over their heads, who for one reason or another are motivated to do things out of the ordinary because the natural order of the world and society has wronged them in some way. "A Serious Man," however, is about a man who doesn't do anything, to whom bad/annoying things happen. This story of a confused suburban Jewish man in the '60s wrestling with life's meaning is therefore an important step in the evolution of the Coens' theme-driven film-making. Borrowing on an autobiographical context (Minnesota, Judaism, etc.) for the brothers, it moves on to greater cosmic questions but with the same quirky and ironic spirit that have garnered the Coens all their deserved attention over the last 20 years.Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) is that one Coen brothers character in every movie -- you know, the innocent one who manages to suffer a seemingly unfair fate (think Steve Buscemi in "The Big Lebowski" or most recently Richard Jenkins' character in "Burn After Reading") -- only he gets to pilot this film. In that spirit, an unknown Stuhlbarg is cast in the lead (although he was clearly up for the challenge). Larry is a mild-mannered math professor with a family in an ideal suburban home only his wife wants a divorce and his kids are nightmarish. Little by little the annoyances of his life pile up from the foreign student trying to bribe him for a passing grade while simultaneously suing him for defamation to his socially immature brother (Richard Kind) who won't leave his house.Larry seeks answers from the rabbis in his community to understand the mess his life has suddenly become. One rabbi tells him he needs a change of perspective, another tells him the story of "The Goy's Teeth," a hilarious bit about a dentist who tries desperately to make meaning of a Hebrew message engraved in a patient's teeth only to find he was better off not worrying about it. None of their advice seems to help at the time -- but it's dead on. The Goy's Teeth scene in particular is one of the brilliant moments where the Coen brothers let you know pretty clearly what their intentions are with the film while giving you something to laugh about. That's their strength and it's all over "Serious Man."Much like "Burn After Reading," this film is one that makes a thematic point out of the audience's attempt to squeeze meaning out of everything. By turning Larry into a Job-like figure to whom inexplicable misfortune happens, we're forced to put everything into perspective. When Kind's character, Arthur, has a tantrum in the middle of the night wondering why God has given him nothing and he points out that Larry has kids and a job, suddenly our perspective changes. Suddenly everything we thought mattered in this film and was of critical importance is really not such a big deal. Our desperate search for answers in both our lives and in this film, our tendency to over-analyze and derive reason from everything comes to a halt; the Coen bros. have worked their magic again."Serious Man" is one of their best in recent memory because it not only feels rooted and personal for them, but it moves toward a greater discussion of previously treaded upon themes and plots from their previous work. It is a challenging film and those who have struggled with the Coen brothers before will struggle again, but for the cerebral and intellectual moviegoer it's outstanding. The truth is, we don't have all the answers to make sense of life's events (or a story's plot points) and neither do the Coen brothers. One insignificant character in the film who appears to have an answer to just one of Larry's myriad of minor problems dies instantly with hysterical irony. Don't go into "A Serious Man" looking for answers, go into it looking for a change of perspective. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
One of the best ways I can describe Julie Taymor's Beatles movie musical "Across the Universe" is schizophrenic. At one point you're watching a drama--then a music video--then an art piece--then an actual stage musical--then a raging acid trip--and back to a drama again. The good news is the film leaves you with its strongest form: drama musical, and it leaves you feeling good.The music is awesome. The arrangements of these Beatles songs are great, modern and given beautiful, fresh voices. It's a definite soundtrack buy. The only problem is that sometimes the songs are portrayed in the film in ways that don't work or that simply detract from what the viewer really wants to see and cares most about--the characters, specifically Jude (Jim Sturgess) and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) and their relationship. It gets cheated a lot in the film for characters that really don't matter in the end, yet we still care about them, so I guess that's what matters most.Basically, everything but the really "out there" musical-like sequences and the psychedelic scenes works. It's a constant guessing game and a fight as to which you're going to get with each song. The film can go for 20 minutes or so as a drama musical and then all of a sudden you get a scene like when Max (Lucy's brother played by Joe Anderson) goes to the army and you have dancing recruitment officers with abstract faces. Other scenes like "Strawberry Fields" gives a very emotional music video type feel that contrasts Jude's art with scenes of the Vietnam War. It is awesome and beautifully done by Taymor."Across the Universe" only suffers in this inconsistency. It could also use about 30 min shaved off. Otherwise it is a truly heartfelt love story with some of the best music of the 20th century. Fortunately, in the end, its best stuff comes out on top and leaves you with a generally if not overwhelmingly satisfying feeling. Without the excellent ending, you'd be left wondering what exactly the movie was trying to be. I'm still wondering just a bit, but I'm content with the general outcome.
Does the independent drama have a formula? "Sunshine Cleaning" is a  touching family/relationship drama with a great cast, but there's also  something incredibly familiar about it. For instance, there's Amy Adams  as Rose, a former high school cheerleader now a single mom without a  steady paycheck having an affair with a married man (Steve Zahn). What  I mean is, Rose Lorkowski is the prototype of the indie protagonist;  she's a lower- middle-class working woman with a boatload of personal  issues. As far as independent film characters go, she can get in line,  but the difference is clearly the charm of Adams.  As a film, "Sunshine" is a good but basic indie drama that goes as far  as its cast will take it. There might not be a more blossoming actress  than Adams. She showcased her sweetness in "Enchanted" and channeled  that into a sensitive but morally upright nun in "Doubt." Rose is a  natural progression: she's motivated, but has self-confidence issues.  Her sister Nora, played by British actress Emily Blunt, ("The Devil  Wears Prada") is another up-and-comer. Nora is unable to even keep a  job and she's still deeply affected by her mother's suicide when she  was little.  Together, the two go into the crime-scene clean-up business at the  recommendation of Rose's lover, which entails going into people's homes  to clean up bio-hazardous materials. It's an interesting concept, but  instead of expanding on it, rookie writer Megan Holley uses it merely  as the vehicle for familial drama and the personal journeys of her  characters. The dark humor potential of such a nasty and depressing  profession is underutilized, but the story still manages to unfold into  an intriguing relationship drama. At that point, it's all Adams, Blunt  and film veteran Alan Arkin as their father, who keep it real and  emotional.  Rose and Nora discover more of themselves and what they need in life  from their business. They realize what's been hampering the trajectory  of their lives and that family is vital no matter the disagreements.  This is nice -- and entirely true -- but it would've been nice to see  Holley and director Christine Jeffs take that to the next level instead  of settling for those familiar indie characteristics like unresolved  family issues and overcoming basic personal obstacles. Instead, we are  left to savor the performances of Adams and Blunt as they add gravity  and real-world weight to the story.
It's fair to say Luc Besson has gotten a bit giddy ever since "Taken." The man who once upon a time brought us "La Femme Nikita" and "Leon: The Professional" has instead taken to lighter action fare, in this case recruiting amateurs James Mather and Stephen St. Leger to help write and direct his "original idea." Exactlynot a "story by" credit, but "original idea."That's not to say "Lockout" isn't creative, but it's definitely not original. Some might dub it "Taken in space," especially considering it borrows that film's starlet in Maggie Grace, but it's much more akin to "Escape from New York in space." Either way, "Lockout" is another simple- concept action film from Besson, only it has a bigger ego that gets in the way sometimes."Lockout" is good for kicks, a fact of which it's very aware. Guy Pearce's Snow, the morally questionable and reluctant hero written so closely to the archetype he almost transcends it, weirdly. He has a sense of humor best described as abundant (though sometimes quite clever), and Pearce plays him especially wry; most actors (think Nicolas Cage) would've hammed it up too much or been unconvincing.Snow is tasked with rescuing the president's daughter (Grace), who is stuck on a maximum security prison in space that has incurred a major security breach. These are the world's most dangerous criminals, plus they have been in stasis for any number of years, which has made them even nuttier. Joseph Gilgun as Rydell, one of two Scottish prisoners trying to run the uprising, is a particularly deranged fellow reminiscent of a demented Groundskeeper Willie.Both Rydell and the other main baddie, Alex (Vincent Regan), have a cold-blooded edge that could have made for an effective R-rated ransom thriller reminiscent of late '90s films like Air Force One, but the devil-may-care attitude of the entire movie ultimately clashes with these darker moments, even though they do make you take the movie more seriously than you would otherwise.After a little bit of context at the beginning to properly motivate Snow, both he and us are effectively shot from a canon. The story only slows down a bit toward the end, but it mostly plays out as a series of dominoes. The action doesn't satisfy so much as the pace and the threat of violence (now here's a good example of how you do PG-13 violence), but it's well done aside from an opening motorcycle sequence shot on green screen and outfitted with an effects job that really shows the budget.Aside from that, the futuristic sci-fi elements stay pretty classynothing overdone or distracting. The gadgets provide some creativity to a number of the sequences and the script manages to inject some unpredictability into a story that could not have a more obvious trajectory.Despite the self-awareness at points, with a lot of that credit going to Pearce, Lockout tries especially hard to be entertaining on too many fronts, aspiring to be the consummate popcorn flick rather than just identifying one tone and sticking with it. The final scene on the space prison strangely evokes the original "Star Wars" Death Star run, as if to make sure the audience gets to munch on some sci fi/fantasy before the credits roll.It's hard to fault "Lockout" for aiming to please considering that that spirit seems to be the driving force behind the movie's strengths as well as its weaknesses. Although the number of attempts at humor might catch some folks off guard, "Lockout" offers what anyone interested in the film would expect, if for no other reason than its built upon tons of tropes from previously effective movies. In turn, "Lockout" is effective, but not too much more.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out moviemusereviews.com
Rarely does a film like "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" tell such a basic human story with such visual prowess. There's not a whole lot of action or imaginative settings, yet director David Fincher makes New Orleans and New York between 1920-1970 feel like a fantasy world of sorts. This is the kind of a film that will likely get a slew of nominations at the Academy Awards and clean up many of them."Benjamin Button" is sort of an epic love story, the kind of film that we haven't really seen since "Forrest Gump." At nearly 3 hours long, it gives us the life of Benjamin (Pitt), who physically ages backward from an old man to an infant, while his brain ages like that of a normal person. While the film could be about how his life is different from everyone else, the emphasis is more on how this affects his perspective on aging, dying and the fleeting nature of life, as seen through his love for Daisy (Blanchett) who he meets when they're both children, but she of course ages normally.The visual rendering of Benjamin as an old man (his younger years) is absolutely astounding and could press some other CGI-loaded films at the Oscars. The make-up as well, which is forced to capture a large span of aging because the film doesn't jump very far ahead in years at any point in time, is incredible.What is most surprising about "Button" is the cinematography. Between the contrast of light and dark around faces and a couple beautiful sunrise scenes, what is just plain old America has a distinct beauty to it that really captures the epic nature of the story. It's long and really quite slow at times, but it could have been worse without some of the imagery.The acting was also very impressive. Pitt manages to pull off the concept of looking one way and feeling another. He's particularly strong when he's 20 or so, when his character appears in his late 50s. He gives Benjamin a gentle nature that comes off as mature, though his naiveté in terms of love and loss is apparent. Blanchett is also very strong, proving triple-fold already how talented of an actress she is in any role. Several other supporting roles played by lesser known actors were also impressive, including Queenie, Benjamin's adoptive mother.Though tedious in length, "Button" is a film that someone of nearly any age can appreciate. Eric Roth's screenplay is genuine in both its comedic and dramatic aspects, though no matter which, always has something to say about aging, death and loss. Ultimately, it manages to say a lot more about how similar Benjamin is to us, though he appears so radically different.
There's not a lot of explicit or physical humor in "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," but such is the case with most John Hughes comedies: you get more of a natural, every-day sort of a humor in a film that's just as family-oriented as it is a comedy. This film is mainly a story about two strangers coming together despite their quirky differences, with the goal of just getting home as all their travel plans go awry. It's not clever, it's not farcical, it's just real, very real.Steve Martin and John Candy put their comedic talents together to drive each other crazy in "Planes." Both are on their way home for Thanksgiving when their flight to Chicago from New York ends up landing in Wichita, Kansas. Martin plays a business man with a sour attitude towards people when things aren't pleasant and Candy plays a loud-mouthed shower curtain ring salesman who has some unusual habits. Naturally the two don't get along and despite their every intention of separating, they find themselves back together, facing a myriad of rough situations. Most of the laughs come from how these two treat each other in addition to the one you have at their misery and expense. The two make a great duo from the moments where they both hate each other to the more sincere ones. The truth is that this plot could happen to any of us (string of bad luck aside) and that's what makes it so likable. We all have to deal with people we can't stand and sometimes in the worst of situations. There's also a really touching element about family in the film that takes you by surprised but isn't unwarranted.
Superhero movies have been thriving in both Hollywood and public consciousness for almost 10 years now, and one of the biggest reasons has been the origin story. "Spider-Man" in 2002 revealed how the emotional power of a superhero's motivation can humanize even those characters with the most extraordinary powers. "X-Men: First Class" provides this oh so necessary background to a franchise whose last two film entries sacrificed depth of character for mutant and superpower pageantry. Wolverine might be the most popular character from the "X-Men" world, but the story of how Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr developed two different ideologies and became Professor X and Magneto encapsulates the comics' core. "First Class" recognizes this all the way.When the action-packed but unmoving "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" was announced, it came coupled with the hiring of a writer for "X-Men Origins: Magneto." "First Class" essentially gives us that story. This is a film about Erik's decision to become Magneto and Michael Fassbender revels in the spotlight as the powerful metal-bender who eventually leads what becomes the Brotherhood of Mutants. Fassbender will continue to be an acting force to reckon with in the future as he brings incredible depth to a character already written so well."X-Men: First Class" has to be the best-written superhero film since "The Dark Knight" and maybe ever behind the first two "Spider-Man" films. The script is loaded with thematic insights into the notion of being an outsider  the very notion that's made this comic so universally loved. The fascinating complexity of Magneto and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) gets abundant attention and even the minor characters exude that feeling of learning to embrace and understand their powers and differences for the first time.The film opens with a scene directly from the original "X-Men": a young Erik at a concentration camp gets separated from his mother and bends a metal gate. A Nazi doctor takes note of this ability and meets with Erik, eventually killing his mother in front of him as to provoke the anger that triggers Erik's powers. That villain happens to be a mutant himself, one who in the '60s becomes known as Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik's one goal is to avenge that death. This background alone, that of a Holocaust survivor, makes Erik such a challenging character for an audience. In his pursuit of Shaw, Erik meets Charles (James McAvoy), whose own quest to find other mutants with the help of a young CIA agent named Moira McTaggert (Rose Byrne) also has him tracking Shaw. As it happens, Shaw's plan is to incite the Cuban Missile Crisis and start a nuclear war, setting the stage for mutant supremacy.Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart are tough shoes to fill, but Fassbender and McAvoy make those characters their own while commanding the screen much like those venerated talents. Despite the film leaning heavily toward Magneto's story, McAvoy impresses here as a rallying leader figure. He has a youthful charisma that a bald wheelchair-bound Professor X never gets the luxury of wielding in the original films, but he demonstrates a maturity we've never gotten to see from McAvoy, who's always playing teenage or 20-something characters thanks to his boyish looks. The chemistry between him and Fassbender echoes that between McKellan and Stewart but in a much different way. With this film now in the "X-Men" canon, I think revisiting the original trilogy would actually make the original films' Magneto-Professor X subplots more powerful. That's how well the writing team captures their relationship and story despite the many other things going on.Director Matthew Vaughn strikes a nice balance between the grittiness of a "Layer Cake" and the superhero fun of "Kick-Ass." Vaughn milks the most he can out of a PG-13 rating as some gruesome deaths are left to the imagination or shown simply without the blood. Graphic enough or not, "First Class" keeps a dark tone with the exception of all the teenage mutants learning to control and showing off their powers. Even then, they remain firmly rooted in the script's core ideas and messages."First Class" forces you to keep track of several mutants, but only a couple feel hollow or ineffective. Despite being a comic book icon, Emma Frost appears to be nothing but a fembot as played by January Jones. A telepath like Professor X but with the ability to turn her skin into diamonds, she serves Shaw with seemingly no regard for her own interests, whatever they may be. Jones provides no edginess to the character, who essentially serves the same purpose as Mystique in the original films as the faithful but alluring evil "assistant."Lawrence as Raven aka Mystique and Nicholas Hoult as Hank aka Beast represent an effective use of subplot. Both play young mutants who possess powers that exhibit physical characteristics. As young people, they wrestle with questions of fitting in or embracing who they are, which echoes the larger Erik/Charles storyline on a smaller scale.Regardless your thoughts on "X-Men: First Class" as a stand-alone film, it unquestionably does great justice to the power of the "X-Men" story as a whole and reminds us why this message has universal qualities that all can identify with. Not only are there the questions of conformity, but also of human nature. The climax reminds us of one of the major differences between Charles and Erik: one has faith that humanity will come to accept mutants and the other doesn't. Although we've been trained to agree with Charles since Bryan Singer's first film in 2000, "First Class" helps us come to realize the power of Magneto's argument, proving he's not so much a villain, but a character with a darker and perhaps more realistic world view.The talent runs very deep in this retro-fitted backstory to the "X-Men" universe that refocuses the franchise for the better. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
There weren't too many people hotter than Tina Fey in 2008. Between the smash comedy 30 Rock, her impression of GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, and taking the lead for the first time in a movie with "Baby Mama," Fey and her iconic black-rimmed glasses have soared above and beyond Saturday Night Live. While the film "Baby Mama" might not be her most notable exploit, it's brand of subtle humor works in her favor and makes for an enjoyable film.Fey plays Kate, a late thirties (her true age) businesswoman who has never been married and is also incapable of conceiving a child though she desperately wants one. When Kate stumbles across an agency specializing in surrogate pregnancy, she meets Angie, a high school dropout played by SNL's Amy Poehler, and the two agree that Angie will have Kate's baby. When Angie's trash boyfriend Carl (Dax Shepard) cheats on her, she moves in with Kate and the two have to reconcile their conflicting lifestyles.Though Fey carries her own comedic presence in her reactions to the bizarre characters around her, it's Poehler's character that is meant to serve as comic relief in her mis-educated habits in life and in pregnancy. She provides a variety of physical humor and also gets some laughs at her character for her sheer ignorance, though it's pretty hit-or-miss with her. While in a lot of her work she can come off as annoying, she's a bit more mild in this film.The rest of a cast is full of high profile actors in smaller roles and other familiar faces to boost the unproven star power of Fey and Poehler. Greg Kinnear plays Fey's love interest, who is just supposed to be a "nice guy" and nothing more and Maura Tierney of "ER" plays Fey's sister. Top that off with appearances by Steve Martin as Fey's zen/hippie boss and Sigourney Weaver as the head of the surrogate agency and there's plenty of time for "look who it is!" amazement as you watch."Baby Mama" doesn't throw anything unusual at us from a comedy stand point, especially being released not even a year after Judd Apatow's "Knocked Up" provided a similar concept, but it has its own subtle, very SNL-like comedic style. That might be easy to say because Fey, Poehler and creator Michael McCullers connections to the show, but like SNL sketches, "Baby Mama" relies on the talents of its actors in creating nutty characters and the way the "normal" characters perceive them. While this doesn't work all the time, it gets better toward the end and the plot keeps you interested enough to wear you certainly don't dismiss it and you may even really like it.
You get about an hour through filmmaker Cameron Crowe's teen romance "Say Anything..." and it finally hits you. Where's the conflict? There's really no drama, only the budding romance of Lloyd and Diane in their last summer as teenagers and the few complications that arise from it. While the last half hour or so adds a bit more, the truth is that Crowe gets you hooked on a film solely about a guy and a girl falling in love. That just shows the power of relationships in film."Say Anything..." is about those two characters, played by John Cusack and Ione Skye, an unlikely couple that forms out of a desire to make the most of what little time they both have at home before entering "the real world." Their chemistry is simply fantastic in being both natural and believable. Things aren't so straightforward in love, however, and the bright future on Diane's horizon and her very close relationship with her father (John Mahoney) complicate things with Lloyd.Lloyd and Diane seem perfect, and the secret is that Lloyd's a little neurotic and Diane is the smart girl that thinks no one cares about her and their "union" is representative of how both get what they want despite their self-perceptions. As viewers, we see our own relationship flaws in them and that's what makes them lovable.The relationship between Diane and her father is also an incredibly strong one that gets established so well at the beginning that when the slight conflict of the film arises, it has a very strong impact. That's really what makes "Say Anything..." an instant classic in ways, the strength of its very normal characters.Crowe's script is very real yet very profound in many ways. Up front it's about trying to make love work, but the fact that it's only about Diane and Lloyd and Diane and her father sets up a parallel between the two relationships to show how they're more alike than Diane thinks as she tries to reconcile them both. It's very simple, but really excellent on Crowe's part, and that really sums up the film.
Guillermo del Toro has made his name as a director of action movies ("Blade II") and imaginative fantasies ("Pan's Labyrinth" and soon to be "The Hobbit"). Naturally, combining the two as he does in "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is going to yield some successful results, and the renewed emphasis on the imaginative mythical creature element makes this sequel crush its predecessor.While the original "Hellboy" showed us red devil creature Hellboy (Ron Perlman) fighting off a futuristic clan of Neo-Nazis, the sequel surrounds a mythical truce between magical creatures and humans on the verge of being broken. "The Golden Army" refers to secret force of mechanical soldiers that can shift the balance toward one side. This is much more stomach-able than the Nazi origin story (god knows Hollywood doesn't need another Nazi film) in the first movie and it allows for the infusion of some fantastical creatures with great make-up and CGI.That's really the strongest point of this film. The action is slightly above par, but the visuals make "Hellboy II" standout with a unique presence among the superhero films of today. There's no doubt that del Toro has the best imagination of any director working right now. Much like "Pan's Labyrinth," this movie will capture your attention with its stunning and bizarre creatures. The whole film is like the Mos Eisley Cantina scene in "Star Wars" except George Lucas' colorful and gross monsters can't compete with the artistic elegance of del Toro's creations.The plot of "Hellboy II" is predictable and its characters even more shallow than the first film. For these characters, it's really what's on the outside that counts: the make-up, costumes, etc. Each character is an archetype with no sophistication that spits out terrible and pointlessly inappropriate one-liners. For example, one new introduction to Hellboy's team at the Bureau of Paranormal Defense and Research is its new leader Johann Strauss, a German ghost who promptly tells a human to "suck his ectoplasmic shvanstuker." Also, our main hero has a deep affection for Cuban cigars and sucks down cans of Tecate beer (yes, Tecate) because his love life with Selma Blair's character Liz (she can light herself on fire) is not exactly swell--nor believable, but that's another matter.So beyond the bad acting and plot clichés lies a visual fantasy/action tour de force in "Hellboy II," which is enough to recommend the film to anyone with an imagination anywhere half as vivid as Guillermo del Toro. It's amazing how stunning make-up and effects can be enough to turn the likes of Hellboy into an interesting and attention-grabbing film.
Welcome to Delos, an immersive Disney World for adults featuring three real-life role play worlds: Medieval, Roman and West World. Outfitted with robots, these era-inspired theme parks are there to serve your every desire. You can shoot people, you can have sex with them and you can take their world as seriously as you like for $1000 a day. They're a set of amusement parks and for all intents and purposes, amusement sums up the purpose of the film as well.Oh, the 1970s. There comes a point where every pre-"Star Wars" film can no longer lean on the technological limitations of the era. That's because things like plot and suspense transcend time. Yes, "Westworld" has a plot, but it's extremely one-dimensional. Ironically, the movie focuses on robots, though its human characters come off just as hollow.Richard Benjamin and James Brolin play Peter and John, two pals whom we know little about that venture out to Westworld for a good time. John's been there before, but it's new to Peter, who has a bit of an adjustment period to the whole shooting and committing crime and prostitution thing. On several occasions the two are confronted by a gunslinger robot played expertly by the infamous Yul Brynner. More on him later.It's no wonder Michael Crichton just stuck to writing his books after this movie. He leans on slow motion for action sequences and does odd jump cuts during the suspense climaxes. He also manages to painfully drag out a movie with a runtime of under an hour and half. For all there was in "Westworld" of substance, the film could have been less than an hour. So many shots say absolutely nothing to the viewer who's fully aware things are going to go wrong at some point or another with these robots. Eight different scenes slowly escalate the fact that the robots are exhibiting strange behavior when half that number with a bit more punch a piece would help keep the plot unpredictable and interesting."Westworld" does ride its concept well and manages to find good grace through Brenner's cold, robotic and downright creepy performance as the gunslinger. The character was undoubtedly a precursor and possibly an inspiration for the Terminator, though in comparison he's much less formidable than Arnold. All that considered, "Westworld" would be well-suited for a 20th Century makeover and rarely does a film strike me as such.
"Eagle vs Shark" is an awkward romantic comedy. In fact it's probably 80 percent awkward, 10 percent romantic and 10 percent comedy. New Zealand creator Taika Waititi shows us the deadpan humor side of love, a style reminiscent of HBO New Zealander comedy series "Flight of the Conchords," (which stars Jemaine Clement, the lead male in "Eagle") only this is less funny. It's cute and good for a few chuckles, but not funny enough to truly endear us to its main characters, Jarrod and Lily.The film begins on the boy-meets-girl premise, with Lily (Loren Horsley) scoping out a particularly unattractive Jarrod at her place of work, a fast food restaurant. After she's fired for seemingly no good reason, she goes to Jarrod's "dress as your favorite animal" party where she lets him beat her in a video game tournament. The two hook up despite Jarrod's awkward advances and their romance quickly takes them to the town where Jarrod grew up, where he has plans to fight his childhood bully -- and ultimately some inner demons.The shift from focusing on Lily to being about Jarrod coming to terms with some family and self-confidence issues is slightly unexpected. The title gives the impression the two will be at odds and that this will be the main source of conflict, but it ends up being about how Lily, seeking desperately to be swept away by love, hits an obstacle because the apple of her eye is an immature Napoleon Dynamite rip-off. Ultimately, love is never simple or easy, but it works out if it's meant to.Clement, had Napoleon Dynamite never existed, would have come off as quite hilarious in this movie. However, the nunchuks thing has indeed been done, so Jarrod's social inadequacy seems more stale than funny or worthy of sympathy. We do feel bad the way his father ignores him, but he doesn't do anything to really capture our hearts. Neither does Lily, but she comes close. Horsley's pretty green eyes aren't quite enough to hide her underdeveloped loneliness. She's more pitiable than Jarrod, but the deadpan style of the film undercuts our understanding of their emotions. Deadpan works for comedy, but Waititi carries it over into the drama too much, sucking the potential for conflict right out of it. When that happens, the director shoulders more responsibility to convey emotions through images. Waititi's script has a few really nice moments, but much of the symbolism meant to do the job of making us feel is too abstract and forced. The eagle symbolism is over-pushed and the animated apple scenes even more so. It captures the independent spirit of the film, but it's not cleverly worked into the script to make us feel as if it belongs."Eagle vs Shark" is nice, but it's a bit too bland to really get a reaction from its audience. Even though the blandness is meant for humor, a film that clearly has a big heart shouldn't let that style cheat it out of becoming meaningful.
Animated talking-animal films since the dawn of CGI have gotten much more prolific. Now that animals can be illustrated with ease and superb realism (namely in textures such as fur, feathers and scales), the supply can meet the demand and almost every major movie studio has either its own animation division or a relationship with an animation company. "Rio" is the product of Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios, the team behind the "Ice Age" franchise.With animated films coming out in rampant fashion, originality has taken a hit. The formula? Pick a country, climate or segment of the animal kingdom and set the exact same story there. So what started as a "fish-out-of-water" tale has become a bird/dinosaur/penguin/African animal-out-of-water story. "Rio" is a visually beautiful film with a sweet story and humorous supporting characters, but it contains not one original feather in its coat other than the Brazilian backdrop."Rio" tells the story of Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg), a domesticated blue macaw that ended up in Moose Lake, Minn. in the care of a socially awkward bookworm named Linda (Leslie Mann). When an overenthusiastic ornithologist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) shows up claiming Blu is the last of his species and he would like to mate him with the lone remaining female back in Rio de Janeiro, Linda is hesitant but agrees.Eisenberg's eccentricities fit Blu well and help sell the bird-out-of-cage story effectively. When he meets his mate-to-be, Jewel (Anne Hathaway), things couldn't go worse. She wants desperately to escape and return to be free in the Amazon. Blu and Jewel are kidnapped, however, by a man who intends to sell them. Chained together, the must of course learn to like each other in order to survive. Oh, and it would help if Blu knew how to fly.The writing team makes a concerted effort to infuse the film with the free spirit of Rio's annual "Carnival" festival in hopes of adding a meaningful cultural element. It basically results in a few unexpected musical numbers and several overweight male characters dressing scantily, but it helps give "Rio" a distinctive flavor. In my opinion, you go full musical or you don't go musical at all, but the concept works better than you'd expect. Even the typical "statement of evil" song from back in the Disney days makes an appearance here and is actually quite funny. Jemaine Clement voices the evil cockatoo Nigel, one of the more sinister and intriguing animated enemies you'll see in a film of this genre. He provides the necessary sense of danger for this all-too-typical adventure.The character archetypes are the most bland: the out-of-its-element main character, the rebellious love interest, the wise mentor figure (George Lopez as Rafael the toucan), the tiny sidekicks (Jamie Foxx and will.i.am as Nico and Pedro) and the big lovable stupid acquaintance (Tracy Morgan as Luiz the bulldog). Sure, there's a reason animated films keep coming back to those character types, but "Rio" uses them to an unoriginal end. The moral and themes are tired and not given any renewed attention. Do you think that Blu learns how to fly by the end? I even went so far as to try and guess a line of dialogue: "Blu, you're flying!" I would tell if you if I was right, but truth of the matter is "Rio" is still a light and enjoyable animated flick worth watching.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"Schindler's List" can best be described as something more than a movie. It is a cinematic exhibit and memorial dedicated to the heroism of Oskar Schindler and the 6 million plus Jews that died in the Holocaust. But don't cheat the film aspect either: this film is brilliantly made and intelligently put together. It is beautiful, smart, touching, haunting and inspiring.The story is in essence about how Schindler was touched somehow to use his position as a factory director to keep Jews from being exterminated in Auschwitz. The film uses a brilliant non-verbal method to offer reasons why Schindler did what he did. In addition, the film also serves as a historical telling of the events that occurred to a portion of the millions who died or experienced the Holocaust.Liam Neeson is very strong as Schindler. He doesn't seem all too warm and lovable at first, but eventually you take to him and see him become the hero he was. Ralph Fiennes gives a performance as the Nazi commander Amon Goeth that is simply chilling. Ben Kingsley as Schindler's assistant Yitzchak Stern also adds a great, simple, modest character.From the technical aspect, John Williams' score is beautiful. The theme is both tragic and hopeful and it's incredible that Yitzchak Pearlman was included in it as the solo violinist. The black and white work (the team of Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski strike again) is beautiful and thoroughly conceived."Schindler's List" is both educational and inspirational. Entertaining does not quite fit in the realm of an appropriate description. It is an experience.
Most investigative thrillers focus on detectives digging around for the answers, but "State of Play" opts to center around the desperate, miserable and dying newspaper industry. Simply put, the forces and pressures motivating a reporter are not like that on a detective, which makes for a much more unique plot with characters an audience can view as more like themselves. A detective who figures out whodunit is doing his/her job -- a journalist who puts the pieces together is a small-time hero.Russell Crowe stars in one of his more unique roles as a seasoned investigative reporter named Cal McAffrey. Crowe somehow more easily portrays Americans than any Australian or British actor working in Hollywood and he brings a light-hearted spirit to his serious role. His character finds himself in a dangerous place when his personal friendships with a congressman and his wife (Ben Affleck, Robin Wright Penn) come at odds with his job when news breaks that the congressman was having an affair with a girl who recently died in a DC subway accident. McAffrey first tries to protect his friend, but when he sees trends leading to conspiracy, his professional instincts kick in."Play" brags a diverse but killer cast. Crowe is the dependable star vehicle, Affleck the ultra- popular movie star who has been scarce lately and Rachel McAdams makes a triumphant return to the screen after a couple years off as a young blogger who assists Crowe. Also appearing in the film are Helen Mirren as the editor, Jeff Daniels as another politician and even Jason Bateman makes a cameo. All of them are talented and have proved so in many different genres, but never have they been together to make a thriller.It's also the first experiment in the genre for the director, Kevin Macdonald ("The Last King of Scotland.") Macdonald keeps this film fast and exciting, generally refusing to use a tripod but not distracting us with shaky camera-work either. He mixes in a lot of close detail shots with scene setters that tell the story at a provocative angle. There are a lot of typical thriller movie conventions used, but he makes it his own. He's a director certainly worth keeping an eye on. Credit must also go to an incredibly well-assembled writing team. Although based on a BBC miniseries of the same name, "State of Play" boasts "Michael Clayton" creator and penner of the Bourne series Tony Gilroy for the drama and action, "Shattered Glass" creator Billy Ray for the journalism expertise and Matthew Michael Carnahan ("Lions for Lambs," "The Kindgom,") for the political/military end. It's amazing to see how that all plays together so nicely with so many reputable writers. Some of the twists might be more on the extreme side, but it's mostly convincing and exciting the whole way through."State of Play" hooks you and keeps you guessing. It tries to keep the characters intimate and worth caring about while also making sure the story picks up velocity. Subplots occasionally get in the way (McAffrey's personal connection to Wright Penn's character among them) but you become pretty easily invested in what's going on and are frightened when what seemed like a nice mystery suddenly gets serious. This is a thriller that is smart and quick and never blows itself out of proportion. It holds its ground and it does so with much talent.Lastly, the film questions the necessary extent of hard-nosed reporting, but also revels in its necessity. Watergate is alluded to as a building where a couple key companies are located. The connection is purposeful -- we're supposed to see the scandal as a fictional modern re- creation of Watergate in terms of how it's reported and uncovered. While films like "All the King's Men" glorified the work of journalists, "Play" is too stubborn to give them full credit, bringing into the discussion the idea of selling papers and not waiting too long to get all the facts or how the Internet/blogosphere twists the news in different ways. It might not be at the front of your mind while enjoying the film, but it sets it above the overdone detective thriller. ~Steven CSee more on my site http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Films about the movie industry are always interesting, but "Sullivan's Travels" is in its own special niche in the show-biz comedy genre. The premise is about a successful musical comedy director who wants to make a serious picture about human suffering. The film opens with a dedication to the memory of clowns, buffoons -- anyone who has dedicated their life to making people laugh. What do you think he will learn at the end of this story? It's not revealed with the most impressiveness, but few themes ring as true as this film's, especially to anyone with a love of the movies, especially classics.Conceived during the Great Depression and premiering at the very beginning of World War II, what an important picture. "Sullivan" champions comedy, portrays Hollywood with a sense of humor yet asks it to look in the mirror and celebrates the golden age of Hollywood that came before it with numerous classic techniques.John McCrea is John Lloyd Sullivan, a pictures director that wants to make a film of substance -- he wants to adapt "O Brother Where Art Thou" (a title most cleverly used by the Coen brothers in their 2000 film) but his producers want ... a little bit of sex. They tell him he knows nothing of human suffering and has no business making that kind of film. Sullivan sees it as a challenge and decides he'll dress like a hobo and learn for himself in order to make his picture.Try as he might to escape his Hollywood entourage, the humor of "Sullivan" is that Sullivan can never manage to escape Los Angeles. In the beginning he tries to shake them in a high- speed chase one of the funnier and more classic scenes of the film. He's in a go-kart of sorts with a 13-year-old and his friends in a giant caravan.Along the way he meets a girl (Veronica Lake) who shows him some kindness and then when they're thrown in jail and bailed out by his producers, he reveals himself rather quickly. She takes a liking to him, however, and they dress as hobos together jumping on train cars the next time out.The brilliance of Preston Sturges' story and script -- aside from his punchy dialogue -- is that despite it's sincere message, it is not a drama about a guy trying to make a drama after years of comedies, but it's a comedy. It's not the funniest thing you ever saw and it hits you right over the head with just about everything instead of drawing it out and making it a bit more epiphanic, but it serves up a pristine reminder of what it's about through use of the comedic techniques it champions.If you love film -- namely the classics -- "Sullivan's Travels" will find a way to your heart somehow. It's a really perceptive film for 1941, a genre rarity in those days truthfully, and it celebrates what at least one genre of film is all about.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
"Rebecca" should have been the film to provide Joan Fontaine her Academy Award, but "Suspicion" suffices. The two films are really miles apart despite coming out in consecutive years in 1940 and 1941, but Fontaine's performance in both highlights Alfred Hitchcock's ability to scout the finest talents in addition to crafting master suspense."Suspicion" is a true romantic thriller that almost exactly like "Rebecca" follows a relatively naive and previously sexless young woman who weds the man of her dreams only to find not everything is as it seems. In this case, the bookish Lina (Fontaine) meets the impressing Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant), who courts her with every ounce of charm. Lina gives in to him in part because of her wealthy and somewhat repressive parents, but ultimately because he's tough to resist.Little could be considered Hitchcockian about the first act of the film. It spends its time building up the romance between Lina and Johnnie so that the impending events will be seen more clearly from Lina's perspective. If any tension can be found, it's due to Johnny's unpredictable personality, not from Hitchcock's direction. Grant's magnetism and his ability to capture both Prince Charming and something more potentially sinister all at once makes him ideal for the film. "Suspicion" was the first of many Grant-Hitchcock collaborations and considering the auteur's penchant for telling stories with people who aren't what they seem, one can see why.As Lina begins to psychologically tiptoe toward the edge, Hitchcock's skills come more into play. Fewer scenes could be dubbed "classic Hitchcock" in this movie than in most, but the feeling that something major will happen never ceases to nag. At the same time, nothing all that big does happen, and for all its craftsmanship, "Suspicion" turns out to be tamer Hitchcock. Blame Hollywood for softening the ending.Still, Fontaine and Hitchcock work together to make "Suspicion" work, enough so, at least, that Fontaine could claim her Oscar with a sense of pride. She's the focus of the film, even though its Johnnie who intrigues the audience the most. Is he just a troubled gambler too proud to admit fault, or does something darker lurk under the surface? The fact that we address these questions from Lina's perspective forces us to observe the film's events (some that are frankly ordinary) with the same paranoia she does."Suspicion" falls under the category of very good films from a director who has done better, which in the case of Hitchcock translates to a great film shadowed by its creator's countless masterworks.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Anyone who watches Brian De Palma's re-imagining of "Scarface" has to wonder why it didn't get so much as a nod for an Academy Award. A powerful performance by Al Pacino, several notable supporting roles and a story that's so eye-opening and fully developed are a few of the top reasons anyone watching this film today would call it great. So why nothing? Was it ahead of its time, or not far ahead enough? The only possible explanation is the latter. Though 9 years had passed since the last Godfather film, clearly Hollywood and its critics were not ready for something similar yet not as immaculate.Al Pacino is dynamite from start to finish as Tony Montana, a criminal immigrant from Cuba who works his way up the ladder of the cocaine business, becoming everything and losing it all. The story is the classic rise and fall of a nobody, of a man with nothing but an iron conviction, even if his values aren't the same as our own. Pacino nails the strong-willed no- fear attitude of Montana, but is equally as commanding when Montana borders on the insane and the emotional. He simply has a magnetism about him as an actor and that's something you have or you don't. Pacino flaunts it in this film and without him it wouldn't have been nearly as powerful.You simply can't compare Montana to Michael Corleone of "The Godfather"--Pacino helms both roles excellently, but they're different characters who handle power in different ways. As for the rest of the film, to compare it to "The Godfather" is unfair. Not only is it unfair to compare any film to something as masterful as the 1972 classic, but they're not even about the same thing: one the Mafia, the other Miami drug cartels. Yes, both involve ordering hits and bloody ones at that, but it's a whole other story. Oliver Stone writes a great script full of memorable scenes and lines that are no less unforgettable than "The Godfather." The only places where "Scarface" can't measure up--and reasonably so--are in cinematography, art direction and directing. Brian DePalma does good stuff, and he should be praised for his work on the film, but it's not a stainless piece of film-making. Simply put, if you feel forced to compare, which perhaps critics in the early 80s did, "Scarface" can't hold a candle to "The Godfather," but there are a number of reasons it should not have been harshly judged.In supporting roles, Motana's best friend Tony played by Steven Bauer is a refreshingly nice, likable, character; Robert Loggia as the big drug guy Frank Lopez also commands attention in contrast to Pacino's character; Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, given the difficult roller coaster ride part of Montana's little sister excels in her role, and even Michelle Pfeiffer, as stoic and loathsome as her love interest character is, has some moments. All in all this is a good ensemble--Pacino doesn't run the show as much as he steals the scenes.When viewed independently from similar material, the only really noticeable weaknesses of "Scarface" are it's poor soundtrack choices and miserable electronic score when something orchestral would have brought out the best in this film. Whoever made the decision at the top to let the film be scored like that really shot a hole in the film that while small, was in a bad place."Scarface" is a great film that through its violence, swearing and general depiction of an extravagant but depressingly hollow and terrible lifestyle, manages to tell the story of the hunger and abuse of power in this country through one man in a complete and thorough way. There are no gaps in this storytelling and the script is full of lines that as sick, twisted and inherently flawed as Montana is, make him a compelling figure with considerably interesting things to say.
Can Sidney Lumet do anything wrong? The esteemed director takes a film in "Fail-Safe" that has most stagnant action, with theoretical destruction and turns it into suspenseful masterwork. His camera angles and his strength working with actors seems unmatched to the unique degree that he does it."Fail-Safe" is a Cold War drama and suspense thriller that would be best described as the serious version of Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove." Interestingly enough, Columbia pictures owned distribution rights to both films and chose to put out "Strangelove" first, which basically killed off any potential impact that "Fail-Safe" could have had. That's really unfortunate.The film is about a mission gone awry that results in an American nuclear bomber plane believing it has been ordered to drop a bomb on Moscow and that it should take no orders from anyone to stop the mission. The result causes a series of negotiations between the men in charge of the military, their consultants and even the president himself (Henry Fonda). Unfortunately, the distrust between the US and Russia perpetuates the problem even further, despite the president's insistence that it's all a mistake.The plot structure of the film is pretty immaculate--you can see the tension build toward an inevitable conclusion and you find yourself empathizing with the characters trying to do the right thing. Some of the greatest scenes are when the president is on the phone with the Russians. It's merely the president and his translator being shown, but Lumet's great use of camera angles and the talents of Fonda make you feel as if you're a third party on the phone in the conversation."Fail-Safe" might be especially poignant in the Cold War era, but it still holds true in the present, merely by its use of tension, conflict and negotiation. Plus, it's got a master of those three things in the pilot seat.
Many people questioned acclaimed director Martin Scorsese choosing to helm a pure genre film in the psychological thriller "Shutter Island," but the marriage of one of the masters of crime drama and a Dennis Lehane ("Mystic River," "Gone Baby Gone") novel is as close to an ideal match as it sounds. Although Scorsese is capable of applying his skills to more meaningful work than a mystery, he's able to play around a lot more with technique, style, light and color to turn a somewhat predictable mystery into a captivating thriller.Many great thrillers have taken place within the walls of an insane asylum and "Shutter Island" takes this to the max. The isolated east-coast island is home to the most dangerous of the criminally insane. When two U.S. marshals (DiCaprio and Ruffalo) come to the island to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of the inmates, they find themselves up to their necks in an even bigger mystery involving the hospital and everyone in it.As Daniels investigates, we learn he is somewhat intimately tied to the case and the facility. He's lost his wife in a fire and the man who set it is locked up somewhere on the island. Daniels has dreams of his wife coming to him and speaking to him, turning to ash in his arms. He even starts to hallucinate while awake. Scorsese certainly hasn't had a lot of opportunity to play with false reality in his films, so he relishes these opportunities. Dream sequences are often pointless, but Scorsese makes them intriguing, beautiful and haunting all at once despite their excessive use. He picks powerful images that might make you shake your head at times, but they enhance the mystery in the long run.Numerous scenes give Scorsese a chance to show off. When he investigates the mysterious Ward C, Daniels has nothing but matches. As he speaks to one of the prisoners, someone he knew off the island, he continues to light matches to see -- a new one every time one burns out. Scorsese develops a rhythm of creepy dialogue from Jackie Earl Haley and quick shots of the match striking flint then lighting the actors' faces. Dull moments are extremely rare in "Shutter Island."Scorsese gets the most out of each scene, but the film doesn't conceal its hand all that well. A few lines of dialogue connect some if not most of the dots, so the impact of the last several minutes (aka the big reveal) is not as effective as some of the great thrillers out there. Without Scorsese and the talents of DiCaprio, however, "Shutter Island" might've ended up just a decent film as opposed to a very good one. It's too impressively executed to be bunched in with the bulk of decent thrillers out there, but not clever and original enough to be among the genre's elite. Scorsese might be capable of better, but "Shutter Island" proves his versatility more so than take anything away from his legacy.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
What if the future is nothing like the novelist and filmmakers imagined? Isn't it more practical to imagine a flawed society bred from stupidity and excess? "Beavis and Butthead" and "Office Space" creator Mike Judge, along with Etan Cohen, has a great deal of fun envisioning this future in "Idiocracy.""Idiocracy" is built entirely around this concept, so naturally that's where this comedy succeeds and fails. What it lacks in story it attempts to make up for with goofy imagination, and it succeeds enough of the time to warrant sitting out its run time.Luke Wilson plays Joe Bauers, an average male with a middle-of-the-road IQ. He agrees to subject himself to a military experiment meant to test stasis pods for military soldiers. He and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), that is. Well, while asleep the experiment is shut down and the two are forgotten about. They would've stayed that way if not for a giant garbage tsunami  500 years later.In this sad, sad future, everything is corporatized and all services and technology are dumbed down so everyone and anyone can use them. Joe's adventure begins when he runs into Frito (Dax Shepard), a speech-slurring lawyer who doesn't protect his clients' best interests (one client being Joe) because he's too stupid. Joe ends up in jail, though he escapes by simply telling the guard he was supposed to be released from prison that day.To make a long story short, Joe's intelligence catches the eye of President Camacho (Terry Crews) and he's named Secretary of the Interior. He must figure out how to make the crops grow again or be killed, pretty much. Obviously, Joe just wants it all to go away, and Frito tells him of a time machine that keeps his hopes alive for escaping back to his own time.The detail of Judge's vision for this abhorrent future makes the film. What Joe and Rita do is of no consequence, though you do root for them, which isn't hard considering every other character is a total numbskull. Instead, the way jokes are crafted into and from this imagining of a stupid future keeps us engaged. A machine that diagnoses all problems seems like an awesome thing, but when the operator doesn't know which probe goes in your mouth and which in your rectum, it suddenly becomes rather amusing."Idiocracy" is a cautionary social parody that refuses to take itself seriously. While there's something horrible about the number one show on TV in 100 years being "Ouch, My Balls!" and the Best Picture winner being a film called "Ass," it does us no good to make that critique in a dead-serious manner.The only fault of "Idiocracy "  and it's a substantial one  is that it doesn't have a story worth a damn. Judge desperately wants to take us to this world, but his film is guided only by the foolishness he wishes to take place in it, as well as jokes about our stupidity that are ripe for the picking. He's not interested in taking the time to tell a story that would also make the same point as his gags and satire. Good thing the gags and satire are sharp enough, as it makes "Idiocracy" an amusing, one-of-a-kind watch.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
"Extract" is not one of those tour-de-force comedies that knocks you on the floor with laughter, then again, that wasn't exactly the case in Mike Judge's previous cult hit "Office Space," a film so in its own category that "Extract" will inevitably be -- pardon the pun -- judged by comparison. In the mold of that iconic working-class comedy now ten years its senior, "Extract" goes for that everyday life annoyance humor, putting a lot of stock in awkward situations. The film, however, doesn't capitalize nearly enough on the comic disaster it stirs up, making it not all that memorable. But what it does deliver comes with a good-natured everyman/everywoman charm, staying human enough to earn our admiration.Jason Bateman stars as the mild-mannered Joel Reynolds, owner and operator of a flavor extract manufacturing plant whose daily struggles include dealing with feisty and mostly incompetent employees and trying to get laid by his wife (Kristen Wiig). When a freak accident spurred by his misfit workers takes out an employee's testicle, an insurance settlement and potential lawsuit threaten to bankrupt Reynolds and his partner Brian (J.K. Simmons) as well as compound the problems in his personal life.Added to the mix are a female con artist (Mila Kunis) looking for a share of the law suit money and Reynolds' shaggy drug-endorsing friend (Ben Affleck) who convinces Joel to pay a gigolo to seduce his wife. It seems like that's plenty in terms of comic potential and the rich quirky characters that made "Office Space" excellent, but its the plight of your well- intentioned average Joel that makes "Extract" work.Not to take anything away from Affleck, Kunis or even David Koechner as the obnoxious neighbor, all of who give good performances, but it's more about how Bateman works off these characters, whether he's shunning Affleck's offers of Xanax or struggling with the temptations of the flirty Kunis."Extract" is just one of those smile the whole way through and laugh just a couple handfuls of times comedies. It's not a triumph, the characters are not nearly as rich as "Office Space," and it skimps on its potential, but the cast is talented, the writing is natural and it still carries on the working-class spirit that made "Office Space" connect with so many people. The bottom line is that whether funny or not, Judge prefers to show off our good side, focusing mostly on the troubles we endure in life as we try to reconcile being good people with having personal needs and desires. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
War films seem to speak the loudest when "the other side" is not the actual enemy in the film. In "Glory," based on the real letters of Union Col. Robert Gould Shaw of the Massachusetts 54th, America's first black regiment in the Civil War has to battle prejudice and its soldiers own devaluing of their personal worth. That is the enemy, and overcoming it is how they achieve "glory" on the battlefield.The film follows Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in his first dramatic leading role to which he finds a mild measure of success. Shaw survives Antietum when he asked by the Mass. governor and Frederick Douglass himself to lead the first black regiment. Not only is the racial barrier a thick one, but Shaw must battle his own uncertainties of being in command and how to deal with others of similar rank who abuse that power. When Shaw realizes his men are merely being used to do the labor of the army, he fights for their right to see battle -- essentially their dignity and glory.Broderick's style caters best to the softer, sympathetic sides of his character as well as the courageous moments, but as a commanding military presence, his performance comes up a bit flat. Still, he is supported by the tremendous talents of Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman. Washington breaks out in a huge way in this film as Pvt. Trip, a quick-tempered rabble-rouser who usually plays devil's advocate to the all the Civil Rights sentiments in the film, a role that earned him a best supporting Oscar. Freeman's performance as the more responsible, level-headed soldier is only overshadowed by the other film he released at the time, "Driving Miss Daisy." Also impressive are Cary Elwes of "The Princess Bride" as Maj. Forbes and John Finn as the loud Irish Sgt. Maj. Mulcahy."Glory" also lives up to its title in the way it is crafted. Director Edward Zwick fills this film with great visuals -- gun powder-shrouded fields, the Atlantic coastline at dusk and the flare-lit skies over Ft. Wagner in the film's final battle, all set to a majestic James Horner score. "Glory" might be Zwick's most Academy-recognized film (which he directed), but his films have most importantly continued to tell the untold stories of heroism all over the world in an entertaining and engaging way.The story is brilliantly crafted by making us feel good by showing people like Shaw breaking racial barriers a whole century before Civil Rights, but then fueling our emotions by introducing characters in power or situations where prejudice trumps this progressive and empowering movement of the story. The plot offers a diverse set of characters that result in a diverse set of responses and perspectives to the racial issues of the film -- from Cpl. Thomas Searles, a well-educated black man raised free in the North to the defeatist "whites will always keep us down" attitude of Washington's Pvt. Trip, "Glory" handles the race issue sensitively and smartly.The story of the 54th regiment is one that needed to be told and it's told extremely well by all who worked on "Glory." All the excellent craftsmanship of the film only enhances its wise approach to a war America still fights on its own soil to this very day: Civil Rights.
It's amazing to see where Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have gone since "Titanic" and it should only be fitting that they reunite in a film the demonstrates the full extent of their talents. The wide range of emotion, the external and internal struggles--without them, this film would certainly flop into obscurity, even in the hands of the talented Sam Mendes ("American Beauty"). "Revolutionary Road" as a script doesn't carry enough strength. It's dialog-heavy and even melodramatic at times, even if much of that dialog is responsible for adding most of the film's depth. But DiCaprio and Winslet are so commanding and convincing that you're taken by their story and Mendes brings the best out of both of them.The timeless duo play Frank and April Wheeler, two suburbanites in the 1950s who have bought into the American ideals of the era despite their every inclination not to. Frank works a job he can't stand, April wishes she could be an actress. The film is the typical suburban conundrum: a contemporary-minded couple desire to grab life by the horns in a time where responsibility, family, practicality and self-sacrifice are the highest of values. Frank and April each wrestle with this in their own ways and it results in a lot of highs and lows for their relationship in the film.Winslet is amazing as usual. Her inner-monologue is about the strongest of any actress in Hollywood. How she can communicate personal conflict and emotion to the audience with her expressions is astounding and in a film where she plays a woman who feels one way but is pressured to behave another, she really gets to shine. She is beautiful, enticing and tragic at different points and then all at once.DiCaprio achieves the same effect in his own unique way. He's always been able to portray a roller coaster of emotion and playing a man who is sensitive, a bit neurotic, but also quick to defend his manhood, he has to convincingly change his emotion. He succeeds and he has to, because Frank does this a lot. His most striking strength in this film is the sensitive side in the calms after he fights with April. It's chilling how real it feels from him.But as talented as these actors are, the parts are highly demanding. They fight, a lot, and about the same stuff, over and over again. Toward the end, their fights elicit laughter from the audience because of how over-the-top the two are forced to react to each other's piercing insults as they fly off the handle. The film needed more external stimulus of conflict, not conflict stimulated mostly by characters' thoughts. There's only so many beautiful angles and close-ups of faces that Mendes can do with a camera to maintain interest. Perhaps the point is that the Wheeler's drive themselves insane due to the nothingness that surrounds them, but films need more than that to engage us sometimes. They rarely interact with their children in the film, which would seem imperative to understanding part of their sacrifice, for example, and it would give them so much more to actually do.The film is quite tragic, but certainly relatable. Whether its fighting with a spouse or the feeling that you're going to let life slip away because you've chosen a certain lifestyle. There's plenty of time during the film for reflection as you evaluate the arguments and decisions and decide for yourself whether they are settling or need some change. One standout character is a man recently let of of a mental institution that the Wheelers meet as a favor to a their realtor (Kathy Bates). It's the realtor's adult son, played by Michael Shannon, who provides the film's irony--he sees the Wheelers twice, affirming their choice to make a change at first and exposing their flaws the second, digging at the contradictory roots of the film's two-faced subject matter. Shannon steals his scenes with both self-deprecating humor and by delivering his poignant lines with great strength. Why is he noteworthy in a cast with such incredible talent? Because his scenes are so refreshing in a film that is so densely wrapped up in conversation with itself, that relies on riding the coat tails of the intense emotion depicted by its characters. "Revolutionary Road" is nothing short of thought-provoking, it just needs to more energy and a grander purpose and that's something two of today's best actors can't entirely remedy though boy do they come close.
You can check off "stoner comedy" and "action/crime spoof" on Judd Apatow's list of concepts for comedies. "Pineapple Express" basically takes the very best of stoner comedy (a genre that has a small but faithful following) and mixes it with clever, over-the-top action and violence. It's basically another notch on the idea belt for Apatow Productions who have hit very few bumps on the way to comedy fame and fortune since 2005's "The 40-Year-Old Virgin. "The result is a lot of fun, ridiculous, but quality laughs, though without that down-to-earth humanity that made Apatow's previous hits lovable and have a broad appeal. This one is strictly about being funny and while it definitely is, it's not up to par with earlier films like "Virgin," "Knocked Up" or "Superbad."I was privileged enough to attend an advanced screening in Chicago and was delighted to get an early glance at how this one compared to previous Apatow films. The raw, improvised, awkward humor that is the group's trademark was definitely there, but I have to admit it was stale at first. Seth Rogen, who plays a pot-loving mid-20s process server (tells people they're sued) named Dale has sat too long in the lovable loser protagonist chair. He's not a whole lot different than his "Knocked Up" role. He's too funny to do that and it's time he experiment or go back to a supporting role like in "Virgin." Truthfully, this film could not survive relying on the same style dialogue as previous Apatow movies alone and gladly it doesn't.One reason is because the other stars have not had too much Apatow exposure. James Franco as the dealer Saul is a much welcomed change of pace. He's not a show-stealer, but he's the more interesting and likable of the two main roles. His character is naive and funny in a more subtle way. In his first major comedic role, I have to say I was very pleased with the results.In general, the relationship dynamic of a pot smoker and his dealer is not as compelling and real as let's say two best high school friends like in "Superbad," which was written by the same writers, Rogen and Evan Goldberg. While they recognize this and try to tell the story of Dale and Saul creating a friendship, it doesn't really work. You'd rather Dale and Saul just do stupid stuff and laugh at them than listen to them argue and other pointless subplot friendship stuff.So what sets this film apart as a comedy instead of it being just okay is the action comedy aspect. The final scene in this film is unbelievably funny and redeeming of any apathy you have toward it, especially if you get what it's doing. It spoofs every typical action film sequence and in terrific stoner fashion. All the film's action is clever and way over-the-top with people over- shooting each other, slamming each other into walls and other things that in real life one would never survive, but these guys do. It's not believable, but it's really funny. Honorable mentions in the violence regard goes to Danny McBride who plays Red, the guy above Saul on the pot ladder who is sort of a self-proclaimed Chuck Norris figure mixed with a closet homosexual. His humor is right out of the Apatow vein but was definitely fresh. Also Craig Robinson ("The Office") is beginning to get his name out there as a comedian with this bad guy hit-man role. Several other lesser roles are also pretty hysterical. The only characters that didn't work for me were Gary Cole's (as much as he's a good actor, the part is just weak) and Rosie Perez's, who even if they chose her because she's a weird fit, is just a weird fit.In its truest form, this is a stoner comedy and that's important to know. While Apatow's past films might have been for a diverse crowd, this is definitely not something that older adults with no hippie background will enjoy all that much. It's not as stupid as other stoner films that draw on dumb things like naked women to draw interest (sex is virtually never brought up in this film), but it doesn't shy away from ridiculousness either. If any part of you likes stoner comedy, this film will instantly become your favorite of the genre. If not, you should still find things to like about "Pineapple," but don't come in expecting bigger and better than other Apatow films previously mentioned.
If all of Norwegian crime writer Jo Nesbø's novels are like "Headhunters," may they all grace the big screen. A cat-and-mouse thriller that unlike much of today's films doesn't drown itself in top-secret government ops and the consequent jargon, "Headhunters" blends suspense, violence, wit and top-flight acting into a superior nail-biter.Although the premise of a main character who steals famous works of art on the side contains a great deal of originality, it takes a deft hand to keep "Headhunters" so exciting. Director Morten Tyldum keeps what on paper is really a rather outlandish premise feeling real and tense.Aksel Hennie stars as Roger, a headhunter for some high-end clients who supports his lavish lifestyle and picturesque wife (Synnøve Macody Lund) with a side business that involves multi-million-dollar art theft. Quite meticulous, Roger prides himself on a few rules and beliefs that have gotten him this far, and Hennie radiates a bold and confident exterior that clearly masks Roger's inner paranoia.When his wife opens her art gallery, he meets Clas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), who he learns is in possession of a painting that could net Roger and his partner Ove (Eivind Sander) enough to quit the theft game forever. Consider that Clas' job in both the military and in business is complex GPS nanotechnology and tracking systems and you can guess what the plot has in store.The first half hour of "Headhunters" isn't exactly quick, but it's a juicy set-up as we become intrigued by Roger's operation as well as some adulterous twists that make the stakes of the cat-and-mouse acts all the higher. Roger is kind of smug and unlikable too, which brings an added range of emotions into the picture. As Roger starts to slowly unravel in his confidence and sanity, Hennie and his piercing blue eyes perfectly capture the sense of panic that we need to identify with him.As we endure the second-act adrenaline rush, the story calls for a few outlandish and extreme twists and turns with a black comedic edge. They wouldn't work in a drama like this under most circumstances, but the pure intensity leading up to and immediately following these odder moments has an amplifying effect on them, one that can best be described as gleefully entertaining in spite of the subject matter.Tyldum's balancing of the dark humor and clever, almost caper-like elements of "Headhunters" with the true drama and suspense gets a little exposed toward the end of the movie. Granted the story reveals itself to be an absolutely wild ride late in the game with a neat and tidy ending to things, but the tone in the ending moments didn't have to reflect that to a T. Wrapping with a wink and smile somewhat undermined the well-developed character drama, as if the writers who adapted the book were unaware that it would be as well-acted as it was.That said, the rare combination of depth of drama and suspense along with a creative, easy- to-follow story is a lot of what makes "Headhunters" such a joy to watch, even if it can be attributed to its few flaws. There's just the right amount of spice thrown in, which can't be said of most of today's thrillers, most of which tend to stick to the book or lean heavily toward comedy or gritty and violent rather than walking the line.Also laudable in "Headhunters" is how technology plays an integral role in the plot as opposed to being the gimmick that keeps us engaged. No character has a suitcase full of doodads that conveniently move the plot along in an exciting manner. The only thing you'll have trouble believing is how Roger lives sustaining some of the injuries he accrues in the second half of the film, but it proves to be worth it.After "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" and the rest of Stieg Larsson's "Millennium Trilogy," it could be said the best thrillers these days are coming out of Scandinavia, so connoisseurs of the genre would be wise to keep an eye on foreign cinema. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

"The Thin Red Line" is a war story told with images. There is a difference between that and a movie. It is a bold piece of film-making, especially for a war film, yet it makes all the same statements only without the stereotypes. If the creators of those dumb spoofs made "War Movie," it would be hard to make fun of this one. It's not the most engaging of films, but once again, it's more art through images and narration than a film.The plot is more like loosely combined narrative threads, a structure akin to a piece of music like a suite or symphony. There are distinct movements but everything is tied together with narrated reflections that repeat throughout. First there's Pvt. Witt (Caviezel), a soldier who's gone awol in the South Pacific, living in a kind of paradise on an island until a military ship comes along and he feels obligated to join up. The other story lines are different soldiers in the unit of young men. The island is Guadacanal and it represents a key turning point in the war against the Japanese.The cast boasts a lot of prominent actors before their prime such as Adrien Brody and John C. Reilly, but a lot of staples such as Sean Penn, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson and Nick Nolte as the war-mongering Lt. Col. Tall, whose life devotion to the army clouds his judgment, particularly when he orders Cpt. Staros (Elias Koteas) to lead his men on a sure suicide maneuver -- the film's most "standard" dramatic moment.The beauty of "Red Line" is not only John Toll's moving cinematography or some of the most memorable film editing, but also its ability to be a war film despite not acting like one. I love a war film that makes a particular choice about how it portrays "the enemy," which director Terrence Malick certainly does. For much of the film the Japanese are faceless enemies firing from a far, but as the fighting heats up, suddenly we see them, we recognize their humanity and how war has affected them too. We see the soldiers grow closer and without any extended obligatory booze, cards and cigarettes scene.Malick's film does what good poetry or music ought to: It uses its method of consumption as a means of affected people, of getting an emotional response. Sometimes that response is "bored," especially considering film is not the entertainment media of the patient person, but many times it's surprisingly effective. The cutaway flashbacks to one of the soldiers with his girlfriend or wife on numerous occasions that are set simply to music and narration are so much better than a dramatic flashback where a scene plays out, so much better at communicating the feeling of longing."The Thin Red Line" has some tough competition when it comes to aiming at being one of the best war films ever, but it stands out as different among the pack, which might be the more impressive feat.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Despite being supremely silly and immature, the timeless duo of Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar manage to make "Wayne's World" and later its sequel two of the only redeeming movies based on "Saturday Night Live" sketches. Their lack of street smarts and schoolyard antics play with a lovable innocence and, more importantly, a self-awareness. It's clear that although the film is basically about two guys horsing around, the talents behind it were doing anything but.The '90s had a very tough time shaking the '80s, at least as played in the movies, and "Wayne's World" captures this awkward transition whether intentionally or not. Mike Myers and then-"SNL" writers Bonnie and Terry Turner wrote a movie that operated in a very forward-thinking fashion at the time but was trapped in a sea of '80s clichés and long-haired metal rockers. If the point was in fact to poke fun at those still clinging to the age of "excellence," consider it received.Wayne (Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) are two dudes living with their respective parents who host a public-access television show in Wayne's basement called "Wayne's World." When Benjamin, a sleazy TV executive (Rob Lowe), flashes money and promises of fame their way, they sell out without realizing it, and when Benjamin starts making a play for Wayne's new babe, Cassandra (Tia Carrere), he and Garth must learn how to stand up for themselves.Myers and Carvey are held responsible for making this unexciting premise entertaining. Their ability to both convincingly play and make fun of their characters, sometimes simultaneously, has few rivals. Carvey in particular makes Garth one of the most lovable characters in a comedy of this kind. Garth's intelligence is matched only by his naivete and you can see both in Carvey's performance at all times. Wayne and Garth's fondness of innuendo also captures that hybrid of witty word play and complete immaturity that makes the humor tick.The magic of "Wanye's World" stems from being an everyman's comedy. The way Wayne and Garth (especially Garth) talk to the camera as if they've simply taken a camcorder to their insignificant but fun-filled lives makes them relatable dudes and establishes that the movie's humor is not manufactured to make us laugh, rather it invites us in for a shared comedy experience that is not above any viewer. Few comedies have done anything similar and been funny; 90 percent of them rely on contrived jokes and situations. The breaking of the fourth wall (to use the professional term not fitting of a movie like this) and the awareness of Myers and Carvey really sell us on this idea.In truth, only a few moments of "Wayne's World" have laugh-out-loud potential, but that's fine. It doesn't need it and it doesn't ask for it. And for a movie with a completely bare plot that does enough to give its characters something to do, it still works somehow thanks to the way it takes jabs at those very conventions. That's probably why 20 years later, it's just as easy to watch this movie and enjoy it even if you didn't sit down with the intent of really watching it. Party on.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com
Brothers Jay and Mark Duplass have made their name as filmmakers to this point by examining uncomfortable personal relationship dynamics and exaggerating all things awkward that arise in those situations. With "Jeff, Who Lives At Home," they focus on life's essential relationships with an entirely different sense of purpose and humor appears to be a secondary objective.With Jason Segel, Ed Helms and Susan Sarandon, the Duplass brothers have assembled more star appeal than they've ever had to work with before. "Cyrus" boasted an impressive cast in John C. Reilly, Marissa Tomei and Jonah Hill, but Segel and Helms in particular are two of the hotter names in mainstream comedy right now, both in film and television. Their casting here is not necessarily off, but misguiding to average viewers who might stumble across this title in their search for a night of gut-busting comedy.Segel plays the title character, a 30-something who lives in his mother's basement and likes to get high. Nothing novel there, except that this doesn't define Jeff at all. He spends the first five minutes at home, but the rest of the film takes place out and about in Baton Rouge as he pursues a mysterious "Kevin" and helps his brother, Pat (Helms), uncover if his wife is having an affair. The story plays out nothing like its title implies, which in the right light should be viewed as refreshing if not the entire point of the movie.The film is built around Jeff's perspective on life, that everything is connected, there are no coincidences and that signs exist all around us that point us to our fate. Obviously, as a man without a job living in his mother's basement, that outlook hasn't gotten him anywhere, but he also carries an abundance of optimism and doesn't sweat much of anything.Taking course in one day, Jeff's adventure begins when he receives a call from a wrong number at home from someone angrily asking for Kevin. Jeff interprets this a sign, and on the bus on the way to Home Depot, he encounters a young man wearing a basketball jersey with "Kevin" on the back. Convinced, he follows him, a choice that ultimately leads him to cross paths with his older brother, who is obsessed with material objects and has lived his life the expected, methodical way, which given his marital problems, hasn't done so well for him either.When Pat and Jeff spot Pat's wife, Linda (Judy Greer), in a car with another man, Pat gets wildly jealous and enlists Jeff to help him spy on them. It's an unusual form of brotherly bonding, which is the Duplass' wheelhouse, and therein lies the bulk of the humor.Their mom (Susan Sarandon) gets her own subplot completely apart from everything else. Her work day takes an unexpected turn when a secret admirer begins to drop her notes and instant messages at work. Suddenly she's confronted with the idea of not being as old as she feels.True to how Jeff sees things, nothing in the film ends up being coincidence, even if there's no other possible explanation for it. How does Jeff's pursuit of Kevin lead him to exactly where he runs into Pat? How do Jeff and Pat end up coming upon Linda? That's just the beginning, too.The opportunity for situational comedy waits around every possible corner in this movie, but the Duplass brothers aren't interested in it. Almost all of the humor emerges naturally from the progression of the story, which, to be honest, is instigated by the exaggerated traits of the characters.Pat is the main ruckus-causer, a role that doesn't fully suit Helms. He's much better at playing the lovable loser than the thoughtless, jealous jerk type, but when the script finds tender moments he makes them feel natural. Segel, however, is terrific as Jeff. He could have a bit more of a full-on weirdness about him, but as a romantic and somewhat naive type, he's perfect. Their clashing outlooks make for most of the film's drama.Undoubtedly, as filmmaking brothers, this had to have been a personal project for the Duplasses. All the members of this family maintain an appearance of being harsh toward each other, but they're all written in a way that sees them drawn to each other, like there's a definite need to be connected as family, and the events they endure play with these ideas of familial obligation and kinship, even while the focus of the film stays on testing Jeff's thesis about the connectedness of the universe.In a way, "Jeff, Who Lives at Home" isn't a misleading title, and the clue lies in the comma. With it, the fact that he lives at home is considered non-essential information about Jeff, but without it, it implies that it defines who he is. This is a story about Jeff, and it just so happens that he lives at home. He's much more than that, and so is the film.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
"Raging Bull" is sort of a sports drama by association. The way that director Martin Scorsese strings together the story of famous boxer Jake La Motta, the film is more of the rise and fall of a man who made his life as a boxer. It's amazing how few minutes of the film are boxing scenes and yet those scenes stick with you enough that you're convinced you're watching a sports movie. Instead, it's a biopic and arguably the first great biopic of a sports figure.La Motta is played by Robert De Niro in what one would argue is either his first or second greatest collaboration with longtime friend and film partner Scorsese. I would say first, because the dedication that De Niro gives to this role is so apparent from start to finish. The sparse boxing is incredible and the amount of weight lost and gained seems almost unprecedented for one film. Not only that, but De Niro seems to capture all sides of La Motta's personality whether a ladies man or an emotionally insecure, angry husband. The truth is that there's not that much going on in this film. It's a movie based around one man's life, which means the actor playing the man has to be really good and his story needs to be well told. Scorsese and De Niro hit it on the nose here. If anything, you walk away from this film seeing how a man who seemed to have so much success as a boxer really never had what truly mattered most to him in his personal life because he was so focused on his pride. While I could have used a bit more going on, Scorsese makes a lot of moments draw you in. The curious affair of La Motta and Vicki (Moriarty) is really well shot and both actors are so interesting to watch together, making it all the harder to deal with as they fight more in the latter half of the film. I also couldn't write a review without properly mentioning the strong supporting acting from Joe Pesci as Joey La Motta, Jake's brother. They also have great chemistry in the film.So you could say "Raging Bull" is about boxing, but it's really about how boxing for one particular boxer shaped and affected his life in positive and ultimately demising ways. I'm too cautious to call this a sports drama, but boxing does play an integral role in the movie without question. It simply goes to show the deeper human stories behind some of the world's greatest athletes and how it's not simply all about hard work and overcoming the odds. There are more themes in the world of sports than just that. It doesn't have to come down to who is going to triumph in the end. In "Raging Bull," you couldn't care less if he wins or loses, you just want to see how it will affect the rest of his life.
Back in 2002, Sony Pictures and filmmaker Sam Raimi brought one of Marvel Comics' most popular superheroes, Spider-Man, to big screen for the first time. Peter Parker's story captivated audiences and set the record for the most money made on an opening weekend.Now, let's imagine none of that ever happened. Let's pretend director Marc Webb and Sony brought movie-goers "The Amazing Spider-Man" for the first time ever in 2012. What's the result? A box-office record would be doubtful given the era we live in, but a powerful story that captivates audiences  absolutely. It would've been hailed as just as if not more of an incredible film in 2002.Well, it's not 2002, and we can't pretend forever. As such, the one major thing that will draw ire toward "The Amazing Spider-Man" is that it tells a story that came to the big screen 10 short years ago. It's not a conversation that would even happen if this were 2032, but this context is a reality.For a child who is now a teenager, this could turn out to be a defining film with two stars of a younger generation in Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, but a good chunk of audience members will wait and wait for the film to deliver some revelatory change to the story they already know that never comes.It's always important to be aware of your own expectations, but if you want to be able to appreciate the multiple strengths of "The Amazing Spider-Man," it's a recommendation that can't be taken lightly. So here it goes: this is Spider-Man's origin story. There are new actors, and some new characters that make it look different, but it's Spider-Man's origin story.To come clean on biases, I love Spider-Man's origin story. There's nothing more powerful in the comic universe than the way Peter Parker comes of age and into his role as a hero in a traumatic flash, losing someone he loves when he chooses to act thoughtlessly and selfishly. So on one hand, you could say I have a predilection toward this movie because it tells that story; on the other hand, I'm very particular about it. I need to feel it or I'll be disappointed. In this "Spider-Man," you definitely still feel it.The presentation of the movie is different than the 2002 film, but its core and messages are the same. Uncle Ben doesn't say "with great power comes great responsibility," but he basically paraphrases it. Call that repetitive if you will, but it's absolutely crucial to Spider-Man. It would be dishonorable toward the comics to handle it any other way, not to mention give little reason for you to care about Garfield's version of Peter Parker.Different from the original film, Peter is severely affected by a complete lack of resolution regarding his parents. He loves his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen, who is superb) and Aunt May (Sally Field), but his parents' disappearance haunts him, so the discovery of an Oscorp file belonging to his father and a lead in the form of man who was his father's old research partner, Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), sends Peter's curiosity into overdrive. Doing so lands him on the path to getting bit by the radioactive spider and becoming Spider-Man.Peter goes from extraordinary teen to masked crime-fighter for selfish reasons after the death of Uncle Ben. Whereas Peter believes he gets his revenge in the 2002 film (we learn he didn't in "Spider-Man 3″), failing to find his uncle's killer adds more painful irresolution to his life. It's a void he eventually realizes he can fill with heroism, and considering he gives Dr. Connors the formula that will later turn him into the The Lizard, stopping him is a chance to finally correct one of his mistakes.Peter also finds a confidant in Gwen Stacy (Stone), daughter of the police chief (Denis Leary) and the man who wants Spider-Man to answer to the law. Gwen actually learns of his identity, and the two even work together to stop Connors, another refreshing change from the damsel in distress motif that permeated all of Raimi's films. Yet Peter and Gwen's relationship still has that tragic quality true to the comics.From the romance to the science to the action, "The Amazing Spider-Man" has a decidedly more realistic feel than the Raimi films (and little of their campy humor), a fact likely to go under-appreciated given that we live in a post-The Dark Knight world. To be fair to that first trilogy, however, it did ground itself in real themes and emotions, but so does this movie. The second and third Spider-Man movies share a screenwriter with this reboot in Alvin Sargent, and the way the story is constructed feels extremely similar to those previous adventures.Even with all the quality writing full of strong themes and proper character motivation, "The Amazing Spider-Man" gets long in the tooth, especially as you wait for the origins to be fully rehashed with Peter getting his powers, playing around with his powers, etc. The third act, however, turns out to be an exhilarating finish and then some. The action (both in choreography and CGI in all acts of the movie) knocks the original trilogy off a skyscraper. And when it seems like the emotional flourish won't come, the script finds some fitting and effective moments of catharsis for all the characters.Yes, it's frustrating seeing something similar unfold that's fresh in our minds, but for a new Spider-Man franchise to emerge in the dust of the old one, these origin essentials needed to be covered, and they're covered exceptionally well. We have a whole new cast of lovable characters now, and Sony and Webb have earned their license (and our trust) to take the trilogy where they want it to go, which looks to be deeper into the mystery of the Richard and Mary Parker.
Audiences don't like to be lied to, but that's all part of the fun of "The Informant!," Steven Soderbergh's best recent directorial effort that hasn't been titled with a number between 11 and 13. The film sweeps us into a world of corporate crime and "espionage" and flavors it all with a thorough peppering of amusing anecdotal narration from an excellent Matt Damon as the mustache and four-eyed Mark Whitacre, VP of an agribusiness corporation specializing in corn cultures."The Informant!" is white-collar '90s period comedy with a quirky '60s spin on it through the use of flower-power title cards and a fantastic score by old-time esteemed songwriter Marvin Hamlisch. It helps lighten the mood of a film that's a lot of talk, that really ends up being more about its main character than the corporate scandal he creates for himself as he tries to turn informant without considering the consequences.Whitacre is a nut, but he's smart and gets the job done and Damon recognizes that. In his own strange ways, he makes sense of things and forms beliefs that "Bourne Ultimatum" screenwriter Scott Z. Burns (based on the Kurt Eichenwald book) expounds upon us with the constant narration that breaks into and interrupts scenes. In the film, he gets the FBI investigating into the corporation he works for because he says he's tired of the illegal price fixing they're engaging in with their foreign competitors. Then slowly, one turn of the spool at a time, Whitacre reveals part of the truth that he hadn't mentioned before, further frustrating the FBI agents working with him, his superiors at the company and making things more interesting for the audience.Damon as Whitacre is really the heart, the nucleus of "The Informant!" It's a dialogue-heavy film and without any big names in the supporting cast, the impetus is on Damon to add the dimension and the unconventionality -- an intrigue factor. The script at its core is a character story of a man who can never embrace the whole truth, so that should be its best part, making "The Informant!" set up to be well-received at the least. This isn't the kind of movie you rave about, but you have to applaud at how it uses what it has to be the best film it can be. Casting Damon and showing off his comedic side is something anyone who has seen a good deal of his films can appreciate. Playing Whitacre stretches him talent-wise and proves he's a good fit for just about any kind of role. And you have to hand it to a man who can play a ripped Jason Bourne but then pack on the belly pounds to play a twisted business exec."The Informant!" is not a corporate thriller or a true gut-splitting comedy, but it's really a well-made, interesting, unique and entertaining film from a director who has really needed a whole lot of that lately. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Welcome to "Drive," Nicolas Winding Refn's exercise in the tried and true lesson that less is more, and more when it follows less is pulse-pounding mayhem. Maybe somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of "Drive" could be considered "action" or "violence," but Refn makes every second of it count. When each slowly mounting scene finally explodes, the rush of adrenaline is so startling that you will either gasp or laugh from shock. "Drive" offers nothing the "stoic hero takes revenge" plot hasn't seen before, but you've never seen it done in this seemingly counterintuitive but amazingly effective fashion."Drive" stars Ryan Gosling as our nameless "Driver," a mechanic and stunt driver by day, stone-cold wheelman by night. Gosling hardly does a scene without a toothpick in his mouth or his scorpion-emblazoned driving jacket. And when the driving gloves come on  you can forget about it. His calm demeanor says everything not written into Hossein Amini's script and from the get-go, this protagonist has earned legions of faithful viewers.Gosling packs a lot of his signature suave from previous roles into the driver, that suave that would have anyone convinced he's a blue-blooded New Yorker and not a Canuck from Ontario. Anyway, the driver develops a little crush on his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), who happens to have a son and a husband in jail. Instead of sweet-talking his way in, he just gazes at her with that little smirk on his face  courtship complete. Men would kill for that move, women are killed by it and Gosling is one of the few who can pull it off convincingly.After the driver grows fond of Irene and her boy, the husband (Oscar Isaac) comes back. Not only does his return bust up their relationship, but also the husband owes money for protection in prison and if he can't pay, it could lead to his wife and son getting hurt. From what we know about our driver, that's tickles the one moral fiber in his body the wrong way. He agrees to help the husband rob a pawn shop by acting as the getaway, but when the job goes horribly wrong, he finds himself in a situation no one could drive away from.It takes awhile for "Drive" to get rolling, but that appears to be Refn's style: tantalize the audience with brilliant camera angles, an unpredictable score and churn the suspense to a tar-thick consistency. This approach will undoubtedly scare off some moviegoers yet completely awe others, but from a filmmaking perspective the artistry of the shots and takes puts Refn easily into a category of elite directors. Only a director with an undeniable gift could linger on literally half his shots and draw out nearly every scene without driving the viewer completely insane (that pun wasn't intended, yet quite fitting). "Drive" feels tedious at times anyway, so it would be painful to imagine such an interpretation of "Drive" in lesser hands.Due to this choice, the film suffers at points for lack of dialogue, but perhaps that's years of conventional filmmaking built up inside me. The instinct becomes particularly hard to ignore in those scenes of longing gazes between the driver and Irene when the script that ought to be runs through your head over the silence in the film. Fortunately, the love story plays second fiddle to the ever-spiraling degree of danger.Considering the aforementioned percentage of action and violence in the film, what little there is feels somewhere between excruciating, satisfying and terrifying all at once. The driver's iced veins through some jarring brutality seem unexplained, but the void in his back story rather than hindering his character allows us to draw any number of wild conclusions about what he's been through. The same goes for most of the other characters. Bryan Cranston's character and especially Albert Brooks' carry themselves in similar fashion. In one scene, Refn even commands the half-naked strippers to stay completely still and silent as the driver holds a bullet over a guys forehead with one hand and a hammer with the other. Realistic response from strippers? Hardly  but effective.Effectiveness would have to be the card "Drive" plays best. Say what you will of character motivation, romantic subplots and the the fact that much of the second act rests completely on an improbable coincidence, but Refn's film cuts hard and fast to the core; it makes you pay attention and then forces you swallow, just as any veritable tour de force ought to. Long term, count Gosling and Refn as two such forces.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
The 1950s has "American Graffiti" and now the 1970s has "Dazed and Confused." Both are well-developed depictions of life in America during those decades with a focus around high school, growing up and making important decisions about what to do and how to live life. Both also gather a killer soundtrack from each decade and the result is more about evoking nostalgia and showing those too young to know what life was like.Director and writer Richard Linklater does good work with this film about high schoolers (mostly incoming seniors) on the last day of school. He's written characters that are fun and easy to identify (by stereotype sometimes) and identify with. The plot is just one giant misadventure involving alcohol, marijuana, high school hazing and a variety of "rebellious" activity. It never settles comfortably around one character, giving you enough to get to know them and be interested in what happens to them, but not enough to truly understand them or care about them. Linklater's focus appears to be showing the many ways that teens handled life and how they felt about it in 1976 through mishaps and comedic moments.The cast is a lot of fun, especially because a lot of actors when they were a bit younger appear in the film: Ben Affleck, Matthew McCounaughy, Parker Posey, Adam Goldberg, Joey Lauren Adams ("Big Daddy"), Anthony Rapp ("RENT") and even more. Nobody's a show stealer, but that's because the film isn't designed that way."Dazed and Confused" is just fun. At the very least the soundtrack will have you rocking out a bit. There's no slapstick, gut-wrenching humor, you just laugh and enjoy. There's nothing moving about the movie, but you enjoy the characters and what happens to them. It's a very sound movie (no pun intended, but it work I guess) in that it's just well put together. It's not bad at all; if you don't like it it's probably because you wanted more from it.
After 1964's "Goldfinger," the question became not about how much better the big-screen adventures of Ian Fleming's James Bond could be, but how much bigger. "You Only Live Twice" is the summation of this effort to push "Bond" to the top, though many would argue it goes way over the top."You Only Live Twice" is Bond's most ridiculous mission yet, but also his most exhilarating. After "Thunderball" took Bond underwater, producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli must've thought the next logical thing would be to shoot him up in the air. Bond pilots the heavily ammunitioned one-man helicopter Little Nelly in this film, a present of sorts from Q (Desmond Llewelyn), which he uses in a spectacular aerial fight sequence over Japan.The film also plays off the '60s Space Race in terms of the story. Russian and U.S. space shuttles are being swallowed up by an unknown rocket that MI6 has traced to somewhere near Japan. Both countries believe the other is at fault, and so nuclear war is on the horizon if the problem isn't solved, so work out the logic and it's clear SPECTRE must be involved.The film opens with Bond getting shot and killed in Hongkong, but it's not a hard sell, or all that shocking of a scene. Pretty anticlimactic, really. Anyway, the move was a PR one by MI6 to keep Bond off the radar. He travels to Japan quietly to investigate where the rocket is coming from, where he encounters the somewhat mysterious love interest Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi)and teams up with Tiger Tanaka (Tetsuro Tanba) and his village of ninjas to infiltrate SPECTRE's base, which they discover to be in a crater.The sensitivity to Japanese culture, or lack thereof, is one of the troubling parts of this film. Tanaka has a line about how women come second in Japan and oh how wonderful that is, plus Bond gets made up to look like a Japanese man, which includes ripping the trademark hair off his chest. That and the Space Race stuff makes this one of the least timeless "Bond" films.One of the other highlights of "You Only Live Twice" is the reveal of No. 1 himself, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Donald Pleasance). He comes off a little silly, but that could be because he was the basis of Mike Myers' Dr. Evil character from "Austin Powers." Pleasance is obviously a terrific actor and makes Blofeld an intriguing bad guy. His lair, designed incredibly by Ken Adams, contributes to the diabolical genius motif. It's so interesting how the "Bond" films, in particular this one, shaped the very framework of heroes vs. evil geniuses. So much of what we now know to be cliché began with "Bond." "You Only Live Twice" is either "Bond" at its most fun or "Bond" at its silliest. Everyone is bound to have a different opinion on that idea, but the truth is probably somewhere in between. I personally would give it a 7.5/10 here if I could. Certainly it would be nice to see the films stay true to a more serious, espionage tone, but it's the ridiculous that makes this fifth film most memorable.Whichever way you see it, "You Only Live Twice" holds an important place in the "Bond" canon.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

To Hollywood, the MIdwest is that amorphous blob in the middle of country that allows for the satire of corn-fed American values. Whenever a place such as Iowa serves as a film's setting, as it does in "Butter," you can be sure that small-town life is about to get put through the ringer. A rather massive ensemble comedy, "Butter" takes this to an extreme by selecting a butter- carving competition as the focal point of the conflict. Obviously, we're only meant to take this film as seriously as most people would take an actual butter-carving competition, which is to say, not much at all.The film has two narrators. First, Jennifer Garner's Laura Pickler, picturesque wife to the wealthy Bob Pickler (Ty Burrell), butter-carving champion, and who hopes to parlay the esteem she and Bob have amassed over the years into becoming a political power couple. She's a full-on caricature of the superficial, borderline psychotic wife, the Lady Macbeth archetype minus the tragic consequences.On the opposite end of the spectrum is Destiny (Yara Shahidi), a humble foster child coping with being a black girl in a sea of white kids who somehow discovers a knack for butter-carving. Her narration involves a few too many jokes about crackers (not the food), but Shahidi turns out to be the film's secret weapon.Laura finds her world upside down when the butter competition folks pressure Bob to retire and he agrees. She decides she will enter the contest herself, but she faces stiff competition from young Destiny and also a cutthroat stripper (Olivia Wilde) whom Bob owes money. And when things don't go her way, she isn't afraid to stoop too low.Writer Jason Micallef pushes the boundaries of decency in terms of language for a comedy that would otherwise be an easy PG-13. Between the excessive swearing and race-related jokes, "Butter" is definitely a bit cruder and more uninhibited of a comedy when you consider it centers on butter-carving. Jokes such as how one of Bob's masterpiece carvings was "Schindler's List" should give you a good sense of the boundaries the script threatens to cross. The mouth on Wilde's stripper character is something to behold and even Garner goes overboard on the F- bombs.Garner's Pickler is a handful of a character and the actress' biggest attempt at comedy to date. Her performance veers into hamming territory with some frequency, but she sets the tone for the film's lack of self-seriousness, which proves pivotal to enjoying its odd, almost black sense of humor.The comedy highlights come mostly from Shahidi and her interactions with Rob Corddry, who plays her foster father. They have a great partially improvised bit when he drops her off to go sign up for the contest in which they imagine what horrible things could be inside the building and that it could be much worse than having to commit to the competition. You haven't seen a pre-teen deliver deadpan like she does, maybe ever.Hugh Jackman also comes in late playing against type as Laura's former high school boyfriend Boyd, a complete dolt who owns a car dealership and agrees to help her with some mischief in the competition. For fans of Burrell on "Modern Family," he's cast as a bit of a fool and completely non-extreme when compared to the shenanigans of his wife, Wilde's Brooke, and others.The script reaches for laughs a small but noticeable percentage of the time, but the fails are cushioned appropriately by the film's cheeky attitude and absolute fearlessness when it comes to political correctness (specifically the lack thereof). At the same time, "Butter" manages to achieve a level of sweetness, particularly through Destiny. As a foster child, the pity card makes her invulnerable and the way she maintains her demeanor while all the other characters (except her foster parents) surrounding her shame themselves with stupidity helps us to like her even more. She cuts through all the others' B.S. with, to be blunt, a butter knife.With a carefree indie spirit and a unique context with which to present its humor, "Butter" manages to stand out among contemporary comedies, even if its quirkiness isn't quite as effective as it would like to believe.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Carjacking is generally a good time, but Dominic Sena manages to make it unexciting in "Gone in Sixty Seconds," a remake of the 1974 film. Aside from a good final chase, this film spends more time talking about stealing cars than actually doing it. At the least you'd expect a two-hour showcase of some beautiful automobiles, but you get cheated out of that too. Instead, you get a cast full of unfunny hollow characters running into problems trying to steal cars, and when they finally do, they last, well, sixty seconds.Sena, whose credits include working on Janet Jackson videos, is interested in ineffective style choices. It's expected in a movie about grand theft auto that there's going to be excessive glitz and a lot of visual dressing up of an average story line, but instead of adding exciting flare, Sena chooses to set things on fire in unwarranted places and set to cheesy electronic "let's wear leather and get in and out of cars" music.The story is pretty straightforward and the plot moves quickly despite a few holes. In it, Nicholas Cage, who's notorious for picking all kinds of projects good and terrible, stars as retired car thief Memphis Raines, who is brought out of retirement when his kid brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisy) gets in trouble with a big overseas car broker. The broker threatens to kill Kip if Memphis doesn't steal an order of 50 cars within three days. Memphis assembles a team of quirky thieves young and old to save his brother's life while a pair of detectives follow his trail.Infamous '90s action producer Jerry Bruckheimer has the right idea in getting this movie made, but the team of Sena and writer Scott Rosenberg (who wrote the Cage thriller "Con Air") just doesn't get the job done. It would have been perfectly acceptable for "Gone in Sixty Seconds" to be a high-adrenaline film for action junkies with a flimsy plot, maybe even hyper-masculinized, but we don't even get that. There's a great opportunity for the story to bring us into the world of car boosting, but we learn nothing about how a car is stolen other than brief images and dialogue. I don't think they had reason to believe everyone was going to start stealing cars with that information. But if nothing else were wrong, there's still no tension or sense of what's at stake. Kip, for some reason, is really cool about everything and it's his life is on the line, so if he doesn't care, why should we? The brother tension between him and Memphis is simply that, not a developed subplot by any means, nor is the sexual tension between Memphis and Sway, Angelina Jolie's character, who's reasons for helping with the mission appear to be to avert sexism. Robert Duvall and Chi McBride also play two-dimensional roles. Apparently the fact that Kip might die (even though he doesn't care) is good enough for everybody."Gone in Sixty Seconds" is mostly a predictable and conventional story line, but it's effectively so, helping keep our attention despite the film's complete lack of an edge. It gives just enough to convince its audience something exciting is coming and meets that expectation with average marks. But I don't even think a car-lover would find this more than marginally entertaining. ~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
"Gran Torino" has to be the only good politically incorrect film to ever be made. Clint Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a crotchety and ignorant old Korean War vet whose vocabulary is a thesaurus of racial slurs. He's basically a racist Dirty Harry in his 70s-80s and the script hits us over the head with his unabashed insensitivity and cold-heartedness to the point where "Gran Torino" is half comedy. But then, as only a masterful director such as Eastwood can do, "Gran Torino" becomes one of those classic unlikely relationship films between a widower and his teenage Asian-American neighbor. It's a film with a great premise but an off-kilter script that Eastwood salvages into something poetic.There's no question Eastwood liked the potential he saw in rookie writers Nick Schenk and David Johannson's script for himself as an actor and a director. It is the perfect cap to his illustrious acting career, combining his great character acting in westerns and the Dirty Harry movies with his more dramatic pictures of the last 15 or so years. It's an unrefined story, but contains a lot of great storytelling potential.Taking place in an old Michigan neighborhood that has since become overrun with Hmong (Southeast Asian) immigrants, "Gran Torino" is about the widower Walt and the teenage Hmong boy next door, an introvert who is peer pressured to join his cousin's gang. When the boy, Thao, tries to steal Walt's 1972 Gran Torino and Walt unintentionally saves Thao from gang trouble, Walt, Thao and Thao's family become entangled, more so than Walt would like.Walt sort of mentors Thao in an inappropriate and grouchy way and he boldly confronts various gangs posing dangers to Thao and his sister Sue despite doing something each time to counter his act of "kindness" with a demeaning or ignorant comment. The script meddles with stereotypes a bit too much in this way, trying to use other characters' dialogue to battle the extremism of Eastwood's character. Sue, for example, gets hit on in one scene by three black guys who trash her white friend who calls them "bros" and to defend herself she starts calling them out on their stereotypical "pick on the Asian girl" behavior. Basically, "Gran Torino" gets a bit in over its head in trying to present an accurate racial palette.At the same time, diversity themes are part of the film's strength. No major film has focused on Hmong Americans before, and considering the prejudices Walt brings with him from the Korean War, they're an ideal focus for the story. The major differences between Walt's lifestyle and theirs is part of what keeps "Gran Torino" interesting.There's no question that Eastwood know what he's doing. He has an uncanny ability to keep the audience guessing what's coming but the story never goes where you expect it to. It's both engaging and surprising and his techniques speak as much truth if not more than the script.The only other thing hurting "Gran Torino" is its lack of an experienced supporting cast. Although Hmong actors needed to play Hmong characters, Walt's sons and the Catholic priest that pesters Walt to confess his sins are weak. Eastwood dominates the scenes he's in and if he's not in a scene, the film lacks power and authenticity. Walt might be a flagrant hater of all peoples not white and American, but he's at least convincingly so where the other actors aren't.So despite its twisted and questionably inadvertent sense of humor, "Gran Torino" is a triumph of veteran film-making and a dominating lead actor over amateur storytelling and a weak overall cast. The film takes refuge in its quiet but lovable teenage protagonist and the relationship he develops with a foul-mouthed old man and how both help each other in the end. We expect Walt to turn into a softie when he takes Thao under his wing, but he never caves completely, and that's admirable, even if it would be nice for him to take a break from the pejorative comments so that the laughs would be a bit more guilt-free. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
The best spies usually work alone. There's a reason James Bond and Jason Bourne fly solo, which is generally assumed to be that it lessens the margin for error and prevents emotional attachments. Perhaps it's really because the we like to uncover the dark secrets that make a ruthless assassins tick, which isn't too much of a challenge to a screenwriter  when there's only one spy. In "The Debt," we have three former Israeli Mossad agents who were hailed as heroes in 1966 after salvaging a near-lost mission to capture a Nazi war criminal in East Berlin and bring him to trial in Israel. That makes for three heads we yearn to crack, not to mention the consequent relationship tension resulting from a little something we don't yet know. For a plot that has a lot of stories to juggle (individual character stories on top of the rehashing of the events in East Berlin), "The Debt" rests in good hands. Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman have written some excellent scripts in "Kick-Ass" and "X-Men: First Class," and despite the various challenges and a few painfully slow moments (some of which you could argue had a point to being that way), they and Peter Straughan manage a narrative with evenly spread tension points. No doubt much of that credit belongs to veteran director John Madden. Every scene packs an unspoken element of tension whether pure suspense, inner monologue or even romantic tension.Rachel, Stephan and David were all agents on the mission that resulted in the death of "The Surgeon of Birkenau." In 1997, Rachel (Helen Mirren) and Stephan's (Tom Wilkinson) daughter Sarah has published a book of their heroism, but that very day, David (Ciarán Hinds) commits suicide. Immediately we come to realize something's amiss and from there the film tells of the events in East Berlin.For the most part, this is Rachel's story. In 1966 East Berlin she's played by Jessica Chastain, who takes advantage of the amount of screen time and steals the show. If there's a right way to communicate what it's like to be spying on an infamous Nazi surgeon who performed horrific experiments while having him examine you in stirrups on multiple occasions, she found it.Rachel is also at the center of an understated love triangle that feels a bit heavy-handed when it rises to the foreground. Nevertheless, the actors do well with what they're given. Romance aside, Marton Csokas gives young Stephan the Type-A personality he requires while Worthington meddles in the shadows as a more introverted young David. Worthington shows he's far better suited for more external characters, but to be fair the only truly bad thing about his performance is his Israeli accent. In fact, the accent thing across the board was kind of rough.When the three finally capture the infamous Dieter Vogel, the film moves in an odd direction. The script gives the doctor too many chances to open his mouth and say obnoxious and horribly anti-Semitic things, all of which seem to waste time and just make the audience and the characters angry  a dangerous emotion at the movies. If not for leading up to a seriously effective reveal/twist, it would have marred the entire film. Instead, the story continues another half hour longer than expected with a slow but mostly pertinent dragging out of the conclusion and the film's thematic questions. Undoubtedly, some viewers will find the script's anger-inducing elements drive them beyond the point of enjoyment, though by the end the filmmakers justify everything."The Debt" asks some questions of those we call heroes and effectively examines the importance of truth, but the road there requires bounding over some romantic obstacles and some serious junctures where the point almost feels entirely lost. The more we know about the story, the clearer the picture comes together, but it takes awhile to arrive there. Like a good puzzle, the most satisfying thrillers come together at an even grind with a couple bumps and twists. "The Debt" compares more to the kind that comes together all at once after much laboring when you finally uncover the key that justifies it all. Both end satisfactorily, but the latter makes you wonder if it was worth it for the moments of great frustration.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
The Star Trek franchise has generally and maybe unfairly developed a reputation for being the threshold between socially acceptable science-fiction and nerd-dom. Basically, many people aren't prepared to boldly go where Star Trek does -- strange planets, a handful of make-up-covered new species and red laser beam special effects. Where Star Trek fans see alien nations, Trek skeptics see alienation. At the hands of the latter group, the second film installment of the franchise, "The Wrath of Khan," will unfortunately suffer from these same prejudices. That is a shame, because its heartfelt tale of leadership is actually universal -- and not only in the interplanetary sense.Those who test the classic Star Trek waters with "Wrath of Khan" will be pleasantly surprised. For starters, intergalactic diplomacy is not the focus of this film -- the alien species count is kept low. Instead, "Wrath of Khan" is about the return of a middle-aged James T. Kirk (Shatner) to the U.S.S Enterprise as an admiral, taking Starfleet cadets out on a brief training exercise. But when former TV show villain Khan (Ricardo Montalban), a highly intelligent genetically engineered being, comes looking for swift revenge for being exiled by Kirk on a remote planet, the trip becomes more than training and Kirk must hop into the captain's chair once more. "Khan" is a coming-of-middle-age story, if you will. Kirk wrestles with getting older, competency and his appearance as role model to the cadets as the only cadet to ever beat the Kobayashi Maru test, a no-win simulation that tries a wannabe captain's character. He even comes face to face with an old lover who of course has a rebellious son. As he battles Khan, it becomes a test of who's smarter -- or who has the qualities a leader ought to have.That's not to say "Khan" doesn't live up to Trekkie standards. There are phaser battles between starships, parasites that control human will by wrapping around the cerebral cortex and plenty of seemingly inescapable scenarios. It's not Star Trek's most imaginative story, but one of its strongest. At times, the logic of all the solutions can be hard to follow, but the general idea of what's going on is all that's necessary to enjoy the film. A true character story, "Khan" is one of the old Star Trek films that fans (Trekkies aside) of the future will test out and discover that the vintage stuff wasn't so weird after all.
Rather than a gritty drama about Irish immigrants struggling to make due, Jim Sheridan has turned the downtrodden parts of New York City into the backdrop for a real-life fairy tale in his film "In America."Instead of frightening us with frank confrontations of real-world problems in the form of drug dealers, trouble paying the rent and following one's dreams, the film holds closer to the family's two little girls, presenting events with a sense of wonder and at times a more raw child-like fear rather than true danger. So what seems like a film about an Irish-American family with Irish-American issues is actually a film about a unique family with its own unique issues, namely a ghost of the past that burdens all of them.The Sullivans, Johnny (Paddy Considine), Sarah (Samantha Morton), Christy (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger) move to Manhattan in hopes that Johnny can launch his acting career. They move into an apartment in the rough part of town and try to settle in, except from the very beginning it's clear that the family is still grieving the loss of its only son, Frankie, who died of a tumor.Whereas Frankie's death has impacted Johnny and Sarah in real ways, the girls have a unique understand and perspective on their departed brother. Christy, the film's narrator and a brilliant little girl (as both character and actress) asks him to grant her three wishes throughout the course of the film at pivotal moments. Both Bolger girls are quite gifted and they give the film its wholesome and at times even magical tone.Frankie's death is both the spoken and unspoken source of conflict in the film, which otherwise serves as a portrait of American life in one particular time in one particular place. Some scenes provide humor and levity whereas others are more thought-provoking. One such scene takes place at a street carnival where Johnny nearly throws away an entire paycheck on a carnival game in order to win Ariel a stuffed animal version of E.T. That scene almost says it all about this little gem.The most powerful chapter of the film, however, involves Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), an African-American artist living downstairs. He's painted "Keep Away" on his door and the girls have often heard screaming from inside his apartment, but on Halloween they bravely knock on his door and they form an unusual friendship that has quite emotional results."In America" has a very personal feel to it and that's evidenced by the dedication before the credits to his late brother Frankie (and also given that he collaborated on the script with this siblings). Although not quite what you're expected in terms of dramatics, "In America" is moving and an absolute pleasure to watch.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
When a film sets out to tackle a big issue, there's usually a lot that goes untouched, but not with "Traffic." This film doesn't hold back anything or give anything but a balanced look at the reality of the situation caused by drug-trafficking in North America."Traffic" follows many slightly interwoven story lines. The first is the side of the story in Mexico with two cops (Del Toro and Vargas) from Tijuana trying to catch the area's top narcotics dealers. The next is the story of Robert Wakefield (Douglas) who is the newly appointed Washington official in charge of the crackdown on drugs. We also follow his daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen) and her recreational drug use despite being a straight A student. Lastly there is Helena (Zeta-Jones) whose husband has been arrested for drug- related crimes she knows nothing about. She is also being watched by two agents (Cheadle and Guzman).There is a lot to follow in all of these story lines, but their slight interconnectedness allows the plot to succeed without getting too complicated. The result is that we see so many different ways in which drugs affect people. The most significant thing this film does, is really challenge the mentality and opinion of those who identify with the white, upper-class politician that is Douglas' character. It is clear director Steven Soderbergh wants us to identify with him and the movie as he learns about the harsh realities of drug use in America.This film is most effective in challenging the notion that drugs can just be stopped. Those who try and end it, every character, whether Douglas, Del Toro, Cheadle, they all find there is a big price to pay for such little reward and minimal difference made in stopping drug use. While that might suggest a bias in the film, there seems to be no suggestion made by Stephen Gaghan's awesome script that the war on drugs is futile and that the effort should be ceased. This film highlights the difficulty and in an incredibly convincing fashion.Soderbergh and Gaghan make a great team in this movie. Soderbergh uses different techniques and lighting, particularly with colors, to help make the distinctions in plot lines that are already solid to begin with. When everything appears yellow, for example, you know immediately that the scene will follow Del Toro and take place in Mexico. It also sets a tone for these plot lines on top of that."Traffic" ends up just being a really fantastically told, eye-opening lecture with encouraged discussion on the war on drugs. The film ends and there is a sense of the futility, the perpetual nature of what this illegal business does to people, but there is also a sense of hope, that ending drug use can start in the smallest of places with the people who have developed attachments to them.
Nothing about the premise of "Pitch Perfect" suggests it should be a funny movie, or anything more than a diversion for "Glee" fans who've burnt out on the hit show after three-plus seasons. A cappella groups might be a change of pace for Hollywood, but college humor isn't, with most college comedies going straight to DVD bargain bins these days.So even after seeing "Pitch Perfect," it's a total wonder how it manages to stay fresh and entertaining. College movie clichés lurk around every possible turn of the plot, but "30 Rock" writer and producer Kay Cannon, who essentially wrote the movie (it resembles Mickey Rapkin's book in name only), artfully dodges, embraces and twists them in surprising ways, and the cast working with it fulfills its end of the bargain too.The film stars Anna Kendrick as Beca, a freshman at fictional Barden University who's an aspiring DJ preoccupied with mixing her own mashups. Reluctantly, she's recruited by the Bellas, the school's all-female vocal ensemble, led by the authoritarian Aubrey (Anna Camp), who's hell-bent on taking the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (which exists, actually) away from the school's all-male group, the Treblemakers. Problem is, Aubrey wouldn't know hip if it bit her in the ass. Beca rolls with their old-school ways and never- ending performances of Ace of Bass' "The Sign" until it's clear they need a shakeup if they want to win it all.But "Pitch Perfect" isn't some competitive singing movie that plays out as a "will they or wont' they win?" drama. In fact, there's almost a total disregard for that element of the story. Audiences who go primarily for the music might even be a tad disappointed that most of the songs are kept to snippets, and director Jason Moore does little to emphasize the quality of the singing or the music itself. The script sticks squarely to comedy, hoping to surprise you with its sense of humor. The best comedies have strong supporting characters who can take attention away from the predictable core story, usually a romance, in this case Beca's friendship and eventual spurning of Jesse (Skylar Astin), a freshman Treblemaker who interns with Beca at the campus radio station. "Pitch Perfect's" ace is Aussie Rebel Wilson, the recognizable roommate from "Bridesmaids," who plays Fat Amy, a new Bella with boisterous personality and loads of confidence. Wilson's one-two punch of deadpan and self-deprecating humor takes the edge off the "Mean Girls" dynamic established between Beca and the two older Bellas, Aubrey and Chloe (Brittany Snow).The other girls in the group possess just the right amount of quirkiness to be memorable rather than stereotypical. There's a black lesbian, a whispering Asian and a tall slut to name a few. The guys of the Treblemakers, led by Bumper (Adam DeVine of "Workaholics"), act cool, but in the nerdiest way possible. The script is keen on reminding us that these characters are all in singing groups, and therefore by definition, nerdy.The laughs extend as far as the competition commentators, played John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks, who frankly don't exist. No one is listening on the radio to these things, and it's not even clear they're even being broadcasted. But they're for our enjoyment to be sure. Not since the team of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman in "Dodgeball" have commentators been this funny."Pitch Perfect" thrives on this genuine wit, which perfectly masks how irrelevant the rest of the movie is. As the director of hit Broadway show "Avenue Q," Moore understands how humor and music work, but even he would concede "Pitch Perfect" is about the former. The script's sharpness is matched only by it's conscious effort to avoid the clichés that comes with this territory. Even if you think you know what the joke is going to be, there's some twist that will come later. The ending, always the worst parts of these movies, avoids all the gooey stuff too. It's so nice to see a conscious effort to deliver something unexpected in a genre that filmmakers so often use as an excuse to lean on the conventional. It just so happens that a movie about college a cappella was lucky enough to be the recipient of this refreshing approach.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
Like most movie franchises begun in the 20th Century -- with a few notable exceptions thanks to James Cameron -- the "Predator" series was never better than its 1987 original. The most recent efforts pitting the Predators against their "enemies" the Xenomorphs, the "Alien vs. Predator" films, had reduced a once imaginative and fearsome beast to a B movie creature feature. Producer Robert Rodriguez and director Nimrod Antal attempt to change that with "Predators" plural."Predators" ranks as next best to the John McTiernan original, but that's not exactly a major accomplishment. This version restores the intensity and creative possibility to the "Predator" universe, but it doesn't match the genre-changing impact that the 1987 film had on monsters-hunting-humans movies. The film plays it safe, going for action with that macho, carnal brutality that only true lovers of monster and alien flicks enjoy.The film definitely proves that a reinvention of the series was warranted. The script from rookie writers Alex Litvak and Michael Finch is a home run as far as concept goes: this time the humans are on the Predators' planet and they aren't just any humans, but representative of the most elite killers from all over the globe. In other words, the Predators want to hunt the very best killers humankind has to offer.Adrien Brody stars as the firm-willed but mysterious leader of the pack. He takes charge early on in the story, but also as far as acting. Lowering his voice to the "Christian Bale as Batman" frequency, he proves he has leading man ability and command. It helps to mask that Litvak and Finch write his nameless (except for the last few minutes) character with a bit of an exaggerated no-nonsense attitude, to the point where he always seems to know what's up, have a plan, or have surmised just the right amount of information to compel the action forward."Predators" begins with more promise than it ends with. The drama begins with Brody falling through the sky and landing on the planet with the other "prisoner," who certainly fail to trust each other at first and slowly begin to realize over the first half hour just what they're up against. Antal, who directed the unsuccessful heist flick "Armored" and the well-received horror flick "Vacancy" is much more patient and deliberate during this first act, but once the Predators make their first appearance, the lid comes off. Part of the power of the original "Predator" as with "Alien" and other successful films with "hunters" was the slow reveal, never completely showing the enemy force until the suspense has built up, if ever. True, we know what Predators look like after 20-plus years, but these enemies become less menacing when overexposed, especially given that there's way more than one in this film.Thematically I was almost impressed that the script was concerned with themes of survival at all costs and the idea of compassion being both a weakness and a strength of human nature. It was not just dialogue that illustrated these points, but actual events, particularly the outcome of when the group meets Laurence Fishbourne's character, who has been on the planet surviving in solitude for quite some time.But the anti-climactic action sequences really snuff the suspense and otherwise impressive pacing of the film. For example, there's no reason to have a Japanese Yakuza hit-man engaging in a sword fight with a Predator than to have a human engaging in a sword fight with a Predator. The scene itself does not work nearly as well as the idea behind it.However, "Predators" is definitely taking the franchise back in a positive direction and with a capable and likable lead in Brody. It carries more of the "Predator" tradition than the failed sequels before it, but by no means does it reach the threshold of what a "Predator" movie can be.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
If humans can only access 20 percent of their brains normally and 100 percent while on NZT, the "Limitless" drug of choice, then I would say screenwriter Leslie Dixon and director Neil Burger probably access somewhere around 70 percent of their creative power with regards to bringing Alan Glynn's novel to the big screen. All far-fetched concept stories have their side effects, but the true winners avoid the crash. "Limitless" takes its audience on a thrill ride through the realm of possibility and gleefully entertains, but some sobering second-act elements kill off a bit of the joy.Bradley Cooper ascends to full-fledged leading man status as Eddie Morra, a disheveled writer stuck in a rut who receives a little round miracle from an old acquaintance. This pill multiplies brain function exponentially, increasing his capacity for knowledge and the speed with which he acquires it. He can learn entire languages within hours, problem-solve instantaneously, recall long-discarded insignificant details from his memory and even finishes his book in the first night. But as we all learned in D.A.R.E., all drug use has its consequences.Eddie's consequent meteoric rise to wealth, prestige and even fame is a fun time. He even scores his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) back. Although the degree to which he outsmarts and impresses everyone is a total joke from a believability perspective, between Burger, Dixon and Cooper, we get a hard sell. The script paces well and uses narration effectively to help us enter Eddie's head and Burger employs a great deal of visual techniques  even if excessive at times  to mimic the effects of the drug, not unlike Darren Aronofsky's work on "Requiem for a Dream," just less stomach-churning.Burger and cinematographer Jo Willems change exposure levels, color brightness and countless other techniques to create a distinction between when Eddie is on versus off NZT so that we feel that transition with him to an extent. Cooper as an actor fully captures that for us as well. I suppose if there's anything he learned to do well from "The Hangover," it was act convincingly hung over or experiencing withdrawal.Truthfully, Cooper's the show here. Although they have scenes of influence, Cornish and Robert De Niro (as a business bigwig who employs Eddie to orchestrate a merger) have little bearing on the story. At one point it seem Cornish's Lindy will emerge as a prominent character, but this surprisingly subsides.Muddling matters more are the varying forces of antagonism in the film: a lender who gets hooked on the drug who keeps coming after Eddie, a man following him and of course the nasty side effects of the drug that Eddie soon uncovers. Things are not as intricately connected as we're inclined to believe, which is mostly what derails the film in the end. The other factor would be a total lack of a realistic message, or any message for that matter.Serving as executive producer, Cooper shows a flare for the business here. He's put the right pieces in place to make a fun concept movie work in addition to finding a leading role that fits his abilities. The film's better-than-expected box-office business also suggests he's growing quite popular. It's almost the kind of prowess you'd have to manufacture  wait, could it be?~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Having inherited the keys to "Star Wars," J.J Abrams has seen a rash of outbursts from skeptics in the last few months, picking up steam with this, the release of his second adventure with the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Surely one man cannot control both nerd worlds, right? Well, "Star Trek Into Darkness" offers more proof why everyone should just let him try.Abrams has an acute understanding of creating universally enjoyable entertainment not really seen since Steven Spielberg in his heyday. His use of mystery as a tool to pull viewers in creates the sensation of a two-hour thrill ride, which is essentially what we get with "Into Darkness." Equal credit goes of courseto his team, especially writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof, who each add yet another shining bullet point to their respective resumes. Much of the formula that made the initial "Star Trek" reboot a success gets implemented in this script. The pace of the film never lags, delivering persistent action, suspense, mystery or some combination of the three, stopping only for character-developing moments (and usually ending them with a sudden bang). The ace in the holeand what makes "Into Darkness" a better film by a slim marginis Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain.If you're familiar at all with Cumberbatch's work, particularly in the title role on BBC's "Sherlock," you knew that at some point he would play a significant villain and absolutely nail it. Fortunately for "Star Trek" fans, Abrams got the first chance to unleash Cumberbatch on a mass-scale audience. His role allows him to be the perfect combination of a formidable physical and mental threat, and the script has you clawing for the truth from the onset that it only magnifies Cumberbatch's strengths. Eric Bana's Nero in the previous film pales in comparison."Into Darkness" continues much of the focus of the earlier film, adding complexity to James Kirk's (Chris Pine) gutsy and arguably reckless decisionmaking, Spock's (Zachary Quinto) inability to feel emotions and the friendship between the two. After the opening scene mission on the planet Nibiru in which Kirk violates Starfleet directives to save Spock, Kirk loses to the Enterprise back to its former captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), but his probation doesn't last long when Starfleet's own, John Harrison, (Cumberbatch) blows a Starfleet archive in London and essentially declares war with the federation. Running at the chance to catch Harrison, Kirk plunges the Enterprise and its crew right into the middle of a deadly no-win scenario. There's a lot of who's really the bad guy manipulation/mind games on the script's part that doesn't exactly fit together nicely all the time in terms of what's really going on, but the level of danger and urgency never fades and that makes "Into Darkness" an ideal blockbuster. Once again, Abrams and co. aren't afraid to pick up the Enterprise like a hyper toddler and shake and smash it and its crew until there seems to be no hope (except for that perfect window to save the day that was set up by some earlier occurrence in the movie).As Abrams has said multiple times in interviews, he was never a fan of "Star Trek" growing up, so he aimed to make these films accessible to a wider audience. "Into Darkness" definitely is, with plenty of goodies for fans of varying degrees. A sequence on the Klingon home world of Kronos satisfies the hard sci-fi and "Trek" fans' curiosity about the extent of Abrams' take on this universe, while also teasing its potential. You're going to want more Klingons after this film.Right there is what ought to give "Star Wars" fans some confidence in Abrams: the curiosity factor, the scratching at the surface of the lore that attracts a geek following and appeasing it, while at the same time still delivering a focused, entertaining film that emphasizes the importance of the characters. The biggest problem with the "Star Wars" prequels as compared to the original trilogy is the poor quality of the characters and relationships. Just restoring that element to the mix guarantees a certain measure of success with the new "Star Wars" films."Star Trek" is in a really good place after "Into Darkness." The first two films work together in terms of the character relationships and themes, and while there will always be room to test the bounds of Kirk and Spock's friendship, to use an example, the door has been opened for the Enterprise to explore anything and everything Gene Roddenberry's rich universe has to offer.~Steven CThanks for reading!

How do you create a unique take on the cabin in the woods motif? How about undead Nazis in the Norwegian mountains? Tommy Wirkola's "Dead Snow" starts off terribly, like every uncreative zombie movie you've ever seen, but by the film's end you might even be impressed.The film, written by Wirkola and creative partner Stig Frode Henrikson, follows a group of medical students and their friends/significant others on a ski trip to the remote village of Oksfjord. When they arrive at their cabin, a creepy old man scolds them for being ignorant to the history of Oksfjord, where German soldiers tormented the locals during World War II until the people ultimately had enough and drove the Nazis into the mountains where they froze to death. Or did they? The friends soon find themselves under attack by hordes of Nazi zombies (Nazombies?).Almost the entire first hour of the 91-minute film unravels slowly and predictably, to the point where you might start guessing which characters will die first out of sheer boredom. It's almost an uncomfortable watch knowing a movie about Nazi zombies has to descend into bizarre, bloody chaos at some point yet there's all this waiting.But the final act delivers for fans of horror comedy and is by and large worth the wait. The gray-faced Nazi zombies are stupid but also malevolent and fast-moving, and the characters face all kinds of unpredictable obstacles in trying to take them down. You'd think filmmakers would've run out of ways to kill zombies by now, but Wirkola finds ways to turn the action in completely unexpected ways with outcomes that are at times way beyond the norm for the genre. Wirkola plays it by the book stylistically for the first half of the movie with suspenseful fake- outs and bad jump scares, but then gets creative later. Visually, his style is slightly reminiscent of how Edgar Wright handled "Shaun of the Dead." His skill set on the whole appears much better suited for action and tension than for pure horror."Dead Snow" features some seriously low-budget effects, but no CGI. The zombie makeup is average and there are a few moments that appear to involve green screen, but fans of old- fashioned blood mixtures and flesh and guts in gooey puddles will praise the film for its commitment to old-school values. The sense of humor also shines in the end, redeeming the clichés of the first hour. It doesn't ever reach too far for laughs, thanks in large part to not taking itself too seriously. After watching the beginning you'd swear not a single clever person worked on this movie, but by the end you'll realize how wrong you were."Dead Snow" puts a strange and oddly satisfying twist on an all-too familiar genre, but it comes too late. Not too late to salvage the film, but too late to be classified as one of the best modern zombie pics. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
"The Brothers Bloom" sounds like a traditional con movie: two talented con men brothers are known for their epic, almost literary cons, when one brother wanting out leads to a concession that the next one, cheating a lonely heiress out of a million or so, will be their last. There's a bit of the classic con movie "The Sting" as well as "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" mixed in to that. Seems unoriginal, but just you wait. Rian Johnson has written a non-traditional con flick, one that acts like a quirky modern comedy but is dressed in '30s period garb and filmed where the world's architecture and backdrops are most classically stunning: Greece, Prague and Montenegro. It doesn't make much sense, but it gives "The Brothers Bloom" and its trio of talented actors undeniable class.Stephen (Ruffalo) is the mastermind who writes his younger brother, Bloom (Brody), into his fantastical stories/cons as the "hero." Bloom, however, is ready to write his own life -- presumably one in which he falls in love for real. Agreeing to one last con, he must fake his feelings for Penelope (Weisz), an epileptic heiress with no social skills. As long as he doesn't fall in love with her, all should go well. It sounds easy considering Penelope is one strange fish, but it's not.There's nothing too complicated about the plot, which hooks you on trying to discern what's real vs. what's part of the con. Johnson keeps it simple so that he can give you what you don't expect -- colorful characters, such as Bang Bang (Rinko Kikuchi from "Babel"), the brothers' Japanese assistant with, aptly, an affinity for explosives made of Barbie dolls.Weisz really gets to have the most fun as a total crackpot. In the period dress along with Weisz' excellent film resume and our familiarity with the genre, we come to expect her to play some classy woman who won't be willed easily, but she's a total nut and Weisz gets to work with this incredible element of surprise. In a scene in her mansion when she reveals to Bloom she's basically never left the mansion and is terrible at conversation, she shares that she just checks out books on how to do things, which Johnson follows up with a hysterical montage of Weisz showing off a dozen or so different talents from juggling chainsaws to riding a unicycle -- while juggling chainsaws. Another wonderful scene is her first passionate kiss with Bloom -- something she's never experienced before.Con movies also give you the expectation of a twist, and though Johnson does give us one when it's all said and done, he also uses that expectation to his advantage, filling the moments that creates with comical flourishes or moments revealing of character. At the same time, there's something unsatisfying about the twists of the film. The expectation of being wowed in that regard by con films is something "Bloom" must work against. We want a surprise ending that reveals something about the characters, or at least if the surprise is mild at best, something that is logical and true to the film and its characters. "Bloom" doesn't fully capture the scope of either. It's no failure by any means, but it hinges on elements of the story that didn't seem to be all that important.If anything, Johnson proves with "Bloom" that he has the chops to deliver something conceptually mainstream (like a con movie) in a unique way. We shall hopefully see much more of him in the future. What we want at the movies is familiarity with a breath of freshness and he gives us just that with his talented cast of characters that defy our expectations in only positive ways. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
It only takes a few great cinematic elements to turn a helter-skelter sci-fi fantasy into a cult classic. Russell Mulcahy finds that edge in directing Gregory Widen's story "Highlander." Part of it is Christopher Lambert's hardened hero Connor McLeod as well as Clancy Brown's exceptionally psychotic performance as the Kurgan, but Mulcahy commands how we feel about these characters and pilots them into memorable battle sequences and grandiose stunts for a film released in 1986. Fantasy and science-fiction fans will easily be able to overlook some of its messiness and appreciate the winning concept and enjoyable lore behind "Highlander."The ripe "Highlander" concept allows for an effective story. McLeod is fatally wounded in battle in 16th Century Scotland only he somehow survives. Fearing he's possessed, he's banished by his wife and neighbors and eventually settles on his own with a new wife in an isolated part of the highlands. Sean Connery then arrives to inform him of his greater calling and warn him of his immortality. He has essentially joined a "club" of immortals (of which there are an unknown number) who compete throughout the centuries to become the lone Highlander by beheading other immortals.Unfortunately, that part of the movie doesn't come first, making the "Highlander" concept much more difficult than it needs to be. At least what Widen fails to do in terms of organizing the film in a logical order he makes up for in delivering an idea with classic themes of immortality, power and love. Because Connor can't settle down without watching those he loves die of age, he wins our sympathy and that's the goal with any fantasy hero. It helps that Lambert's furrowed brow and emotionally exhausted look communicates a feeling of inner sorrow, an always ideal hero combination of hard on the outside, soft on the inside. Mulcahy draws close attention to his eyes, which at the beginning makes us think of Lambert as a bit of an ugly brute because of his large forehead, but eventually succeeds in portraying him in a sensitive light.On the opposite end of the spectrum is Brown's Kurgan, the immortal hoping to be the last one standing by killing Connor in New York City, where the Gathering (an unofficial tournament to become the Highlander, sort of) is happening. Every second Brown he spends on screen just induces more and more hatred, especially when he does a poor job of shaving his head. Villains are so much more effective with a psychotic twist and Brown delivers. It's also not the kind of crazy villain that tries overly hard to be funny with poorly written dialogue, but the unexpectedly randomly licking people type of insane.The sporadic pacing hurts our ability to become invested in the main love story between Connor and forensic metal specialist Brenda (Roxanne Hart). It's more an example of great potential unachieved rather than offensively poor writing. The same goes for the relationship between Connor and his personal assistant Rachel (Sheila Gish). A flashback takes us to World War II when he saves the young Rachel by taking bullets for her. Their friendship and affection for one another has the power to be a fantastic subplot in the film, but it never cooks.Little else can be said negatively about "Highlander," unless you're not amused by people in New York City fighting with broadswords attempting to slice each other's heads off. The entertainment appeal won't be for everyone, but there are plenty of explosions (every time an immortal is decapitated a "quickening" happens and stuff in the area breaks and shatters), and with a Star Wars-esquire fight scene at the end, it's easy to see why "Highlander" spawned a number of future films and a TV series, etc.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
No doubt about it folks, we are in the age of the R-rated sex comedy.  This explosive trend among movies stems from filmmakers and producers'  never-ending pursuit of making the rare comedy that costs little but  rakes in obscene amounts of money. "No Strings Attached" fits the exact  profile of a film quite literally strung together with the hopes of  getting its cup under the R-rated sex comedy tap and catching a few  precious drops of what has been comedy gold the last five years. And if  2011′s first romantic comedy is any indication, that cup hath runneth  dry.  Natalie Portman, the darling of Hollywood right now coming off her  Golden Globe (and what will likely be an Oscar) win for "Black Swan"  and the somehow always-popular Ashton Kutcher co-star in what amounts  to "Friends with Benefits 101," or a very rudimentary telling of how  two people come to and work through a decision to use each other  strictly for sex. Although no movie has highlighted this story line so  explicitly, most young people are aware of the concept, yet the film  takes us through the motions as if we're all 50-something and aren't  aware such progressive sexual arrangements exist.  That's why veteran director Ivan Reitman ("Ghostbusters") proves  immediately to be out of place. He appears to have been handed  Elizabeth Meriwether's script and told "this is what's popular now, go  do it." Meriwether certainly didn't go out of her way to divert from  formula as "No Strings" overflows with plot-subservient supporting  characters (the roommates and friends of our "not lovers") and  injections of foul-mouthed humor, but a more modern comedy director  wouldn't have exposed those ploys as brutally as Reitman does.  The film takes us from the beginning of Adam and Emma's  acquaintanceship (they were never really friends before the sex  happened), which started at a summer camp when Adam attempted to mope  about his parents' divorce to Emma in hopes of a sympathy hook up.  Deciding to be frank, he asks to finger her. This is the movie's first  attempt at slapping in "modern" and "R-rated" sex jokes. Maybe that  would've been funny in 2005, but our over- exposure to dirty dialogue  in film has  and rightfully so  desensitized us to laughing at, for  example, any time the word "penis" or a variation on "penis" gets  tossed into a movie script as "No Strings" so often does. In fact, by  comparison to similar comedies, the movie hardly warrants an R rating.  As romantic comedy fans know, however, great chemistry in the leads can  help remedy even the worst of situations. To some degree, Portman and  Kutcher have something that works, but Adam and Emma are so poorly set  up that it slightly undermines Kutcher's sweet and surprisingly  sympathy-worthy performance and Portman's excellent ability to reveal  all her characters' inner thoughts and feelings. When they first have  sex, it should in theory be an enormous release of sexual tension for  the audience, but it feels as if it just happens for the sake of there  being a movie. That's the real problem with "No Strings Attached": as  genuine as the characters can feel at times, they all ultimately feel  like pawns of or cogs in a formula to deliver us a story. A good film  executes like a real-life or at least intriguing situation that the  audience gets to peek in on.  So like any film with an absurd amount of pieces, the characters  surrounding Adam and Emma either insignificant to us or we like them  but their screen time is completely short- changed. Meriwether would  have been better served to cut down on the amount of friends and  roommates and relatives and add dimension to the better of the bunch.  Among the list of those who deserved more attention are Greta Gerwig as  one of Emma's roommates, Lake Bell as one of the assistant producers on  the "Glee"-type TV show Adam works for and SNLer Abby Elliot as a  bartender who does weird impersonations. Unfortunately, the most  intriguing supporting role, belonging to Kevin Kline as Adam's former  TV star dad who starts seeing his ex-girlfriend and loves drugs, falls  flat.  The lack of laughs and botched attempts at "hip" jokes, however, are  the root of the film's problems. After Emma gets drunk on tequila shots  one night after she and Adam have decided to sleep with other people,  she goes to Adam's place and finds him with two other girls whom she  proceeds yell at, calling them "pumpkins" for absolutely no reason. It  plays like a bad cut of improv, but Reitman seems to have blind faith  that that's what "comedy" is these days.  You'd really like to give credit to Portman, Kutcher and many of the  other actors who attempted to build likable characters despite how  processed they come across in the story itself, but "No Strings  Attached" never relents in its dependency on formula. We all know how a  romantic comedy will end (except 2006′s "The Break-Up"), but when you  know how it will start and middle, that's busting the illusion that  fans of the genre pay good money to be fooled by. Sadly, the fact that  there's no disguising the film's attempt to jump on the sex comedy  bandwagon undermines nearly everything, perhaps even the bandwagon  itself.  ~Steven C
I'm trying to get over the fact that the ending of the film makes absolutely no sense to me (unless i'm looking hard for something that's not there). When I do get past that, however, I find that "Interview with the Vampire" is a very beautifully told tale that looks deep into the heart of what evil truly is.Based on Anne Rice's novel (and also her screenplay) "Interview" is the retelling of Louis's (a vampire) story of how he became a vampire. The story starts in 18th century Louisiana where Louis (Brad Pitt) encounters an opportunity for eternal life when he is seeking death. A vampire named Lestat (Tom Cruise) gives him this opportunity with the expectation of companionship. When Louis has trouble disconnecting his human moral compass from his blood-lusting monster of a self, Lestat tries to test him and eventually brings him another companion when he makes Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) a vampire as well. The story is Louis's search for an understanding of this immortal life that he can come to terms with, which results in a film that explores deep into the notion of immortality with a price.The film's beauty comes from the very lavish sets and the strong mystical element that is worked into every set. Though the setting is all real world, because the film explores the fantastical world of vampires, everything seems surreal and magical. Dante Ferretti has created another beautiful movie world and Neil Jordan makes it shine through his camera-work. Jordan really brings Rice's screenplay to life, or else you'd be looking at a particularly boring film.Cruise as Lestat was a good choice. He is downright creepy and conveys the sense of moral ambiguity that Lestat represents. Pitt also shows both the strong and the weak sides of Louis, though he is not as skilled with handling some of the film's melodrama. Dunst is probably the most praiseworthy. Having to portray a child who technically has wisdom beyond her appearance is a challenge and Dunst is behind some of the film's best scenes and most suspenseful moments. Her fits of rage are probably the most interesting as is her character's predicament with never growing up, which really starts the conversation about mortality and the film's themes.Though some plot clarity would have been nice and a little less melodrama would have helped make the themes really significant to the rest of the film, "Interview" is a successful film from a visual standpoint. The craftsmen of this film, everyone from production design to costumes and make-up, truly made this film take off from okay to good and very interesting. There is no doubt that you are deeply interested in what happens to these characters and that is thanks to the actors and the incredible world that was envisioned for them to act in. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
"A Fish Called Wanda" is not your typical comedy which is its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. It is a crime comedy that curious merges British humor (the Monty Python sensibility led by writer and actor John Cleese) and American humor (the over-the-top performance from Kevin Kline). Often times this works for some great laughs and other times it'll leave you a bit confused, but overall it's a fun movie with an unbelievable set of characters and a plot that only pushes these actors to do their best.The film plummets you right into the action as 4 strange individuals all collaborate to rob a bank of 20 Million in diamonds. When 2 of them, Wanda and Otto (Curtis and Kline) turn in one of the others, the double crossing, seduction and lying continues in the interest of the characters getting their hands on the diamonds and walking away.These characters are just terrific. Kevin Kline is every bit Oscar-worthy in his role as Otto, the eccentric, clueless, risk-taking,self-assertive criminal (but not stupid...) who thinks he knows best all the time. He stands out as one of the best character roles in a comedy of all time in this film and that's not overstating it. Jamie Lee Curtis, while you wouldn't think to be your first choice for a seductive, manipulating and completely self-absorbed criminal but she commands the attention her role requires so easily. Monty Python greats John Cleese and Michael Palin also add that distinct Monty Python brand humor to the film that makes it so unique. Cleese plays a lawyer that gets wrapped up in the double-crossing and Palin plays a stuttering, fish-loving, sympathizable sidekick. If you can't tell by now, let me reiterate that this comedy is all about the characters.The plot here is enough to keep the antics going and that's what good sketch comedy (which you'd expect from a John Cleese) does. It takes a bit for you to adjust to the humor, but once you get beyond the fact that they're not just being weird to be weird, there's a bit more too it, this film goes from being just okay to really enjoyable. While I think it could have done better in terms of a satisfying plot, it wasn't enough to keep the film from identifying itself primarily as an absurd, off-the-wall and over-the-top crime comedy. Don't expect flashy, slick slight of hand crime comedy here, just some really silly but unique laughs.
It's nice to thoroughly enjoy a comedy this decade without catching a single whiff of Apatow. The fact that audiences are eating up the boundary-crossing humor of "The Hangover" this summer and the famous producer of "Knocked Up" and "Superbad" nor any of his cronies (Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, etc.) don't have so much as a finger print on it might be over half the reason for its praise.Starring rising leading man Bradley Cooper ("Wedding Crashers," "Yes Man"), Ed Helms ("The Office") and stand-up comic Zach Galifianakis, "The Hangover" doesn't boast the stylings of any comedic actors that we've already been beaten to death with by Hollywood in the last ten years and they're all extremely talented. Their characters are incredibly well-developed and free of too much stereotype, their comedic timing excellent and the concept they're thrown into so perfect you can't believe it hasn't been done before.Two days before their friend Doug's (Justin Bartha of "National Treasure") wedding, the aforementioned characters head out for a night in Las Vegas as do many a bachelor party. But "The Hangover" doesn't show their night out, instead it takes us straight to the next morning where they wake up to find strange animals in their room, one is missing a tooth and the groom-to-be is missing. And of course they don't remember a thing.Todd Phillips, director of "Old School," another comedy that for its time brought us new comedians and situations keeps the timing and revealing funny moments at a healthy pace. Every time we think it doesn't get funnier or more ridiculous, it does. The writing team of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who delivered last winter's notable flop "Four Christmases" really hit it big here. Having character retrace their footsteps and discover their debauchery of the previous night rather than showing it gives the trend toward R-rated comedy a new set of wheels. The gags here are nothing all that foreign to us, but with an unfamiliar cast of talented actors it feels pretty new. Everything is just revitalized, given new life because the script really fits the characters.I didn't particularly like Cooper previously, but he gets more of a chance to exercise his range with a character that's not stale. Helms can truly be a foul-mouthed funny kind of guy, but his nerdy girlfriend-whipped character Stu is perfect because it forces him to hold back, therefore making the moments he explodes funnier and more believable. Galifianakis is something else. He's the new funny we've been looking for. Alan is a horribly dumb, outrageously gutsy but sweet character with a child's heart. Galifianakis plays a wide range of comedy perfectly whether needing to hold back and be dumb and cute or go all out physically.There are some gaping holes in "The Hangover" like the fact that they are apparently hung over but do not eat or drink the entire film. Also, only Helms' character gets a true subplot - - everyone else is just there to make us laugh. This isn't one of those comedies with heart. Instead, we learn to love the characters because they're funny and we empathize with their ingeniously funny situation quickly. Still, some of the most original comedy I've seen in years. And don't forget the best and most boundary-pushing credits sequence ever. No question now that this is the era of dirty comedy and "The Hangover" delivers some of its finest.
There comes a point in the repetitive nature of films where the phrase "run-of-the-mill" just won't do. In the case of the remake of the train hijack/ransom heist thriller "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3," the mill has been running so much that maybe the more adequate phrase should be the past tense "ran." Tony Scott's "Pelham" does give us those vital and homey conventions of the "mad man takes hostages and demands millions" movie, but the story is so straightforward and the film as a whole never seems to take itself seriously enough to completely hook its audience and pull them into the situation.First there's John Travolta, rocking some creepy facial hair, senseless tattoos and shouting swear words at authorities like it's the third grade and his buddy just taught them to him. Considering "Pelham" is not a movie that aims to dig into the psychological background of its antagonist, his attempt to play up the Joker-esquire semi-insanity of his character is pointless. The script does coax you to guess the motive of his character, but the ultimate answer isn't good enough to justify Travolta's performance. Even Denzel Washington, unlike previous Tony Scott thrillers, is relegated to spectacles and a weak attitude. The characters offer very little gravity to the hostage situation.In the film, Travolta and his cronies hijack a New York City subway train and hold everyone in it hostage for $10 million dollars In the process. Washington's character, the man who oversees that section of the rail traffic, gets stuck in the situation because Travolta's character takes a strong liking to him from their radio conversations.Travolta's "all guts, no glory" attitude does keep you in suspense for brief moments when he might kill another hostage, but the attempts to make us really care about the hostages on board are feeble and half-hearted. I really don't pity the guy video chatting with his girlfriend during the crisis who keeps stupidly demanding that he tell her he loves her when he could get shot if he says something. Then there's the matter of him getting Internet down in the tunnel, but that would have been more forgivable if it weren't such a cop out.The only real solid other than Washington despite his limitations is the direction of Scott, who does everything in his power to keep up the intensity of this bare bones movie. Speeding blur transition to mimic the feeling of a train as it barrels by and briefly freezing moments and giving us title cards to show time ticking down until the deadline for the money exchange are a few of the techniques that the master of highly watchable thrillers employs."Pelham" isn't horrid, it just doesn't bring a whole lot to the table. It makes no effort to stand out among the dozens of ransom thrillers that came before it other than that it involves a subway train. Unless you're a sucker for the genre, "Pelham" won't feel like it made enough effort to go beyond mere sufficiency and I say that having really enjoyed Scott's "Deja Vu" and "Man on Fire," for example. I'd recommend searching for a thriller that might have something more to offer before trying out "Pelham."~Steven CVisit my site, moviemusereviews.com
96 minute film with all but 3 minutes taking place in the same room: that's daring. It's hard to believe, but director Sidney Lumet finds a way to make "12 Angry Men" move at an attention-holding pace while being hardly dull at all. Now that's film-making. Lumet's camera techniques and the phenomenal performances from the actors he captures makes "12 Angry Men" a terrifically interesting court drama that is so elemental but so profound.In the opening minutes, a 12-man jury breaks into deliberation over a case where a teenager has been charged with killing his father. If found unanimously guilty, the boy will be executed. After a preliminary vote, every man votes guilty except for one juror played by Henry Fonda, who is afraid of being too quick to reach a verdict.The story basically paints a picture of 12 strangers. If you follow closely, you can learn a lot about these people, but the point is that you learn a lot about them and what makes them tick as they argue and reason. The first thing achieving that requires is great acting. This film is loaded with classic actors of the 40s and 50s. It's hard to really single out one performance as the best, though certainly Lee J. Cobb as Juror #3 is the most dramatic and he very much helps give the story an adrenaline boost when his character acts out.But the most excellent aspect of this film, what pushes it above a lot of other drama, is Lumet's directing choices in what is his first feature film. Filming in one room, it can be easy to put little thought into camera angles and movement, but Lumet considers everything very carefully and no single shot in the film feels arbitrary. The camera moves with incredible purpose, zooming in at perfect speeds and picking angles that best reveal the characters. Also, his attention to the idea of the heat in the room, the impatience, the confinement, all comes across in his directing. His angles start above the actors in the beginning and thus more impersonal, but the camera lowers more and more as the film goes on. You're so interested in the story at this point that you don't even notice, but you feel it. Lumet makes you feel much like a 13th juror and you begin to form your own opinion, bouncing back and forth (that is if Lumet and writer Reginald Rose did their job right, which they do.)The film is--and this really isn't a spoiler--without a climactic payoff for those that need a little something more or a resolution or mystery solved. You're supposed to find it satisfying in the way that it reveals a bit about who we are and how we arrive at the moral conclusions we make. You're supposed to learn so much about these characters that by the end you're shocked that you never even learned their names. The film is like a social experiment on screen and it's very realistic and yet still very interesting. It's an absolute marvel for being stationary, dialogue-heavy film. ~MMRVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/
The '60s was the decade of the movie musical with "West Side Story," "The Sound of Music," "My Fair Lady," and "Oliver!" all taking home Best PIcture. It's fair to say "Funny Girl" might've been on that list had it not came out the same year as "Oliver!" But the Academy had it right in giving this musical romantic comedy's one Oscar to its best attribute and greatest asset: Barbara Streisand.Only in her mid-20s and in her big-screen debut, Streisand plays like a veteran. She brings the film to its highest points, makes it bearable through its lowest, is responsible for all of the laughs as well as all the touching moments and she does it while defying the "standards" of beauty in Hollywood.Streisand's nose might be the most famous body part in movie history, yet she holds her head high confidently and gives the mirror a smile as she utters the film's first line "hello, gorgeous." She's an average Jewish girl from Brooklyn but here she is -- and that's what makes her perfect as Fanny Brice, the famous Zigfield Follies comedienne."Funny Girl" is a typical musical love story only its main character is a famous (and wealthy) musical performer and there's a bit more attention on the dramatic aspect of her relationship with Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif). As she sings about people who need people being the luckiest in the world, the story becomes less about her rise to fame and more about finding the right man and making him part of her life. Keeping the focus on Fanny is legendary director William Wyler in one of his last pictures. Wyler keeps us focused on the talented Streisand and together they keep our attention on Fanny's story -- what's going on in her head. The love story can get awfully bland at times, but its Fanny that keeps our interests and brings the film its few poignant moments.Streisand has many faces in this film and that's why she's so good. She's not necessarily deeply moving or able to give a truly affecting performance, but she's believable and she's honest with the part while also giving it some comedic zing with the over-the-top Jewish New Yorker routine. There might not be any notable epiphanies in her performance, but she clearly guides us through Fanny's emotions and realization of her own flaws.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
With a subject as delicate, personal and even as controversial as religion, the wisest choice "Jesus Camp" filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady make is to keep their voice and presence out of the film and let their subjects tell the story. Documentaries are always better with some kind of guiding force and a hint to the film's intention, but as much as that's missing from this film, it's probably for the best."Jesus Camp" is one of those rare films that will likely resonate in positive ways for viewers with opposite viewpoints on the spectrum. We tend to think of documentaries as "exposing" truths or fighting for or against something, so the initial thought -- especially from those with a liberal mindset -- is "Jesus Camp" is intended to do just that. But consider the other side and the film could just as easily offer tangible proof for the powerful impact of evangelist teachings.The subject of the film is primarily a children's pentecostal minister in Missouri named Becky Fischer who runs a summer camp retreat for families in North Dakota with an emphasis on Christian faith and values. We meet a few of the children and parents who will be in attendance and interestingly enough, this camp is mere reinforcement for these people. They already seem to have strong Christian conviction, even at age five for some of them, so this is not a film about converting those of little faith.Ewing and Grady put subtitled facts on the screen, but other than editing, that's all the say they want in the documentary. We simply observe as these impassioned adults preach and these children -- often times reduced to tears -- become transformed to a degree most will never have seen before. Fischer draws a parallel to how Muslim children are trained at a young age to believe certain things about Islam (and how to use weapons, but that's another matter) and she wants to do the same thing but with Christianity and "good" principles. This idea will terrify those who defend separation of church and state and make perfect sense to those who believe they must be intertwined to make the world a place free of sin."Jesus Camp" poses the ultimate question about the capacity of children and how we teach them. These kids believe their generation has a greater responsibility than any before it to bring the light of God and Jesus into this nation and the world. The words of ministers such as Fischer strike them deep within, in some ways (in my opinion) terrifying them to the point of wanting to make a difference. Is this a paragon for forming outstanding moral behavior or is it taking advantage of children who know nothing else? Ewing and Grady merely want us to be aware of how many children receive this message in our country because of how large the Evangelist movement is. Regardless of whether its good or bad, Americans need to understand this perspective because it constitutes a significant portion of the country's religious/cultural landscape and one that has a fierce influence on the political sector.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
There's no doubt that you have to be a bit of geek if not a lot of a geek to love "Tron." At times the production design looks like a cheesy neon laser tag set and the special effects are ancient -- especially more than 25 years later. The plot of course is amateur while somehow also confusing. But to love "Tron" is to look past all that and see the adventurous soul behind this imaginative computer-world fantasy. It's a one-of-a-kind work of imagination that was decades ahead of its time."Tron" stars a younger Jeff Bridges as Flynn, a former software program developer who wants to get back at the head of his former company, Ed Dillinger (David Warner), who stole some of his computer game programs and used them to get to the top. To maintain and expand the power of his cyber network, Dillinger created the Master Control Program. That's not too weird, except there's a whole world inside that computer system where programs appear as people or machines. Trying to access the files hidden away that prove Dillinger stole the programs, Flynn is sucked into the computer world by the MCP. Teaming up with his friends' programs, one being Tron, Flynn tries to take down the Master Control Program from the inside.The world of "Tron" in conceptual terms is what makes this movie so interesting. Not the way it's visually put together, though it kind of has a unique retro high-tech style to it that in some circles might be "cool," but the thought process behind it. When Flynn enters the computer, the first thing that happens is he's sent to the game zone where he's forced to compete in games where the loser is deleted. The trademarks of the film such as the flying discs, digital jai alai and the lightcycles come out of these scenes early on. The inventives of these games are what makes "Tron" good for those apt to like it.Discussing the finer plot points of "Tron" is to forget it's a wacky Disney movie. There's nothing great about the acting and there's nothing too suspenseful about their adventure either -- it's all about watching what creators Steven Lisberger and Bonnie MacBird come up with next. I do have to mention the very cool aerial shot of the city at night where Lisberger speeds up the tape to make it look like a computer chip. Also, Wendy Carlos' score is a perfect fit for the movie.Then you also have to look at "Tron" for the achievement that it was in 1982. This movie predates James Cameron movies and he's looked at as the director who is always ahead of his time, working on the cutting edge of technology. As cheesy as it all seems now, it was ground-breaking and 28 years later, it's simply the only of its kind.
Animated sequels have yet to disprove that timeless adage about movie sequels, but they're giving it a real go. DreamWorks Animation hasn't always gotten the formula right (the "Shrek" movies got worse and worse), but even "Madagascar 2: Escape 2 Africa" had entertainment to offer. "Kung Fu Panda 2" marks the studio's third try at extending a franchise, and from a production quality standpoint its their best effort to do so.No, "Kung Fu Panda 2" doesn't outdo the original, especially not in terms of humor, but it improves on the visual mastery of the first, which was strong to begin with. The action sequences in particular still have no rival to this series. Director Jennifer Yuh stays true to the winning combination of action, character development and heart that made the 2008 original a success.The story works well, but its predictability holds the film back. The original offered a lot of surprises in telling the story of a fat and lazy panda who learned he could be great if he put his mind to it. In this movie, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) tasks Po (Jack Black) with another seemingly impossible mission, one in which the film's narrated introduction sequence already foreshadows his success. Sure, kids won't know the difference, but it zaps the film of any excitement for the rest of us.The story takes Po, the now infamous Dragon Warrior, to Gongman City, where the three kung fu masters that protect the city have been ousted by the villainous peacock Lord Shen (Gary Oldman). Shen was exiled by his parents  who once ruled China  because he had a fondness for turning fireworks into dangerous projectiles. Years later, he uses these cannons to uphold his new reign, because not even kung fu can stop them. We'll see about that.The strong voice cast returns for the sequel and delivers. Black has simply become Po at this point he does it so well, and characters such as Tigress (Angelina Jolie) and Po's father Mr. Ping (James Hong) get more of a spotlight, albeit at the expense of everyone else. Oldman makes a terrific addition as the cocky peacock; he demonstrates some lovely dashes of insanity and Shen's facial expressions match it perfectly.On all accounts, the production value of this series has gone up in this installment. The film moves at a good clip and the action sequences have no shortage of wowing moments. Shen's fighting style is something to behold and the storyboarding of the film's first sequence when the Furious Five defend their home from Shen's wolves does not lack for ingenuity to say the least.Also at work in the film is a subplot involving where Po came from, as one must imagine he is not literally the son of a noodle-cooking goose. The answer to this mystery becomes clear from the moment the question surfaces. All the other aspects of the movie satisfy, but Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger's story possesses no creative energy. The choice to go with it was safe. Rather than venture too outside the box, "Kung Fu Panda 2" takes the cookie-cutter route. It looks good and it is good, but it doesn't meet the standard raised by its predecessor. Fortunately its dedication to character and heart make it stand taller than your average CGI-animated effort.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out my site, moviemusereviews.com
No genre has defined 2010 like the group-centric comedy-infused action flick that pits betrayed special agents/soldiers against "the man." So the only chance "RED" had at standing out was to rise above the formula at the hands of an acting core whose mean age would qualify for a senior discount to see said film. In honesty, it doesn't succeed at being more special, but what "RED" achieves that many of its kin this year did not is pull it off with a definitive sense of class.Although hardly as hysterical as it ought to have been, "RED" combines likable faces and smart direction well enough so that the recycled premise doesn't nag at you for too long. Robert Schwentke ("Flightplan," "The Time Traveler's Wife") takes the style of the film in various directions from goofy action comedy to more serious revenge thriller, but the key is that he never crosses the line into eye-rolling territory; no one walks away from an explosion his film.Bruce Willis stars as retired CIA operative Frank Moses, whose existence has been reduced to phone conversations with the woman that sends him his government check (Mary-Louise Parker). That changes quickly when Frank's home is reduced to Swiss cheese by the very agency he worked for. Realizing he and this "woman" are in jeopardy, he kidnaps her and while on the run, finds his old friends (other retired agents) to piece together what's going on. The gist is that Frank's been deemed "Retired, Extremely Dangerous" because he's still got some juice left in the tank and the government  as per usual these days  has some dirty laundry to which Frank is connected.The mess leads Frank to attempt to break into Langley and eventually try and kill the vice president of the United States  which should give you a sense that much of the film is "old(er) guys kicking ass." Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren all join the fray as retired-but-deadly compadres when Frank enlists their help.They're a likable group; even for those with a smaller Malkovich threshold will enjoy him playing the insane, paranoid character and Freeman and Mirren flaunt their usual charms. At the same time, with Malkovich as the exception, the group is more lovable than hysterical  as much as you expect them to play against type, they don't really, though Mirren with a machine gun is refreshing. It's part of the dual nature of "RED;" sometimes its focused on comedy and amusing action and other times more serious action coupled with dramatic performance.As for the "young-uns," Parker, famous for her starring role on Showtime's "Weeds," manages to bring a unique flavor to the role of "clueless female lead stuck in the vortex of bullets and explosions against her will initially but not later in the film." Karl Urban ("Star Trek") plays the usually not-so-distinguished role of CIA agent hunting the REDs down, except he actually has a multi-dimensional story line. Jon and Erich Hoeber's script was a good find for Urban, whose star will continue to rise."RED" also has a wealth of cameos from beloved older actors that much like the rest of the film, aren't hysterical, but make the film ultimately more enjoyable. Whereas many films based on comics are aiming now for lesser-known talents and conventional thought says that packing a film with a ridiculous amount of stars is overkill, "RED" comes out and proves once again that there's great comfort in a familiar face, especially seasoned veterans. We enjoy seeing them have fun with less sophisticated roles, even if their performances don't rate with the anticipation of them crossing a genre line. Without a doubt, however, it makes today's most used and abused Hollywood action formula much more tolerable.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
Some movies withstand the test of time better than others. In terms of politically driven content and quiet suspense, "Three Days of the Condor" holds up well, but as a gripping conspiracy thriller, it can't quite compete with the films of today.Maybe that's unfair given the technology of now and the way the C.I.A. appears as a much more unshakable fortress of know-how in modern films such as "The Bourne Identity," but that doesn't mean "Condor" wasn't a good fit for the times or that director Sydney Pollack wasn't one of the all-time greats. Quite simply, the way conspiracy thrillers are fleshed out these days at the script level with most of the loopholes plugged up and pulse-pounding climaxes trumps what Lorenzo Semple Jr. and David Rayfiel concocted in the early '70s."Condor" stars Robert Redford as Joe Turner, a reader/analyst for a small division of the C.I.A. After leaving to grab lunch, he comes to back to find all his colleagues murdered. He reports to Langley and they tell him to meet him in an alley where he can be taken into safety. When that results in an attempt on his life, Turner tries to get off the grid and find out what's going on.I've read Pollack was an Alfred Hitchcock fan and wanted to give "Condor" the same legendary suspense, the kind that draws everything out slowly and drives you mad with anticipation. The execution isn't wrong, but it overestimates the script. A thriller cannot be quiet and brooding if the tensions aren't expertly crafted at the most basic level. Pollack wanted "less is more," but the script needed "more." The beginning needed to have a bigger impact (like some blood spatter for greater effect) and a better score would have helped make the key scenes feel bigger. At one point Joe fights hand to hand with a guy out to kill him to the tune of complete silence.The best scene in the whole film comes when Turner mistakenly goes back to his apartment and the assassin Joubert (Max Von Sydow), who we recognize from the opening, follows him into the elevator and we're never sure what the next move will be though we know it's coming. There's not enough of this at all.Unfortunately, other elements drag the film out more in boring ways. In order to get somewhere no one will expect him to be, Joe holds a complete stranger, Kathy (Faye Dunaway), at gunpoint. He stays with her and their relationship evolves to be more than captor and prisoner, an ultimately irrelevant and completely unbelievable subplot. Redford, however, proves yet again to be as infinitely watchable as a fish tank (that's a compliment, though I admit a weird one). Watching his character go from clueless to a cunning pest that the government can't exterminate ranks among the films highlights. Certainly, for 1975, a time when Vietnam was more so the focus than Cold War intelligence, "Condor" was doing something different and from that perspective I cannot criticize. But in terms of gripping entertainment and espionage films, "Three Days of the Condor" will likely not find itself among the all-time great conversations -- and more and more so as time wears on.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Andy Samberg is a funny guy, but if he wants to be a funny guy who makes movies, he'll need to figure out exactly what kind of funny he wants to be. "Hot Rod" is a mess of comedic styles, and though that falls a lot on writer Pam Brady, who has written many "South Park" episodes among other solid gigs, Samberg doesn't quite pull Rod Kimble together into a cohesive character.The movie has its moments to be sure, but "Hot Rod" mixes together Adam Sandler humor and Will Ferrell/"Anchorman" humor into a neo-'80s movie parody. If director Akiva Schaffer tried to blend all this into its own tone, it didn't work. Every other scene feels as though its attempting to win laughs by another set of means.At its core "Hot Rod" is a Saturday Night Live movie as it was produced by Lorne Michaels and the members of the Lonely Island group behind the show's popular digital shorts all have their hands on it: Samberg as the star, Schaffer the director and Jorma Taccone in a supporting role as Rod's half brother Kevin. Bill Hader, Chris Parnell and Will Arnett also have roles. Danny McBride is the lone black sheep as he has his own comedy nucleus.Samberg's Rod is a stuntman, which you could say about his hobbies or his maturity. Of the two stunts we see him attempt early in the film, he fails both, but that's neither here nor there. At home, he wrestles literally and figuratively with his stepfather, Frank (Ian McShane), desperate for his approval having lost his father in a stunt accident when he was little. When Frank takes a turn for the worse, Rod vows to jump 15 school buses to raise enough money for Frank's heart transplant.Rod rallies his stunt team, which includes Taccone, McBride and Hader, plus he recruits the girl next door (literally) who he hasn't seen since high school (Isla Fisher). Together they do all manner of strange things to both train and raise money.It's tough to capture the wide range of ways this film fishes for laughs. The most hilarious scene involves one of the film's many '80s montages, in which Rod goes to blow off some steam by doing all kinds of gymnastics stuff in the woods but suddenly finds himself tumbling down a mountainside. That unpredictability serves the film well, but it doesn't stick close enough to the '80s stuff throughout to warrant being called a true '80s parody.Most of the scenes are formulaic, but the humor is and isn't. When it goes for physical humor and gags you can see it coming, but when it goes for witty deadpan, it catches you off guard. Calling the jokes hit or miss would not be a generalization for this movie.Rod falls victim to the scattershot approach as well. At one moment he's sympathetic, in another he's so needlessly angry at his stepfather; at one moment he's shy and socially awkward, in another he's brazen and foolish. Just when you think you know the guy, you don't, and treating a main character that way guarantees complete audience apathy, which is what happens in "Hot Rod."If someone stepped into this project with the voice of reason to say let's go for this one specific overall tone, "Hot Rod" could've developed into a memorable comedy considering the talent involved. Instead it's a comedic style variety show packed into a single focused story arc. As such, this is one comedic stunt that doesn't quite get pulled off.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Both a Golden Age Gothic romance and a true Hitchcock thriller, "Rebecca" somehow merges its director's style with its producer's sensibility. Much has been made about the butting of heads between Alfred Hitchcock and famed Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, but "Rebecca" ends up feeling like a Hitchcock picture with the sweeping feel of a Hollywood film.Despite being Hitchcock's first experience working with Hollywood and Selznick's reputation for controlling his projects and making literal book adaptations (this being of Daphne Du Maurier's novel), the best parts of the film have Hitchcock's thumbprint on them. He infuses the story with total suspense and discomfort, refusing to let it bore for long in spite of its length.The story follows a Gothic romance storytelling model akin to the Bronte sisters, which explains why star Joan Fontaine won the lead in "Jane Eyre" opposite Orson Welles just a few years later. Hitchcock channels nearly everything through Fontaine's performance as the aptly unnamed main character, a personal assistant who on a whim during her stay in Monte Carlo meets and marries a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). Fontaine exudes a lovable naivete, one that starts out earning sympathy but twists into an attribute that antagonizes the audience as the film goes on as the presence of the late great first Mrs. De Winter, Rebecca grows more powerful.The role of Rebecca easily ranks as the most powerful character in cinema to never appear on screen. Hitchcock sees to it that her presence not only fills the mansion that already overwhelms the new Mrs. De Winter, but also consumes the film itself. She's felt both on camera and in the audiences mind, enough so that when Hitchcock pretends that she's really there by "following her" with the camera in a key scene late in the film where Maxim recalls the night she died, you honestly believe it and picture her as some terrifying figure. But there's no depreciating the characters on screen. Fontaine as she writhes about in mentally anguish does manifest everything a bit too physically, but the reaction she creates in the audience is a palpable paranoia and fear. Olivier portrays a man quick to anger but clearly for deep-seated reasons that come from a dark place. Then there's Mrs. Danvers, the woman who runs the house. The moment Judith Anderson walks on screen she enters your mind. A good comparison would be Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch in "The Wizard of Oz." It helps that Mrs. Danvers also serves as an antagonist, but in an entirely different way. We connect with our unnamed heroine's fear of Mrs. Danvers, but not simply because she plays the creepy housekeeper, but as we come to know her and understand her connection to the late Rebecca, she becomes this psychologically complex individual. Although Hitchcock's directorial voice runs through Fontaine, Anderson adds punctuation to his efforts, especially as she steals the final moments of the film.Although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences would have you believe "Rebecca" to be Hitchcock's finest effort, it merely showcases his ability as an artist to overcome what was a producer-driven Hollywood at the time. Despite David O. Selznick's name appearing before the title card, Selznick will always be better remembered for "Gone with the Wind.' "Rebecca"  that was Hitchcock's work.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Having not seen the original 1972 "The Poseidon Adventure," I can merely speculate as to how Wolfgang Petersen's "Poseidon" is compared to that film aside from much more visually amazing. With that out of the way, "Poseidon" can simply be stated as a modern day, visually enhanced disaster movie, and that's it.The plot is simple: a ship gets hit by a freak rogue wave and tips completely over and a group of the survivors try and make their way to the top before drowning. The talent all pretty much gets wasted here, from Kurt Russel to Richard Dreyfus to young star Emmy Rossum. Josh Lucas is simply cool, and the role, while not very special, fits him nicely. Overall, however, the characters and big names are simply meant to bring you to the theater so you can watch and guess which ones die first. While the suspense in this case certainly does exist, it's nothing that hasn't been seen in the string of late 90's disaster movies.What gives this film the little merit it has are the visuals and well-thought out director's choices from Petersen when it comes to the disaster images. The stunt work and scenery here is intense and highly respectable as I'm aware Josh Lucas injured his ribs on set. One of the most interesting and strongest choices Petersen makes is to show what it would look like in every possible area on a ship when the boat is turning completely over. You see everything from the main party room where most guests are at, to the kitchens, to the deck pools as people fall out of them and the water dumps out of the pool. It really gives off the feel that the main characters are not alone and it makes it a bit scarier for the viewer as well given many people have been on cruise ships.Basically, if you're looking to go to a movie and you've seen everything else this summer, "Poseidon" is a worthwhile way to kill 99 minutes and not regret it.
New parents take on frat boys in "Neighbors," the latest dirty R-rated comedy from director Nicholas Stoller ("Forgetting Sarah Marshall," "Get Him to the Greek") and produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's Point Grey Pictures. Yet what separates "Neighbors" from the heap has a lot to do with the script, written by novices Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien. Their unusual yet familiar concept results in a comedy accessible to both college guys and to 30-some-year-olds with babies along with everyone in between.Yes, you do need to move beyond the preposterous notion that a neighborhood would ever be zoned to allow fraternity houses to move in in order to enjoy this movie, but the comic treasure chest this premise opens is well worth it. Rogen and Rose Byrne ("Bridesmaids," "Get Him to the Greek") star as young parents Mac and Kelly Radner, who are adjusting to being homeowners and caring for human life, even if it requires having sex in random rooms of the house just to feel young and adventurous again. Of course when the Delta Psi fraternity moves in next door, the Radners feel their quiet adult life being threatened, while also not wanting to be the unhip couple that calls the cops when the noise gets too loud.After awkwardly befriending Delta Psi leaders Teddy (Zac Efron) and Pete (Dave Franco), the Radners betray the boys' trust when they call the cops, and a war is waged with the fraternity making the their lives miserable and the couple scheming of ways to get the fraternity kicked off campus.Naturally, these 30-somethings find themselves in situations they are way too old for, and anyone who's ever had a moment in which they feel like they can't party as hard as they used to will relate. Rogen and Byrne are hysterical together and their relationship is the backbone of the movie.Also, anyone in a fraternity or who has ever been in one will appreciate the way "Neighbors" exaggerates fraternity life, as there are some moments that show the brothers' bond and sensitivity. Of course the portrayal still perpetuates fraternity stereotypes, but we've at least moved beyond "Revenge of the Nerds" or National Lampoon depictions of all frat dudes being jocks. Efron and Franco are ideally suited to portray the "modern bro," with Efron making a statement that the "High School Musical" days are far behind him.What will surely go most under-appreciated about "Neighbors" is the unusual tail-end Gen X vs. Millennial clash going on. Mac and Teddy's argument about who is Batman (for Mac, it's Michael Keaton, for Teddy it's Christian Bale) perfectly represents this divide in its most fundamental sense, as college kids today watched Christopher Nolan's trilogy throughout their formative years whereas to someone in their 30s, the original Batman films in the late '80s early '90s were those movies. Either way, until now there hasn't been a movie that pits such similar age groups against each other, with college guys striving to be legendary and nervous about their future and young adults clinging to whatever 20-year-old version of themselves they have left.So on the surface, "Neighbors" looks like (and very much is) a war between college kids and new parents, but it's actually an impressively spot-on depiction of generational struggles in 2014. The Macs and Kellys out there today don't see themselves the way parents of babies have been depicted on screen for ages. They identify with this couple, striving to be youthful and spontaneous while recognizing their responsibilities. With this in mind, I would not be surprised if older adults did not like this film very much.This truthful component of "Neighbors" won't be what those who see it remember most (it earns its "R" rating to be sure), but it adds surprising depth to a rather funny comedy that without these layers would've been entertaining enough anyway. Still, the "realism" here is what makes "Neighbors" actually funny rather than just playing for laughs, and it earns the film consideration as one of the year's best comedies.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

Exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez received the highest honor that can possibly be awarded in Intelligence for his work during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979, and the man who played him and directed his story in "Argo," Ben Affleck, will find himself quite decorated as well if he continues to make films at this quality of a clip. The "Gone Baby Gone" and "The Town" director has  at this point  completely erased his image as stale actor of the early 2000s and replaced it with a reputation as one of the most exciting directors working today. Those first two films depicted a gritty, hard-nosed America as seen through blue-collar Boston, and though "Argo" is a story that takes place halfway across the world and is so inconceivable it could only be true, he finds a way to make it unmistakably real and palpable.After explaining the events leading up to the crisis in clever storyboarding fashion, "Argo" opens with an intense depiction of the invasion of the U.S. embassy and shows how six Americans escaped and took refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador (Victor Garber). Several months later we meet Mendez, who is brought in to consult on the CIA's current plan to get the six out. After tearing holes in their various strategies, Mendez eventually concocts a plan to disguise them as a Canadian film crew scouting for shooting locations.In order for it to be a convincing cover, Mendez must build an entire movie from the ground up. He enlists the help of skilled Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and wisecracking producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to find a script and create some tangible buzz and legitimacy surrounding the film. They select a script called "Argo," a bad "Star Wars" and "Flash Gordon" knockoff that calls for exotic locales with a Middle Eastern flair."Argo" (the real film) is a tense journey from start to finish. Even for those familiar with the true story and the outcome will find reason to pause and think, "they do get home safely, right?" Affleck keeps the suspense high by pristinely communicating the stakes should they fail. Brutal punishment and likely certain death awaits them if so much as anyone suspects them of being American spies. Affleck captures the unstable and erratic nature of the angry Iranian mobs, drawing upon imagery from actual television footage and photos taken during the duration of the crisis from '79 to '81.But much of what makes the film work can primarily be found in Chris Terrio's script, which is based on an article by Joshuah Bearman. It delivers the story in such a succinct manner and uses sharp and illustrative language to communicate the nature of the situation and the characters dealing with it. It's also impressively witty and clever even if a bit contrived in order to be so. Consequently, Arkin is at the top of his game as the lovable scuzzball producer, and Affleck, Goodman and Bryan Cranston as Mendez's CIA supervisor also benefit. This top-shelf ensemble cast adds every bit of legitimacy to the film as an Intelligence thriller.Although incredibly subtle, there are numerous nods to the sci-fi films and TV shows of the '70s. Geeks will appreciate a little shout out to a famous sci-fi show of the time, but otherwise, these films are the unsung hero of the movie. Without the ridiculousness of the exotic Martian locales and other hallmarks of science fiction, we would've all but surely failed to extract the hiding Americans from Iran.More down to earth and part of what gives "Argo" broader appeal is the way that it feels quintessentially American (with all apologies to the Canadians and their instrumental role in the events both real and depicted). Affleck takes the time to show moving imagery of how we responded to the crisis at home with the yellow ribbons and as far as saving the day, the film depicts us as not having so much pride that we couldn't let the Canadians get all the credit. Given international relations as they are now, it's refreshing to see this golden example of governmental collaboration."Argo" is a golden example in its own right. Movies based on true stories don't get more compelling than this. Despite some incredibly suspicious timing as far as avoiding the bad guys and other stuff we're more accustomed to from works of total fiction, this film represents a crisp, clean and maybe most importantly, accessible execution of a bureaucratic thriller, especially one based on true events. The delivery of the story is so impeccable that it ought to be used to teach writing for film. We don't ask all our films to be revelatory, but they should all be as thoroughly engaging as "Argo."It's true that "Argo" isn't loaded with big ideas. It might be the antithesis to another of this year's likely awards contenders, "The Master." But what it lacks in themes and conversation starters it more than makes up for in intrigue, suspense and intelligent entertainment.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site, moviemusereviews.com
After reading the plot summary and watching the first half hour of "Volver," I thought I had rented the wrong film. I was impressed with what I saw from creator Pedro Almodovar -- he really lets the visuals tell the story -- but what I had read to be a fantastical comedy was turning out to be more of a dark comedy out of the Woody Allen playbook. The Allen features eventually faded, but Almodovar fails to reconcile this dark half hour in any way throughout the rest of the film. It is the only costly mistake in a film that is otherwise intriguing and offers quite a new perspective on family drama.This new perspective arises when Irene (Maura) appears to return to life in spectral form to her daughter Sole (Duenas) after Irene's sister, their Tia Paula, dies. Having thought she died in a fire many years ago, Sole tries to understand why she has returned. With what was once thought to be lost forever now back, they both have second chances, but the problem is that Sole's sister, Raimunda (Cruz), had a falling out with her mother as children, so Sole tries to hide Irene from her, even though Raimunda and her daughter Paula are working out problems of their own.That complicated explanation alone is what keeps "Volver" from being a truly wonderful film. We start to understand more of the relevancy of Raimunda's problems at the beginning of the film to her mother's "return," but there is never a clear or thematic connection. It does, however, give Cruz a killer role in which to flex her acting talents. The Oscar nomination was a deserved one -- Cruz is a master of a wide range of emotions and visually communicating the inner torments of all her characters, especially Raimunda.The film eventually unravels as a mystery because so many events that don't occur in the film (their are no convenient flashbacks) are critical to understanding the present action. It's challenging in that regard, though highly interesting. As things make more sense, we begin to see the film's inner beauty, how it reveals our tendency to closely and often stoically guard the love we have for those in our family and how it's rarely worth severing those bonds because those relationships become so valuable in the long term, especially that between parent and child.So although Almodovar creates a fatal flaw in his film, he makes up for most of it by telling this touching story in a way that's just as sensitive and beautiful. Certainly a unique film, but it definitely doesn't come as advertised.
In a film where a giant monster attacks Manhattan, there are a lot of questions. What is it? Where did it come from? Why is it being destructive? "Cloverfield" doesn't want to answer these questions, it just wants you to ask them.It's a hard concept to grasp, but this film, brought to the screen by LOST's J.J. Abrams and his property Bad Robot, doesn't want you to get caught up in the details. Your job is to experience what goes on and react to it and for much of the film. Sure, it's frustrating, it doesn't make sense, but Abrams and director Matt Reeves are aiming for that for a reason.As soon as disaster strikes, images and feelings of 9/11 are conjured. With a cast of unknowns and a single camcorder as the source of the images, "Cloverfield" feels very real. While the film takes off from there as a monster attack/alien invasion, for a majority of it you are interested in what's happening to these people and how they're handling the situation. There is a lot of stuff that's hard to believe, but without it there's not much of a film. In general, the dialogue and the reactions of the people are very realistic and for a majority of the film keeps you on the edge of your seat.In a sense, "Cloverfield" is a sci-fi, fictional United 93, a gritty retelling of events (although false). The undertones of tragedy are difficult and it's amazing how these young actors are able to convey such realism."Cloverfield" takes several different styles and genres and fuses them into something new and successful. It is the kind of film that if imitated in any way by any future film will clearly not get by without constant references to this film. It is exciting and innovative and exactly the kind of twisting of the norm that Hollywood needs to stay fresh while staying successful. It's not mind-blowing or genius, but it's got style. It goes to show that big blockbuster-style films can be done in small independent film-style ways.
The predecessor of "Chronicles of Riddick," 2000's "Pitch Black" was an exercise in sci- fi/horror, a kill-one-character-at-a-time flick whose saving grace was a gray-eyed anti- hero named Riddick who always did the right thing despite having an attitude about it. Now, this entertaining one-liner machine has stepped into the limelight and into an intergalactic action/adventure "Star Trek"-esquire genre. "Riddick" has more characters, more planets and more special effects. The result is a more exciting and imaginative film, but one that's a bit overwhelming as it juggles a cluttered array of characters, planets and other science-fiction embellishments.The thing keeping "Riddick" from being mainstreamed is that it comes on a bit too strong, especially considering "Pitch Black" was barely a cult favorite. Let me explain: escaped convict Riddick (Vin Diesel) is tired of being tracked down by bounty hunters so he tries to find out who wants his head. That takes him to Helion Prime, a planet on the verge of an attack by Necromongers, a warring religious cult of sorts going from planet to planet converting more Necromongers and killing anyone who stands in their way. Of course Riddick is too self-serving to care about saving a planet though several characters such as some woman that keeps appearing to him, his old friend Imam and Dame Judi Dench insist that his destiny lies in defeating the Necromongers' evil Lord Marhsal (Colm Feore). And that's just part of it, forget the subplot between Riddick and the girl he cared for in "Pitch Black" played by Alex Davalos or the one between Lord Vaako (Karl Urban) and the woman controlling him (Thandie Newton) as they try and take the Necromonger throne.Science-fiction fans will be fascinated by all the concepts and lore to seek their teeth into, but for most viewers it'll be too much. Director and writer David Twohy is a man of great vision but he lacks the foresight to see that his story is too complex -- not in that it's hard to follow, because you get what you need to, but in that it's too hard to care. As far as the costumes, sets and visual effects, Twohy does some great stuff, though strobe-lighting in the earlier action sequences is a bit frustrating.Still, the film's strength, much like that of "Pitch Black" lies in its titular character. Vin Diesel's been the star vehicle in several action films, but he's at his best as Riddick. Twohy pens some great one-liners and Diesel delivers them with slick precision. He manages to be both standoffish and caring in this film, not something all A-list action stars can do well without going over-the-top. The development of Riddick's backstory is a little shoddy on Twohy's end -- it'd be better to leave him an enigma than even slightly address it -- but that's part of the complicated web that Twohy weaves in developing this story.Fans of complex sci-fi actioners will really enjoy "Riddick" but casual fans of the genre or those who require a stronger human angle will find it a bit much to deem it anything more than entertaining.
Finally, the greatest and most "unfilmable" graphic novel of all time reaches the big screen. I can understand director Zak Snyder's hesitation in taking on Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' "Watchmen": it's a golden example of a story that perfectly fits its medium, that doesn't need to be told (and maybe shouldn't) any other way. But Snyder takes the challenge head on, opting to stay as visually and structurally faithful to the novel as possible, crossing his fingers that the rest will work out. And "Watchmen"'s crowning achievement ends up how stunning and marvelous it is to watch. As for the rest working out, a bit of something is left to be desired--part of the impact of the characters and their struggles lost--but all flaws of the film directly correlate to the choice to stay true to the source. A tough choice, but the right one for this movie because the visual payoff is extraordinary.The first challenge the film meets with incredible success is setting up the context for an alternative 1980s America where Nixon is in his fifth term dealing with the Cold War, Armageddon is looming and self-proclaimed vigilante superheroes walk the streets to try and do good (although they've been recently outlawed). The opening credits sequence does this masterfully. It is without a doubt the best opening credits sequence I have ever seen. Not only is it loaded with goodies for "Watchmen" fans but it drops information needed to understand the film and shows how famous historical events or iconic images and the like would have been altered if the "Watchmen" universe were reality. All this in the form of still or slow-moving images. I wanted to stand up and applaud when it was over.The middle of the movie is the toughest part to endure in terms of pacing and understanding the characters. There's a lot to digest as we dive into the mysterious death of retired superhero The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and what it means to the ruthless vigilante Rorschach (Jackie Earl Haley) trying to solve it. Add the vital back story of the other characters: all-powerful Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), the lonely Dan Dreiberg once known as Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), the lost but beautiful Laurie Jupiter once Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman), her mother (Carla Gugino), and the powerful businessman who commodified his once superhero-dom, Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode), and you have just way too many characters to follow. Naturally, that means you take to the coolest ones (Rorschach) and find yourself wanting to know more, which the film could never do without either boring you or taking away from the story.With so much character development going on, things can get slow, so there is action added to the film at parts or intensified by Snyder at others as only the "300" director would know how. Snyder amps up the violence a bit for this reason (and likely a bit for his personal tastes). In general, the sympathy I developed for all these characters reading the graphic novel isn't there as much in the film because too much is going on at one time. This is where doing a straight adaptation gets extremely difficult, because handling all this at once in a film is near impossible unless drastic changes are made. For the most part, the acting of these reputable but not A-list stars helps you get to the core of these characters more than you might otherwise.Fortunately, the main idea of the story which creates an incredible two-view perspective on human nature comes across clearly in the end as the world nears its darkest hour, and you leave more satisfied than you thought you would through parts of the film's second hour.But understandably, the dark, psychological aspect of film is not what will drive most people to see it. Snyder brings it to this film in terms of action. When you watch these heavy-hitting, physically exaggerated fight scenes, you recognize they're far from real, but gosh are they cool. In combination with great sound editing, Snyder's tendency toward slow motion is exciting and captivating. But what he deserves more credit for is the way this movie is shot scene by scene. It is sweeping and grandiose at times, intimate and tense at others, beautifully lit and colored by his cinematography team at every scene. Best of all, there are so many small details from pictures on the wall to other things you won't catch the first time if you don't know the novel that really do enhance meaning and comprehension. Honestly, his only poor choice is Leonard Cohen's "Halleluyah" for the soundtrack during the soft-core porn scene. Not having this film scored was a risky proposition. Having actual songs from the era help create a sense of realism, that this is a period film, but it does hurt the emotions at times.Truth be told, no one else could do a better job than Snyder. He's the real deal, I truly believe it after seeing the incredible vision he brings to the project. Maybe others could do just as good a job or worse, but not better, because this film is very firmly an adaptation: a chance to see source material beautifully and cleverly re-created for the big screen. Nothing can help the fact that this story cannot be fully understood and appreciated as a 163-minute epic, but instead requires a slower digestion afforded by the novel. Without butchering the source material, there is no way to make "Watchmen" a perfect film, so Snyder and writers take the high road, aiming to please fans and terrifically execute every scene as if to say the parts are more valuable than their sum. Although a risky move as far as films go, it's the right one for such a treasured story.
The best crime films of all time continue to prove that they're not about the action and the plot twists. While "Chinatown" certainly keeps you guessing, it's the style of the film and the acting that make it so good. You don't watch "Chinatown" when you're in the mood for a good thriller--you watch it when you want to see fine film-making."Chinatown" is about a private investigator named J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) who is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, the wife of the man in charge of Los Angeles' water supply, to find out who her husband is having an affair with. When her husband turns up dead and the woman Gittes thought was Mulwray was actually someone else, Gittes and the real Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) begin an investigation and a relationship in the process of discovering the truth. Gittes eventually finds himself in a bit of trouble as he tries to figure it all out, including receiving a slashed nose (a character played by director Roman Polanski)It is only fitting that the character who scars Gittes is played by Polanski himself. He leaves a mark on Gittes that we see for the rest of the film, that is symbolic of his own marks on the film as a director. First of all, Polanski is at his prime with this film. His semi-first person camera angles and pans seem to really suit the film well. While he had a ton of help from screenwriter Robert Towne (who won the only Oscar the film received), the characters' subtleties are by far their most interesting and important features.Nicholson and Dunaway do some great noir acting. Nicholson is a clever, foul-mouthed, lovably dislikable protagonist and Dunaway succeeds at portraying the fact that her character appears to be hiding something from Gittes in nearly every scene. Both were worthy of their Oscar nominations. The film doesn't work without them both being very interesting characters to watch.As with any mystery that's really not so much about the mystery and more about subtleties, "Chinatown" warrants a second viewing. You need to be able to spend more time paying attention to Nicholson's references to his life in Chinatown, for example, and spend less time trying to make sense of the plot. The plot is certainly interesting and the ending really delivers what you've been waiting for in a film where people are getting mixed up in things they shouldn't be. "Chinatown" is undoubtedly a classic, even if it lacks the attractive swagger that films like "The Godfather Pt. II" (which beat it out for the Oscar) have.
It's a good thing robots haven't taken over the world, but it's a shame Hollywood is run by them. When a director with a gift for science-fiction like Alex Proyas ("Dark City") is asked to helm a big-name big-budget action flick starring an A-lister in Will Smith, a battle has already begun: the human artist or the Hollywood machine? "I, Robot" is a slick and exciting futuristic action movie, but it gives the highly evident man vs. machine themes too light of a treatment considering the age of special effects in cinema has delivered movies with similar insights before. Smith gets a little closer to freeing himself from the Hollywood bondage that has stuck him with mediocre sequels to the "Men in Black" and "Bad Boys" films. The only alarming factor is that this marks the first time Smith has invested in himself as executive producer and leading man. Considering the way the script pimps Smith out to his fans with dumb, smart- ass one-liners, one hopes Smith backed the film on its thematic potential and the chance for him to play a character with a slightly more sophisticated background.Smith stars as Det. Del Spooner, a homicide cop in Chicago in the year 2035, where robots are as commonplace as the cell phones of today, robots programmed to obey three laws that essentially state saving human life is paramount to all other instructions. When the father of this technology (James Cromwell) dies by apparent suicide, Spooner -- who for personal reasons doesn't trust robots -- investigates what looks to be more than meets the eye (pardon me, Transformers). Inspired by the book by famed science-fiction author Isaac Asimov and written by Jeff Vintar ("Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within") and "American Beauty" Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman, "I, Robot" wastes no time questioning if intelligent artificial life forms guided by logic and reason can replace the need for human emotions to guide free will. It's a bit blunt at times, but something to chew on that's more than popcorn at a summer blockbuster is certainly welcome.Proyas brings the future to life by means comparable to Steven Spielberg's vision in "Minority Report," a futuristic murder story two years this film's senior. Other than some really annoying product placement (a FedEx delivery robot, Audi and Smith wears Converse All- Stars) bogging it down, this is a vision of the future that not only appeals to the eye, but definitely appears to have been given a great deal of thought. It's not gratuitous technology for coolness' sake, it all serves a practical purpose other than the bells and whistles of the robots.But the script would prefer to keep Smith talking smack and providing too much of our background information than giving him some serious depth. Spooner is not a carbon copy of any previous Smith character, but it's still pretty clear in the writing and the Converse All- Stars that Smith is there to score style points above all else. And with the rest of the cast being throwaways or too small of roles to count, this is once again his show. Better, but still his show."I, Robot" sits on the cusp of a great science-fiction film; after all, its director has made one before. But it prefers to operate on the surface level as if it were worried going deeper would ruin its commercial appeal. In the end, its another example of a movie that could have been made better but got manufactured by the Hollywood machine, duping us with eye candy into believing we want a safe, formulaic sci-fi movie.
"L.A. Confidential" has it all: rebel cops, corrupt cops, two-faced killers, seductive women, drug-runners, prostitution, murder, set-ups, mystery, gun fights, suspense, brain-teasing twists and turns...the works. If that seems like too much crime drama stereotype for one film, let me assure you that it all works and it works well. That's why "L.A. Confidential" is hailed as one of the best films of the 1990s, though it should be seen as the precedent- setter for the crime drama-obsessed decade that followed it.The plot is too intricate to summarize briefly, but after LAPD cops and detectives beat up on several jailed Mexicans because the Mexicans had allegedly been responsible for the beating of two other cops, the bad press for the LAPD sets into motion a sequence of events that become further worsened when a massacre occurs at a coffee shop. Bud White (Crowe), Jack Vicennes (Spacey) and Ed Exley (Pearce) are all very different cops who go about investigating the case differently but end up closer to each other than they realize."LAC" can be viewed in two separate halves. The first hour feels like a film in itself and the second hour feels totally different until the ending ties the two together. The feeling you get is the film is long, especially because mystery-wise your brain has been working in overdrive if you like to try and figure things out. It's a wild ride, albeit a very good one.The acting is all phenomenal. Everyone plays terrific characters. The film was just the beginning for Crowe's leading roles, Spacey works his lovably hateable charm and Pearce really adds a different dimension to the cast as highly moral justice-driven cop. Even Kim Basinger as a woman involved with and caught up in this mystery seems to steal every scene that she's in with her beauty and poise.The only thing going against the film is at times it does feel over-the-top with all the plot lines going on, especially at the end, but at that point you're so caught up in the well-developed characters and their subsequent motives, as well as the mystery, that the feeling is easy to block out. Had it not been the first, it may not have been one of the best crime dramas of all time, but it certainly was and it deserves kudos for it.
"Foxcatcher" is anything but a wrestling drama. Although based on the true story of Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz and his brief years of training under multi-millionaire John du Pont, "Foxcatcher" expands well beyond the wrestling ring into the minds of two men longing to find greatness.So those expecting anything close to director Bennett Miller's last film, "Moneyball," should be forewarned. This is not a sports movie, but a slow-burning character study (like Miller's first acclaimed film, "Capote") in which the wrestling serves as the visual, physical expression of the psychological struggle between the characters.When we first meet Mark, played by Channing Tatum, whose versatility continues to amaze, it's 1987 and he is living in the faded glory of his 1984 gold medal. Despite his success, he is living a rather lonely life and itching to accomplish more; his brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo), also won gold and Dave feels that leaves him with something to prove. So when John du Pont (Steve Carell) contacts him about paying him to come train at his top-notch facility on his family's estate, Foxcatcher Farm, he sees his opportunity.Mark and du Pont's philosophies about striving to be the best align, and the two form a close, almost father-and-son bond, though more so because they both feel pressure to live up to others' expectations. Du Pont, in particular, wants to prove himself to his mother (Vanessa Redgrave), who breeds world class horses and finds wrestling barbaric. John's desperation, bottomless checkbook and unresolved family issues make for a dangerous combination, and his relationship with Mark slowly begins to change for the worse. Further complicating the matter is Dave, the only man capable of saving Mark from his demanding expectations of himself and whose coaching expertise intimidates du Pont.The often unspoken psychological warfare between the three (and, perhaps most importantly, du Pont and his mother) is the driving force of the story more than anything that actually happens on screen. Mark's ups and downs as he competes at the '87 World Championships and '88 Olympic trials are symptomatic of his mental state and the state of his relationship with the other men. As such, "Foxcatcher" is a long, at times brooding film that can drag in spite of the brilliant character development and internal drama.E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman's script is quiet and doesn't have a lot of big juicy moments for its actors to lean on, so the fact that Carell is totally haunting and captivating in this role says a lot. Du Pont is an incredibly complex character whose back story is mostly implied so as to keep him as unpredictable as possible. Even with all the makeup on, Carell gives the epitome of an understated performance, something you would never dream possible from a guy who has made a career out of big acting and abrasive characters. Undoubtedly some credit goes to Miller, who has churned out acting nominations and wins for his previous casts, and gets Carell and Tatum to pause and linger at all the right moments.With those two in transforming roles, it's easy to overlook Ruffalo (who always seems to get overlooked). Dave is the comparison point for both these men. He's a family man who is smart, has accomplished a lot and knows what it truly means to work hard. Ruffalo brings his trademark authenticity to his part as the "good guy" and does it so well.Even when it's too quiet and languishes, "Foxcatcher" is a fine piece of cinema and Miller has established himself as a true auteur. It certainly does not satisfy in the mainstream sense, but its purposeful use of imagery, total avoidance of melodrama and magnifying glass on the human condition make it an undeniably sharp and intelligent art film to be sure.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

Adam Sandler's sense of humor has always been childish, so in a back-handed way, "Bedtime Stories" was a great project for him. He gets to play goofy uncle in this imaginative kids tale that's as warm-hearted as it is silly and maybe even formulaic at times. But aren't bedtime stories supposed to be formulaic? This is a movie that sees at a kid's level and provides just that sort of entertainment.In "Bedtime Stories," Skeeter Bronson (Sandler) plays a hotel maintenance worker snubbed of the hotel that was rightfully his to own, who is charged with watching his niece and nephew, Bobbi and Patrick, during the night hours while their mom (Courtney Cox) is away for a few days. Skeeter, a typical Sandler-esquire self-centered unmarried loser character, tells the kids bedtime stories because he doesn't know what else to do with them, and strangely enough, what the kids add to his stories comes true for him the next day. It's clear Sandler dragged his Happy Madison Productions pals into this one with the idea of "let's do it for the kids." Sandler's own children, when they are old enough, will at least be able to watch Dad doing something where they don't have to ask him questions that are sex or swear-word related. And not so surprisingly, Sandler does the father figure thing quite well. I'm sure he didn't have trouble getting the kids to laugh naturally on set.As a film, "Bedtime Stories" is exactly what you'd think: Walt Disney meets Adam Sandler. Disney writer Matt Lopez brings the fantastical story and longtime Sandler collaborator Tim Herlihy helps personalize it to the longtime comedian. It's Sandler comedy (Rob Schneider and Allen Covert make cameos) with the jokes toned down to PG levels and a Disney-sized imagination.Other than Sandler's regulars, the cast is full of diverse talents. Keri Russell as the love interest, Cox as the mom, Russell Brand ("Forgetting Sarah Marshall") as a bizarre hotel chef/pal of Skeeter's and even Guy Pearce ("Memento") in his first non-dramatic role. All of them, besides Sandler, really reach out of their genre comfort zones to make this a true kids' movie."Bedtime Stories" is cute at every turn. From the children to Bugsy the bug-eyed CG guinea pig to the way Sandler attempts to make jokes the kids will love, there isn't anything negative one can say about the spirit driving this film. Unlike other PG movies that try and beat the censors with adult undertones, "Bedtime Stories" plays perfectly to its audience: kids and their imaginations.
Don't let the powdered wigs fool you  "Barry Lyndon" is a Stanley Kubrick film through and through. To many it comes off as the filmmaker's period stepchild, but his hallmarks shine in this portrait-esque telling of an Irishman's rise and fall in social status at the hands of what can only be considered luck.This biographical epic derives from William Makepeace Thackeray's 19th Century novel loosely based on legendary Irish fortune-hunter Andrew Robinson Stoney. Published in serial form and then turned into a novel, Thackeray's tale is said to be one of literature's very first instances of an unlikeable hero.But Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) wasn't always that way. In fact, it's not until Act II when he assumes the mantle of Barry Lyndon that he becomes a figure one might not be so inclined to root for. Even with his brazen ways in the beginning as he leaves Ireland and finds himself in both the British and Prussian militaries during the Seven Years War, you can't help but hope fortune looks kindly upon him after his early-life woes.Kubrick's lengthy telling of this tale allows us to see the complete rise and fall of Barry without skipping many beats. His pursuit of a wealthy lifestyle begins as a teenager when he falls in love with his cousin who ditches him for a wealthy military captain who will bring the Barry family lots of wealth. In a jealous rage, he challenges the man to a duel and kills him, forcing him to flee the area, but he finds out not much later that the ball was a dummy round of sorts. Redmond was set up so that the family could keep him out of the way of the marriage. At this point a Red Coat himself, he determines to climb his way to the top by any means necessary.Despite the period look, "Barry Lyndon" plays out more as an 18th Century fantasy adventure. Redmond is never in the same place for long until he marries Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) at the start of the second act and his misadventures have a humorous bent to them. He finds himself in all kinds of predicaments and dealing with all manner of people. Instinct and luck lead him on a roller coaster that peaks at his achievement of wealth by marrying the Lady Honoria. Then, of course, it goes straight down.Guiding the film is an omniscient narrator who both foreshadows and offers keen insights, especially into the themes and ideas at play in the film. It also helps to frame the film as a portrait of a man's life. Kubrick's visuals echo this concept in the way he films every scene as if it's a painting. Only a few scenes, namely the more visceral ones in which there's fighting or something of that nature influences him to move his camera freely about. The technical aspects of the film are among the best of any of Kubrick's works. The costumes, cinematography and music create this moving tableau that keeps the film exciting even if a particular part of the story dulls momentarily.The performances are among the least memorable of Kubrick's films, but that's not to say they're poor. O'Neal has the challenge of always being 30 years old in real life but acting like Barry at different stages of his life. The blend between these stages lacks the necessary smoothness, but O'Neal excels at the all the emotional high points and finds ways to generate our sympathy in spite of Barry's inherent flaws.The rest of the cast either have or are made up with striking visual features. Kubrick and frequent casting director James Liggat find actors who really stand out, an important feature in both creating the tall-tale effect of the film but also in helping keep multiple characters separate in a time period in which conformity was the style. Murray Melvin as Reverend Runt, for example, has such a distinguished face that simply enhances the film. Of course it helps that Kubrick was a master of close-ups on faces."Barry Lyndon" shares some story characteristics with Kubrick's other films, namely in a man's transformation, a character or mankind's corruption, over time. Many of his works detail how war or violence ruins men, and while that's here too, it's told in a more biographical manner with an emphasis on luck and fortune or misfortune. What we discover at the latest by the film's one-sentence epilogue is that Kubrick didn't necessarily believe in luck's influence on the whole story, but he was nonetheless fascinated by how in this time period, the actions of men could be misconstrued as just luck one way or another. The social hierarchy, if you will, created a perception of powerlessness in one's own life to change social circumstances. Kubrick loads the film with innumerable scenes featuring duels and card games, but based on the outcomes, the characters involved always seem to make their own luck.Sure, "Barry Lyndon" could be considered the least commercially viable of Kubrick's films, but it is their equal as far as the director's mastery.~Steven CThanks for reading!

An easy way to measure how much you will or won't enjoy "Fanboys" is how closely you fit to the titular category. The more of a Star Wars fan you are and the more your gender and maturity is on par with 'boy,' the more you'll like this ode to Star Wars fans.The premise of this film is excellent: In 1998, six months before the scheduled release of "Star Wars Episode I" a group of fanboy friends in their 20-somethings road trip to Skywalker Ranch to try and steal a rough cut of the movie because one of them has a terminal illness and won't live to see the release. The execution, however, is spotty.The movie is a Star Wars-themed version of "Road Trip," with the guys heading across America in a van and stopping along the way solely to buy some time before they get to the ranch. My guess would be that Ernest Cline and Dan Pulick are fanboys themselves who came up with the premise of stealing Episode I and then had to find a way to actually make it work. Therefore, the guys stop off in Iowa where the character of Captain Kirk from the Star Trek franchise was born to antagonize some Trekkies, they get caught at a gay biker bar and they have to go to Las Vegas to get security clearance to the ranch from an insider.The main character and the story are not all that strong, but the small tributes, spoofs and cameos all related to the Star Wars universe is what makes "Fanboys" entertaining. Therefore, the more you know Star Wars -- things like thermal detonators and that Chewbacca is from Kashik -- the more you love "Fanboys."In addition to appearances from a few notable actors from the Star Wars franchise, director Kyle Newman does some nice homages to Lucas and obviously Star Wars. The infamous side wipes that Lucas uses to transition in those movies appear a couple times and the security at the ranch resemble the ones from THX 1138, one of Lucas' first movies (although that might just be the truth, who knows). The writing also does this too including famous quotes when appropriate and even the movie's funniest scene when the gang ends up in George Lucas' trash compactor. Other cameos include Seth Rogen, Billy Dee Williams, and Kevin Smith, to name a few without spoiling one of the film's few excellent aspects. Stars Sam Huntington ("Superman Returns"), the rotund Dan Fogler ("Balls of Fury"), Jay Baruchel ("Knocked Up") and Chris Marquette ("The Girl Next Door") are all average, though mostly because their characters are written sloppy.Bottom line is "Fanboys" states in title alone exactly who it's intended for. I don't know why Harvey Weinstein would fight to try and make this something that would appeal to the masses only to let it come out without making a peep. If Star Wars is going to be the focus of a movie, there's one segment of the population that will like it, no matter what you do. Fortunately, for those fans, "Fanboys" is good. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Few films are certain conversation starters like "Compliance." How a prank call to a McDonald's in Mount Washington, Kentucky led to an illegal sex act is disturbing and inconceivable, but it's true. Filmmaker Craig Zobel takes this ridiculous piece of verifiable non-fiction and reconstructs the events in hopes of uncovering some secret as to how something like this could happen.The Mount Washington event was the most serious of a series of prank calls that occurred across the country attributed to one perpetrator. The caller's M.O. was to call usually a fast food or some chain establishment pretending to be a police officer and describe a young female employee who was being accused of stealing money. He would then require a strip search of the girl because the police were too busy to conduct a minor search like that.In the film, restaurant manager Sandra (Anne Dowd) is called by a police officer who says he's sitting with someone who claims a young female employee stole money from her purse. He describes Becky (Dreama Walker), who of course denies the accusation vehemently. The officer claims to have Sandra's supervisor on the other line, and after talking back and forth with Sandra and also Becky, tells Sandra she must strip search Becky to make sure she's not lying and hiding the money on her. From there, the officer's demands become more severe and the employees continue to comply.Zobel had to have wanted to inch closer to the truth of this psychological phenomenon in order to make this film, yet "Compliance" will leave viewers more curious about the truth and wondering how it happened than having any actual understanding of how it happened. Maybe exposing more people to this baffling story was his only objective, but in taking on the responsibility of telling this story, the challenge is stringing together unbelievable facts in a way that we can buy into their validity. Zobel only manages to accomplish this in part, though it's no small task to be sure.Much of the film will leave you wondering how anyone could be so dumb as to not question the voice on the other end of the phone or not insist that the police actually show up and do the strip search themselves. Zobel doesn't suggest any reasons for this through the script, so you have to imagine being in the characters' shoes. In the beginning, the blame for the perpetuation of this lie falls on Sandra's shoulders. Sandra never questions whether she's talking to the police based solely on the caller name-dropping her supervisor. She gives in to his friendly chit-chat and seems afraid to question what she perceives to be authority.Dowd's performance is undoubtedly the best in the film. Through her we can understand Sandra's compliance, which is the key to everyone else's. She's the lone authority figure in the restaurant, and if she believes the man is a police officer, everyone is likely to believe it. We see Sandra's hesitance, though we can sense her fear to not obey authority, which is obviously the stronger of the two feelings.It's the other characters that we struggle to comprehend. It's really hard to understand why Becky gives in to any further searching after the initial strip search. She obviously feels pressure from authority, but as the demands become more sexual in nature, you'd expect her to refuse at some point, especially knowing that she never took money from anyone. Her compliance is the real phenomenon, along with Van's (Bill Camp), Sandra's fiancée. Sandra calls him over when the officer asks her to leave Becky with someone she trusts of the opposite sex while she works in the restaurant. You'd expect Van to think the whole thing was ridiculous as someone who comes into the situation as an outsider. His obedience is a sickening mystery.The film's failure to help us understand these characters and their actions isn't entirely necessary to being intrigued by the movie as a whole, but it can be maddeningly frustrating as far as believing the events because you know they actually happened but you just don't get how or why. Zobel has some obligation to making this make sense, and while that's a heck of a mountain to climb for any filmmaker, he definitely could've done more.The biggest creative choice that I majorly disapproved of was the decision to show the caller on the other end, played by Pat Healy. If you're trying to get into the characters' mindsets so you can make sense of why they obeyed, you should tell the story as closely to how they experienced it, and showing the caller shatters that mystery. A reveal at the end might have been effective, but revealing him halfway makes our experience a completely objective one, which impedes our ability to empathize.At the same time, Zobel should be commending on how he wields the suspense and the horrific nature of this small-scale atrocity to his advantage. In some ways, it's scarier than most billed scary movies, at least in the ways that it's genuinely freaky. There's no denying he tells the story in an absolutely compelling manner."Compliance" manages to be a captivating film on premise and story alone and if you're unfamiliar with the real-life strip-search prank calls like I was when I sat down to watch, that's definitely enough to enjoy it (though "enjoy" is really a regrettable word for this movie). When you really start to break it down, that's when it amounts to a bizarre account of bizarre events that doesn't justify its existence from an artistic standpoint, but in all other senses, it absolutely works as a film.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Dogma" isn't the kind of comedy that most people will find themselves holding onto their guts during. It's more the second-long "ha!" kind of comedy.That simply means Kevin Smith's writing is clever enough to the point where you will be pleasantly shocked by some of the conversations and events of the film and think it all rather amusing and humorous. It's not hilarious, it's just clever and a bit funny.The premise is rather interesting and surprisingly from a more fantasy-esquire genre than Smith traditionally dabbles with. Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are more or less fallen angels that have found a way back into heaven. They must be stopped or the world will come to a screeching halt, so a seemingly random protagonist named Bethany gets charged by God to stop them. Simple, but the slick, nonchalant approach to religion keeps the satire rampant.The film does spend a lot of its time explaining itself, which isn't too bad considering Smith keeps the explanations to-the-point and allows the characters to stay interesting in the process. Chris Rock, who plays an apostle, and Alan Rickman, who plays God's messenger/ voice are two of these characters that are both good in the film and Smith has allowed to maintain their character's edge despite lines upon lines of explanation.Getting from point A to point B and so on is not the film's strength. The physical events that take place are ultimately boring and unexciting. It's the moments along the way, the conversations and the philosophy that come about, that make it successful. Affleck's character raises a lot of interesting religious questions about humanity and his conversation with the protagonist on the train is rather insightful. In general, Smith has used Bethany as a way to keep the viewers skepticism of the plot active in the film. She keeps it from getting preposterous. In general, the whole cast is very talented and their characters well written, which keeps the film interesting.It's not the funniest or most interesting comedy in terms of plot and the sequence of events, but "Dogma" is a smart concept that ultimately results in a sharp satire and some great thoughts that scrutinize religion in a way that never seems too out of line.
Ever since 2002, Hollywood has had a case of mistaken "Bourne Identity," pulling the trigger on any script that weaves government Intelligence with guns and combat and centers on a protagonist who doesn't know his or her own strength. "Salt" is another byproduct of the "Bourne" era, yet barely executes half as well as that consummate secret agent thriller.Angeline Jolie plays the titular "hero" in question, a CIA agent. When she interrogates a Russian who claims a Soviet sleeper agent will attempt to assassinate the president of Russia, she finds the finger pointed at her as that exact agent and so she goes on the run, very quickly putting her innocence out of the question, whereas the film would lead you to believe it's a "is she or isn't she?" movie. Whenever that's the case, you can bet the answer lies in the gray area, but nevertheless, that's "Salt."Why movie scripts can't simply let go of old Cold War themes and plots warrants a rigorous head scratch. Writer Kurt Wimmer ("Law Abiding Citizen," "Equilibrium") has a history of penning films that are never as believable as they are entertaining and "Salt" follows suit. The idea of bitter "comrades" awakening sleeper agents 20 years later that they trained and planted in the USA in hopes of reigniting nuclear war might top his list of improbable.Yet "Salt" has a nuclear warhead in Angelina Jolie, Hollywood's most treasured femme fatale. When Tom Cruise left the project, she became the sexy choice and consequently might have saved a Cruise-led "Salt" from complete annihilation critically and financially.Philip Noyce ("Patriot Games," "Clear and Present Danger") could direct a film like this in his sleep and he may well have. I was able to watch the director's cut, which is insignificant when you don't see the theatrical cut, but I didn't find anything other than the action all that redeeming, so I imagine it made no difference. His expertise lies in flipping the adrenaline switch on and satisfying that part of every viewer that's just waiting for the action to kick into gear. It's very obvious when something will happen, but the results are less predictable than you'd expect.The real problem with "Salt," preposterousness aside, comes in story structure. In order for the effective twists and turns at the end (not unforeseeable, but still exciting), Wimmer and Noyce both have to downplay Salt's character. Frankly, she sucks for most of the film. She's a terrible protagonist because -- without giving anything away -- the script's not-so-well guarded secrets are held in priority above her character development. Irrelevant flashbacks to her "husband" are an attempt at humanizing her, but her present actions become too strong for those sympathy cards to work.Espionage thriller and action movie fans will find comfort in "Salt" and continue to be drawn to Jolie's performances in these roles, but those who can't keep their fingers out of plot holes and have to ponder the feasibility of a story will be frustrated throughout most. For me, the twists at the end sorting the film out and making it "matter" more saved it from total mediocrity.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Nicolas Cage outranks all others under the column heading "schizophrenic actor," but when he hits, he hits. Playing characters such as lovably deplorable gun-runner Yuri Orlov fans the flames of the public's love-hate relationship with the big-screen veteran, reminding us of how much great work he could do if he had any semblance of screenplay taste buds (or fewer problems paying his taxes).Andrew Niccol's "Lord of War" fits Cage scarily well. The film creates an fictional arms dealer and imagines what his life would look like throughout the years from the Cold War to the many African civil wars. It then focuses inward on what kind of a person could possibly live with themselves dealing tools of power and genocide. Cage thrives with the opportunity to be slick and clever yet off-kilter and morally troublesome. Niccol's snappy writing, especially the voice-over narration, gives the film some edginess. What could be a darker and more dramatic tale of a man who deals guns to some of the most despicable people on the planet has a comedic tone that further muddles how we should feel about the main character.Orlov immigrated from Soviet Ukraine as a child and grew up pretending to be Jewish in Brighton Beach. In awe of the power that guns had, he quickly made his way from gang supply to arming full-on wars. He stuck with it because he was good at it, and it made him rich. He had enough money to contrive an entire scenario that would allow him to meet and woo his dream girl, a model named Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan). She grows wise to the fact that he's not what he says he is, but takes no issue with the extravagant lifestyle.A counterpoint to Yuri is his brother, Vitaly (Jared Leto), who begins as Yuri's partner but caves to the moral pressure of the job and develops a fierce cocaine addiction. So while he's the screw-up, he still has his moral compass in check, and we're left wondering which is the better of the two evils.Compared to Niccol's previous work ("Gattaca," "The Truman Show"), "Lord of War" seems like a much more grounded and gritty affair, but the New Zealander filmmaker employs levity throughout and gives the story some Hollywood-y or fantasy-like characteristics. As Yuri begins to have run-ins with an Interpol agent played by Ethan Hunt, their relationship feels very cat-and-mouse in the truly archetypal sense. It's evidence that Niccol wants to make an entertaining film on a topic that some would probably regard as being too sensitive for such a treatment. Yet the tone of "Lord of War" is consistent throughout. As shocking as some of the violence can be and as much as you'll think about what a horrible thing he does for a living, there's a riskiness to the film that echoes the volatile nature of Yuri's line of work. You might be having a ball living it up one moment and find your life in danger the next, just as any moment in the film could flip around entirely."Lord of War" doesn't condone Yuri's choices or suggest you should be rooting for him, which is one of the film's biggest strengths. Niccol wants you to ask yourself why this happens; why someone can get filthy rich off selling guns. The answer might leave you a little sick inside, but it's true. Rather than asking the audience to assess Yuri's character, the credits roll on "Lord of War" with much bigger questions on the table.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Woody Allen's film-making has always had a strong sense of personalized agenda about it, seeing as for most of his career he wrote, directed and starred in his own films, but none are as strikingly about discovering self-meaning as "Stardust Memories." It's not a pretentious work, but it's not nearly as accessible as his more popular films for this reason. All in all, it ends up being good for the same reasons: the characters and relationship drama and Allen's unique perspective on life and love, but its profundity seems mainly reserved for Allen or other middle-aged artists.Allen plays Sandy Bates, a director famous for his early comedies who goes to a festival of his old work at a time in his career where his producers are saying he's getting too out there. A combination of bombardment from fans, the arrival of an old, French love affair, and meeting a woman that eerily reminds him of one of his ex-lovers, causes Sandy to reflect on his work and life and radically reconsider his future.Allen gives a strong effort to align the audience with Sandy's perspective, whether keeping Sandy out of frame in scenes that he's in at times or more commonly bringing the camera into first person perspective. He succeeds the most at creating empathy for what it must be like to deal with the attention of fans or people seeking your help for one reason or another. He also uses those techniques well at capturing what it is about the women he's with in any given scene that truly rivets him. Charlotte Rampling, who plays his ex-lover Dorrie who he can't seem to get over, has the perfect look for the part. She has a distinct beauty in scenes where she makes him happy and when she's depressed, she can appear cold and detached. The film has some issues with structure and continuity. It's not hard to follow, but it's hard to catch all the time shifts because the transitions are always so quick. Toward the end, as Allen and this film search for a deeper meaning, the film only seems to get more surreal and downright existential. You get the sense that Allen knows exactly what he's attempting to make you consider, but it's not cathartic in any way.It's interesting, because at one point in the film Sandy is taking questions from attendees of the film festival and one woman asks for his reaction to claims about him being narcissistic. Though his answer comical, Allen, presumably with a cinematic chance to defend his actual self, never denies the allegations. The question then remains for viewers of his films, especially "Stardust Memories," whether Allen's stories can be identified with, can be accessible to a large audience. His success suggests yes and his lower points in his career suggest no, but Allen knows this is how he makes films, this is how he searches for meaning and he will continue to do so.
Since the Golden Age of comic books, folks have been imagining what it would be like if ordinary people came across extraordinary power. But not until 2012 with "Chronicle" has anyone truly attempted to capture this notion with a sense of realism. Josh Trank and Max Landis have done just that with their low-budget found-footage take on superpower archetypes.Found footage has exploded in the last 10 years. "The Blair Witch Project" just scratched the surface of the storytelling method's appeal toward the general public as well as the medium's secret ability to convince people that because it looks real, we for some reason must psychologically react to it as if it's real.Creating the illusion is about more than using lesser-quality lenses, however. At just 26 years old, Landis and Trank understand today's teens better than anyone making wide-release Hollywood movies right now. The trio at the film's center gets it too, and it results in some believable characters who react to developing telekinetic superpowers in ways you'd expect teenagers to: pranks, general tomfoolery and showing off.Although three teenagers come across this power, the story belongs to Andrew (Dane DeHaan), a loner who gets bullied at school in addition to a depressing home life that includes a deathly ill mother and an abusive father. He begins recording his life as if to document his misery (not a stretch considering the number of personal YouTube channels out there), and this serves as our only window into the story.After his cousin Matt (Alex Russell) convinces him to come to a barn rave (kids these days), Andrew, Matt and Matt's friend Steve (Michael B. Jordan), the most popular kid in his class, discover a hole in the ground. Upon exploring it underground, they find some kind of alien object, and the next thing we know they have telekinetic abilities, powers that grow stronger over time.The boys' newfound strength forges a secret bond between them, and Andrew has friends for the first time. He even uncovers some popularitya loner's fantasy realized. But Andrew is also emotionally volatile. Unlike his friends, he lacks control over his life, and after an incident in which he pushes a car off the road and into a pond, things change drastically, both in the story and in the tone of the film.For a good chunk of the movie, Trank and Landis use their unique premise to explore how one's use of power and control can be dictated by personality, emotional wellness and social status. In no other phase of life do these feelings wield greater emotional consequences than in one's teenage years.As much as you want to believe Andrew can step back and look at things logically and communicate feelings rather than bottle them up (as Matt and Steve so often try to get him to do), you know he's going to pop at some point. Fascinatingly, he is both our main character and our source of antagonism in the story and it actually works. The film plays tug of war between sympathy and outrage at how Andrew handles his situation to keep the audience riveted.What happens next can only be described as gutsy. Things take a dark and chaotic turn and the scope of the story goes beyond what found-footage movies ought to do. The story remains gripping enough to keep us invested in the outcome, but it's a wild, wild ride that might lose some viewers in the process.The found footage gets tough for Trank to keep up in this final act, and it makes one question why it was necessary at all. Security cameras, cell phones and other people's assorted recording devices document this part of the story because the original documenter is off driving film's course of events, yet it's all perfectly edited together. "Found footage" would seem to imply the importance of the story being documented in a realistic manner, but that's not the case with "Chronicle." The medium appears to be utilized here solely for that authenticated look and to allow us access to personal moments for the characters. As such, Landis' biggest challenge as a writer had to be making up excuses for the camera to be in the right place at the right time.As striking and powerful as the climax of "Chronicle" is, it blows the door way too wide open. What began as such an intimate story to start finishes like a blockbuster. An exciting finish to be sure (on $11 million especially), but one with a cognizant disregard for the tone of the earlier acts of the movie. It's not a disappointment, but it could have concluded more meaningfully if done on a smaller scale.Especially when you consider that it's a rookie effort on multiple counts, "Chronicle" impresses with its unique riff on super stories. It also proves that a $200-million budget is not a prerequisite to making a movie about people with extraordinary powers. Considering it probes deeper into human psychology and power dynamics than those studio tent-poles, maybe those franchises need to take a good hard look at themselves.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Noah Baumbach ("The Squid and the Whale") films are always difficult. The concept of going to the movies for the sake of escapism is lost on him. If anyone tried harder to make real life into a movie, they'd have to compete with Baumbach. If anyone tried to make a film where dialogue is king, they'd have to compete with Quentin Tarantino -- and Baumbach. "Greenberg" is certainly one of his better films, but the casual viewer can only enjoy it to a point."Greenberg" stars Ben Stiller in the title role as one of the most realistically complex characters in a film in years. Baumbach and writer/producer/actress Jennifer Jason Leigh have built a character with tons of idiosyncrasies and complexes and some how a comedian in Stiller manages to bring them all to life in convincing fashion. Both he and costar Greta Gerwig as Florence have fascinatingly real characters with diagnosable problems and that's the chief strength of the film.Roger Greenberg is 40 and telling himself he's going to do nothing for awhile. He's just gotten out of some form of a mental hospital, which learn before we even meet him, so as to (brilliantly) make the audience think "well, he's just got problems" instead of meeting him head on. While his wealthy brother is vacationing in Vietnam, he moves from New York to LA to live there. He meets Florence, his brother's family's personal assistant, a 26-year-old always thinking of others and not allowing herself to grab a foothold on life.Greenberg is a backseat driver, he writes sophomoric complaint letters to companies, he's slightly impulsive yet he likes to step back quickly and reevaluate when he detects something is wrong. Most human of all, he deflects scrutiny and makes a lot of excuses sometimes irrelevant to his arguments -- and he was in a band with friends that he broke apart because he didn't want to accept their first record deal. That little bit possibly motivates this entire film.Like most Baumbach films, this one is about more distorted lines of communication and never realizing quite what you want from life because what you want, what you once wanted and what you say you want are never the same. Greenberg's cross-country move is a huge perspective change, which begins his slowly unraveling epiphany. The trouble is that Baumbach builds this film (and others of his) on character realization. There are some dramatic plot points, but mostly to create more dialogue for his characters. It's a movie that really doesn't allow you to process it naturally. You have to actively try to analyze these characters in the midst of being impressed by how lifelike they are. Everyone knows a person with at least one characteristic akin to Greenberg or Florence.No matter how much sinks in, everyone who watched "Greenberg" will be impressed by Stiller and waiting to see where Gerwig shows up next. Super-realism might not make the best movies, but that being the goal in a sense, Baumbach's effort certainly deserves to be commended.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"Predator" boasts a few unique claims, one being that it's the only movie to feature two US governors. The "Jaws" and "Alien"-inspired monster attack film also gave birth to one of the most original creatures we've ever seen instead relying on aliens or dangerous animals. But most of all, it's the ability of "Predator" to deliver entertainment on bare-bones plot structure.Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in director John McTiernan's breakthrough action thriller about a team of commandos on a hostage rescue mission in a Central American jungle who on their way back find themselves being hunted one-by-one by some extra-terrestrial hunter with stealth armor. The beauty of "Predator" is that's all for the plot. No sub-plots, no character development, nothing -- just gunfire and guts. Only occasionally does a mindless film like this one come along, recognize that its mindless, and just execute "entertaining" right down to its very definition.The cast is completely talentless, but Schwarzenegger appears to have finely honed his ability to be an action star without distracting us with a thick accent. His recognizability at this point in his career is enough to like him in the film. Jesse Venture adds a bit of variety to the cast and makes for a nice fun fact many years later.It would be one thing if there was no good reason for "Predator" to be devoid of everything but spine, but an alien with hunting gear and dreadlocks killing commandos for good sport needs nothing but some clever action sequences and effective suspense. Like "Alien," we don't see the Predator in full until way into the movie and that's half the excitement necessary to enjoy it.Other movies try and give us back story, romance and clever twists when they aren't capable of delivering them well. "Predator" says "you want blood and aliens but not the same old presentation? You got it." Good film-making has never been simpler. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
James Bond is back and better than ever in "From Russia with Love." OK, so that's not exactly saying much seeing as the film is only Bond's second outing, but "From Russia with Love" is a considerable improvement on all fronts from "Dr. No." This sequel takes more time to develop its characters, utilizes greater levels of suspense, places Bond on a bigger stage and much more.What's all the more impressive in this major step toward forging Ian Fleming's James Bond character's film legacy is the way it recognizes its own iconography and winning formula. Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman understood just what made their first film special: the music, the women, the larger-than-life bad guys  even the fact that Bond gets tailed from the airport as he did in the first film. Repeating and boosting those winning factors would make it hard for anyone who didn't know the release order of the "Bond" films to know that "From Russia with Love" was only the second film. It feels less like a franchise finding its legs and more like one that's carefully honed its craft."From Russia with Love" has much more of an espionage flavor than "Dr. No." MI6 sends Bond to Istanbul in hopes of getting its hands on a Lektor decoding device from the Soviets, but we know this is part of the plan of the shadowy SPECTRE organization to get its hands on the decoder while also paying Bond back for the demise of its colleague, Dr. No. The mysterious cat-petting No. 1 along with ex-KGB agent No. 3 (Lotte Lenya) and chess champion No. 5 (Vladek Sheybal) put their scheme into action, which involves recruiting the beautiful Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi) to seduce Bond and feed him false information. Bond and MI6 know the likelihood that they could be walking into a trap, so he's armed with a handy suitcase gadget and sent to meet MI6 associate Kerim Bey (Pedro Amendariz) in Istanbul.All the supporting characters have more meat to them and present either a comparable physical/mental challenge or possess a similar intellect to Bond. Bianchi as a Bond girl is equally stunning compared to Ursula Andress, but she's not some helpless shell collector forced into the middle of the fray, she's playing him falsethough admittedly her motives lack anything sinister because she thinks she's working for her country and she's like putty in Bond's arms. Amendariz plays the helper character, the one with the resources who risks his life to help Bond. He has wits about him and some skill and motivation unlike the boatman in "Dr. No." Then there's Bond's first physical challenge in the brick wall that is SPECTRE agent Grant (Robert Shaw). No. 3, Rosa Klebb, is a peculiar addition, but as an evil female character who is not a femme fatale, offers a nice change of stereotype.Suspense is much more wieldy in "FRWL," and director Terence Young has found a really good handle on how to keep things interesting. The script moves quickly, which helps as well, with shorter scenes all ending in something memorable whether a death or a fight or a reveal that something's amiss. The action scenes are excellent in terms of variety and intensity, from more intense fist fights on a train to a boat chase to an obvious homage to Alfred Hitchcock's "North by Northwest." If they were going to steal from any filmmaker, it should be Hitchcock."FRWL" as one of nearly 25 "Bond" films is very good, but as a correction to "Dr. No," it's brilliant. It's really the first great "Bond" movie and would serve as a better first in the series to anyone needing an introduction to the franchise (who wants to save the really good stuff for later).~Steven CThanks for reading!

"The Wicker Man" is a peculiar little film. It begins as a typical mystery: a Scottish detective travels to a remote Island off Scotland's coast where he is to investigate a report of a missing girl. Then the film mutates into a musical of sorts with numerous shots of topless women. Then it becomes a mystery again, this time fueled by religious beliefs. Undoubtedly paganism was an eye-opening concept in 1973 and while it doesn't completely translate in terms of effectiveness today, it presents an interesting theistic argument and lays the groundwork for a number of future thrillers that would employ similar twists.Edward Woodward stars as the police officer investigating into the missing girl, which is suspicious right off the bat. "The Wicker Man" is not particularly good at hiding the vital clues to the film's mystery, but then again this is thirty-some years and consequently more experience with the thriller genre talking. Presumably the rites and rituals of pagan culture mystified and perplexed people a bit more back then. Anyway, as he starts to look into the mystery the landlord's daughter (Britt Eckland) attempts to seduce him and the Summer Isle's lack of sexual censorship becomes 'celebrated' in the film.At first, "The Wicker Man" appears to attack the God-fearing Christian. Sgt. Howie, the detective, is outraged at the lack of Christian morality on the island. He can't believe that the church is no longer a church and that no priest or minister exists. His ignorance is laughable in a modern context, making his character a bit despicable. It is a film not kind to Christianity or at the least Christians who choose to remain ignorant about faiths that do not believe in Jesus Christ and are appalled that someone can practice them.Eventually that concept evolves. It still remains a film thematically based in religion, but Anthony Shaffer's story suggests that we not be so quick to pass judgment on those who believe differently and hold different moral standards than ourselves. The moral guidelines that different groups of people follow are not clear-cut; right and wrong is not so black and white. In that sense "The Wicker Man" is a brave film despite its flaws.It would be wrong to classify "The Wicker Man" as horror. It is a thriller with non-traditional religious themes that seem cultish and mysterious. It is a mystery that despite not being the most elaborate and impressive of story lines, is nonetheless unique and highly memorable. Undoubtedly anyone that sees this film will remember its final act, culminating in the burning of the wicker man.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
Introducing the first modern bicycle action movie, "Premium Rush." Considering how Hollywood action movies offer chase scenes at a relentless rate, it's a wonder how no one thought to focus on bicycles. Writer/director David Koepp saw this opportunity to present something fresh and pounced on it, and he was also fortunate to nab one of the biggest new stars around in Joseph Gordon-Levitt to legitimize his project.In terms of story, "Premium Rush" is bland, vapid and seemingly arbitrary, but it does a better job of masquerading as clever and original than other films about which you could say the same. Primarily, there's a different energy and feel to biking sequences than there would be if the characters all drove fast cars.Wilee (Gordon-Levitt) is an NYC bike messenger who lives life on the edge. He rides fixed gear and refuses to have brakes because in his eyes, that's more dangerous. After receiving an envelope that must be delivered premium rush from a college campus to Chinatown, he's approached by a man named Robert Monday (Michael Shannon) who attempts to intercept it. Monday turns out to be a dirty cop who will stop at nothing to get what's inside, so he chases Wilee through Manhattan.All taking place in the span of four hours, Koepp tries to make the story edgier by going back in time earlier that day to follow Wilee, Monday and the person who gave Wilee the envelope, Nima (Jamie Chung), as a way of revealing the envelope's contents and why they matter. Normally this is a great alternative to characters explaining what's going on through dialogue, but in a movie showcasing bike stunts, it's a pace killer."Premium Rush" is at its best on the bicycle seat, using a ton of vehicle rigs to capture the chase shots and creating stylistic enhancements with CGI including mapping graphics for transitions in location and a pre-visualization of the snap judgments Wilee must make on his bike to avoid getting hit by cars. All the bike scenes offer a little something different, capped off by stunt-laden getaway from a vehicle impound. Honestly, who knew a bicycle movie could be this fun?Gordon-Levitt helps with the cool factor a great deal. He has to play an extremely confident and borderline macho character in Wilee and he pushes himself there, but when things get intense he shines the most. Great action heroes do a good job of expressing a sense of fear when their survival is uncertain while maintaining a strong physical presence. Gordon-Levitt has gotten pretty good at this technique, which is so important in implying the stakes of a situation and planting a seed of doubt in the audience's mind as to whether things will go okay. The final outcome if done right is added suspense, and even with a pedestrian story, "Premium Rush" has a decent amount of it.Shannon gets to ham it up as Monday, but that's his specialty; he makes it so convincing when his characters blow up. Most of the time he comes off as ridiculous, but there are enough occasional moments of great acting that convey some kind of depth to his character and solidify the intensity of his game of cat-and-mouse with Wilee.The other characters, such as Wilee's biker girlfriend (Dania Ramirez) and his rival bike messenger (Sean Kennedy) are total stock. They service the plot and nothing else even though Koepp tries to wedge in a poorly imagined romantic subplot between the three of them."Premium Rush" tries to be funny and falls flat too often, but it tries enough that it communicates a carefree attitude and lack of self-seriousness that a movie about bike messengers probably needs to have. The most underrated aspect of the movie is how often drivers, pedestrians and other extras get ticked off by Wilee weaving through traffic, blowing through red lights and going the wrong way down a one way street. Action movies almost never stop to consider this because their filmmakers are too concerned with distracting from the suspense of the sequence, but here it adds authenticity and a little bit of subtle humor.So when it doesn't take a time out to expound on the story, "Premium Rush" is a well-paced, kinetic movie experience that deserves some added kudos for going green and changing the paradigm of the chase sequence, even if its only at the surface level. At the very least, you might be inspired to take up biking more often.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
The Charles Dickens classic "Great Expectations" could not have been in better hands than David Lean's. Though his later works would be the ones to earn him accolades, this film is just as special. Few directors can make a film feel grandiose while still paying close attention to the details like Lean. "Great Expectations" is a film with as much power on-screen as the literary classic it came from. It also calls attention to what's between the lines of Dickens' pages.It helps that the "Great Expectations" is a classic story: a young common boy who aspires to be a wealthy gentleman; a strange old woman who stays in doors and lives with her beautiful young daughter; a mysterious benefactor --all unique twists on conventional archetypes. The young Pip is a likable lad with a strong inclination for good who meets the old Miss Havisham and her daughter Estella who change his world view forever.Lean's choice of black and white is the first stroke of brilliance with this film. That's simply the kind of story that "Great Expectations" is. Nothing to do with being an old novel, but when you think of the dark, shadowy mansion of Miss Havisham and the beginning scenes in the Church graveyard, light and dark is huge metaphor in Dickens' story and there's no better way to establish that contrast than use of black and white.Then there's the suspense and intrigue Lean brings to this story. The shadows and howling winds are just part of what makes this such an interesting film. Boiled down, the story of Pip becoming a gentleman is driven by the mystery of who his benefactor is (and partially what will become of his love for Estella). Without a lot of explicit conflict, that puts a lot of responsibility on Lean and needless to say he delivers. He increases tension at key scenes to drive up our interest and picks a few intensely compelling shots at crucial moments. He demonstrates an exceptional understanding of Dickens' text.Topping off the film are its memorable characters. Top-notch performances from John MIlls as 20-year-old Pip, Alec Guinness as his friend Herbert Pocket and some terrific character roles: Martita Hunt as Miss Havisham and Freda Jackson as the story's lovable simpleton, Mr. Joe Dargery. Each character represents something substantial in a Dickens story and it's abundantly clear in this sterling adaptation.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
In the tradition of "Scarface," "Blow" is a rise-and-fall or rags-to-riches of a notorious drug dealer story. Though George Jung was never poor, his seemingly implausible quick shot to the top of the American drug market with first marijuana and then cocaine is indicative that he was simply nothing without the drugs. But unlike Tony Montana, George Jung is a much more enigmatic main character. It's hard to understand his motivations for what he does or the reasons he risks everything to continue his work. That's part of what makes "Blow" compelling but it's also part of what holds it back from becoming a truly compelling biography."Blow" starts from the beginning, showing George's relationship with his father (Ray Liotta) and then goes right away into George's introduction to marijuana on the California coast where he's played by Johnny Depp, whose versatility continues to amaze in this role. We don't fully grasp his depiction of George, but we see some very human moments that are easy to latch on to because he's so talented. The film then continues to go through George's life as he becomes a key player in drug smuggling and finds quite a bit of success for himself which of course is followed by some jail time and then the cycle repeats.There's nothing revelatory about the drug business in Ted Demme's film, it's more his character that makes it unique. People double-cross each other, it's dangerous, there are beautiful women involved ... nothing surprising. The difference is that George doesn't ever seem inherently bad and this is Demme's intention and it works. Normally we want to associate a drug dealer with corruption and a twisted sense of morality, but George is just an ambitious guy hoping to make a lot of money with no care about the consequences. You want him to answer for his illegal activities but your gut doesn't give you a good explanation for why. George's ideas about life eventually get tested, especially later in the film when a wife (Penelope Cruz) and child come into the picture, but otherwise the reason "Blow" can argue it's not another drug film is because it doesn't claim to say what's right or wrong about illegal drug trafficking.It's the film's best characteristic, but it also keeps it from leaving a distinct impression. There's just not enough freshness to the subject and despite being based on a true story, George isn't that fascinating of a character. If you like slightly more complex crime dramas where mystery and suspense are not the primary vehicles of entertainment (or in this case complete non-factors), "Blow" will offer what few other films do.
Liam Neeson's action-man renaissance in 2008's "Taken" was a most unheralded critical and box-office hit for a seemingly generic revenge flick. Writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen managed to captivate audiences with a streamlined story of a retired CIA operative using his skills to locate and rescue his kidnapped daughter. It was a simple concept in that it utilized family bonds as motivation, but it was made exciting through a mixture of intriguing resourcefulness and crafty violence. Everything about the story of "Taken" was so concrete, that there didn't seem like any obvious direction for a sequel, but a gross of $226.8 million on a $25-million budget talks, and so we have "Taken 2," but what Besson and Kamen have come up with this time fails to measure up to the original in almost every way.This shouldn't surprise anyone considering, again, no justification existed in the original story for a sequel. Kim (Maggie Grace) couldn't just get taken again, and part of the intrigue was Mills (Neeson) having to find her despite being hours behind her captors with no idea of where they might take her. In "Taken 2," it's not as complicated and the stakes don't feel nearly as high.Simply, the Albanians that Mills killed en route to finding his daughter want revenge, so they track him to one of his private security jobs in Istanbul. As it happens, Kim and her mother, Lenore (Famke Janssen), decide to surprise him by flying to meet him there, though to be fair it's not that obnoxious of a coincidence, as Mills had invited them to come after hearing Lenore's current husband had canceled their family trip to China.During their first full day together in Istanbul, Kim gets the idea to let Bryan and Lenore have some alone time in hopes of rekindling their relationship, but when they go into town they are followed by the Albanians, and despite Mills' best efforts, he and Lenore are taken.The entire setup here is forced  really forced. It feels as though every single plot point or detail exists solely to create circumstances in which our main characters can get kidnapped, with ample occurrences both inconvenient and convenient to allow for problems and general suspense while also providing enough room for a solution.We already know what Mills is willing to do for his family, so his motivation is identical to the first film, plus we know he's too skilled to stay kidnapped for long. What's required to compensate for not raising the stakes in terms of both motivation and danger is substantially more creativity, and that's where Besson and Kamen really come up dry.There's one scene early on (as in once the film gets going early on) in which Mills uses Kim to help pinpoint his location in the city, instructing her to set off grenades so he can figure out how far away she is by how long it takes for him to hear the blast. It's just a tease that the film might reach its predecessor's level, however, as the ingenuity never gets any more exciting than that.Director Olivier Megaton, a frequent Besson collaborator, takes over for Pierre Morel, and does nothing to help nor hurt the picture. His style is a bit more frenetic as he heavily edits the action sequences to the point where you don't get more than a second and a half at any one camera angle, but that's not a problem so much as the film's failure through and through to prevent the audience's indifference to what's going on. We were given plenty of reason to doubt Mills' success in"Taken," but this time around we haven't a shred. There's a moment in which we think something might take a surprisingly darker turn, but it's over in a flash.The script also attempts to be a bit more theme-driven than the first film, whether just because or in effort to compensate for its pointlessness. The father of one of the Albanians Mills killed (the infamous Marco from Tripoja), the "main bad guy" played by Rade Serbedzija, has a few conversations with Mills about taking the lives of family members and when revenge is or isn't justified. It's legitimate notion, but a bit out of place; we're asked to consider the feelings of the random European thugs who we normally see as killing fodder for our action movies. We don't care if you're someone's son  you're a tattooed meathead who deserves to be offed if for nothing but our amusement."Taken 2″ isn't offensively bad, just uninspired and unable to make the case for its existence. At 91 minutes, it's a harmless exercise in generic action filmmaking aimed at placating the folks who clamored to see more of one man's particular set of skills, even if they're the exact same skills applied in a less-than-spectacular manner.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Fargo" is one of those crime films that doesn't actual attempt to mislead you anywhere. It doesn't need to rely on Hollywood twists and that's the look of a truly great story.The film follows the consequences of William H. Macy's character Jerry's choice to hire two men to kidnap his wife so he can pay off other debts. The plot is simply how this spins out of control and turns into something tragic.Balancing out the tragedy is the simply yet wonderful character of Marge, the pregnant policewoman played by Frances McDormand. She has no dramatic dialogue or scenes that demand a great deal, but she plays her character with such charm and simplicity that she is easily the most likable character in the film. Thematically, it seems as if Marge is representative of honor and hope in how she does her duty with the former and symbolically in her pregnancy for the latter.The Coen brothers create an aura around this film that seems somewhat contradictory but effective. The snow gives it a distinct feel of innocence, but the blood taints it. You feel like with all the violence, your heart should be racing, but the Coen brothers have shot the film in a way that it simply builds interest and/or concern for the characters in the film. The setting is very subtly of great importance."Fargo," simply put, is probably one of the greatest tragedies of the modern era, almost Shakespearian in a way in how it probes the mind by showing simple people in a difficult situation.
Nostalgia. Now that's a word not uncommon around a Woody Allen picture. His films have always oozed of it, and now that his filmmaking legacy spans more than 40 years, to some people, an Allen film equates to it. "Midnight in Paris" falls under both categories. Remarkably, only Woody has been able to riff on the same themes, characters, ideas, etc. for decades and manage to still churn out thoughtful, funny and heartwarming pictures (when making a comedy, of course, not one of his tragedies). Perhaps "Midnight in Paris" derives its warranted praise and acclaim merely for freshly emulating Allen's beloved past work. Call him a cheater if you like for simply whipping up a new modern context for the same shtick, but "Midnight in Paris" could charm a tweed jacket and thick-rimmed spectacles onto almost anyone.A breezy summer romance, "Midnight in Paris" hearkens back to Allen's work in the early-to- mid '80s with films such as "Stardust Memories" and "The Purple Rose of Cairo." His trademark "intellectual" dialogue functions in the capacity of what purpose it serves rather than a need to understand what it means, and with exception of main character Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), all the supporting cast members are role players in this fairy tale of sorts rather than complex multi-subplot characters.Gil Pender is your typical Allen-would've-played-him-had-this-been-30-years-ago protagonist, a screenwriter manufacturing soulless Hollywood material who hopes that his planned novel will benefit inspirationally from a city that has moved so many great artists before him  Paris. He travels with his fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams), who yearns to learn from Paris the more practical way and criticizes Gil's lack of sociability. While Inez spends her days learning Paris from uber-intellectual Paul (Michael Sheen), a caricature of Allen's most pretentious characters, Gil takes to the streets at night for an intangible inspiration. What he finds in Paris after midnight changes everything, including an alluring young French woman named Adriana (Marion Cotillard).The only character other than Gil to receive any attention is the city herself. Paris takes on this amorphous identity as defined by the characters who perceive it. For Gil, Paris is magic, and as such that's what it becomes for the viewer. As we later come to learn, a city's ability to cradle the history of its impermanent people and absorb their stories is what constructs its aura. This geographical timelessness evokes the emotions of those who seek inspiration from something greater than themselves.Without diving into the details of Gil's late-night adventures, Gil does learn something that challenges his desire to cling to nostalgia. The challenge of any great writer or artist is to capture and express the uncomfortable, troubling and intangible void that is the present. To keep things simple in making this point, the other characters serve to magnify Gil's journey to enlightenment. Even, Inez, who we expect more from considering McAdams' ability to turn fluff into substance, becomes a deplorable and one-sided character quite rapidly. But despite Inez being written so harshly, she does help convey the fairy tale feel of the film, which Allen clearly aimed for and struck the bullseye.There's definitely a sense that Allen purposefully sidestepped any serious drama or consequences for Gil's actions or those of anyone in the film, frankly. Knowing Allen's capability to add an a powerful gravity to relationship conflict, it's surprising he chooses to exercise none of it when the film could've been better for it or at least his ideas more resonant. Instead, he chooses to let the story float about as this postcard from Paris, one signed with love and addressed to his fans, those who've pined to recapture the Woody of old. Yet with impeccable self-awareness as usual, the great filmmaker adds a postscript in the form of a thematic reminder that dwelling in the past constitutes nothing but an escape unless we use it to understand and empower our present. That, of course, is what Woody's done with "Midnight in Paris."~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
The Coen brothers have delivered some of the most challenging films of  the last few years, ever since winning Oscar glory for contemporary  Western "No Country for Old Men." The Coens' remake of the 1969 film  (or as some would say, the second adaptation of the Charles Portis  novel) "True Grit" does constitute as a bit of a departure for the duo  in terms of cerebral thematic storytelling, but as filmmakers, "Grit"  serves as yet another affecting and above-average entry to the  brothers' canon.  "True Grit" easily deserves a place as one of the greatest modern  depictions of a classic Western. Certainly there have not been many,  but the Coens' film possesses more maturity, natural humor and  emotional impact than most films period. The genre tag of "Western" in  some ways comes merely as happenstance; "True Grit" would receive  sterling marks as any type of film with such consummate storytelling.  Newcomer Hailee Steinfeld stars as Mattie Ross, a 14-year-old with  maturity and intelligence well beyond her years determined to seek and  apprehend her father's killer, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). She seeks the  assistance of a veteran marshal with some questionable morals named  Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), who she's been told is a man of "true  grit." Mattie impressively twists Rooster's arm into leading her on an  expedition into Choctaw territory to hunt Chaney. Though he plans to go  it alone, the tenacious Mattie insists upon accompanying him.  The story of "True Grit" clearly thrives on their unlikely  relationship. Even the whip-smart Mattie must inevitably converge with  a loss of innocence on so harrowing a journey and Cogburn's shoot-first  attitude gets challenged by his new caretaker responsibilities. Matt  Damon's Texas Ranger LaBoeuf also adds a nice third dynamic to the  ensemble floating in and out of the action, but he also serves as a key  piece in Rooster and Mattie's ever-changing relationship.  Steinfeld goes toe-to-toe with Bridges like you wouldn't believe.  Although the old-timey dialogue the Coens use makes about everyone in  the film out to be a robot at one time or another, Steinfeld, in trying  to play a smart kid who thinks she knows best, exudes a slight naivety  that's simply perfect for the bravado of Mattie. Bridges gives a  performance tons more memorable than his Oscar-winning one in "Crazy  Heart." That film might have earned him the hardware, but Cogburn is  far more emblematic of his prowess as an actor. As with "The Big  Lebowski," it seems the Coens bring out the very best in the old-timer.  He's hysterical as the stubborn old sharpshooter with a penchant for  whiskey drinking. Cogburn fits his "take nothing too seriously" style  as a person and actor, but by no means does it hamper his ability to  dial up the seriousness needed to make "True Grit" a cutthroat Western.  Yet the humor above all else resonates in "True Grit." The climactic  events provide the necessary gravity and intensity to make the film  feel epic, but the Coens' true stamp here comes with the humor. So  organic at times, you have to wonder whether the Coens intended the  film to be so funny, but you appreciate it regardless. They write  characters and situations so pitch perfectly that a grin constantly  slips across your face throughout this film, especially as Mattie  verbally outsmarts every adult that the movie introduces.  Bottom line, the Coens set out to make a Western and their finished  project delivers it in terms of scope and drama. They brand it with a  cheeky and slightly irreverent humor that only they seem to know the  recipe for, but with exception of Cogburn's jumbled speech all  audiences will find it accessible. That's the trouble with the Coens:  most audiences don't operate on their wavelength, but as "True Grit"  continues to become one of their most financially successful films, the  finished product provides all the evidence as to why.  So where the Coen brothers have taken a step back in intellectually  rich filmmaking for the sake of connecting with a wider audience, I for  one will not lament the sacrifice given that "True Grit" embodies many  of the great trademark qualities of their films regardless. No sweeter  victory can come for a filmmaker when great critical reception meets  high popularity. More so when the finished product casts a recognizable  reflection of its maker.  ~Steven C
The first "Night at the Museum" worked despite conventions for a few reasons, but the main one was that it eased into its premise of museum exhibits coming to life and didn't take it for granted like "Night of the Museum 2: Battle of the Smithsonian" does. I'm actually surprised the writers of the first film wrote this sequel, because Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant handle these characters like they're someone else's creation and they can butcher them all they want. "Night at the Museum 2" sucks the magic out of the original and overdoses on characters as well as meandering sarcasm and awkward humor. Save some bright spots in character acting from a delightful and plucky Amy Adams and some bright spots from Hank Azaria and Christopher Guest, "Smithsonian" will disappoint most defenders of the first film -- except kids and anyone else who'll bite on an outrageous premise.Ben Stiller stars again as Larry Daley, only our beloved night security guard has randomly become a mastermind of As Seen on TV products. That decision alone completely destroys the continuity between this film and the last, forcing Larry's story to be something totally different than the single dad trying to be a role model for his son. Now son is hacking into the Smithsonian Institute floor plans to direct his dad to the location of the tablet that brings things to life at night. See the Museum of Natural History is going digital and all the beloved characters of the first film are shipped to the national archives in DC, only that naughty monkey brought the tablet with him and so the Smithsonian has come to life.Our source of conflict is the Pharaoh at the Smithsonian, Kahmunrah, played by Azaria doing his best Stewie Griffin impression, who wants the tablet to unleash his army, so he gets help from Napoleon, Ivan the Terrible (Guest) and young Al Capone. At least director Shawn Levy realized the asset they had in Azaria and had him voice a couple other key statues that come to life later on. Azaria's too good for this film, really, but he plays at its level instead of pushing it and even manages a few of the better laughs when he puts a major diss on Darth Vader.Then there's Amy Adams, the lone diamond in a sea of forced comedy and excessive cameos. It might seem like loving Adams is the "it" thing, but she brings the imaginative spirit sorely lacking in the film as Amelia Earheart. Every time she speaks it literally feels like the film gets more believable because she's such a convincing spirit. She also gets to work her best Katherine Hepburn impression to boot.But "Smithsonian" is more defined by its disappointments and synthetic sequel material. Lennon and Garant try and include too many characters between the old ones and the new ones and the film just feels chaotic. It's like a contest to see how many new ideas of different things they can bring to life from paintings and photos on the wall to historical monuments in DC. Worst of all, it's completely rushed. Understood that we get the coming-to-life premise and we aren't going to be surprised by it, but they take all the fun out of it. Levy figures a shot a piece of the statues of Amelia and Bill Hader's Col. Custer are adequate foreshadow, but they're not. Daley just cons his way into the archives and the story rockets right into the Smithsonian with a few quick facts about what it is to provide context."Night at the Museum 2" does just about everything we used to be terrified of sequels doing in the '90s -- overdoing it and diverting from the core values that won some love for the original because that film wasn't just about things coming to life.~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.com
Pixar has taken the animation genre literally to infinity and beyond in the 15 years since "Toy Story" first changed the game forever. So when the ground-breaking production company decided to return to an old friend in 2010 after three straight years of cutting-edge family film-making, you had to know there was a compelling reason to go back to the toys that wasn't merely monetary. Normally any movie title with a "3" next to it is a warning sign, but not a Pixar film. "Toy Story 3" is every bit imaginative, ingenious, funny and heartwarming as not only its predecessors but also every other animated film out there.I don't cry at movies -- ever -- but three films in the last three years have pushed my tear ducts to their limits: "WALL*E," "Up" and now "Toy Story 3." Sure, the first "Toy Story" came out when I was still playing with toys, so the nostalgia and attachment factor played a part in my love of this movie as it will for many, but on its own, "Toy Story 3" is every bit as intelligent on its own as the Oscar-winning Pixar films of the last two years.There's no denying the film is cluttered with too many toys we barely get to know and that certain plot elements (namely that relate to the film's antagonism) are rushed, but the film stays unwaveringly true to its heart and message as all Pixar films and great family films do. Kids won't be able to pick up on the toys' existential contemplation as expressed by their desire to be "played with" and the feeling of loss and rejection at Andy's going to college, but the humor and physical adventure is right in their wheelhouse.This final (in all likelihood but not sealed off) story takes the toys to Sunnyside Daycare after they are mistaken for trash when Andy intended them to go in the attic now that he's moving out. What a perfect locale for introducing new characters and giving the toys an opportunity to finally be played with again. Of course it's not long before they realize not everything is "sunny" at the daycare as they've been relegated to the youngest kids for whom they're not age appropriate and consequently end up broken and covered in paint. The toys at Sunnyside also have their own chain of authority that begins with Lots-o-Huggin' bear (Ned Beatty) and includes Ken (Michael Keaton) as well as many others.Woody (Tom Hanks) finds himself separated from the gang because, like always, no one believes him that Andy didn't intend to throw them out. After a side venture to a little girl's house and some more characters like Mr. Pricklepants the thespian hedgehog (Timothy Dalton) and the triceratops Trixie (Kristen Schaal of "Flight of the Conchords"), the daring Woody must return to Sunnyside and rescue his friends.The elaborate plan to escape Mission Impossible-style from Sunnyside is Pixar writing at its finest and where the movie really earns its points as far as entertainment goes, especially for those unfamiliar with the characters. Like the previous "Toy Story" films, this one also expands the scope to include the big and scary "real world" and has a sense of authentic danger, which was exactly what made the originals so captivating and thrilling."Toy Story 3" might not have the thematic power of "WALL*E" and "Up" (and those are exemplary models, so that is not a shot at this movie) but it certainly outdoes both films in terms of action and plot creativity. Now that the comparison has been made between gold and diamonds, it's time to say that "Toy Story 3" will give anyone who ever loved a toy some kind of closure with regard to that last flame of child left inside. That and there's so much darn good in this movie. From sticking together and helping others to the idea of sacrificing something you hold dear so that someone else can get that same joy from it -- it's all part of that special emotion Pixar captures every single time it embarks on a new project. It proves that touching films start with ideas about human truths. Then the geniuses like the brains at Pixar find ways to wrap clever, funny, entertaining, relatable and lovable concepts around them.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
The cycle of violence is not a subject filmmakers have ever shied away from. There are plenty of films like "City of God" that try and show such gratuitous violence that we almost become desensitized to it, we expect it. However, there is no film like "City of God" that tells this kind of story in rich, visual detail using some very compelling visual storytelling techniques.The film follows a narration and chapters structure, often going back in time to explain the events of the present via the film's narrator, the main character named Rocket, a boy from Cidade de Deus, a slum project in Rio de Janeiro. Rocket has many friends and acquaintances tied to the drug trade and/or people who steal and sometimes kill. While he doesn't do it himself, he's close enough to give us the story of those who do and explain how it has affected his life.The film starts off showing how in the 60s it all began with petty crime to make money and how that escalated into some bigger crimes that had serious consequences. It shows us specifically how one character, Lil Dice, changed everything with his violent ways. Director Fernando Meirelles gives us these little explanatory stories in chapter form with actually text titles to make it clear. With so many names and characters to remember, doing this with Rocket's narration is key to making this an accessible film.In the 70s, it's now Lil Ze (Dice's new name) that rules the streets. Where the only option to making money is to work your way up Ze's chain as he owns every drug ring in the area. It's a life of incredible violence in which all of Cidade De Deus' children believe that crime and dealing is the only way to make money.But while we see all these corrupted characters, we lose sight of how Rocket, an aspiring photographer, has managed to stay out of it, proof that it doesn't have to be that way, although the prospects for change look grim.What really makes this film different is Meirelles' work visually with lighting, color, a variety of non-traditional camera techniques. There is no element of traditional drama. All the scenes are particularly short or time passes rapidly in them. They are snapshot images meant to show us as many characters and lives as possible. While violence, drug-dealing and life in a poor area are not new subject matters, its Meirelles' work that makes this film stand out as one of the best ways of doing such a film.
"Once" touts itself as a "contemporary musical," but that term doesn't quite do it justice. It is a film that is centered around and supported by its music all at the same time. The songs don't help tell the story so much as enhance it much like a soundtrack would. In that sense, "Once" is more like a brilliant pop/acoustic soundtrack with a story mixed in.The film is about a guy who lives with his dad who when he's not helping his dad fix vacuums, is out on the street playing music and at night he plays his own songs. When a girl stops by and listens their different lives become uncontrollably intermingled by their love of music, which they begin to create together.Perhaps the truly great thing about the film is that it doesn't give in to the romance story that the viewers mind is undoubtedly wrapped around. Their relationship and attraction is central to the story, yet creator John Carney finds a way to make it enjoyable while not indulging in the simple pleasures of Hollywood romance cliché. It makes the film very honest, respectable and perhaps praiseworthy while retaining a lot of charm.When it comes down to it though, the film is about the music and it is truly beautiful music for anyone that has an appreciation for acoustic pop. It does have a mildly indie sound, but it's definitely capable of being mainstream. The songs aren't only good, but they make the movie interesting - you can see the inner-monologue and the emotions when the footage is simply just of the two of them playing. What's even better is when Carney keeps the audio of the song rolling and continues the film visually. It creates some seamless transitions and shows just how much the music really acts as an appropriate soundtrack too - something that brings out the undertones in the story."Once" is a triumph of independent film and a unique venture into experimental genre. It does leave a little left to be desired and dances around some potentially dramatic moments, but we're not talking about a major studio picture, so considering the limitations I'm awfully impressed.
Rest assured if 8-year-olds were old enough to see "Ong-Bak" there would by a Muay Thai studio in every American town. Yes, Mommy, I want to vault over cars; yes, I want to jump feet-first through hoops; yes I want to beat people uperr, defend myselfwith what amounts to the strength of my elbows."Ong-Bak" is a martial arts showcase in this regard; any of the action scenes could be used as a recruitment video for the sport/art form. And then there's Tony Jaa, who aside from instantly elevating himself to modern equivalents such as Jet Li and Jackie Chan, plays a character in Ting who could teach every action hero that ever was a thing or two about humility. In fact, we could all learn a thing or two from the Buddhists.Ting lives in rural Thai village centered around a Buddhist monastery. When the head of the town's precious Buddha statue, Ong-Bak, is ripped off and stolen, Ting is tasked with heading to Bangkok to retrieve it lest the village see bad luck forever. Men have kicked ass over less.Filmmaker Prachya Prinkaew surrounds Ting with a vibrant ensemble. Ting's first order of business is to seek out his cousin, Humlae (Petchai Wongkamlao), a deceitful and shallow money-grubber of the worst kind and his little sister Muay (Pumwaree Yodkamol) with whom he runs cons. When Humlae realizes Ting could be a top prize fighter, he agrees to help Ting get the Ong-Bak back. It's currently in the possession of Komtuan, a wheelchair-bound crime lord with a tracheotomy. Although the dynamics between them could be described as cliché, this is a rather unique core cast of characters.With someone of Jaa's ability, it's not difficult to conceive of some creative action sequences and grin-inducing stunts. The smartest decision, however, is easily Prinkaew's choice to reveal Jaa's skills to us slowly, to tease his ass-kicking potential. The chase scene through Bangkok that shows off Jaa's acrobatic side gives us our first taste and leaves us hungry for what this guy can do when someone needs to be put in their place (a.k.a the floor).The fights don't disappoint either. Although they can get repetitive toward the end, Jaa provides a spectacle and the fight choreography is legit. And despite the "R" rating, "Ong- Bak" avoids getting brutally violent, instead more interested in the artistry of the fighting. The only poor technique choice is the use of the "let's see that again!" shot after Jaa does anything the film wants you to see as miraculous. This is a film, not a live sporting event, but that's not to take anything away from the cool moves they highlight. If they happened in live sports, I'd want to see them again too.The most enjoyable part of "Ong-Bak" aside from the martial arts is that the creativity is not limited to the fight choreography. Scenes like the street chase or the Thai taxi bikes chase make the film something that can be enjoyed by more than just martial arts connoisseurs.And everyone who watches "Ong-Bak" will walk away from the screen completely in awe of Tony Jaa. He's the kind of talent playing the kind of character that's impossible not to love.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
How do you not pity Richard Jenkins? He has "sorry SOB" written all over him and he uses it to much effect in "The Visitor." Although the film bases its drama around the immigration issue, it's a story about this poor widower named Walter Vale who has stopped caring about his job as a professor and has yet to restart his life, and how it all changes when he finds an immigrant couple living in his apartment."The Visitor" is a quiet film. It is straightforward and low drama 90% of the way through and everything happens as it should in reality. You think you can predict when things will turn in this film, but you're almost always wrong because clichés don't work when watching it.The only thing that could be considered cliché about the film is its use of an awkward, lonely protagonist and his unlikely relationship with the Assyrian man named Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) that he eventually invites to live with him. Their bond forms around music, specifically percussion. Walter's wife was a classical pianist, so he takes some interest in Tarek's djembe and his frigid life begins to free itself in the rhythms that push him out of his comfort zone.When Tarek runs into immigration trouble, the film starts to turn toward the dramatic as Tarek's mother Mouna (Hiam Abbass) arrives in New York out of concern for her son. She also begins to free Walter up, though in a far from cliché fashion. Even then, however, this film does its best when focusing on Walter. Jenkins is simply terrific. He's awkward, quiet, sweet and incredibly likable and he'll have your sympathy within the first five minutes. Creator Tom McCarthy, most known in Hollywood playing smaller roles -- including countless George Clooney films, follows up his directorial debut "The Station Agent" with something much more accessible to all audiences in "The Visitor" though the target demographic is distinctly older. His best work is done in quick sequence shots that have no dialog but reveal a lot about Walter. Many times days will go by instantly, but McCarthy will show you the important character-building moments: he understands what the most important part of his film is. Though the issue is very real, this is not standard drama, it's much more realistic.Hopefully the critical acclaim given to "The Visitor" will prompt McCarthy to create a film that will garner him the public attention he deserves as a director and writer. If not, there's certainly a need for plenty more little films like this one to surprise us with how poignant the mundane can be.
Advertisements for anti-depression or anti-anxiety medications are all over television, and when the announcer rattles off the two-dozen or so horrific-sounding side effects, you can't help but think about taking your chances and sticking with the depression. "Side Effects" explores the dangers of these drugs  and they go beyond the warnings on the label."Contagion" writer/director duo Scott Z. Burns and Steven Soderbergh re-team for this pharmaceutical thriller, which is much less procedural than "Contagion" and more of a typical, familiar conspiracy film with ample twists and a plot laden with intrigue. Rooney Mara stars as Emily Taylor, a 28-year-old married woman whose husband (Channing Tatum) has just been released from prison after being convicted of insider trading. Emily has a history of depression and even with the pieces of her life coming back into place, she has trouble coping. After attempting to take her own life, she enters the care of psychiatrist Jonathan Banks (Jude Law), who attempts to fit her with the right drug, but the side effects end up having a disastrous effect on her."Side Effects" begins almost as a horror film with how freaky Emily's behavior gets and the strange things she does while taking these drugs, but as the questions come flooding in, it mutates into a full-fledged mystery. Not much more should be said, but fans of traditional thrillers and mystery films will likely not be disappointed.Much of the expert pacing that made "Contagion" a strong film works even better in "Side Effects." Soderbergh is so good at adding the slightest touches to enhance the tension and the tone of a scene that he brings out the best in Burns' script, which has plenty to chew on and doesn't lack for surprises. Given the nature of the genre, you know that something's not quite right, but the script is so smartly designed that even when there's a big reveal, part of the truth is still concealed, usually in that the characters are a step ahead of the audience.Most of Soderbergh's recent films have gone overboard on big-name casting, but "Side Effects" only uses a few of the stars that have worked with him before: Tatum, Law and Catherine Zeta- Jones, who plays Emily's former psychiatrist. In a way, "Contagion" and last year's "Haywire" were hurt by an inflation of stars playing minor roles because it raised the expectations for those films considerably. "Side Effects" relies chiefly on the talents of Mara, who is still a fresh face even after "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo." She sells the part of Emily beautifully to be sure. If Soderbergh doesn't fully retire, you can bet he'll look to cast her again in the future.Law's character features prominently in the film as well, particularly in the second hour. He hasn't done much great work lately but he gets to play a terrifically written character in Banks, who starts the film in a supporting role and then is suddenly thrust into having a share of the lead. Banks develops throughout the film in a way few movie characters ever do, period.But strong characters and performances are just a bonus, as the success of "Side Effects" comes primarily from the thickness of the plot and the mystery, which at the onset appears so open- ended that not even a supernatural explanation can be ruled out. Soderbergh assures that each viewer will keep on guessing with the way he guides the story. He finds the poetic, artistic potential in even the most straightforward or mundane scenes. Screenwriters who specialize in these kinds of typical genre entries would kill to be able to recruit Soderbergh to direct their films. He's definitely capable of making greater movies than "Side Effects," but when a real professional takes on something simple, great things can happen."Side Effects" doesn't change that game as far as multi-layered thrillers, but credit to Burns for spawning such a complex story out of the simple concept of the inherent risk presented by today's medications.~Steven CThanks for reading!

When you let a child play with the same toys over and over again, you're going to end up with some stale make-believe. Tim Burton has pulled his Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter dolls out of his play chest again and decided this time they're engaged in a supernatural love story taking place in the 1970s.Like most of Burton's films, "Dark Shadows" hits on moments of gleeful peculiarity that remind us why we've been following his exploits for decades, but by and large it feels over- trodden and uninspired, and that latter adjective is not one to wield lightly against Burton to be sure.That's not to say Burton has lost a step by any means; he still does what he does better than anyone can, but his past successes have set the bar higher than he dares to even jump with "Dark Shadows." Depp plays Burton dress-up again as Barnabas Collins of the wealthy Collinses who immigrated from Liverpool and established a fishing empire in Maine. After spurning the love of the witch Angelique (Eva Green), he and his family were cursed. She turned him into a vampire, locking him in a coffin buried underground for nearly 200 years. Now, in the 1970s, he's unearthed and learns that Collins family has fallen quite a bit, so he endeavors to restore them to glory.The voice-over prologue hits us over the head with language that love is the strongest curse, begging us to care about Collins and his lost love (also cursed by Angelique). We're also then asked to take interest in the dysfunctional Collins family led by the distrustful Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her thick-headed brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) in addition to some other misfits: the rebellious daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz), troubled son (Gulliver McGrath) and his psychiatrist (Bonham Carter). Turns out that Barnabas' exploits as a vampire out of time are far more interesting than whether or not they get their act together as a family.The archaic expression of crude dialogue written for Barnabas and perfectly suited for Depp provides the chief source of entertainment in what's otherwise a campy affair that hopes you will just embrace its outlandish choices and unjustified quirkiness. It will surely remind those who've seen most of Burton's work that he is a man in love with classic B movies, not to mention Gothic appearances and odd turns of events.Although Depp brings the humor, Eva Green is the standout as Angelique, who 200 years later still desires Barnabas and has destroyed his family in the process with her own fishing empire. Green is nearly unrecognizable in the role, and despite playing the villain in a campy affair, manages to avoid chewing the scenery to pieces, which can't be over-appreciated in a script of this nature.Seth Grahame-Smith and John August take liberties with the "Dark Shadows" TV show  so I'm told. The film uses the show's concept as inspiration, but inspiration for what? It would seem that the point of adapting something with a fan base would be to honor it with some degree of loyalty. If you're just using the name, characters and basic concept, why not create something entirely original? Perhaps the film's one true crime is providing no good reason for being a "Dark Shadows" adaptation, and consequently seeming somewhat purposeless.No doubt Burton had fun making this movie. It's an excellent excuse to defy the rules of reality and borrow numerous characteristics from the films he has drawn his inspiration from over the years. It's expertly set-decorated and Colleen Atwood's costumes assure there's plenty to look at. Much of the film's big set pieces have a grandiose quality to the them, a certain fanfare, if you will, with due credit to Danny Elfman, whose scores are always so quintessential to Burton's tone. Everywhere else, however, it's hard to find intrigue or anything compelling in these characters and their dilemmas.Burton appears to channel all his energy into the aesthetic of "Dark Shadows," something that could be argued as the downfall of a lot of his other lesser works. It's as though everything rides on the script in his films, an arena he has generally avoided in terms of the creative process. If he's picked strong source material that's adapted well, the aesthetic that he brings makes his film a winner. If that core is weak, then he goes down with it. "Dark Shadows" is one of those more hollow stories and it shows.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
In the tradition of the many other Will Ferrell-Adam McKay produced comedies with a colon in the title that's focused on a quirky character, "The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard" makes a pitch for awkward humor from a wide range of messed up characters. If you're an easy sell on that kind of humor "The Goods" is worth the time, but looking at it more critically, this movie is just trying to dress up used material so it can sell it like it's new.Jeremy Piven is the latest comedian after Will Ferrel and John C. Reilly to attempt to pilot this ailing brand of comedy. Don Ready is a smooth-talking car salesman brought in to help a struggling dealership, a role that's perhaps a natural evolution (or de-evolution) for Piven's beloved "Entourage" character, Hollywood agent Ari Gold. Unlike those before him, Piven is not an "I can act so dumb it's funny" kind of guy so by no fault of his own, he fails to be the best character in his own film. He's just a hot shot stereotype ramblin' man character and that's why he's given such a large supporting cast."The Goods" overloads on whack-job character portraits. Andy Stock and Rick Stempson, writers of the straight-to-DVD colon comedy "Balls Out: Gary the Tennis Coach" starring Sean William-Scott, base their entire film around these character concepts. The plot is dumb, the events that happen are completely pointless: only the characters and the scenes written to utilize the character's comedic potential are given attention.Naturally, Ready has a crew that mostly have no tangible sales skill. There's Brent Gage (David Koechner aka Champ Kind in "Anchorman"), the quasi normal guy who exists solely so the dealership's owner Mr. Selleck (James Brolin) can make awkward homosexual advances towards him, Jibby (Ving Rhames) who's had meaningless sex all his life and wants to "make love" to a woman and Babs (Kathryn Hahn), the horny sex-appeal saleswoman who battles both her lesbian desires and her sexual crush on the Selleck's 10-year-old son stuck in a man's body (Rob Riggle).That's not even the half of them, however. The belief here is that the characters sell the comedy, so all the stops are pulled. Korean-American Ken Jeong ("The Hangover") plays a salesman named Teddy, there's a crazy old war vet (Charles Napier), a DJ with internal anger issues (Craig Robinson), the standard "normal girl love interest" in Mr. Selleck's daughter, her jerk fiancée who's actually a dork in a "man band" (Ed Helms) and more. Then of course there are cameos, after all this is a Ferrell/McKay movie.There are hits and misses among them, the hits being the out-of-nowhere jokes that get a quick laugh thanks to the depths the writers and actors are willing to go with their characters, namely in terms of inappropriateness. It's not the kind of humor that has you laughing a whole scene. That kind of situational humor is minimal. After all the plot is a bunch of crazy sales consultants come in to save a dealership from going bankrupt and having to sell to the owner's future in-laws, specifically Alan Thicke; a plot that most of us could dream up in our sleep, minus the Alan Thicke part, probably. The cleverness comes not from the story, but "how far can we take a sexual metaphor for a baseball glove."For those that find this type of comedy gets them every time, enjoy "The Goods" because this kind of humor is in the bargain bin and who knows how much longer it will last.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Ian Fleming's James Bond character's humble on-screen beginning is just that  humble. "Dr. No" is more of a mystery than an action film, so despite being the film that introduced the world to the most successful movie character of all time, it's not often considered a favorite of Bond die-hards.Yet the foundation for the Bond franchise's DNA is all here. The famous Bond theme, the opening down-the-barrel gunshot, "Bond, James Bond" the Walther PPK, banter with Moneypenny  all originated in "Dr. No." Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman honed the essence of Bond the first time through, including casting the best actor to play the role the first time in Sean Connery.Connery isn't the only thing that makes "Dr. No" work, but it's hard to imagine James Bond becoming the icon he is today without him, and more specifically, his performance in the film. That starts with the look. As Bond is a ladies man (and more than a few women get all out of sorts around him in this movie), Connery had to have a natural sex appeal and natural is the best way to describe it. Simply, he's a man's man, far from a pretty boy, and he cleans up like a boss. And while he's pretty smart and skilled, Connery adds some grit into the performance. Bond gets put through the ringer in this movie and he doesn't always look good doing it."Dr. No" introduces Bond as a playboy, but one whose duty to country calls. A fellow 00 agent who was investigating the jamming of Cape Canaveral's rocket launch signals has gone missing (permanently, a.k.a. he's dead) in Jamaica and so MI-6 sends Bond to investigate. From the moment he lands he finds he's being closely watched and everyone he tries to question won't talk. He soon collaborates with CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord) and a boatman named Quarrel, where he learns of the reclusive Dr. No and his heavily manned island of Crab Key. Bond and Quarrel travel to the island where Bond discovers the beautiful Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress), but not without finding himself a bit trapped.A good deal of "Dr. No" is slow-going, and the script relies on our curiosity about the title character in order to maintain our interest. Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) is revealed late in the game and he's worth the wait, even if we don't get nearly enough of him. Creating the mysterious aura around No is one of the best things about this movie as it set the stage for the grandiose Bond villains to come. Most of the film is steeped in reality, but once we get onto the island, we see a bit more imagination and Bond gets rightfully larger than life.Wiseman and Andress are also examples of top-notch casting decisions. Andress is absolutely magnetizing despite her character's complete and utter lack of importance to the film. She is something for Bond to do (in all senses) and something for the audience to look at (and she rocks that bikini). As much as she started the great tradition of Bond girls, she amounts to a shell-collector who found herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Oh well, it was the early '60s."Dr. No" has to be considered a wild success, however, because it introduced us to a character who clearly caught our interest. No matter how you feel about "Dr. No," it ends leaving you wanting to see more of this Bond, James Bond fellow and what beautiful women he might sleep with next while saving the world at the same time. The foundation this film builds is rock-solid, embodying nearly everything about the Bond character that we know today.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site moviemusereviews.com
In this superhero-obsessed culture/Hollywood world we live in, it's a wonder that the grand-daddy of them all, Superman, hasn't had a successful debut in the 21st Century. Obviously I've just implicitly bashed 2006's "Superman Returns," which I will not be taking the time to discuss beyond this sentence, but I don't think anyone disagrees that Bryan Singer's film failed to do the Man of Steel justice.Knowing they had yet to tap the full potential of one of the greatest characters of all time, Warner Bros. finally committed to bringing in the amount of mind and muscle befitting of Superman and channeling it into a new incarnation. The duo of producer Christopher Nolan (mind) and director Zack Snyder (muscle) promised an intelligent, visually extravagant and emotion-filled blockbuster spectacle. A tall order, no doubt, but they manage to breathe new life and excitement into the character."Man of Steel" doesn't feel like a Snyder film or a Nolan film, and it visually distinguishes itself as separate from the Christopher Reeve/Richard Donner "Superman," whose imagery became the definitive take on the Superman universe. Purists might well have an issue with the liberties taken with the Fortress of Solitude, Phantom Zone and likely more. There are no visual easter eggs or homages to famous dialogue either. "Man of Steel" clearly wanted a fresh start.It begins fresh as well with an extended sequence on Krypton, which sets up a bit more of the reason Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sent his newborn son to Earth as well as who is General Zod (Michael Shannon). It's definitely rushed, but in showing us part of the Superman universe we've never seen before it manages to keep our interest completely piqued with an array of dazzling action, sets, costumes and CGI.The on-Earth beginning of the story, the origin of Clark Kent, also goes in a different direction. As Clark (Henry Cavill) ventures through Alaska in an effort to discover his greater purpose, the narrative flashes back to pivotal moments during his upbringing in the hands of Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane).Screenwriter David S. Goyer keeps the momentum going forward while touching on the crucial thematic points of Superman's origin, the bits about keeping his identity a secret and finding his greater destiny, etc. This creative choice also helps to avoid a total feeling of deja vu in experiencing Superman's origin story yet another time, a fault that many saw in the reboot "The Amazing Spider-Man," for example. That said, toying with the chronology keeps us from experiencing the greatest degree of empathy for our hero. Fortunately, Cavill plays the role with great humility, so it's tough not to like this Superman.As much as the script takes certain liberties with the origin and how its told and also how Clark meets Lois Lane (Amy Adams), it stays extremely focused on Superman and Zod's invasion of Earth the entire time. So many superhero films get bogged down with subplots, but "Man of Steel" has none. Anything you might deem a subplot directly connects with whatever else is going on in the film at the time.What Goyer and Nolan have done with the story could spark endless discussion (and in some circles, debate). Anyone expecting an artistic blood transfusion from "The Dark Knight Trilogy" will be let down a tad. Batman's universe can theoretically be steeped in realism; Superman's flat out can't. "Man of Steel" embraces the science-fiction elements of "Superman" and plays them up. Considering one of every two action films these days involves aliens leveling a city, it's not hard to see why Warner Bros. was more than happy to go in that direction.At this point we can safely say that the more audiences are subjected to final sequences involving mass-scale urban destruction, the more they will begin to just tune it out. The film doesn't exactly do a great job of making us care about whether the Daily Planet turns to rubble. In fact, I can't recall if the word Metropolis is even used in the entire movie. Regardless, the photo-realism of the fight sequences thanks to advances in CGI is breathtaking. Snyder, known for his abundant use of slow-motion, goes hard left with extremely fast-moving, often airborne action and fight choreography that despite the potential for blurry, incoherent CGI, comes out stunningly vivid. Superman's showdown with Zod's buddies in Smallville serves as an incredible showcase of the visual effects work on the film. The climactic scene in Metropolis is too, but again, after Superman gets chucked through that 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th building (all in one frame), you stop paying attention and eagerly await how the showdown with Zod will finally end.Spectacle would be the first way to describe "Man of Steel." As much as it offers some interesting themes, the film doesn't take the time to sit on anything. It's go, go, go in order to fit the origin story and provide plenty of drama once Zod invades. It's a pure summer blockbuster as opposed to a grittier, more intellectual take on "Superman" (a majority of the time), but it's infinitely more interesting than similar spectacle films such as the "Transformers" series.All the elements of the film and characters are pretty likable, but these peripheral elements are underdeveloped. Much like how I felt after seeing "Amazing Spider-Man," now that the origin story is out of the way, there's room for a little more complexity in future installments. And if just scratching the surface of this new "Superman" world was this exciting from an entertainment standpoint, getting an opportunity to dig deeper holds promise.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Americans have long been ignorant of the comedic prowess of Ricky Gervais. The round- bellied Brit is the force behind "The Office" having played the Michael Scott equivalent, David Brent, on the original UK show and produced the American version. Yet to most of us he's "the guy from the Night at the Museum movies." His latest try to gain name recognition in the US after the failure of last year's "Ghost Town" comes in the form of concept comedy "The Invention of Lying," where he plays a lonely loser who in a world of truth and candidness, stumbles upon the first lie.Such a premise is tricky territory: genius if you can pull it off, mediocre if you leave open too many holes. Creating a believable world where people say what's on their mind all the time - - no deceit, no flattery, no withholding information -- without seeming forced, would have to be difficult to say the least. Yet Gervais and co-creator Matthew Robinson manage to give "The Invention of Lying" just enough legs to be unique, funny and leave a good impression.For one thing, you have to like Gervais' style in order to really enjoy "Lying." He has an "every-man" humor, kind of a reactive style that makes fun of the more aggressive characters around him in subtle ways with amusing comments muttered under his breath. For this reason his character, Mark, is portrayed as a total loser. The film opens with a blind date with Jennifer Garner, which really gets things going as what could be worse than a blind date where you can't withhold the truth? She rips on his looks and explains why he won't so much as get a kiss at the end of the night let alone be a proper genetic match for the children she wants to have.Although the concept delivers some big hits, "Lying" does get a bit lost in it. It opts to explore the depths of its world of truth-telling -- and rightly so, it's interesting -- but no firm story line develops. It's more like "this is Mark, unlucky with women, about to get fired from his job, look what happens to those things when he learns he can lie." It's purely scene- driven and situational. I thought the movie could've ended at two other places until the script decides that the film is really about his love interest in Garner's character.That love story is okay. To go with the not lying concept, I have to say that Garner's talents, despite her character being kind of animated, is the only reason the romance works. I've rarely ever praised her dramatic talents, but coupled with the character's fluffy innocence, her realizing how she feels about Mark manages to feel real at times -- surprising in a world that feels so fake because people are always saying what they think.Maybe the best thing about "Lying" is its cameos and supporting roles. Gervais is the star, but the big names are in the rest of the cast such as Tina Fey as his secretary at work, Jonah Hill as his suicidal neighbor and Rob Lowe as his narcissistic co-worker. While I won't spoil cameos, I will say that they're effective in being not too over-the-top and completely unexpected.Whenever "Lying" doesn't lose sight of its opportunity to tell an original story because people can't lie, it's a really good movie. Occasionally, however, it gets a bit lost in some religious stuff, the love story and other things. It makes some key points such as how important it is that we have the ability to tweak the truth or hide it or flat-out lie, but sometimes it meanders and that's where you have to really like Gervais' style to enjoy the rest of the film. If you're unfamiliar with him, this is the right film to try him out.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
"Raiders of the Lost Ark" is simply the classic adventure film. You have your charming, smart, brave, witty and unforgiving hero in Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. There's history, mystery, traps, explosions, fighting, damsels in distress and...snakes. "Raiders" has it all and it shows the collaborative genius of two of the greatest modern day cinematic storytellers: Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.The film begins on an artifact hunt in South America in 1936 as we follow Indiana into a hidden temple with a treasure hidden inside. Normally, this scene in a film would just detract from getting toward the actual plot, but this scene not only introduces us to our hero and his fearless ways, it also happens to be incredibly memorable in how clever the actions is and the traps are. You watch it and you feel like you've seen it a million times before, but that's because you have (since 1981). "Raiders" has influenced Hollywood that much. Granted it does borrow on previous concepts, but that's always what making a hit entails.Eventually we see Professor Jones and learn about the Nazi's pursuit of the Ark of the Covenant, the ark that held the Ten Commandments and disappeared thousands of years ago from the first Hebrew temple. Jones gets paid to stop them. After a pit stop in Nepal to pick up an essential artifact for uncovering the Ark, he ends up picking up an old flame (Karen Allen) who immediately becomes the stereotypical leading lady. When they arrive in Cairo, the search begins, which action and mayhem along the way.Ford simply makes these movies. Why else would Indiana Jones have been attached to the beginning of the names of the following films? He simply is one of the best one-liner deliverers in Hollywood history. Jones is a complicated character and Ford fuels that while also making him the cunning hero everyone wants to see.While the ending of the film is okay, it's all the cool action along the way that makes it a 1 hr. and 55 minute thrill ride that you can't help but love. It was simply was the Daniel Boone of adventure films and in how much it has inspired other adventure films, it has accumulated its own timeless value and gotten better because of them.
My how things would be different today if in 1995, instead of getting Sylvester Stallone in "Judge Dredd," we were treated to director Pete Travis' "Dredd." And I'm not just talking about visual effects advances in the last 17 years. "Dredd," starring Karl Urban as the helmeted anti- hero, does classic, '80s and '90s-style action better than a lot of films in the '80s and '90s did. Forget needless character development and side plots  writer Alex Garland's ("28 Days Later ...," "Never Let Me Go") adaptation of the John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra comic drops us straight into the action and executes the plot with video game-like precision. Urban's Dredd is an immediately likable badass, armed with as many great one-liners as he has different kinds of ammunition in his all-in-one handgun-carbine hybrid."Dredd" plays out a lot like another of 2012's popular little action movies, "The Raid: Redemption." Both use the straightforward premise of a skilled hero trapped in a dangerous slum building controlled by a ruthless crime lord (in this case lady).Dredd is a judge of the Hall of Justice in Mega City One, a concrete jungle stretching from D.C. to Boston built amidst the ruins of the world that we know today. With crime rampant, judges are granted the powers of law enforcement and the legal system all rolled into one  judge, jury and executioner. All we know about Dredd is that he plays everything by the book, but he's far from a softie.The film occurs over the course of just a few hours. Dredd gets assigned to assess a rookie judge named Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), a young woman that that has failed most of the judge tests, but possesses powerful psychic abilities deemed valuable to the Hall. She joins him on patrol, though they both get more than just a test when they respond to a triple homicide call at a 200-story residence called Peach Trees. The building has been gang-controlled for years, but now just one woman rules the whole place, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), a former prostitute who peddles an inhaled narcotic called Slo-Mo that causes the brain to experience time at a 100th of its normal speed. When Dredd and Anderson threaten her operation, she locks the building down with intentions of killing them. That's the gist of it. No side plots or secondary characters bogging things down, and Travis doesn't overindulge the sci-fi elements of the film either. All the futuristic technology is rather self-explanatory and none of it is integral to understanding the movie. It's all style. Technically, the Slo-Mo drug could have been any kind of drug in terms of fitting the purpose of the story, but it ends up crucial to creating the movie's visual identity.."Dredd" is an exceptionally bloody film, yet most of it is CGI, so its violence is comparable to the quality of a really graphic video game. Actually, think of the most graphically bloody video game you've played and up the level of gory detail. Lots of smashed in heads and stuff. It would be great if it didn't look as fake, but it fits with the extremely lucid, glossy aesthetic of the movie.Slow motion will usually cheapen the look of a film because it's so overused, but Travis works it in as part of the charm. It's so violent and fast-paced that allowing the audience to experience certain scenes "under the influence of Slo-Mo" radically changes the look and feel of what's going on and helps form the film's thumbprint.One-liners will do the same thing as bad slow motion, but a majority of these lines work really well between the context they're used in and Urban's delivery. Most of the time a writer has to completely contrive them, but Garland crafts these zingers exclusively based on what's happening in the film. He only reaches in a couple of instances. "Dredd" has a bizarre sense of humor between the dialogue and some of the lewd sequences that occur as the script starts to play around with Anderson's psychic powers. During much of the film, she has captured one of Ma-Ma's men (Wood Harris, "The Wire") and he tries to freak her by picturing sexual episodes between them in his head. These scenes can't exactly be deemed necessary, but they at least prove Anderson's psychic powers aren't just about having a convenient way to advance the plot.Despite opportunities for all the actors to chew the scenery, none do. Headey has learned a thing or two about playing villains from "Game of Thrones" and Ma-Ma is a sickly subtle villain to be sure, while Urban does a better Christian Bale gruff-voiced Batman than Christian Bale does. The movie doesn't tell you anything about the man behind the helmet, but by the end, you wouldn't mind learning a thing or two if there's ever a sequel."Dredd" keeps thing incredibly simple, entertaining and gleefully violent. That's not everyone's cup of tea  the style of the movie could definitely be considered too niche for mainstream tastes  but regardless of how good you might feel it is, there's no question that in executed a stupidly simple story so well, "Dredd" makes bad action movies that try to do too much look that much worse. No one will ever label "Dredd" an action classic of the early 2010s, but it will stand the test of time better than anyone expects.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
There are few musicals like "Les Misérables," an operetta lined with incredible music from start to finish, with a story so grand and tremendous that somehow manages to fit on a Broadway (or West End) stage. Needless to say, Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil's story has been ripe for a film adaptation since the English version opened in London in 1985, a chance to place this larger- than-life production in an environment with no physical confines or limitations. With the keys in the hands of Tom Hooper ("The King's Speech"), one would expect something extravagant, but surprisingly, the Oscar winner chooses to do the opposite  to zoom in on the story and its characters in search of greater depth.It's this choice that completely determines the effectiveness of this take on "Les Mis." As anyone familiar with the musical knows, you're not going to walk out of any film version disappointed with the music and lyrics or the quality of the overall story  they guarantee the film a certain measure of success. Instead, it becomes all about presentation.Hooper's primary technique for telling this story is the close-up. If he and cinematographer Danny Cohen got any closer, in fact, you'd swear the camera would smack into the actors' faces. With so much of the music being sung by one character at a time  characters who are usually pouring their souls out  it makes sense, but there's little breathing room for the audience. Stars Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway and more are literally right there; the makeup department had to be utterly scrupulous to be sure. But Hooper doesn't just expose his actors physically, he also does so vocally. With the choice to film all the singing live on set as opposed pre-recording tracks in studio for the actors to lip-sync to, their voices become the object of audience scrutiny. With the lens so close on these characters, the actors had no margin for error in their performances, so it's truly a compliment to say that there is some truly incredible acting in "Les Misérables."Jackman and Hathaway excel the most with this technique as Jean Valjean and Fantine, respectively. Valjean is the protagonist in this large ensemble, a man released from prison on parole for stealing a loaf of bread, who after remaking himself eight years later, promises the dying Fantine that he'll look after her daughter, Cosette (played later on by Amanda Seyfried). Interestingly, their best work comes at the very beginning of the film. As the prison-worn down-on-his-luck Valjean who is given a second chance, Jackman sets the bar for the film's emotional intensity with "What Have I Done?" only to be outdone by Hathaway, who, despite minimal screen time, delivers the iconic "I Dreamed a Dream" with an intensity that really hammers home the lyrics in a way no previous renditions have ever done. It's incredible, though sadly it goes unmatched for the entire rest of the movie.Young up-and-comer Eddie Redmayne as student rebellion leader Marius and West End starlet Samantha Barks as the street urchin Eponine also succeed when the camera fixes squarely upon them in their respective songs "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables" and "On My Own." As much as the close-ups really highlight and enhance the acting, some members of the cast struggle with it. Russell Crowe has a lot of trouble with Inspector Javert, both vocally (at the beginning at least) and emotionally. He's a tricky character who's hard to empathize with in the first place, and Crowe just seems uncomfortable during his two huge solos. Opinions will vary on the overall sound of "Les Misérables" because of the choice to do on-set singing. Some lyrics become a bit lost when multiple people sing at once, and the actors generally choose to restrain their voices or even speak some of the lyrics rather than belt them, which given the choice and the film's intimate nature, makes sense. Great pitch is somewhat sacrificed for a raw quality that benefits the acting. The entire film is really built around the performances.Usually, when a film doesn't quite have the emotional impact it should wield, it's a lack of introspection and intimacy that can be blamed, but in this case, it's when "Les Misérables" fails to get big enough that it lacks that power to hit all of the story's several emotional high points. We never get that big sense of scale because of Hooper's preoccupation with the characters and that intimacy. The wide shots in the film are mostly sweeping pans to establish change in time and location, and they're very effects-heavy. It's odd, because what made "The King's Speech" such an excellent film from a technical standpoint was the way Hooper beautifully incorporated the scenery in almost every scene. The rich detail of the set decoration, props and costumes all came through. Here we can pretty much only judge the costumes from the waist up. Half the shots in the movie could've been filmed with actors not wearing pants and we wouldn't have known it.The trade off is that we get some of the very best performances in a movie musical of all time. These are star-making turns for Redmayne and Barks, and when you stop to consider at any point in the film that the guy playing Valjean also plays Wolverine, you'll have a whole new level of respect for Jackman. He and especially Hathaway will wow you like no acting performance has in quite some time."Les Misérables" has its missteps to be sure, but it's a worthy adaptation that utilizes its talent to impressively bring new insight to a stage musical heard and seen countless times all over the world.~StevenThanks for reading! moviemusereviews.com
Timely and familiar: these are the two qualities "Tower Heist" has going for it. Heist films have a reputation for good fun, and when said heist is pulled off by average or incompetent folks like these, all the better, as the characters become even easier to like. Add that they're stealing from a millionaire who has defrauded hardworking people and you have a pitch- perfect modern battle of the 99 percent versus the one.Director Brett Ratner sticks to the basics with "Tower Heist" and makes it work, plain and simple. Ben Stiller takes his seat at the head of the table of relatable guys and Eddie Murphy plops down next to him as the crooked thief version of his Donkey character from "Shrek." Add Matthew Broderick, Casey Affleck, Gabourey Sidibe and Michael Pena as out-of-type supporting characters and you have a bumbling group of lovable fools.All these (except Murphy) work for Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) in his multi-million dollar luxury apartment building. When Shaw is arrested and they all learn their pensions (which Shaw managed) were essentially gone, their love of him, namely Stiller's Josh Kovacs, turns to anger. After an FBI agent (Tea Leoni) tips them off that Shaw's likely hiding a multimillion- dollar safety net somewhere in the building, Kovacs rallies a group of them together to find and steal the cash and hires Murphy's character Slide to teach them the tricks of grand larceny.The first portion of the film builds up these characters, their devotion to their work and their love of Shaw. It's not a particularly funny chunk of the film, but coming from Ratner, it's a thumbs up when you can say he appears not to try too hard (though that's not the case throughout, however). The humor enters the picture as these guys learn how to be crooks. A sequence at the mall when Slide challenges them to steal $50 worth of merchandise in 15 minutes to prove they're in for real stands out as one of the more clever.Enter the heist act and the film dives off the silly cliff. Rather than get overly complicated in showing how they manage to get their way inside the tower, the film plays up the stupidity of security guards and other antics. Those expecting a really technical, exciting and realistic heist will find themselves, in a sense, defrauded. The script bets on its ludicrous nature and amusing characters to charm a smile on your face.The real laugh-out-loud moments are scarce, but the minor characters add to our desire to see this plan succeed, no matter how *not* fool-proof it is. They keep our attention and make for some digestible entertainment. Talents like Affleck and Broderick relegating themselves to minor parts add a unique depth to the supporting roles that somewhat cancels out many of the predictable Murphy moments one would expect from a Ratner-directed feature."Tower Heist" also possesses some creativity that's rare for a multi-writer script. Over the top it might be, but most sequences show you something you haven't seen before despite the fact that the story's skeleton gives you only things you've seen before. The result is a nice balance that makes for a watchable heist comedy.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out moviemusereviews.com
Call it a chick flick, call it aggressive feminism, label it whatever you like, but "Thelma & Louise" is a classic story of female companionship and liberation that challenged what was and in many ways still is a male-centric movie industry. Roles for women in film have expanded over the years, but Thelma and Louise proved women can even be outlaws starring in a fugitive adventure thriller.Societal messages aside, however, it doesn't change the fact that Callie Khouri wrote a fantastic character-driven script with unexpected twists and turns and an unforeseeable ending. "Thelma & Louise" might be far from a blood-pumping fugitive crime thriller, but action and excitement is not what this film hangs its hat on.Even director Ridley Scott, who directed probably the greatest suspense movie with a female lead of all time in "Alien," recognizes that "Thelma & Louise" is relationship drama at its heart as two women discover themselves as they push each other over the edge.Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon star as the titular characters, one a suppressed housewife and another a chain-smoking waitress who plan a weekend getaway together only to end up trying to get away from the authorities after Louise shoots a man at a bar who tried to rape Thelma. After deciding there's no way to come clean of their crime, they run for the Mexico border as authorities (led by Harvey Keitel) try and track them down.Davis and Sarandon are an incredible duo playing the most detailed of characters. Davis as Thelma is the best of the two as she takes Thelma through a complete transformation from warm, acquiescent housewife looking to let loose to a fully committed armed criminal. Sarandon plays Louise as a colder, self-assured type who learns that she really doesn't have it all together. The two work in perfect balance creating strong, relatable and fascinating characters whose flaws make them so human.Not much has to be said for Scott's directing, he gives these characters the attention they need to blossom before us and does just enough to keep us guessing when they'll do some sudden and unpredictable.Yes, in this process of self-discovery, the girls both literally and symbolically give the middle finger to the male establishment. From shooting the abusive trickster that attempted to rape Thelma to Louise turning away her boyfriend (Michael Madsen) after he finds her and proposes to her, there's little sympathy for the male characters. Only Keitel's detective gets Khouri's vote as he defends the ladies (despite wanting to catch them) when a young Brad Pitt gets mixed up with them. Some of it might seem unnecessary such as the trucker who makes crude gestures to them along the highway, but considering Hollywood's abuse of the femme fatale, innocent girl and other female thriller/adventure genre archetypes, I'd say it's a fair trade, especially when these characters are actually very thoughtfully conceived. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
Few films can brag that they were adapted from a fake grindhouse movie trailer, which is exactly what makes "Machete" special. Few filmmakers can pull off an exploitation flick quite like Robert Rodriguez and although "Machete" will never be a cult classic, Rodriguez is to thank for helping popularize this often laughed-at sub-genre. There are a growing number of movie fans who enjoy mindless films that don't take themselves seriously and "Machete" is one of the leaders in this revolution.Rodriguez is notorious for developing long-standing working relationships with a number of his actors and "Machete" serves as a good chance to give them some work. One of his best friends in that regard, Danny Trejo, gets his first huge starring role as Machete Cortez, a federale whose high sense of honor led him to a betrayal and the death of his wife at the hands of Mexican drug kingpin Torrez (Steven Seagal). Fast forward three years later and Machete lives in Texas as your typical illegal day laborer, although he misses his blade dearly. When a man named booth (Jeff Fahey) pulls him off the street and tells him he'll get $150 K if he assassinates a local anti-immigration senator (Robert De Niro). Machete nods silently in agreement, but the job was a setup and Machete must go on the run from a corrupt politician in addition to an ambitious immigration officer (Jessica Alba).How often do you get a cast that includes Alba, De Niro and Seagal? It's more mind-blowing when you mention the rest of the cast: Michelle Rodriguez, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson and Lindsay Lohan. The eclectic cast makes "Machete" that much more interesting of a watch.The film roars off to a gory and delightfully cheesy start that includes slicing, dicing and Machete carrying a naked girl over his shoulder. The setup of the film's events surprises in terms of being equally amusing and slightly intriguing. The script does a really nice job capturing our interest that the moment of obnoxious mayhem comes as a bit of a surprise. But after a scene in which Machete is taken to a hospital in critical condition, rips off tubing and then slices some guys up with surgical tools (followed by a window escape using a man's intestines as a rappelling rope), "Machete" hits a plateau. Despite some funny moments, "Machete" fails to surprise us and gets a bit lost in illegal immigration satire. The political agenda is held up by Alba's character and sadly, the girl can't even act dramatically when the film she is in is a joke. It's painful watching her try to act not so seriously -- I've given up hope on her credibility as an actress unless she's in something melodramatic with fight scenes.It's hard to tell exactly how "Machete" loses some of its luster, but the events and the techniques simply become predictable, even if they're as over-the-top as when Machete's brother, a gun-toting priest played by Marin, gets nailed to a cross. Although amusing, it doesn't take us by surprise. Even the final battle royale against a bunch of "wetback haters" doesn't take the film to the next level as the buildup drags and the payoff is unclever carnage. The only strengths in the end are the carefully orchestrated deaths that exploitation films are known for: giving the bad guys what they deserve.Rodriguez definitely intended, for the sake of the genre, to beat us over the head with visual clues as to what ridiculousness will happen next, but rather than play it up, it stays a bit subtle and the anticipation isn't there. By the climax, the film has become a tiresome exercise in poor visual effects and reprises of previous techniques. However, only Rodriguez could assemble the cast and dream big enough to make a B-movie with an "A" feel.~Steven C
It seemed like they couldn't get any worse. After 1996's Goldeneye the downhill string of "Tomorrow Never Dies," "The World is Not Enough," and "Die Another Day" kept bringing Bond to new levels of repetitive gadget-loaded mediocrity, spared only by the suave of Pierce Brosnan . Then comes "Casino Royale," a film which producers claimed would be the rebirth of the franchise. After casting Daniel Craig as the 6th James Bond, the speculation grew as to what direction Bond was actually headed. Now that the film has hit the silver screen, we now have our answer: up, way up."Casino Royale" is so well done, that years from now past, present and future Bond fans will wonder how in the world 2002's "Die Another Day" was the film that preceded it. This film is smarter, faster, cooler, funnier, more engaging and in almost every way better than "DAD" and the Brosnan films that came before it. Just when you thought that Barbara Broccoli and crew had no idea what they were doing or which direction to take the franchise in, they completely turn around and in impressive fashion. While Bond was still a financial success with DAD grossing over 400 M world wide, they decided regardless that what they were doing was harmful to the franchise and did something about it, which is most applaudable.The first wise choice was not only to pick an already existent Bond novel to adapt, but to choose an origin story, going with the very successful Hollywood trend that made films like "Batman Begins" more successful than additionally harmful to their franchise names. They stuck to the origin story and they followed through with it, not simply saying that "this is how Bond came to be a double-O" but showing Bond's first lesson of "trust no one" in a way that brings humanity to a character that has for so long been a distant icon of manliness, coolness and suave and nothing more.Now on to Daniel Craig. The Bond fanatics were in uproar over the blue-eyed blonde's casting, but they were incredibly off. I don't like to say that I called it, but one merely has to watch Craig's performance in "Layer Cake" to see that Craig is 100% Bond material. His qualities bring Bond to a new level yet also restore some of the classic Sean Connery style. He is far more muscular and imposing than any previous Bond, yet his face is much softer and his expressions and humor more subtle, building on the finesse that has made Bond so successful in the past. Craig's performance makes Brosnan look like a clown in the past 4 movies because he is much more rugged and not overbearingly witty. It also helped Craig's case that the plot and characters were more well-developed in this film, making the humor less punchy and more natural. The surrounding cast was also very strong. Keeping Judi Dench as M was a wise choice and digging up the talent of Bond girl Eva Green and villain Mads Mikkelsen was also impressive. Green is very fitting for the smart and sophisticated Vesper Lynd. Her unique beauty and wit make her a much stronger bond girl than any of recent--she comes off much more as a leading lady than a sex symbol and her character is much more valued. Mikkelsen also adds to the successful subtleties of the film's characters with the portrayal of villain Le Chiffre.The bottom line is that Bond is back, and he's bigger and better while still doing what he does best. "Casino Royale" keeps all the elements that are essential Bond and does them well while vastly improving upon the franchise. The action is grittier and more realistic, the romance is more believable than whimsical and the humor is explicit yet more comfortable. The only concerns lie slightly in the film's length and in some of the serious, emotional moments. Those moments, however, are entirely excusable given this film is the first ever to tackle them, and will hopefully then allow for improvement in the next Bond installment which will find itself having a hard time topping its predecessor.
If there was an ultimate and absolute antonym for "Moulin Rouge!" it would be the adjective "shy." Hundreds of gorgeous costumes, lavish studio sets, a digitally reproduced city of Paris and an abrupt and cartoonish comedic style make this movie musical a one-of-a-kind spectacle.From the very first musical mash-up number in the Moulin Rouge club that consists of around five songs, two of which are Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend," you get a sense that "Moulin Rouge!" wants desperately to be different and ultimately unforgettable. The initial gut reaction to the film's camp and genre- butchering is to dismiss it as forced and unnatural, but once the recycled albeit powerful love story takes over, the derring-do of Baz Luhrmann's visually striking show becomes much more easily appreciated.Despite a mix of songs that defies the historical context, "Moulin Rouge!" takes place in turn-of-the-century Paris in the "underground," inspired by the paintings of Toulouse- Lautrec of the burlesque dancers, courtesans and Absinthe-drinkers. Christian (McGregor) is a hopeless romantic poet whose talent earns him a shot to convince the most famous dancer/performer/courtesan, Satine (Kidman), and her manager/pimp, Harold Zidler (Broadbent) at the city's most famous club, the Moulin Rouge, to let him create the show that will turn Satine into a star. At the same time, a wealthy Duke (Roxburgh) is funding the show and one of his conditions is for Satine to be his."Moulin Rouge!" is also not shy about love or letting you know its themes are love and everything to do with love and that it's all that matters in life. If not for Kidman's wonderful performance as a morally conflicted woman dealing with masculine pressures and discovering love is indeed possible, one could make the case that the focal relationship between her and Christian around which the rest of the film blooms might never have even begun to ripen. Christian, after all, is a one-dimensional character seeing as he's motivated only by Satine and true love -- he has no other desires. So as Satine falls for him and his incredible ability to steal the material of famous songwriters decades after his lifetime and perform it with a soaring tenor, something must ground the film, and her very real issues, which are inspired by a combination of famous story lines including "La Boheme" and "La Traviata," do the trick.Then there's Luhrmann's (1996's "Romeo + Juliet") influences on the film. As it progresses, we begin to love his work here more and more. As the plot thickens and turns for the dramatic (and convincingly so despite so much early antics), his lightning-fast editing choices and lighting become even more effective and the musical numbers being fashioned out of a wide array of songs (like Sting's "Roxanne" mixed with original tango music) become all the more impressive.Sweeping zoom-ins of a city done all by computer and music numbers that are shot and choreographed in an all too showtune-y manner go from questionable choices to beautiful ones as Luhrmann's twist on a classic love story archetypes matures before our eyes and the true spirit of his film becomes clearer. There are still some goofy elements that don't fit, but the spontaneity of song and its often times non-traditional use is one of the biggest things to make sense and fit Luhrmann's vision with time.Despite only one original song in "Come What May," (which should have been allowed to contend for an Oscar) it's more the placement of the songs, the way they follow traditional musical theater rules for song placement -- either setting the mood and foreshadowing the story or expounding on the characters' inner feelings at appropriate times -- makes them so effective. Similar can be said of "Moulin Rouge!" on the whole: though there's an inherent abruptness, randomness and even a faux quality to much of the film, it keeps the traditional love story at its core and everything else is merely growing bountifully from it. There's a reason the same kinds of love stories get recycled in the theater and movies and simply get dressed up a different way and it's because those stories work; they appeal to something human. So as flamboyant and absurd as this movie gets, it never goes wrong because it sticks to its universal storytelling ideas. ~Steven C
Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, "Dumbo." At an unusually short 63 minutes, "Dumbo" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself."Dumbo" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film.When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him "Dumbo." At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself  until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion.The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, "Bambi") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song "Baby Mine" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy."Dumbo" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give "Dumbo" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics."Song of the Roustabouts," for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie."Pink Elephants on Parade" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of "Fantasia," which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent.At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him.Over time, these regrettable choices have given "Dumbo" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off "Fantasia" and "Pinocchio," "Dumbo" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but "Dumbo" stands out with more than big ears.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
The first Harry Potter movie was kind of like a freak-out test for its creators: how much material do we use from the book? How loyal do we stay to it? How do we make this all come to life? "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," the film version of the second book in the fantasy series by J.K Rowling, shows less concern with these questions. Director Chris Columbus and his crew operate much more like a team that's been here before, that knows the fantasy world it has created and how to make it better. Not to mention the material is a shade darker, the kids another year older (which at 12-13 makes a big difference) and the special effects light years better in comparison to the last years' "Sorcerer's Stone.""Sorcerer's Stone" was sort of a childish family film, one worried about being too scary, whose major merits came merely from book-lovers' excitement to see what was stuck in their heads come to life on the big screen -- something its creators could bank on. Now that the Harry Potter world has been imagined once before, the trial period is over and Columbus and adapter Steve Kloves must really put themselves to the test. They definitely succeed: "Chamber of Secrets" is much more thrilling and visually complex, enough so to steal our minds from some of the story flaws that bled over from the first film (something all future Potter films will endure)."Chamber of Secrets" is inherently a richer story -- a mystery where death lurks at every turn and Hogwarts school, the wizarding school which Harry attends, is in imminent danger. When Harry arrives at school for his second year, students begin turning up petrified as word gets out that the legendary chamber of secrets, said to contain a monster, has been opened. It's still a fantasy side venture that avoids the looming conflict between Harry and the great evil wizard who killed his parents, Lord Voldemort, but there's a lot more at stake than the first story. Maybe it was unavoidable for Columbus to respond with a film more capable of frightening young children, but whereas a silly troll that might as well have been Shrek attacked Hogwarts last time, "Chamber of Secrets" loads up on creepy giant spiders that attack Harry and Ron, and Columbus doesn't hold back. Thank goodness.More UK all-stars join the cast this time around such as Kenneth Branagh as the new -- and foolishly egotistical -- defense against the dark arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart and Jason Isaacs plays a sinister looking Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco, Harry's arch schoolyard nemesis. More notably are the improvements in the nucleus trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Watson sheds some touching tears as Hermione, but the most improved award goes to Grint. He was adorable in "Socerer's Stone," but now he's progressed to being a goofy, klutzy character that commands much more of the screen.A much more exciting story awaits those who haven't read the books or were not so impressed by "Sorcerer's Stone." Kloves' script still crams a bit too much, but nothing goes in that doesn't progress the mystery plot or deliver some sort of imaginative CGI sequence from flying cars to magical creatures. That's at least an improvement over the last film. We also have a clearly defined lesson for Harry to learn as he begins his maturing process. There's a definite sense of his growth.A tip of the hat goes to a crew that learned enough the first time around to make great improvements to the second edition. This is more the young adult demographic that these movies need to hit on.
Steven Soderbergh has a reputation for directing films that are great, weird or anywhere in between. You can, however, always depend on the right pieces to be in place, as he has a devoted following of A-list actors who agree to star in everything he does. With Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor, Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender in supporting roles, "Haywire" certainly has a large part of the equation covered in order to work, but it falls decidedly in the "anywhere in between" category.MMA fighter Gina Carano is the foundation around which "Haywire" attaches its many Oscar- caliber ornaments. A fresh-faced action star padded with so many superb talents, Carano automatically rises to the top of this vanilla action-thriller concoction. Despite some really wooden line delivery in a number of scenes, she's got action star chops, and her character, contracted black ops agent and ex-marine Mallory Kane, isn't treated differently for being female."Haywire" isn't quite by-the-numbers as far as modern post-Bourne special agent action- thrillers go (nothing by Soderbergh ever is), but it places all its novelty in Carano's hands. She's an entertaining watch, but she's not going to take generic material and make it awesome  no one's that talented.Lem Dobbs' screenplay isn't really a problem, as plenty of films in the genre have been made out of worse, but neither he nor Soderbergh make an argument for why you should watch "Haywire" instead of another movie (or even another viewing of any "Bourne" film) other than to see all the stars that have been collected to play minor characters."Haywire" follows a classic betrayed agent looking for revenge premise. Mallory is an asset working for a private ops contractor named Kenneth (McGregor) who is thinking about getting out. The film opens after he's betrayed her and left her for dead in Dublin, and she's set to meet with him in upstate New York, except he sends her coworker, Aaron (Tatum), who attacks her in order to bring her in. She breaks his arm and escapes in the car of a random person at the diner (Michael Angarano) and tells him the whole story of her betrayal as she flees.Soderbergh downright refuses to follow some of the most fundamental conventions of the action genre in this film, which keeps "Haywire" fresh but ultimately renders it somewhat stagnant. The trade off for avoiding something stylistically generic is depriving the audience of some of the usual tactics of action films to engage and maintain interest. With a short run time, "Haywire" never gets too boring, but it does at times feel flat.The technique Soderbergh uses that stands out the most involves flipping the traditional use of scoring in an action film. Whereas most movies use silence to build suspense and then use music to underscore the intensity of an action sequence, Soderbergh does the opposite: he enlists David Holmes (of the "Ocean's" films) to create synthetic-sounding '70s action music leading up to action confrontations and then cuts the sound completely to make the fighting feel more raw and natural. It has an interesting effect that manages to work in the fight scenes, but it sets an awkward tone for the build-up given how dated the music sounds.The hand-to-hand (or I should say foot-to-throat) combat scenes we get are rather exciting with this raw presentation, and it suits Carano well given her talents before she decided to try acting. She is definitely beautiful, but she's not lady-like, and as you watch her you aren't distracted by her sex. The point is that it would be wrong to categorize her as a femme fatale or anything we've previously seen in this genre. She's an action star and she earns it here.Solid is one and perhaps the most applicable of the many unremarkable yet reputable adjectives one could use to describe "Haywire." Its detractors will likely come from disappointment over potential rather than poor filmmaking and considering the names on the poster, it's not an unwarranted complaint. One could also argue that without the level of pedigree, the material wouldn't warrant any attention but the bargain bin. Best, then, to attribute to "Haywire's" lack of being special to some miscalculation on all fronts. Fortunately, it's quite tolerable nonetheless.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Somewhere in the four plus hours of film that New Zealand director Andrew Dominik shot for "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" has to be a cut fully capable of winning an Oscar for Best Picture. This version, however, is not it, but it's beautifully filmed and supported by incredible acting. Length (157 minutes) and a few scenes that wander off just enough to deflate the plot's naturally thriving tension are the only hurdles too high for this underrated ensemble to jump.Based on Ron Hansen's book of the same title, "Jesse James" is a historical fiction account of the great American outlaw: the man, the myth, the legend (literally) -- Jesse James. It tells the story of how the young man Bob Ford, who would eventually come to kill him, joined the famous gang of bandits and how he came to commit the "cowardly" act that forever lived in infamy.Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck as the two titular characters form one of the more intriguing relationships on the screen. As the one huge name in the cast, Pitt is perfectly cast as James, a cold outlaw that creates tension by utilizing the fear of everyone around him. Affleck is the socially awkward Ford, who used to idolize James growing up. Now that he's become part of the gang, Ford's ideal image of his hero has been shattered. The transformation he goes through from being naive to pulling the trigger on James gives Affleck an incredible range to work with. He's simply under-appreciated in Hollywood or he's really selective.That's not to diminish, however, the talent around him. Sam Rockwell, Paul Schneider and Jeremy Renner have impressive chemistry as part of the James' brothers gang. The script provides great subtext for their characters, but each is capable of so many levels. One minute they're joking around and the next they're bullies or even killers.Lastly, cinematographer Roger Deakins does absolutely gorgeous things with the lighting of this film. From the onset there's the scene of the James gang waiting in the woods for a train they've obstructed to stop so they can loot it. The train's headlight shines through the trees as it moves and ripples over their hooded faces, elevating the anticipation of the first action sequence of the film. On the whole, "Assassination" has the look of a great cinematic tragedy. The assassination scene in particular is so visually memorable. All the deaths in the film, in fact, have that traumatic effect on the audience.Then there's length. Scenes just kind of get lost. The excellent ending really pulls you back in to the film and leaves a favorable impression, but many middle sections are too quiet despite the ever-growing tension caused by the inevitability of the film's conclusion. It's hard to believe there wasn't a way to edit this film to make it of both tolerable length and a bit more streamlined through the middle because this cast, crew and story is clearly worthy of more recognition for this first-class effort.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
If you think it's tough to think or talk about old people having sex, try being one of said old people. "Hope Springs" pairs two Oscar-winning and well-aging talents in Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones as Kay and Arnold, who endure the ups and downs of couples counseling with the main goal of rekindling their romance in mind.This is not Arnold's idea of course. He's the pragmatic type and a textbook cynic that ought to remind you of at least one older man that you know if not your own father. It's Kay who wants to break from their routine and complete lack of intimacy and who must utilize passive-aggressive tactics to con Arnold into joining her on this trip to the Maine town of Hope Springs where a renowned couples counselor (Steve Carell) will give them one-on-one time.The film reunites Streep with director David Frankel ("The Devil Wears Prada"), but this is not a comedic affair. The script from television writer Vanessa Taylor ("Everwood," "Game of Thrones") steers clear of the obvious jokes of an older, oblivious generation trying to be hip, and mostly sidesteps the awkward humor of seniors attempting to be intimate. Other than Streep's trip to the store to buy bananas, the film is decidedly dramatic, a showcase for its actors to show us what a struggling marriage really looks like.And it's not that Kay and Arnold have irreconcilable differences, but that Kay sees a problem where Arnold doesn't. The onus is then on him to recognize that her unhappiness is a sign of a problem between the two of them. As an outsider, when you consider that they sleep in different rooms and don't touch each other, it's easy to pick up on the warning signs, but Streep and Jones are so convincing that you relate to how two people could live like that for year and not suspect that something was wrong.Carell's character talks them through a lot of things in his scenes and assigns them intimacy exercises. That's it. His casting is a tremendous waste, and all he has to do is sound like a therapist who gives a damn and knows what he's talking about.Ultimately, too much of "Hope Springs" is spent in therapy. Jones and Streep give convincing reactions to the questions and what else they're asked to think about, but the final product is a cinematic depiction of couples therapy for seniors. The script tells it how it is, but to keep the dramatic tension going, Taylor inserts scenes in which Arnold and/or Kay completely freak out when things look to be going well. The emotional ups and downs are a roller coaster of greatly exaggerated proportions. Doing so does avoid the typical rom-com arc, so you won't exactly roll your eyes at "Hope Springs," but this presentation invites a microscope on the degree of realism.The degree of sincerity in the acting outweighs that of the plot. "Hope Springs" is in essence the case study of a relationship, and as such its leads need to be convincing individually and as a couple. Streep and Jones do this touchingly, even though the twists in the plot throw a great deal of challenges their way. They  and to its credit, the film  manage to awaken the emotionally in tune and bold romantic in all of us, though perhaps that should be left for seniors to determine.~Steven CThanks for reading!

To compare "Wild Strawberries" to a story that's a bit more grounded (yet still part fantasy), what instantly comes to mind is "A Christmas Carol." Though that classic is much more exaggerated, it shares that reflective spirit, sense of personal regret and un-fulfillment and the desire to make amends. The difference is that in "Wild Strawberries" we need no ghosts - - only Ingmar Bergman as our guide.Isak is a very old professor on his way to Lund, Sweden with his daughter-in-law to receive an honorary award, when in his aging state he's confronted by dreams of his childhood and consequent past regrets. On the trip, he also meets some vivacious young people and a bickering couple who continue to steer him toward a path of using his last days/months/years to bring meaning into his life.Released at the same time as Bergman classic "The Seventh Seal," "Strawberries" is also incredibly contemplative and full of incredibly philosophical dialogue. Both films confront themes of mortality, but "Strawberries" is the more hopeful of the two. Although we pity Isak and the film's other characters who seem to have failed miserably to suck any joy or positive meaning from life, there's nothing imminently bad or unavoidable -- there is great capacity for betterment.Bergman's excellence as a director resonates throughout the film through its opening scene with ticking clocks and first major dream sequence on the barren streets to the final zoom-ins and close-ups. His every shot is a portrait of an emotion or at the least of a man caught somewhere between the past and death. Like all great classic/black and white directors, Bergman understands the powerful moments of his story and reserves his best just for them.Although Bergman creates more pity than empathy (though it could be my fault I've always struggled to really find personal epiphany in viewing his stories) and his language more intentionally mystical at times than intrinsically inspired, he manages to capture the uncertainty he's trying to address better than anyone else; His portrait of emotion brings us closer to life's toughest questions than any other director has ever dared.It's the hopeful ending, however, that really makes "Wild Strawberries" a great film. Despite Bergman showing us a mirror that's very tough to look at for an extended period of time, he never suggests that we can't look into it and change whatever it is we don't like. It's that outlet that makes the thematic difficulty of the film all that much easier to bear.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
"Porky's" is the ultimate teenage fantasy, a movie celebrating group mentality shenanigans, everything from obsessing about sex to pulling the ultimate prank on that one old guy always bringing you down. It's a film that says that at heart, we're all good-natured kids that wish we could be irresponsible every so often.This is "Porky's" only point, both its hindrance and most celebrated characteristic. There isn't any character development or a through plot line -- going to the strip club Porky's is only representative of two major scenes in the movie. It's about high school kids horsing around and trying to get laid in Florida in the '50s. There are some admirable but pointless subplots fixed on anti-Semitism and parent abuse, but it's just about laughs.What makes "Porky's" unique is that it's about laughter, it's not just about creating it for the sake of being a comedy film. A stand-out scene is when the strict oafish gym teacher Ms.Ballbricker is explaining to the principal her plan to identify a trouble-making student by lining up several of the boys to examine their manhood. In the background, two of the students are dying from laughter and even the principal at one point can't hold it in any longer -- then a nice close-up of a portrait of President Eisenhower with a big grin on his face. That sums up "Porky's" nicely: we all need to laugh at the ridiculousness and humor of certain situations. If only the film spent a bit more time hammering that in instead of meandering about like a bored high schooler.This is a film you can watch over and over again, not only because it can be funny for all appropriate ages, but it only thrives from scene to scene. The entire high school-aged fantasy of boys getting spy on the girls' showers owes its birth to this film, the hilarity as the new gym coach learns why the attractive young girls' coach is nicknamed "Lassie," and of course that ultimate revenge against the powers that be, in this case Porky and his redneck sheriff brother, who try and stop kids from having fun. It can be watched one scene at a time -- there's nothing gluing it all together.Bob Clark's film has a carefree and reckless attitude that resembles that of his characters, but as admirable as that is -- and a rare find in a movie indeed, especially comedy -- there's no doubt that "Porky's" avoids being the kind of coming-of-age film it could have been. There's no substitute for memorable characters in addition to unforgettable scenes, but "Porky's" viewers can at least relish the latter.
Few true stories are the stuff of folk legend, but the tale of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow ranks near the top. Bank robbers and lovers of the limelight  as well as sometimes each other  their story has everything you could want in a film: suspense, action, humor, drama and romance. "Bonnie and Clyde" hits all those notes.The package director Arthur Penn ("The Miracle Worker") puts together could be a lot neater, but he captures the iconicity of these two tabloid heroes, in large part thanks to stars Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty. They both exemplify the uninhibited joie de vivre of their characters, who seem to fear nothing, go out of their way to give the press something new to write about and speak off hand about when they're caught or killed.Unfortunately, only the beginning of the film, when Bonnie and Clyde meet and head off together, focuses purely on their relationship. During the bulk of the film, the other supporting characters/members of the Barrow Gang have to be pushed to the side for it to be about the titular couple. We know how they feel about each other, but we don't feel permanently strapped in to the roller coaster of their relationship.The inclusion of Buck and Blanche Barrow (Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons) as well as C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard) certainly make "Bonnie and Clyde" feel more like an adventure. They bring a certain levity that enhances how care-free they all lived despite constantly having local forces bearing down on them whenever they gave away a small clue of their presence in a certain town.Then there's Blanche, a role that won Parsons an Oscar. Therefore, Blanche is one of the most irritating and unlikable characters (who's not a bad guy) to ever garner an Oscar. She's "family," being Buck's wife, so they must keep her around, though she's self-centered and a complete liability. You wish they'd just throw her out of one of the dozens of cars they steal and drive around in throughout the film, but she sticks around to the audience's chagrin.This large middle chunk of the film featuring the Barrow Gang plays out as a collection of moments from their travels, almost all of which lead to the next time the police will find them, resulting in a gunfight and them fleeing town. These scenes are memorable and build the characters up in entertaining fashion, giving you a sense of just how reckless and fueled by danger they all really were. At the same time, that builds up more of the folk perception of the Barrow Gang rather than capturing who these people were and what drove them to behave that way.Dunaway and Beatty do give us a greater depth of character with their performances when the film allows for a focus on their relationship. We get a very good sense of what attracts each to the other and for Bonnie, a very good idea of what drove her to throw her life away for Clyde Barrow and his anything-but-normal lifestyle. Dunaway embodies everything the script says or suggests about Bonnie Parker. She has a definite beauty and manner suggestive of a woman who knows what power she wields, but there's a naivety to most of her decisions and reactions. Obviously as the film continues she sheds more of the latter for the former.Beatty also demonstrates the dual nature of Clyde, who comes off as so self-assured and in control, yet he harbors some insecurities and is almost team-oriented and selfless to a fault.The one weakness of the script other than limiting the depth with which it explores our main characters is a sense of scope. As to the fame of Bonnie and Clyde and the Barrow Gang's exploits, we are asked to take the film's word for it rather than truly see how they've become a tabloid favorite. We also don't get to see the cat in this cat and mouse relationship between the gang and the authorities. Most films will have part of the story focus on the person/people trying to bring the crooks down, but that person doesn't emerge until very late in the gang. We have trouble understanding what motivates them to take the Barrow Gang down, and so violently too."Bonnie and Clyde" also doesn't have much to say, but ultimately, that's okay. It leaves us with is a portrait of who these people were, giving us the opportunity to decide how we feel about them. Was their end tragic? Heart-breaking? A long time coming? Unfair? It's all there for us to pick through, but the unquestionable truth is how fascinating their legend is.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
Welcome to the mind of Patrick Bateman: Wall Street broker, fine diner, playboy, oh and serial killer extroadinare. Bateman claims only part of himself is based in humanity and similarly, only part of this film is based on reason or sanity."American Psycho" is easily one of the top five most deranged films of all time. Those with a taste for the bizarre and an interest in the abstraction of realism will find it great, those who prefer movies grounded in, well, something, will at the very least be amused by the perverse nature of the plot and Bateman's psychotic character.Christian Bale does some pretty great work with Bateman, giving us a very dissociative identity look to the clearly insane killer, showing him as very cold and crafty while also emotional and irrational. His character jumps all over the place and Bale really has the look and skills to play all those kinds of characters.I have to say that while I like Mary Harron's visual choices with the film, overall I don't know if we got deep enough into the meddle that is this plot and the cavernous mind of Bateman. The thin line between reality/imagination, sanity/insanity is very clear, but the social commentary is sort of overshadowed by the film's taste for the absurd. I definitely think there's richness, but there is a lot of thickness too.I suppose if you come at this film with a more abstract perspective than a desire to sort things out and make sense of them, you'll find more things to enjoy about the film other than Bateman's philosophical conversations about sellout recording artists while he indulges in one fantasy or another. It's strange, and while strange is good, strange also needs to be handled a bit more thoughtfully than in "Psycho."
The superhero film craze has led to a lot of ordinary main characters taking justice into their own hands. In that sense, nothing will strike you as original about "Super," the latest film from James Gunn ("Slither") and one made on a shoestring budget. Rainn Wilson stars as Frank, a man who loses his cool when a drug kingpin (Kevin Bacon) steals away his wife (Liv Tyler). After having a vision in which his brain is quite literally "touched by the finger of God," Frank decides to create his own superhero, the Crimson Bolt, a force against all that is evil in the world, or at least the small town he lives in.Much like last year's "Kick-Ass," which re-examined superhero tropes using unlikely and subversive heroes, "Super" specializes in being deliberately perverse and relishes in the violation of genre expectation. James Gunn's film is foul, hilarious, real and campy all at different times. The film's disapproving critics will undoubtedly argue that down-to-earth characters and a gritty context cannot coexist with excessive, comical violence. Gunn likely believes that these two universes can be reconciled into one film, but nevertheless, the film delivers roaring entertainment with surprising moments of poignancy despite being a complete brain-scrambler."Super" begins like a typical narrated indie comedy. It portrays Frank as a bit of a dreamer, a slightly unrealistic person with a slight but charming naïveté. He finds oddly religious sources of inspiration to become a hero, such as the Holy Avenger (Nathan Fillion), a made-up TV superhero used to promote Christian messages to children. Although Gunn brings Frank's overactive imagination to life, the film stays grounded in its "real person seriously considers being a superhero" concept. As Frank's world comes crashing down, we develop a definitive sense of pity and support his revenge fantasy. Then Gunn blows the lid open.First off, the Crimson Bolt's weapon of choice is a pipe wrench. It seems goofy and kind of silly at first, but then he's actually bashing people over the head with a pipe wrench until they're bleeding and/or unconscious. Eventually, sweet lovable frank becomes a morally ambiguous hero, especially after he decides to teach the guy who butted in line at the movie theater a thing or two. This certainly makes "Super" a more complicated film, but it also creates a definite discomfort. Enter Ellen Page as the over-zealous comic book shop girl who inserts herself into the equation as Frank's kid sidekick Boltie. She not only attempts to seduce Frank, but she has an even more unrealistic notion of the violence she seeks to create. Together, they serve as a catalyst for the black comedy elements and the campy gore.Both Wilson and Page push themselves in positive ways with their roles. Page leaves her dry wit comfort zone for some outrageous antics and Wilson shows some range with Frank's emotional side. Their radically different notions of what being a superhero is about leads to great hilarity and disturbing conflict.Gunn chooses to sacrifice communicating the great depth of these characters by violating viewer expectation with the violence. Some of the gore stays realistic but uncomfortable while other deaths go over the top. The inconsistencies jar the tone of the film and suggest to the audience that they should take the film more or less seriously depending. It can become very difficult to remain engaged in the character sub-plots and the script's other strengths with this distraction. The other issue is the lack of realism with Frank being able to pull of his superhero. He drives around with his own license plates, for example and does a terrible job of concealing his identity. For a film that chooses to create down-to-earth characters, it becomes a bit hypocritical to ignore obvious truths.Yet the fun, the humor, the strength of character and the way Gunn challenges thematic notions raised by most superhero films definitely elevates "Super" in a way that suggests its future will be as "cult favorite" as opposed to "lauded superhero spoof." The way it toys so carelessly with realism and cartoony realism makes the ride a bit bumpy, but judging it purely on entertainment value it's a hilariously good time. One simply must be able to reconcile its various genre elements in order to remain engaged in Gunn's unique and well-intentioned story that deconstructs our previously unquestioned love of superheroes.~Steven C

What an experiment. Nine literal years following the event(s) of Before Sunrise, inside and out of the fictional continuation, came the very well done follow-up, Before Sunset.I adore original sequels. Especially since there are so few of them. Now, I might lose some credibility for this one, but Before Sunset and Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 share something in common with me. Both had probably thee most original concepts for a second chapter.Now, granted, Blair Witch 2 wasn't an overall great film, and nowhere near it's predecessor, but the idea of a sequel based on the idea the first was a movie was truly original. (Sadly, it went nowhere near it could've gone with that initial premise.) Here, with Before Sunrise, we get to literally see where these characters AND actors changed in nine years.Basically, this movie does take place almost a decade after the events of the first movie explaining a ton of what happened following that fateful day for our two lovebirds: Jesse and Celine. They meet again after some time has passed and it's like no time had passed. Again, the camera follows these two soul mates through, now, Paris, and they talk and walk and learn about each other's new lives and loves.As if no time had passed (and it helps seeing these movies back to back,) these two feel just as comfortable with each other as they did when they first met. Only nowthere's tension because they did grow up, apart and with someone else.While, I liked the movie as a whole and absolutely loved the concept of the 9-year gap of both fiction and nonfiction, it wasn't as fresh after awhile as the original. That doesn't take from the fun I did have with this; it was still very nice to follow these two around and how much they understand each other.(Spoiler comingif you don't like those, just skip the next paragraph.)The absolute best part of this movie, when you get past the premise, was the 100% ambiguous finale. The first movie, did give direction where the future was headed, and, yet, you still could draw your own conclusion. This one abruptly ended, which, while I was a little puzzled at first, made me fall in love with the decision of the filmmakers.I did take a Sunday and watch the entire trilogy and I marveled on what it would've been like had I been a fan of this series and had to wait to see what happens next. I can't imagine what it was like for those who fell in love with these characters and had to wait yet another nine years to find out what the ending of this movie meant.I guess I cheated, but nonetheless, I enormously loved this climax.It's a bridge movie, but it's still definitely worth viewing.
The Fountain is one of those movies so hard to review. Well, okay, for people like me that didn't fully get it. I mean, it's not the easiest thing to admit your ignorance.All the way through this movie, and this is my first time watching it  5+ years late, it reminded me of a more recent movie, Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life (2011.) In fact, not knowing anything about The Fountain, I thought this movie had Terrence Malick all over it. Not just for the subject matter  both spoke about the actual "tree of life"  but for the art direction, the mysticism and the space/inner-space journeys. But, alas, I was incorrect. The Fountain was Darren Aronofsky's baby.I digress, The Fountain is a beautiful movie and somewhat deep  though, again, I didn't fully understand the message. As the movie progresses, if you can make it that far (I've heard of people all-but immediately stopping it, not giving it a chance), it slowly, but surely reveals the jumps in time-periods. I counted three separate story lines.The Past. Seems like the Dark Ages  but, then, what do I know  and a man's journey to find the Mayan's "secret" Tree of Life, the original one from the Garden of Eden.The Present. A Man and His Dying wife. Here's the tad bit clichéd, but effective story of a doctor (Jackman) doing everything (albeit mad) he can to cure cancer to save his wife who's on her deathbed, pretty much.The Future (??). This part kinda reminded me of a Pixar short. A man (could be that same doctor??) in a snow globe (??) heading into space and into a dying star.That last part might throw off a lot of people. It sure as hell did the trick on me.Unlike the more recent The Tree of Life, mercifully, this is only 90 or so minutes, verses the 139 agonizing minutes of Tree. Also, The Fountain got to the point faster where Tree was all over the place and a minute few walked with a new meaning of life.I'm not sure what the meaning of The Fountain really wasbut that's okay. It was entertaining, mesmerizing, had fantastic cinematography and a beautiful score. I just wish I "got" it more.Perhaps the person that recommended it to me could fill me in a bit. Hint, hint.
I was thoroughly disappointed in The Last Airbenderbut not just for the low quality it was. It was because I was expecting to laugh out loud throughout, as I do with many M. Night Shyamalan movies. I mean, The Happening was one of the funniest movies I've seen.Okay, there were a few scenes I laughed uncontrollably, such as some of the high-school-esquire choreographed in sync fight dances or whenever Aang (Ringer) opened his puny mouth making little Annie (Jake Lloyd from Star Wars Episode I) seem actually intelligent. But for the most part, I just simply couldn't wait for this experience to be over  and it was, mercifully, only 103 minutes!Perhaps I just wasn't the target audience, and I have yet to see the source material. I would say this was solely intended for the age 2-5 crowd. It's easy enough for them to understand and there was barely an offensive reason to be anything more than 'G.' My guess on why it was 'PG' was the semi-violence, or scenes so incredibly tame, they wouldn't even have been edited out of a Looney Toons short on Saturday mornings.Though it wasn't the worst movie I've seen, nor was it Sleepy-Shyamalan's, it just wasn't any good. The writing was all over the place, the acting was laughable  namely, but not limited to, the main actor, Ringer, who was supposed to carry the picture, the dreadful dialogue was simply painful and the "fight" scenes might have worked on the original Street Fighter II game, but not today. This is the Star Wars Episode I of The Lord of the Rings and the Masters of the Universe of The Chronicles of Narnia.My assumption is Shyamalan was trying to fit an entire series of TV episodes in one movie and even if you haven't seen the original shows, you can clearly see he missed large chunks and began ideas that simply went nowhere. Such as, this little tyke Aang had to learn how to bend the other elements but only got as far as element #2 of 4 when previously he already had #1 down pat.So we have these Wonder-Twin siblings, Katara (Peltz) and Sokka (Rathbone) who are out hunting for food when they stumble upon the 1000-year missing Avatar, Aang, trapped in the ice with his faithful giant flying dog straight out of The Neverending Story. He's wanted by The Fire People for reasons that shift constantly throughout the movie.And this is where it gets somewhat funny and eventually tedious: he's captured 4-5 times and always thwarts them to where you have to wonder if each time he's caught, that was the end to one TV episode with the words "To Be Continued" even though you know he'll be freed the next week.This back and forth prisoner must learn the bending of the other elements so he can truly be the Avatar, or the only one who can bend all elements and bring harmony to the world of fantasy. But, instead of reaching that goal, they simply end with the obligatory final battle accompanied with a "heartfelt" message of "Why can't we all just get along?"I guess I could recommend this to the under-five crowd for the somewhat "feel-good" message  mostly on how to stay away from fire since it burns, and for the semi-good special effects. But for anyone six and above, just skip. Skip it like the movie skips all over globe too many times.
Will Smith has had his hits  more than his misses. Sadly for him, this complete and terrible misstep for him will rank as one of his worst.Winter's Tale was literally all over the place. It never settled in on one subject or one of the multiple story lines. It attempted to create a new universe and failed at every aspect. Even with an all- star cast.Very basically, the movie follows both thief Peter (Colin Farrell) through decades of wandering until he can save someone red-headed and his jealous demon mentor, Pearly (Russell Crowe) who only stole his role from the equally terrible Les Misérables movie.The movie seemed to show some spark of heart, but was so blended in so many random directions, it could never focus long enough for us to be invested. This may be adapted from an astounding novel, but it only gave us the cliff notes version of the real cliff notes. If they said  and they did  this book was unfilmable, they should've listened. This should've been a 13-episode miniseries instead. Then they would've had more time to explore the 82 subplots and additional characters that did not appear in the book. LikeWill Smith.Seriously, I laughed out loud at his character and costume. He was unintentionally bad. Terrible. A Riot. And the CGI placed into his mouth was actually worth watching the entire movie for. It was pre- Jurassic Park bad and that might be a selling point for new viewers to watch and laugh at.I see where they were going with this. Skip it. There is absolutely nothing here to see.* * *Final thoughts: I only watched this because of the fantastic How Did This Get Made? podcast. That episode was awesome and more highly recommended than this piece of crud. Here were a few notes I took during this movie:> Why didn't Ray Liotta play the Crowe character? He definitely fit more perfectly, though I see why Crowe would want to reprise his Les Misérables role.> What was with the score? It was really good and so misplaced here. > NYC 1915: Population 20. > 12th Street. Chicken. 12th Street. Chicken. Must remember this! > Why not ride on the horse to safety? Why did he forget everything? Who the hell cares?
If not for the terrific performances and depth to EACH character in Silver Linings Playbook, this movie would've tanked outside Oprah's OWN cable station.Okay, yes, the story is very well done, as is the cinematography, music, dialogue, etcetera, but above all else is the wonderful performance by Bradley Cooper and I never thought I would say that. I am not a fan of his; in fact, he was my least favorite character in the Hangover series. But, here, he gives the performance of his career.Notice how I didn't mention Jennifer Lawrence yet? Oh, of course, she's excellent. But, I expect that out of her. (I have yet to see her critically, and publicly, panned horror film of 2012, so in my mind, so far, that woman can do NO wrong.) Okay, I enjoyed her once again, but again, I already expected great things from her. I was shocked by how well Cooper played the bipolar hero of our story.Recently released mental patient, Pat (Cooper,) tries to put his life in order by being positive and reclaiming his lost wife at his side. All the while, he's unintentionally testing his elderly parent's (and the police's) patience with his uncontrollable outbreaks and being wooed by the great, and almost equally messed up character of Tiffany (Lawrence.)At probably too long of a length in running time, you know how this is going to pan out, but it's still suspenseful throughout because of the excellence of acting on the side of Cooper and his raging one moment to calm the next. I don't even know too many people with this problem, and yet, I know this is realism.In addition to all the greatness I've spoken about, the movie is full of heart, comedy and great strides in performances from everyone involved, including Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver and yeah, even Chris Tucker. I did love his reoccurring character throughout.Again, it's a tad bit long, especially since the end, while thoroughly welcomed, is foreseen. Overall, it's absolutely a delight and highly recommended.
There are two things I despise when it comes to advertisements: overkill and the ads themselves.Yes, I know we "need" commercials to fund the "free" stuff we see/use, but they really are a chore to get through and when there are too many, I simply make mental notes to never, ever buy their product.The other marketing ads I hate, and mentioned, is excess. My poppa always said, if the ad's too big, or if they over-advertise something, they have little faith in their product. Okay, I was paraphrasing there, but I 100% agree with him. Movies, these days, like the Star Wars, Harry Potter and even the Twilight series, don't even have to promote so much because they're brand names. Smaller films, or products, should advertise some, but let word-of-mouth take over.Whoa, I digressIn Frankenweenie's case, every single movie  and I AM NOT Exaggerating, from the beginning of 2012 until the film's release in October, I saw a preview for this movie. Sometimes, even one of those stupid, Pre-Show-Countdown segments before the previews in the theatre, had behind-the-scenes clips of Frankenweenie, in addition to the inevitable preview following. It was so much overkill, so much advertising, that I vowed never to see this. Besides, it looked like an animated, though Black & White, remake of the 100x told story of Frankenstein.Seriously, it was too much. With each over-used trailer, I wondered how bad this movie was that they had to show it to me a minimum of 4 times, per month, for 9 months. It's absolutely no wonder that it made such an incredibly low sting at the box office. (To date: $35 million domestically and overall, $66 million, worldwide. To most animated films, these days, that's about 10% or less of the normal gross.)Now, that all saidI did break this vow  but then, I saw it at home, once you get through the first half's retread of the classic story the promos laid out, the movie actually gets better. I did find myself enjoying the "retelling/re-imagination" story Tim Burton presented. Although, I still have yet to figure out why it HAD to be in black and white. Sure, it's because, again, it's an old story, but I don't think it needed to be without color.Young Victor brings his dog back to life after a tragic death scene and attempts to hide his secret and yapping dog. When other kids learn of this undead dog, they want infor the school science fair. Chaos ensues and it's a fun climax of corrections.Overall, the movie isn't up to par, even on Director/Writer Tim Burton's standards, or other "fun" animated tales. But, if you can make it through the first half  and you should, then you might be pleased with how Burton could turn his all-but boring (re-)introduction around.Side Note: A lot of people have criticized this as not being "safe" for young kids, i.e. too dark. Maybe, I'm desensitized, but I will admit, it's not for too-young children for being somewhat violent.Side Note II: Another example of way in excess, overkill advertising is this stupid horsey show I see billboards for up and down my work commute every morning and evening. There is a grand total of 7-8 billboards advertising some horse boutique ON EACH SIDE OF THE ROAD. I will not name it, because that's just fueling the fire I want extinguished. I mean, come on, I've heard this show is actually supposed to be good, but why do they have to over-advertise it, sometimes, every few feet with the same billboard advertisement? Even if it's good, I will never, ever, EVER see it because they've shoved it down my throat every day, up to 16 times. No need!
Let's see if I can remember my math: (Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World + Kick-Ass + Batman & Robin)/(Iron Man + Spider-Man + Batman Begins)  (The Dark Knight + Superman: The Movie) = The Green Hornet. Please see the movie and check my math.Incredibly, this mess of a movie is actually good, sometimes a lot of fun, in spurts. It's funny at times, namely the romance between the two leads: Kato (Chou) and Reid (Rogen) and it certainly contains action, mostly fun and mostly from Kato. Unfortunately, it's the uneven and horribly edited other two-thirds you have to endure to get to the good parts.But, even when the movie's so-so, Chou was excellent and a helluva lot of fun to watch in both silent and deadly roles. He literally makes the movie worthwhile. And though I like Rogen a lot (just re-watched Superbad  great movie and was co-written by both Rogen and Evan Goldberg, like The Green Hornet) this was not his best work, either in front or behind the camera.The problem begins and pretty much ends in the editing. Well, that, the aimless and unfinished ideas/script (someone can't swim and two fight fruitlessly over a broad which leads toalmost nowhere) and Diaz in a supporting and annoying role. Okayaside from those, the movie's all over the place and sadly, that happens in the first third whereas most movies fall apart in the third act.That's unfortunate, because they're supposed to hook us and get us to feel out what kind of movie this wants to be. Fine, you do get a feel, but it takes way too long to get there and you just end up waiting, as I did, for the action to start. And when they did produce the goods, it was fun, and Seth delivers some good lines, so if you can make it into the movie without the urge to blast yourself with the same sleep pellets the Hornet acquires (you should've seen that bit in the preview) you might have a good time.Let's seethe plot. Well, "complex" (no, not really, but that's what Kato says) Reid's dad, James (Wilkinson) dies leaving no-ambition Britt Reid (Rogen  is there any other kind of character does he play? Or write?) to gain the newspaper his father owned. Wandering aimlessly, he discovers coffee. No really. And when he does, a whole crime-fighting duo emerges in the form of The Green Hornet Plus One. The "one" being Kato, and in everybody's (aside from Reid's) eyes is Number One.Being a ginormous Superman fan, I can understand it's a stretch to not put two/two together to match Clark & Kal-el, but come onthese two are more obvious than Spider-Pig.AnyhooTheir aimless mission brings them to the crook of the week: Chudnofsky (Waltz, who I'll now appreciate more in Inglourious Basterds (2009)) who starts of as a predictable but cool head of the crime force in the city and seriously goes south  as in character development  fast. I can see where Waltz was going with it, or trying to sort out the badly written script, but he got progressively worse and it was hard to appreciate him.Throw in the inevitable fight amongst the superheroes, the love triangle with Case (Diaz) and the redemption scene and end scene.Funny, as I was writing this review, I came up with more and more this movie resembles (SEE: opening line above)  and believe me, I probably forgot some and no, I haven't seen Sky High, which I've been told should be in the equation as well. So since it's painfully not original, you (or I, here) have to resort to being reliant on the acting, depth and action. Well, they got the last one right and believe it: I'd give a slight recommendation for both the action and KATO!
Let the games continue. 'Saw II' had one great thing going for it: it brought back a true "haunted house." Since I don't believe in ghosts, let me explain  the worn-down house in 'Saw II' that the multiple victims need to navigate through is truly a "haunted" house, in my opinion. They seemed to want to up the ante from 2 victims in the first movie to 3-4 times that and have them all solve another puzzle by Jigsaw simultaneously creating a Hannibal/Clarice scene between the now practically on his deathbed, Jigsaw, and the father of one of the test subjects. That's probably a better term than "victims," as anyone who's seen the 'Saw' series, knows there's always a reason the people are there, and if they're victims, they really only did it to themselves. This is their wake-up call. Do I agree to the extreme measures Jigsaw puts these people through? Not at all. But, I didn't create the (now) long-running series. Previously mentioned, I said they up'd the ante, and they did with gore but more importantly, plot twists. Where part 1 almost started up too many twists/turns, this one is practically tripping over themselves to introduce multiple story lines (obviously setting up the inevitable III, IV+) but that's part of its downfall. While it's fun to try and solve the mystery/whodunit, it's almost exhausting to keep up with everything flashed in front of you in music-video-style. That said, I did enjoy the movie, loved some of the revolutions and it was nice to see more of Jigsaw interact, almost to the point of feeling sorry for him and wondering if he's the smartest person in the room. Perhaps he is, but putting ourselves in the opposite character's shoes, it would probably be hard for us to act differently.
Ahhh..that's so cute. Hit-man wants to be Bourne Again.And even down to its music.If this isn't classic Hollywood. A huge successful movie (or franchise) usually precedes knockoffs. Probably the most famous, and over used, was either Halloween (1978) or The Matrix (1999.) Both movies (and series) spawned absolutely numerous rip-offs. Only a few can pull it off, namely because they actually develop somewhat of a script in advance. Unfortunately, Hit-man, based on some series of video games (of which, I admit to not playing, yet,) failed at every single aspect. Including being the next Bourne movie. And, just for fun, let's list the awards it should be winning in the category of failures:Worst acting. Worst dialogue. Worst attempt at snappy lines. Most overuse of slo-mo. Worst adaptation of a video game. Most inept, incoherent and confusing script of all time. Worst adaption of any source. Most uninteresting characters. Best reason for a good actor (Olyphant) to reconsider simply skimming over a script before agreeing to star. Hero or Anti-Hero you're least likely to root for. Most predictable storyline. Funniest serious movie you'll see. Least likely to promote repeat viewings. Most obvious hit man in the history of hit men. Least interesting and Worst choreographed fight scenes  two for one! Most ironic name given to the writer (Skip.) There is no justice on how this didn't sweep the Razzies, with that many, and probably more, awards.Admittedly, I was confused throughout this boreathon, but what I got from the dumb plot is: a man programmed from birth, baldy #47 (Olyphant) is a, well, I hate to spoil this, but a hit man! And he's assigned the assassination of the Russian President. Things don't go well and predictably, he's set up by the same people who wanted him to carry out this mission. Man, that pains me to write that, because this plot line has been used so many times that simply renting Hit-man should tell you that at some point he'll be double-crossed. Duh.Well, he meets this girl (another wildly unoriginal and foreseen event) and maybe, MAYBE, he'll lighten up. Not really, but at that point the movie's so incredibly bad and laughable, you'll accept the 95% great Olyphant's apology (if he would ever.) Perhaps this is my fault. Recently, I've yearned for new action flicks and always end up with comedies. Maybe I should choose one of those horrible Rom-Coms in search for an action movie. Hollywood's just become lazy, and here's the proof. Even the actors in the movie look uninterested. Like I said, if the writer's name (SKIP) doesn't give away what should've happened in the first place, you should take that same advice and SKIP this movie. Afterall, it has ZERO attributes.
My preconceived thoughts, thanks only to the marketing, on The Wolverine involved me rolling my eyes. Yet, another Superhero/Comic Book part 2 (in this case, Wolverine's second solo feature) that our hero loses their powers, the very thing I go see these movies for. Yet another movie I had to count the minutes until the inevitable return of their abilities. Do writers even consider how unoriginal this concept is?Hmmm how many have there been, excluding this one? And what were the reasons?1. Iron Man 2  Heart problems. 2. The Dark Knight  Wants to retire.3. Spider-Man 2  Anxiety. 4. Superman II  Lost for love. 5. Men in Black II  Amnesia. 6. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer  To each other. As some kind of comedy. Kinda.But, I will say this: half way through this incredibly tedious, boring, terribly paced, toned down, un-fun, laughable dialogue and horribly choreographed "action" movie, I changed my opinion and actually wished my favorite X-Men character's (Wolverine) powers wouldn't return if this was how it was going to go.I understand they wanted to make a more "grown-up" superhero movie, but still listing it as just that and keeping the PG-13, is a contradictionin this particular case. "The" Wolverine's really dark  he even drops the F-bomb in this, so if they truly wanted to make it more like an adult adaptation, ditch the too-low MPAA rating. Sadly, that wasn't the only problem the Director failed at.The Walk the Line, Girl, Interrupted and Cop Land director, James Mangold, had absolutely no clue on how to make these characters the very least bit interesting, what makes action scenes  especially in the X-Men universe  exciting or flow right or understood the mythology behind "the" Wolverine character. Even Hugh Jackman, reprising his role for the sixth time, looked bored and ready to quit. I was, too  I almost took a break during this painstaking long movie and not even ask my friend what I missed upon returning.Oh, and don't get me started on the storytelling from the characters. The endless, relentless and uninteresting childhood stories the characters stop the film every 5-10 minutes to tell us. I couldn't stop laughing when I mimicked the numerous "When I was very young" stories following the feature to my friend.Basically, the preview gives away 85% of the movie, leaving very little surprises. "The" Wolverine is summoned to Japan to accept thanks for saving a man during World War II, but not just thanks: the gift of the death to "the" Wolverine's instant healing and eternal life "curse." So, when "the" Wolverine loses said power, he's shot multiples of times, including dead-center with a shotgun, and he continues on like they were scratches. Will he get his powers back? Oh, gee. I dunno. Maybe. But, he will begin a chemistry-free love affair with a cardboard-cutout chick that had less depth of the width of said cardboard. The movie was practically score-less, music-less, story-less and action-less. Along with the characters so incredibly dull, there was very little of interest here. And like I said, even Jackman looked uninterested and just going through the motions.I wasn't a big fan of Iron Man 3 since it contained a minute amount of action, but at least that had a huge supply of comedy. Even "the" Wolverine's signature small one-liners seemed to be written by a three-year old and were so predictable, I quoted them (whispered out loud) before he said them during my initial viewing.Oops, sorry: Initial? Probably: only.
What can I say about the Were-Rabbit than it was absolutely fabulous! There's not a single area I could zone in on that can be negatively criticized. For, it was enormously funny  Gromit always cracks me up and his mute but loud expressions always have me rolling, it was adventurous, inventive, had a great soundtrack and score and is simply great for the whole family. Not to mention the climax just goes on and on  and that's a good thing. You can't help but laugh and roll with the excitement simultaneously admiring the genius on what they did with what was around.Wallace runs a anti-pest type company that the entire community relies on and on the side he craves cheese and inventions. Luckily for him, his faithful and thoroughly superior pet/friend, Gromit, keeps him in check for the most part.With an outbreak of rabbits  hilariously portrayed by poor overworked Gromit, who humanely takes care of the captured "pests"  Wallace decides on de-veggie the rabbits. In an experiment gone wrong, a mutant rabbit now stalks the street.Further, the town is terrorize much like the days of old werewolf movies, but in this case a gigantic rabbit beast that Wallace & Gromit try to capture to both save the city and their name. Meanwhile, Wallace is in pursuit of Lady Campanula Tottington who's also wooed by the sinister Victor Quartermaine.Will they stop the Were-Rabbit and save the day? Spoiler Alert! It's a G-rated cartoon.I don't want to go as far as to say you have to be a Wallace & Gromit or British humor fan, so I will say, regardless, this movie is excellent. There is absolutely no harm in taking a viewing to one of the most inventive movies I have ever seen. Especially with what happens in the background. SEE IT!
1. And speaking of Jews, I haven't laughed this hard since Schindler's List.2. There's more child abuse in these 101 minutes than in the last 101 years of the Catholic Church.3. Is this a Kirk Cameron movie or do horny teen boys actually refuse to drink (and even pour out) the beers they're given by a hot chick at a party? 4. Lines such as: "This just got real...Real stupid" need to be placed at the beginning of a film like this as a disclaimer and not towards the middle when it's already clear.5. The story of 'Three Blind Mice' came to mind when I saw it took three writers to pen this.6. I don't even like football and I can distinguish between a touchdown and a field goal. But, apparently those three writers couldn't.7. Whelp, Taylor Lautner's list of terrible sequels grows.8. Turning this into a drinking game for whenever a funny joke is told is like attending an AA meeting.9. You might as well believe Kmart serves chicken chow mein if you're also told Motel 6 has a romantic hot tub.10. The lack of a gag-reel end credits scene proves there were never any to begin with.11. Here's to hoping this movie made money only because it was funded by the same moviegoers who unapologetically slow down traffic just to look at a horrible car accident.12. When your Congress can plot to shut down the government more efficiently than these bottom dwellers can plot a thoughtless film, Armageddon's definitely close.13. Even the old "I Love the '80s" show would hate their '80s party.14. With the shameless and seemingly endless plug, the list of Kmart's bad decision making continues.15. I'm thinking God's promise not to flood the Earth again was reconsidered following this release. Heck, He's probably already regretted Adam Sandler.16. It's okay for married men to look at other woman as long as their wives only look at "gay, dead or cartoon" men. Yep, that's the mentality here.17. Grindhouse movies make Bmovies look cool, fun and relevant. Sandler's attempts at bad comedy look sloppy, desperate and very 1982.18. Using a dry-erase marker to draw incredibly lame tattoos on a man-child doesn't make him look tough, but it does show the make-up crew had balls for that third grade idea.19. With each scene more painful than the last, breaking my bones in a quad accident I had in Mexico sounds like Heaven.20. Can someone please tell Sandler he's more of a joke in Hollywood than M. Night Shyamalan?21. YouTube must've been behind this. The countless random clips had way too many annoying advertisements to be real entertainment.22. Showing almost zero remorse for breaking your child's leg is evidence that CPS can be effective.23. There's a special place in hell for this cast and crew.24. The only way I couldn't stop my mouth from being agape in disgust throughout all of this mess, was to attempt to convince myself Adam Sandler was literally trying to make the dumbest comedy of all time while simultaneously saying "Fvck You" to his audience.25. It's incredible that Adam Sandler has increasingly gotten worse with every new movie I see of his. First I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry was my least favorite movie of his. Then, I saw Grown Ups, and that took the crown. Jack & Jill was worse than those and following that, That's My Boy became my most hated of his movies. Well, you gotta hand it to Sandler; now that Grown Ups 2 is his absolutely worst film, he's been nothing but consistent. I can't wait to see what sh|t he'll come up with next.
Believe it or not, there are some positives about the latest failure of trying to revitalize the spoof genre in Vampires Suck.#1 Jenn Proske as "Becca Crane" was amazing. Seriously. She nailed "Bella Swan" from the Twilight series perfectly. She had the right moves, mannerisms and melancholy attitude to prove once and for all Bella is a horrible character, not to mention a terrible role model.#2 I admit there were a few chuckles. I would be lying if I didn't say I laughed maybe 4 times throughout the entire 80 minutes.#3 Wait, that's it. The rest was crap.I can see where they were trying to be either exactly like or the next Scary Movie, but it wasn't a tenth of the creativity level as the Wayans classic. In fact, that spoof, only part one, mind you, was released in 2000 and was the last good spoof. NO parody, including Vampires Suck, comes remotely close.Truthfully, how on earth do they make a satire that's way less funny than its source material? I remembered laughing all the way through the original Twilight and still more (than Vampires Suck) in New Moon. While we're at it, how on Earth did they find this B-list actor, Matt Lanter as "Edward Sullen," who, incredibly, not only acts circles around Robert Pattinson, the original Edward, but is so much better looking?This comedy was boring, obvious, predictable and just plain lazy. There were so many missed opportunities that if the directors sobered up for a few seconds they might have either stopped production all together on moral grounds while taking the hit, or ask if anyone, ANYONE in the cast & crew thought ANY of this was funny.The movie follows the first two terrible Twilight films fairly closely where as you have sooo sad Becca moving into a town full of vampires  man, that joke of pointing them out got old really, REALLY fast  and there she meets Edward and the suck/hate relationship blossoms.Again, like the original piece of crap, Edward leaves, leaving the door for shirtless Jacob to move in. Along with the Black Eyed Peas. Oh, and by the way, despite the original characters "kind of" look like the band, that would've been a funny gag 5 years ago. It was like making a reference to the sitcom, Joey  who the hell remembers either?I would say the biggest surprise is the Rotten Tomato score of 3%. Even though Vampires Suck, and definitely blows, how on Earth did this get a lower rating than Twilight?
I've heard many a talk about Suspiria and I've never seen it. Not the movie, a trailer or hell, a clip of it previously. And I've known about this movie for many decades; I've even listened to the main theme many times from a horror-movie-score-collaboration CD I've owned.I love these experiences. Going into a movie, especially a well-known, cult film, cold. (Well, that's not 100% true in this case  the score does mention the word "witch," so beyond knowing it's famous and it's horror, I knew it had something to do with witches.)The result of me seeing this may not be the same as most people. I cannot comment on the DVD or BluRay version of this since I have not seen either. I wanted to see this one night for my October Horror Movie Marathon of movies I've never seen before and the best I could come up with was a YouTube version. So, maybe the incredibly BAD dubbed and TERRIBLE dialogue was part of that version. I dunno. What I do know is: I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt (for the dialogue) since I watched this from YouTube.Beyond that and my free-pass, I observed the movie fully. It wasn't the most original movie, even for 1977 and the acting was subpar. But, I felt a lot of it was well shot and interesting despite the incredibly bad decisions our "heroine" makes throughout.Basically, the story goes: a newcomer to the ballet world ventures to Europe and inadvertently gets involved in a cult academy. Weird scene after the next evolves until the final confrontation.Following this, and a day later, I would watch another one of Director Dario Argento's films to understand how weird this guy is. That movie, Phenomena (aka Creepers,) helped me see what his visions were and they don't mesh with my ideal horror film. So, there may be more out there that like his odd sense of filmmaking, but it's not my cup of European Tea.Unfocused and random this movie may be, it's ten times better than Phenomena (aka Creepers,) but it doesn't match the better horror movies locally made. Skip it.* * * Final thoughts: The overall score was meh, but the main theme  the same one I heard on that compilation CD was fantastic. I just wish the movie mimicked the theme.
I really don't want to start this review of this fine movie, Tron: Legacy, on a bad note, but I gotta get one thing out of the way: I HATED the character of Caster (Michael Sheen)! He was the (extremely) gay version of Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) of The Matrix Reloaded. Every second he was on screen made me squirmand no, it's not because I'm "homophobic"on the contrary, it's because I think he's giving me a bad name. Sure, it would be okay if Johnny Depp played him, as he's pretty much done countless times, Johnny would know how to make that character interesting.I thoroughly digress: Tron: Legacy was one of the most visually stunning movies I've seen. It would be foolish to compare it to the original, 28 years prior, but the budget on graphics were VERY well spent. Actually, make that, that's all they spent the money on. Well, that, and advertising.I'm not trying to be too harsh. The score was very good, but had little to do with the first. The acting was decent, but it boiled down to the bright spot, Quorra (Wilde) and a clueless  which is VERY rare for Bridges  Kevin Flynn. The rest of the cast was paint-by-numbers, literally.The problem, aside from the flamboyant distraction of Caster, lies in the story, which, by no means was terrible, but that along with the pacing made for a very long movie. It was so slow at times, I almost wanted to ride my own cycle to the next scene. I would've at home  in the form of the fast-forward button.The story of a young Bruce Wayne, er, I mean, Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund in a flat, heartless performance) who inadvertently gets sucked into the same machine his dad did a few decades past. All this time, Sammy was waiting for his Daddy to return and to think he was sloching in some achient arcade video gamewhich happens to be one of favorites as a kid!Anyways, immediately, Sam is sucked up and sent to fight as a neon-gladiator until he uses the skills shown in the first part of the film to escape. He does, in fact, meet up with his dad again and plots their escape.Of course there's a short time frame to leave the "grid" or "Matrix" to put it cliché terms. Battle, battle, battle and you'll have to pay to see if they escape.And you should pay. No matter what I say or anyone else. This is movie to be seen, if at all, in the theaters. I paid for the IMAX 3D version, but seriously, I don't think you have to go that far. The 3D wasn't great, but then again, we're dealing with Disney who can't get 3D right to save their studios.I recommend on the graphics, scope, score and the character of Quorra alone. Like Avatar  not one of my favorites, if you're gonna see this type of movie, it needs to be viewed on the big screen.
Back in the 1990s, I first saw The Long Kiss Goodnight. Despite the low box-office return or public appeal, I really, really enjoyed it. So, when it was presented to me on Amazon for a low, low price on BluRay, I snatched it up, even without having seen it in over 15-16 years.Am I happy about the purchase? Eh, yeah. Since it was cheap.Actually, the over-long film suffered from many problems, but overall, it was actually enjoyable. It's just hard to watch in 2013 following the excellent Bourne Trilogy. (Yeah, just parts 1-3.)You see, the concept is almost identical with the exception of swapping sexes. Here, teacher/good housewife Samantha Caine has a great life with a family, but doesn't remember her life prior to just before giving birth to her daughter and being found on a beach.She hires the best of the best private investigators to find her past and only reaches some success with the bottom of the barrel Mitch. Onlydoes she really want to find herself again?I've always loved Geena Davis, and sad she never got the superstardom as she deserved. And who doesn't, in their right mind, love Samuel L. Jackson? They both play a huge part in this movie's enjoyment.Even though it's really too long, and it's hard to hold this up in a Post-Bourne world, it's still a fun watch.
Thank goodness I waited a good 15-16 hours after watching the despicable Grown Ups to write this. I knew how I was going to begin my review with a disclaimer that the following is for GROWN UPS only because I knew it was going to be chalk full of swear words on how I wanted to describe my loathing of the movie.How unprofessional, unoriginal, uninspired and well, un-grown up is that? Whew. I am calm now. And I can begin the healing process.Not before I say this: Grown Ups starts bad, got worse and I almost pulled out my remaining hair before it was over. My stomach literally hurt  no, not from laughter.This abomination has almost zero plot; this hateful movie was just to get yesteryear's buffoons together, à la any rat pack movie and please forgive me for comparing these has-beens to the late and great 'pack. That said, I will try to summarize the movie just as quickly as they took to write it: boys play basketball, have a "great coach" who dies years later and the boys (notice: not MEN) reunite using that as an excuse to goof off, be mean and show off their not-so-trophy wives, kids and rented cars.That's pretty much it. That sums up the aimless "comedic adventure." After the six minutes it took them to write the outline (I'm assuming there was no actual screenplay) they chose follow that with incredibly lousy jokes that would beat any horse beyond recognition, terrible music that attempted to remind us of "back in the day"  bah, sporadic editing and an extremely absent director. The final result? Drop dead (if you think this is even remotely a) comedy.Sure, they looked like they were having a ball, and maybe that's where I got the Rat Pack reference, but they failed to make it even minutely interesting to us. There: I completed this without a single cuss word, but if this is what it means to grow up, I'm going to end it now. BANG.
I haven't seen this low-rent kind of acting or dialogue so laughable in what should've been a serious film since porn. As a matter of fact, I think the last time was an X-rated film featuring "real military men." And let me tell you: those first couple of minutes were a lot more fun than all 110 minutes of Act of Valor.I digress. Act of Valor was made so ridiculously, so unrealistically "patriotic," that Michael Bay should sue for defamation of character. But, he really should pity them on their YouTube attempt to remake his style.Here's a paraphrased scene of the movie and how much unintentional comedy was in this movie:"You, a terrorist, are captured. You have a wife and daughter that you want to see again?"  The Good Guy."Yes, every moment of my life."  The Bad Guy."Then, you will tell us what we need to know.""Okay, okay, you twist my arm. It's going down today, and we're using these vests that explode and there are 16 of us, and they're entering the U.S. of A right now."Now, wouldn't Zero Dark Thirty been PG-Rated had they removed all that needless torture if the soldiers just simply asked where Bin Laden was?This is the first Rated-R "Church" like film I've seen. Meaning, it's shot like a Christian movie and I've seen my share of those low-budget, holy movies with terrible acting and dialogue, but never a Rated-R one. At least they're original on that aspect.All you need to know about the, if you can call it one, plot, is Bad Guy #1 is working with Bad Guy #2 to create a terrorist explosion on US soils, since the opening and horrific scene of 20+ kids getting blown to Heaven wasn't tragic enough. So, rumored real-life Joes, or "The Good Guys," with zero faults, weaknesses or personalities, go after said enemies.Since this "Based on True Events" movie feels so fictional, all the way through it, I wanted to watch everything, anything fictional, like any of the Bourne films  skipping the last one, or even Independence Day for more of a manipulative, but, at least, entertaining, patriotic feeling. When I'm watching action and fiction, I'd like them to be honest about it.Look. I love America. I 100% (more, if I could) support the troops. I practically thank them verbally or to myself almost daily for protecting us and their sacrifices. But, these bland characters felt like the Uncle Sam poster: they were so cliché, flawless, mechanical, wooden, unidentifiable from the next soldier, unrealistic, soulless and "perfect" for 1940s military recruitment film stock. IF ANYONE WERE TO BUY THIS BULLSHIT RECRUITMENT PROPAGANDA todayI fear for our nation's safety.Don't even get me started on the most hilarious part of the movie, aside from all the absurd and funny slo-mo: whenever the camera switched to the first-person CALL OF DUTY video game mode, I truly laughed out loud. I don't even play those games, and I laughed hard whenever the director tried to "switch it up" to try and relate to the younger and influential crowds by making real combat JUST LIKE their video game pastimes.Allow me to tone it down for a bit, and yeah, this is a spoiler you won't care hearing about, dare you subject yourself to this mess of a film. These barely different shades of green react when one of them self-sacrifices themselves on a grenade. I dare you, if you read this following your viewing, to name the character who performed that ACT OF VALOR. I watched that scene of remarkable heroism of him "taking one for the team" but could not, for the life of me, care about that individual since the writer, director and actor failed to keep me interested, invested or informed of who was who. No depth was given to anyone, except, maybe the "bad men." They were also as equally generic, plain and clichéd, but at least we knew who they were. Weren't we supposed to know who our heroes were? Weren't we supposed to care if they lived or died? I guess the Director(s), Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh, felt the American warriors didn't even deserve more recognition than the cardboard cutout soldiers the "actors" portrayed them to be.This movie is sad in so many ways. Such as, even though it couldn't have been cheap to make, a few of the action scenes, aside from the comical POV/video game shots, were well-crafted and some of the aerial shots were "pretty," it still lands as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.Mercifully, I still support the troops. This, in NO WAY, has deterred me. This is just a couple of people's vision of the perfect soldier(s). It's pure fiction marketed as "possibly true" and is not even okay for fun action. This is the combat version of both The Room and Troll 2.And like those two movies, it's okay to laugh at practically every scene. For, none of its real, well thought out or could ever happen.Side Note: Really? You had to rub it in by picking the two American destinations for the bad guys to attack that mean the most to me? Seattle and Las Vegas  the only two places I both love and visit regularly! Hell, if I didn't already hate this movie for every minute it was on my screenthis was the icing.
There's a Red-Band trailer for Horrible Bosses. Heed my warning: do NOT watch that prior to seeing this movie. And though the original "green" preview gives away just enough to get you into a seat, the Red-Band, which, by the way, is thee most rated R trailer I've ever seen, gives away at least 80% of the "surprises."Sorry, had to get that out first. And although a LOT of Horrible Bosses is predictable, it's still more fun to see the cameos and plot twists firsthand during the feature.What I'd like to also get out of the way was the "horrible" missed opportunity they had hereto show realistically horrible bosses. Sure, these might mirror some supervisors, but they were so chock-full of clichés, that it took a lot away from what I actually wanted to relate to prior to going to see this. Also, a lot here from these three male leads, Jason Bateman as Nick, Charlie Day as Dale and Jason Sudeikis as Kurt, has already been done in Nine to Five, albeit from female leads.The comparisons are obvious between the movies, down to a comedy about employees fantasying about killing their boss, while drinking alcohol and using drugseven with rat poison. And though I laughed hard in spots here, in Horrible Bosses, I could more easily relate to Dabney Coleman's evil boss than any of the three here. Also, Nine to Five was a whole lot funnier and still holds up well today.I digress; Horrible Bosses was still a lot of fun, thanks to all three leads, and especially Kevin Spacey  the biggest asshole of the film. I believe, despite my review here, this movie can and probably will grow on me with multiple viewings, of which I'm not opposed to.So, what we have here is hard-working, but shut-out Nick vs. his boss, the greedy, selfish, profane and jealous Dave (Spacey.) The innocent, Zach Galifianakis-stand-in Dale vs. his sexually active and abusive superior, Julia (Jennifer Aniston.) And finally, Happy-To-Clock-In Kurt vs. his friend/former boss's son, the stereotypical male-doofus new boss: Bobby (Colin Farrell.)Again, like Nine to Five, Nick, Dale and Kurt plot the deaths of their nemesis's over alcohol and sometimes drugs. But, from the planning stages to the, uh, execution?, it's hilarious, despite a somewhat silly, cop-out and easy conclusion.They tell me that this is VERY HARD R, and yeah, it's extremely raunchy at times, but I've seen worse. It's not for kids, but not just for that reason  a lot of this has to go over their heads, though the teen boys might want to "almost" see Jennifer Anniston's breasts.Definitely a recommend.
Wow. For being 100s (or more) of years in the future, it sure looks like barely anything has changed 'In Time' (3/10 Stars.) Okay, the biggest difference is now people are "engineered" to stop aging at 25 years old (ALTHOUGH, HALF THE CAST LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE IN THEIR 30s) and have to "earn" their years following that by either A: Be Wealthy in Years or B: Working minimal jobs for eternity. It's a tad bit confusing at first, but after you get the somewhat original concept of currency now being "time" everything else is either bland, boring or both. Good-hearted, and expert sprinter, Will (Justin Timberlake) suddenly gains a hundred years when he's told the system is only in place to help the rich, and when his mother quickly "runs out of time" i.e. dies, he's hell-bent on bringing down the system. But, then he's hell-bent on a new girl. But, then he's hell-bent on helping the less-fortunate. But, then he's hell-bent on...you get the picture that this picture is all over the place. Suffice to say, it's a boring future with a plot that's been around for centuries. It's a Twilight Zone episode that's stretched four times too long and contains far too many (UN-FUNNY) puns on the "time" word. For example, my ex of many years ago probably got sick of the pun on his name. Let's just say it went something like: J__in Time. (That was just to protect the innocent.)
A must-see for any Airplane!-enthusiast, The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! is so close to perfect, from beginning to end, you'll wonder why the defunct TV program didn't last. For, it's all the same jokes.Perhaps that was their gamble: only the 50 or less people who saw the show  me, included  would recognize these replayed jokes. Nevertheless, this movie is downright hilarious and it never, ever lets up or changes course.Very few creators (Abrahams, Zucker & Zucker) of comedy can achieve such heights. Despite some recent setbacks, they've been behind masters of slapstick  Airplane!, Top Secret! and this one from Police Squad!  wow, they definitely like to shout a lot. So, if you're into silly humor, like I happen to be, watch this. Of course, if you haven't already, shame on you. Check this Beaver out now.Police Squad's Frank Drebin (Nielsen) beats up innocents and terrorist alike, whether by stumbling into them or hitting them with his runaway car. But now, he MUST SAVE THE QUEEN, who happens to be visiting their town of L.A.Evil, eeeevil Vincent Ludwig (Montalban) has plans for the perfect assassin and his lovely, but blameless assistant Jane (Presley) serves her purpose of spying on Drebin. You know how the story goesFrank: It's the same old story. Boy finds girl, boy loses girl, girl finds boy, boy forgets girl, boy remembers girl, girl dies in a tragic blimp accident over the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. Jane: Goodyear? Frank: No, the worst.This review would be increased tenfold if I was to lay out (okay, fine, copy) all the fantastic quotes, but this is a great example of what you're getting yourself into. If you like the above, you'll love the rest of the movie.And if you have seen this movie, and it's been awhile, like for me, watch it again. I practically had it memorized from seeing it probably two dozen times as a kid, and still, I was cracking up and enjoyed every last scene. Yeah, even with OJ Simpson as one of the leads.Side Note: As much as I love pure slapstick  not the crappy Vampires Suck and Disaster Movies of today - my only (SLIGHT) complaint is when they look at the camera to indicate even they think this is crazy. They do it a little too much in this movie  but not enough to downgrade the movie. Yes, my favorite comedy of all time, Airplane!, barely did it once or twice  but for 99% of that movie, it was a perfectly insane world.
Oh, if I ever want to make it in Hollywood or get into (the movie business type of) bed with Steven Spielberg, I better not say the followingand I am resistingbut I can't help it: Kate Capshaw nearly destroyed the Indiana Jones franchise.Let the flood gates openShe was AWFUL! She was the Jar-Jar of Indy's adventures. She was the Cousin Oliver of the series. She was comic relief no one asked for.Dr. Jones's second episode: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom wasn't great to begin with, heck, it's 50 steps below the original masterpiece, Raiders of the Lost Ark, but let's add in the most annoying female lead/sidekick since Sylvester Stallone shouted: Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot!Too harsh? And I love(d) Estelle Getty  a great and golden girl.Fine, forgetting the "Willie" (Mrs. Spielberg's character), the movie is all-but a cartoon adventure and contains more "family" orientated scenes than the deeper first installment. And yet, they also thought it would be a good idea to throw in enough grotesque segments to further the "PG-13" movement. Eh. Make up your mind.Also, with the enormous success of Raiders, they decided it was an appropriate time to tone down the special effects and budget. Huh? Where Raiders contained one unbelievable scene of FX  the finale of claymation  Tempe of Doom contained dozens of more laugh-out-loud scenes, including, but not limited to: water pouring out of the side of the mountain and the little, tiny dolls in the "roller coaster" scene on the tracks. (Side Note: That happened to be one of my favorite scenes in the film, though I have to look away when the characters appears as toys instead of humans.)Let's fast forward a bit, leap frogging over the enormously superior follow-up/make-up third installment and realize, even though how much of a letdown this film was, it could be worse: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  the long-overdue sequel few asked for and those who did regretted it.That leads me to wonder: was this movie a complete waste, as it all-but indicates above? Honestly, no. In addition to the always-excellent score by John Williams, the opening was grand  I absolutely loved the number the aforementioned disappointment Kate sang: "Anything Goes." I liked the gun vs. sword follow-up gag, even though this is a prequel  still, it was a nice homage. And believe it or not, even "Short-Round" (Jonathan Ke Quan) was a needed and real comic reliefespecially when Willie was such a dud.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) gets dropped (LITERALLY) into an adventure involving an evil man's quest for 5 glowing stones to, well, what else? to RULE THE WORLD. You see, just one magic stone can harvest and flourish an entire village, but that, along with all the children have been stolen to find the two final stones in order to complete world dominance.That's a quick synopsis. And another reason I didn't care for this movie all that much  aside from the bad aftertaste you'll get if you watch the first two simultaneously. I liked (in Part One, Three and Four) the fact that Indy does his research and willingly goes on a trek for (insert human or artifact here) VS simply crash landing into a "mission."After that wonderful opening I mentioned, Indy's escape plane he took when he's chased by greedy business men crashes and the Stone-Less tribe begs him to find the Stone to return the tribe to greatness. OH, and to possibly bring back the kidnapped offspring. If he has the time.It's a weak excuse to get Indy into action. And it's even more unbelievable on how Willie "has" to tag along. But, be that as it may, it still has some fun action/adventure sequences such as Short Round and Indy being trapped when Scream-Queen Willie is "bugged" out by having to, oh, I don't know, rescue them.This movie is literally for kids, namely ones that don't appreciate the first masterpiece and the excellent follow-up (only #3, The Last Crusade, that is.) It's a live action cartoon adventure that's best served with no-Indiana Jones knowledge prior to going in. It's like watching Die Hard 2: Die Harder before you explore John McClane's excellent other adventures.Side Note: Since this doesn't have to do with the quality of the film, I'm mentioning it here: One of my all time favorite video games growing up was the Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom arcade game. I played it constantly, alongside Tron. And I played the Indy game before I actually saw the movie. So it got me pumped for the score, and the quotes, such as "We walk from here" and whatever the bad guy says. So, now, when I watch the movie, I do get a nice sense of nostalgia when I heard the score and lines. Unfortunately, that doesn't make a better movie, but it sure as heck reminds me of a simpler and fun time of my life.
Mama is certainly not a Mother's Day gift I would like to present to my mom. Even if she liked horror movies.While it was nice to have a diverse group of family members in the tired ghost genre as of late, especially involving Jessica Chastain play a different, albeit The Runaways, role, the movie was all over the place with just as many plot holes as the ghost created to teleport.Even though not seen, but implied nonetheless, the movie opens with violent acts against both family and, sadly, very young children. Father decides that the best method to deal with the recession is to point-blank kill his wife, two infant children and probably himself, but gets interrupted by the title character.For the next five years, the children are cared for by said "Mama Ghost" with a rundown place that never gets cleaned or heck, dusted and fed, incredibly, a diet of rolling cherries of unknown origin or explanation.Mercifully (or not) for the children, the kids' uncle spends every last dime, and more so, to find them. Only, they bring some deadly baggage with them and are forced to deal with, for the most part, the barely committed punk rocker girlfriend of the Uncle who showed the true meaning of the Evil Stepmother.Despite the violent ideas in the opening, the movie started off well and continued that way until about the second half where it lost steam, direction and headed right over a cliff of a finale.I do not believe I have spoiled anything you can't read in a basic synopsis or wouldn't understand had you not seen the movie, but I would really be spoiling a whole lot more if I pointed out all that was wrong with this mess of a screenplay. I can say that most will be raising eyebrows when the end is revealed and one realizes the entire movie could've been over with in mere minutes.Oh, and get ready for some laugh out bad CGI and ghost movements. People: it's 2013, not 1984. Ghostbusters is absolutely forgiven for the abilities back then. No need to mimic them in today's time.Send Mama to the Home.
There are a lot of people who didn't like Ocean's Twelve. Enough so, I feel they made Ocean's Thirteen as a make-up movie, à la Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade when Part Temple of Doom was such a joke. Of course, using that theory, they still need to make Indy 5 for that tragedy of part IVAt any rate, I'm a HUGE 2001 Ocean's Eleven fan. I've seen that movie more than a, ah hem, dozen times. This one, not as much, but I still appreciate it when I do see it.Is it anywhere close to the magic that (somewhat) part one held? No. But, it's a fun addition and original to the max.Basically, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and crew stole more than $150 million in the original movie from three Las Vegas casinos. They were set to get away with it and live happily ever after, or so people who only saw part one would count on.In this follow-up, the man they stole from, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) comes a'looking and teams up with another thief to ensure they pay back the money with interest. Playing it by ear, they cook up some European schemes to "earn" back the money so they don't get murdered, or worse.Despite the lack of the gorgeous Vegas backdrop, or the normality of the original, Ocean's Twelve does manage to capture the same crew with pinpoint accuracy on their individual characters and the dialogue is still incredibly rich and absolutely hilarious. I always love George Clooney and mostly love Brad Pitt  together, whether this is the original or not, they certainly deliver in the fun I watched time and again in the original.In truth, this movie is a mess at times. It's random and despite the original aspect of characters having to make up for their sins in the first movieit's still a ton of fun, funny and the cinematography and scenes are crisp and fun to look at.In truthPart Two or Twelve, honestly, I wish this movie hadn't been made. I loved them just getting away with it in the original and riding off into the sunset. Butif it had to be made, I would have strongly preferred this version. I am a fan. And I endorse this.
I am a super-hero/comic-book fan, namely the silver screen adaptations, but I always dread the part twos of any of their series. Kick-Ass 2 falls right in line with my dread for the first follow-up.Like Superman II, The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2 and many, many more, our friendly neighborhood crime-fighter either loses their powers or wants to and it's a great bulk of the film to get them to regain their muscle to understand their "great responsibility." Kick-Ass 2  and yeah, this is a spoiler on the plot  doesn't sway from that cliché by having the best character from the original, Hit-Girl, quit the business.Not only is this ploy worn-out and overused, it's flat out annoying because we all know both: the powers will return, but it'll take way too long and there's usually never a guarantee there'll be a part III, so why waste this precious screen time on the same ole trick?But, beyond this lazy writing, I did have a good time with this movie. It certainly wasn't perfect or close to as great as I felt the original was, but it still was a lot of fun. They didn't fail to remember these movies are rated R for a reason and I appreciate unapologetic filmmaking.Basically, Dave/Kick-Ass has given upagain for clichéd reasons, but when he's needed, he's abandoned by Mindy/Hit-Girl and spends a chunk of the movie getting her back as she's obviously and absolutely irreplaceable. The past plays forward as good vs. evil gets gray.While, again, not perfect, it's a ton of fun and if you're a fan of the original, you'll probably like this slightly lesser follow-up.* * * Final thoughts: I don't blame Jim Carrey  who was awesome here  for speaking out against violence in films, but to be shocked this had too much school violence, which it doesn't, is just plain dumb ignorance. He could've starred in "Brokeback Mountain 2: Straight Shootin'" and be surprised he had to be in a gay sex scene. I sincerely hope he didn't think his outburst hurt the box office. That was just the ignorance of the audience. This was a very fun movie to watch!
I don't want to start off on a negative note  oh, that so wouldn't be like me  so let me tell you of the positive that came out of Strange Wilderness: The few  and FAR between  stock footage scenes with (mostly) Peter's (Zahn) commentary were a tad bit funny. (I'm a stats guy, so let's say that took up 2.05% of the film.)Whew, that was hard. It's almost like I had a legal commitment to say something nice, or knew one of the producers who I owed a favor tobecause I can't get rid of the bad taste this retched film left.Pineapple Express, it wanted to be. Comedy, it yearned to be labeled as. Disaster amongst all terrible films it ended up as. This horribly edited and thoughtless romp barely had a good idea to begin with and was made by the same people who used the same drugs that were found in the movie.Seriously. There can be no other explanation on how the film got funding, or how the "stars" actually agreed to almost put a stop to their careers, or how they thought any of this was funny, even on paper. Oh! I thought of another positive: this made me second-guess the other movies I rated low. Perhaps, I was just too harsh on them.Five second synopsis: Animal show host diesson continues broadcasting show into groundIDEA: film Bigfoot & get back on top. Fini.I think it took them less time for the rest of the screenplay and a little bit more on planning on where the characters would fall next. They couldn't have spend any time on the jokes, because even the decent ones  or, let me rephrase, the models of something similar to humor  abruptly ended before the punch line, whether by bad editing, bad execution or both. Don't even get me started on the endless, mindless and scattered subplots that went nowhere or what happened to Bigfoot or why.My friends criticize my critiques of Adam Sandler and his films. This is just by his production company, but it should drive my point home. Please, someone let me know how this didn't shut down his production company, Happy Madison, or his career. All I could add to my disdain for Sandler would be: "Your Honor, I have no further evidence or witnesses. The defense rests."
Forgive me up front by saying: I truly believe both Johan Hill and Russell Brand might very well be comic geniuses. And this is coming from someone who only liked Brand in small doses, but always loved Hill.Here, in the faux-pas sequel to Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek, they're both absolutely hilarious and despite the movie being a tad uneven and overlong, I had a great time with the misadventures of Hill's Aaron Green character who needs to lead his rock idol from London to L.A. for a reunion concert.One Sunday, well, yesterday, I vegged by watching four movies and left this one for last  if I got to it, that is. It appears I did save the best for last, for, I had the most fun during this than the previous three movies, two of which, were supposedly cult comedies.Normally, I would provide a synopsis, but I pretty much already did. Music recording enterprise employee, Aaron, must hand deliver Russell Brand's aging rock star, Aldous Snow, from England to several U.S. cities while trying to deal with both the crazy antics of the druggie has-been Aldous, his own possible ex-lover, Daphne and his eccentric boss, Sergio, played wonderfully by Sean Combs.Like I already reported, the movie is a tad uneven as told with the sometimes directionless plot and clichéd shenanigans, but the basic concept keeps us entertained until the "big show" that will both further Aaron and Aldous's career.I really did laugh out loud a lot during this movie and was sad that I missed it when it was released almost 3 years ago. It's not a movie I would want to buy, but I am glad I got a chance to see it, finally.I know this is short, but, let me assure you, it is hilarious in most scenes, thanks to both Hill and Brand and all the secondary characters with inside jokes. It's highly recommended.
One of the funniest  perhaps scariest?  things I heard about A Serbian Film prior to me watching it was a movie critic friend of mine advising me to see the uncut version and not the American one. For, they had to edit the film down to receive an NC-17 rating in the States, he said. Edit it down to an NC-17??Well, chances are you've never heard of the American (or Serbian?) version of this film and I'll bet even more money you wouldn't watch this either way. It's an enormously graphic snuff film disguised as art mimicking, well, snuff.ButI will hand it to the filmmaker Srdjan Spasojevic, he did set up the film nicely in the first half making you wonder if all the negative things you heard about this (if any) were fabricated. Well, just wait. Literally the second half is pure hell.Sadly, however, as much as people spoke about this as thee most graphic, enormously disturbing and incredibly sick film ever conceived, they actually made it less so for me. In fact, I stand by my previous words: The Human Centipede II is, to me: thee most graphic, enormously disturbing and incredibly sick film ever conceived. This comes in second.Not to damper this film; believe me: this is very vile and twisted and it seemed to have every conceivable sexually deprived act (with some made up, I'd reckon) known to man with the exception of probably just autoerotic asphyxiation. Whew! You missed one!Our "hero," Milos, is an ex-porn star  and, according the movie, the biggest porn star and yet, he must be the ugliest foreign actor next to Gérard Depardieu  who's summoned out of retirement to shoot one more porn, er "art" film for an obscene amount of money that's never disclosed. He's suspicious, but his partner convinces him to accept to support their family.At first, like the real movie you're viewing, things aren't that bad. But, to avoid spoilers, I will make this as absolutely simple as I can without ruining anything: think a rated-XXX journey down the rabbit hole. And then multiply that image by ten.I guess I am as guilty as those before me that labeled this as the worst of the worst in regards to gore and unforgivable scenes. I believe I am simply warning you that, while there is a statement here, while the graphics are realistic and the acting and cinematography is decentthe movie should be a skip.Unless your real-life pleasures are on the same playing field as those attracted to opening the puzzle box in the Hellraiser series, there's really no reason to journey into this extreme darkness.
"Thank God, we can't tell the future. We'd never get out of bed."  Barbara (Julia Roberts.)Um, I guess that is true. Pessimistic, but accurate. Much like the rest of the incredibly true-to-life  to my experience, that is  movie, August: Osage County.Okay, yeah, this is fiction, but from what I observed, I saw truth here. Each character here in this wildly dysfunctional family, reminded me  some more than others  of people of my own life. Some people, in my mind, were exaggerations, some were dead-on and some were just around the corner. But, all existed in one form or another.As a ton of standup comedians and a lot of screenplay writers point out, we all have crazy families. I'm no exception to that rule. Maybe that's why I could relate and celebrate August: Osage County  because I was on the outside looking in this time.Daddy's gone missing, again, and this brings the family, and extended family and friends together. When things get worse, so does the family on screen and the secrets burn up the dialogue and actions.While not groundbreaking, the uniqueness and depth of the characters, the profound dialogue, wonderful music and the connection I had with the characters from my own life (of which, I choose not to name names, since they might read this  ha) kept me going until the very satisfying ending. It was so because it was so real.Highly recommended and definitely for fans of the cast and have their own nutso family.* * * Final thoughts: While I did like the majority of performances here, the one I centered in on the most was Julia Roberts. Yes, over the great Meryl Streep. If Streep does win the 2013 best Actress Oscar, more power to her. But, to me, the number one here was Roberts. By far, her best performance since 2000's Erin Brockovich.
The very late 80s and early 90s, I exploded in film-watching. I saw everything and anything, good or bad, mostly horror and action/adventure and sometimes not. Coming off my all-time, and since, favorite movie summer, 1989, I was anxious to have 1990 impress me even more. Sadly, it did not, but one gem that's stuck with me ever since Summer 1990 was Gremlins 2: The New Batch.Admittedly, it's silly, sometimes over-the-top and some of the special effects looked cheesy, even back then, and yetI had a blast almost double than I had for the original.Sure, I know the 1984 Gremlins original is considered a cult-classic and beloved by many, but since I wouldn't have even seen that movie (see my Gremlins review on why, but suffice to say, my mother warned me it was "satanic" and I was too young to make my own movie-watching decisions) for a few years following this, I basically grew up with this movie first instead of part one.Also, the comedy  there was 10x more comedy than the original and actually a lot less horror, had me rolling. The homage scenes and props were great and seemed to be multiplied from the original. Further, I loved the adventure and the grandiose of it all  I wouldn't have anything to compare it to since I hadn't at this point seen the original, but from the background story, I could piece together that they made this bigger. And finally, of course, I loved Gizmo, but by far, my favorite character and scenes involved Brian Gremlin, voiced incredibly by Tony Randall.Basically, it's a retelling of the original, but in the Big Apple, specifically a Trump-esque building. Gizmo's back and though milder than his inevitable offspring, he's still mischievous and the original, albeit questionable, "rules" involving this "Mogwai" creature, are broken again. Hell breaks hilariously loose in the building and our original heroes, who are older, but not surprisingly, look the same as they did when they were "teens," have to stop the madness.It's not groundbreaking and not meant to be deep, but it's a helluva ride and has a ton of cameos and side-characters/actors that I loved, like Kathleen Freeman, their television's "Microwave Marge," the wonderful John Glover, my personal favorite Star Trek Doctor, Robert Picardo, Christopher Lee and Leonard Maltin's mocking himself and the original movie. Brilliant.While it's good to see the original, do not miss this incredibly fun (and funny) follow-up.* * * Final thoughts: Gizmo's still great, with the exception of his bad FX running, and "Mohawk," who replaced "Stripe" as the original movie's evil leader, was good, but this movie belongs to Brain Gremlin. The on-screen interview is worth watching the entire movie for.
"Arg!" says the undead.Actually, the undead aren't supposed to say a lot. And this is coming from someone who grew up on George A. Romero's films and recently, The Walking Dead. Maybe they did in the Return of the Living Dead films  "Brains!" but that's not the norm.Warm Bodies is a touching and different take on the current zombie craze that's happened over the past few years to decade and it's the first I've seen that puts the viewer (and zombie film lover) in the mind of the living dead. And while it's not a bad thing that this is a comedy (well, romantic comedy,) I would also like to see this from a straight point of view.I digress. In a movie that's not even rated R  we're all probably becoming pretty immune to zombie movies, we have 'R' who still has a minute left of a brain yet to think consciously after being inadvertently turned into the undead. His thoughts, while both interesting and often hilarious, lead him to true love when he meets the un-undead of his dreams and rescues her.Once the initial and inevitable back & forth getting used to the idea one of the zombies would want to help the living and not actually eat them, the movie falls more and more into the predictable territory for a film that's set up like this, or the Romeo & Juliet theme, if you will.Now, the movie has more highs than lows, and that's thanks to the cast, namely Rob Corddry and lead zombie, R (Nicholas Hoult.) And the ending is one of the most original I've seen for a zombie movie and that was thoroughly refreshing.It's a nice take, has literal laugh out loud moments and enough for both the zombie & chick-flick fans. Recommended!
I yearn for any movie, drama, comedy or even slasher/torture-porn flick, to contain character depth, originality and a present and background well thought out  as well as scenes, and I got all of it in The Collector.For a measly hour and 29 minutes, you will get one of the most unique, well shot, wonderfully directed, believable acting and overall executed of all horror films. And for all that, I will award a flat ½ star above the lowest rating possible: 1 star.The Collector makes Chucky, Jason, Michael and Freddy look like wimps. The Collector makes Pinhead and even Leatherface look like pansies. And The Collector makes Jigsaw look as amateurish as a first-year film school dropout. This, my peers, is thee most grotesque, disgusting, repulsive, vile and reason-for-a-cold-shower movie I have ever seen. For that, I will highly recommend the movie to be AVOIDED.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Yes, it has qualities I appreciate in movies  more than you'll ever know, and yes, for the most part, it was well made. And furthermore, I truly understand when someone describes a movie of such a despicable nature as a movie you should steer away from, you'll yearn to see it more. Heck, I do the same thing when people tell me to stop smoking or drinking  it only makes the rebel inside me want to do it more. But allow me make something clear: Let me take one for Team America so you don't have to.You see, I don't review movies I don't 100% see. So I endured this evil voyage (in 4-5 segments, it was that rough) and now you don't have to. The reason for such violence portrayed kept escalating so much, as if the director/writer wanted so bad to not only top all other torture-porn's prior, but himself in the process, that I finally had to scream out at the screen: "Oh, come on! Really?!? Give me a freakin' break!"True  I did shout all that out, because, there's a point that it just gets, well, just too much. Now, this didn't happen in the film, but for the inevitable sequel  which I will avoid at all costs  you might as well tie down an innocent 7-year-old girl and cut off one finger at a time while injecting her with whatever medicine in an I.V. to keep her both alive and conscious to "take some more punishment." Lord, forgive me for having such horrible thoughts, but that's what this movie is like.If this kind of awfulness is your cup of tea, I will feel for you. Never before have I seen such an abomination to humankind, to morals or to sanity. I would give them credit for doing what they set out to: make Satan proud.I'm no prude. I love horror. Even the slasher genre. Heck, I felt the first three Saw films were well crafted with decent acting, originality and suspense. I'm a life-long Jason, Michael and Freddy compadre. I enjoyed the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (and its remakes.) I've even sat through the original Hostel and Wolf Creek.To drive my point this movie needs to be avoided: The Collector had its major plot holes. Apparently, within a period of hours or less, this masked Person Under the Stairs S&M villain set up enough "traps" to make Nancy Thompson want to take lessons. In addition, the killer can navigate through these wires and trips with the ease of an Ocean's Eleven thief or ballerina at the drop of a hat. Also, the leather he's wearing only allows some sounds, because the true burglar can make as much noise as he wants to alert the next county over, yet go undetected in the stereotypical creaky house.So, even if you get past the actually good set up with enough plot intrigue to fill a series of mystery films, and the homage to torture, you'll have to suspend your disbelief and almost laugh at the most inappropriate times.Oh. I forgot the obligatory part of my review where I mention the plot. Well-to-do craftsman Arkin (Stewart) is scoping out the place of his employment  an unfinished house in Timbuktu  in order to steal from it later in the night so his ex can get money for her loan-shark while helping their daughter. (Mouthful.) Wait, there's more! Someone "collects" humans and is also watching the place. And, the target family with the clichéd daughters  one rebellious and one young and innocent  are supposed to be away on a family holiday, but they stick around to, well, eventually stick around.Does the plot matter? They think so, and I do admire them (again  only ½ a star worth) for putting some effort into this blood bath. But, beyond a reasonable doubt this movie was based on one subject and one only: How far can they go to shock the audience or upset even the most experienced horror-fan? Spoiler here: the ending had plenty of opportunities to redeem most of the movie. Not only did it fail at the extremely unoriginal climax (or final 5 minutes,) but it left no good-will at all. Sure, I know the context of the film (or mood) but give me a freakin' bone already. I needed something to remind myself I'm still a human being.Heck, I would give it kudos for ending on a fraction of a positive note, but they had to go for the obvious, never-minding what they had in store was completely unrealistic.Please for the love of GOD, skip this movie. I hate to say it but if you're a fan of this movie, I would have trouble being your friend. At very least: I would watch my back.
Wow, this doesn't happen all the time, probably rarely, but I love a good make-up part three of a trilogy. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Ocean's Thirteen and Die Hard with a Vengeance come to mind, but now, I will add Army of Darkness.This is not to say Indy 2, Ocean's 12 or Die Hard'er were terrible, they really weren't, but the third chapter redemption is always refreshing. I will say, however, this does not apply to the Evil Dead (original) trilogy, as Evil Dead II, or The Evil Dead Redux, was just plain atrocious.Not only was Army of Darkness a fun, exciting and often hilarious movie  thanks, Brucey!  but it's one of those rare sequels that takes the main character from the saga, along with some of the established themes, into a whole new dimension. You couldn't seriously be as far away from the first two chapters in regards to setting, direction or, uh, time period, as Director Sam Raimi took Army of Darkness.Now, that all said, this wasn't perfect, by any means, and as much as I found it entertaining and original  for the series, that is  it's not a new take on period piece movies with swords, castles and grand scale battles. And as the movie progresses, it fell deeper and deeper into old film clichés.Almost taking place immediately following the events in part II  and I emphasize the word almost, because they seemed to either forget what exactly happened at the end of the last chapter, or they wrote themselves into a corner previously and they hoped no one would notice, Ash (played wonderfully and hysterically by Bruce Campbell) is taken prisoner in the 1300s after being sucked into a vortex that was meant to rid present day of the "evil dead."Without so much as a trial or sentencing, he's just tossed into a well of hell and, in good old fashioned Ash-way, he proves himself and lives. Some claim him to be a prophesied warrior "from the sky" to rid the land of evil by retrieving the same book that sent him back in time in the first place. Also, Ash-like, he'd much rather save himself and get back in (the right) time than help the villagers.Ash must survive the evil dark lands/cemetery and it's amusing incarnations and bring back the book. Will Ash save his own ash, or care about other ash's when all hell breaks loose after his book journey?Recently, in 2013, the remake (well, second remake, if you rightfully count the second installment as the first reboot) came out and, I'll take a guess, since I won't be seeing it for another few hours, reinvents the first wheel. My hope is that they follow that up with a remake of this, for, while this was often witty and had some pretty decent lines, I can see an even better version of this. There seemed to be a lot of missed opportunities by the writers and I stand behind them spending a little more time to get this even more hilarious.Also, I am not always a fan of the "Director's Cut" of films. Granted, I applaud them for being able to show us their true and verified visions, but mostly, I find when a director takes advice from either crew members, or sneak-peak audience members, it's just plain good advice. In this case, unfortunately, I only had the "Director's Cut" to see and I recalled a different ending. While this one (no spoilers) was decent, and actually makes sense in regards to the events leading up to the end, it was a too-quick resolution. I YouTubed the original theatrical ending, found what I remembered seeing this many years ago when I first saw this and felt that one was longer, funnier, more exciting and deserved to be in all "cuts" of the film. Seriously, Raimi, how could you think your "cut" was better than the theatrical one?Both endings worked, but, again, I prefer the original's. I digress. Even if you hadn't seen the first two movies, and I would highly recommend the first one of two only, this almost stand-alone is well worth your time for a little early 90s campy fun.And who can go wrong with the great Bruce Campbell at his best?** - In comparison, his worst was just one movie back, Evil Dead II.
Two things happened as G.I. Joe: Retaliation progressed: the script revealed itself as being written by a ghostwriter  literally, a ghost, and, secondly, I had a ton of fun.While the first part can be written about any of the Transformers films, the second is far from accurate to those terrible films. I don't know what it is, or how they could of screwed up that franchise so badly; the Transformers were higher on my list of toys I grew up with than the G.I. Joe action figures, even though I played with both.I haven't seen the first G.I. Joe film since it came out in 2009, so it's hard to make a current comparison. But, I can say, I had an entertaining ride during both. Perhaps it was the same kinds of action that was in the original series' cartoons, or maybe, the cast always seems to have the right amount of charisma. Here, in the (hopefully, first of many) sequel(s), I loved the cast, including the Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis. That last choice rarely makes a mistake in movies, so when he did in the previous 2013 Willis release, A Good Day to Die Hard, it was nice to see a little, ah-hem, retaliation in this movie.As stated, the screenplay was just the pits  and it got progressively worse as the movie concluded, but just for review's sake, the movie is the same ole scene: the elite and patriotic soldiers, or "the Joes," are framed and the President's being duplicated and run by the evil Cobra villains. Their plan? Well, kinda, sorta, rule the world? What is the evil plot of any cartoon race of bad guys?The Joes, now outnumbered and outgunned by approximately 99 to 1, still manage to use their resources to fight the enemy.My synopsis is a very basic retelling of the many-times-over retelling of dozens of filmsbut that's incidental to the action.The fighting, gadgets and choreographed scenes weren't anything new themselves, aside from the great mountain fight with my favorite Joe of all-time: Snake Eyes, but they were still wildly engaging. And there are more than enough of them. Once you get a tad bit bored or confused  rightfully so with the multiples of plot holes  with the story, they throw another action segment to get you by.This is a life-action cartoon, nothing more. It's for people who grew up on the animated series, the comic books and action figureslike me. But, that wouldn't have been enough for me. If not for the action, the fun characters by the actors, or the humorous lines  yeah, I did laugh out loud a few times, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this as much.YesI do recommend G.I. Joe: Retaliation. If, again, you fit that persona I described in the previous paragraph.
If only the Star Wars prequels were even a tenth of how good this kinda, sorta, updated Star Wars flick.I was way off on my prediction for this Guardians of the Galaxy film. I thought with the stream of Sci-Fi wannabes from sometimes acclaimed novels and a relatively unknown live cast, this was going to bomb and bomb hard. Unfortunately for me and fortunately for the movie, I couldn't have been more off. (In my defense and demise, I predicted this 6 months prior to opening. Sheesh! That's way too early to predict any box office number.)I didn't think the movie would necessarily suck, or would be barely watchable, but I'm just not into Sci-Fi and because of which, it took me 30 days to the day of release to finally see this. Poor choice #2 on my part. (Almost 4 months for The Matrix  and I wish I had seen that one sooner, as well.) While not perfect, way too many predictable lines and twists and slightly longer than it needed to be, the movie worked extremely well overall. Though the highlights were the literal laugh-out-loud humor, killer soundtrack and very good and inventive effects, the best aspect for me were the fantastic and memorable characters.How they worked on their own, their depth and the comradery between them was simply divine. Too often characters, and especially ego- driven actors portraying them, ruin what could be a fun adventure flick with depth. Everyone's chemistry was spot-on and I couldn't help but love everyone individually and definitely together. Heck, even The Avengers dragged too long on the conflicts within. What was also nice about the bond of our heroes was the reasons of being together. Not a single weak part to everyone's story line  everything worked splendidly as a whole. To have this many characters  five main and exclusive characters  all feeding off each other while maintaining their own direction isn't easy and should be praised when it does occur.I went into this movie with ZERO expectations. I neither really wanted to see it nor did I think it would be bad. What I got was one pleasant surprise after another. For example, the opening nearly had me in tears  and not from laughter.The movie opens with our future hero and "Han Solo's nephew," Peter "Star Lord" Quill's mother passing and that's immediately followed by his space abduction and eventually 20+ years later. Now, a full blown Han Solo renegade, he's trying to steal a sphere, Raiders of the Lost-like and the adventure begins with him being chased, him meeting the rest of the title characters and the rise of heroism.To be honest, the story is not the newest or freshest out there, but it works beautifully here. Even the negative of occasionally predictable scenes, as mentioned above, was necessary for a movie like this to have. It's enormously unique on its own, but needed to tone it back to be more accessible to the general audiences while giving homage to the greats like this before it.The emotional scenes also worked, as in the beginning  that was tough! not to get upset then  and a couple more later. Also, the laughs were plentiful even with the ones absolutely not geared towards me. I appreciated that they spread out the humor so not to just please one audience type. Further, the sometimes ingenious ways of solving problems were fantastic as was the loyalty amongst our crew  something I love to see in movies like this. Yes, I know it's more realistic to show more conflict than they did here, but I'm certainly not going into a movie like this and trying to find too much realism. And finally, I am HOOKED, as most people are on that dang good soundtrack. I look forward to more follow-ups and cross-over's. I am super glad my prediction didn't come true and happy for a genuine blockbuster in one of the most lackluster box-office summers in many, MANY years. * * *Final thoughts: I might need to watch it again  ha, I'm definitely buying this on Blu when it arrives, and I might be wrong, but far too many people survived way too long in space and exposed. I kept saying "NO" out loud as if I were Grumpy Cat when I saw one fly through space with only a secured helmet on. His hair was flowing with the transition and his hands were ungloved, even. Again, I might be mistaken, but this and a few other minor anti-physic-issues I couldn't get past.Did this downgrade the movie in any way? Another "NO." As much as I didn't like to see such obvious mistakes, it's still a space- adventure-comedy. Heck, even the very-fun Gravity had its share of issues, and that was supposed to be realistic.
It's really sad this movie was overlooked. I mean, I can see why they made it; 2010's Red was a cult hit. I really liked it and even bought it on BluRay for my limited collection.Now, granted, Red 2 isn't as great as the first one. For one, Morgan Freeman wasn't involved. But, it was thoroughly action packed, fun, funny and a comprehensive film.Basically, aging ex-CIA agents are called back into duty (again) to clear their names and must perform the same stunts/achievements shown in other movies, such as Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol. Only this time, the big news is bringing the dull Mary-Louise Parker's Sarah along for the ride.Apologetically, it's been well over a month or so since I've seen this. What I do remember is that I had a great time. It's not perfect, entirely original and it's fairly predictably, but it's enjoyable. Just have fun here. If you liked the original film, you'll have a blast here.* * * Final thoughts: Earlier in the year, Bruce Willis starred in the worst Die Hard film, not to mention one of the worst action films I've seen in a long time: A Good Day to Die Hard. He looked really old in that film, as that was part of the idea for him being too old to be an action star. Mercifully, he looked great here  back to his old self. Sadly, he was the weakest link in this movie. While still good and kicking ass, he looked tired and defeated. I do not recommend a Red 3, but I am looking forward to another Die Hard with him back on track.
I make no apologies on awarding A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 5/5 stars. And I certainly don't consider it a "guilty pleasure." Let's say I grew up on this movie. It was one of my initial "Movie Event of the Year" films as I watched it 5 times in the theatre in 1988, all at the now defunct AMC Gateway. (Twice alone, twice with my sister and the final time with my father who wanted to know what "evil" I was watching so many times.) Also, since I was so young (14, and I am puzzled on how I frequently got into a rated R flick  even my sister was younger than 17) not only was this my first introduction to Freddy  I hadn't seen 1-3 yet, this movie made a huge impact on my future movie-going experiences as well as my life.It's strange to even think about rewarding a #4 in a 1980s horror franchise more than, say 2½ stars, but I absolutely loved this movie. The soundtrack (which I had bought and have listened to hundreds of times, we'll get more on that later), the score, the comedic tones, the frights, the fights, the inventiveness and the acting. They really up'd the ante this time with an obvious budget and special effects. But more so, Freddy finally came out of the closet, so to speak.Not only was he absolutely hilarious, we finally got to see more of him and his glove. I obviously didn't know at the time how privileged the audience was to finally see him out of the shadows and into the limelight where he (and his clever one-liners) belong. I guess some might have problem with that  they probably felt he was more "scary" hidden away. I didn't. I felt he was too strong of a character not to show.Well, Freddy's back, but mostly because Kristen (the newly replaced Tuesday Knight, due to Arquette being pregnant, and Knight also did the wonderful opening song) couldn't leave well enough alone and kept thinking of him in her dreams. She also has a bad knack for involving others in her dreams, including #3's survivors Joey & Kincaid.When Freddy eventually stalks them and murders them (including one of the series most memorable/creative death  "How's this for a wet dream?") the series actually keeps continuity by stating Freddy's mission was to murder all of the original "Elm Street Children" and these were the final three. Kristen does manage to transfer her power of pulling someone into the dream to another innocent she pulled into the dream, Alice (Wilcox.) Positive: this gives someone else the opportunity to defeat Freddy. Negative: most likely Freddy would've been done with his task complete.Alice, sweet Alice, doesn't know what to think of all this, barely being informed of the back story earlier. In fact, had she been a little more prepared, she might not of inadvertently brought her friends into her own dreams for Freddy to collect souls. As Alice attempts to put the pieces together there's another side effect  just like with Kristen, she collects their powers, or personalities, habits (smoking, bad!) and strengths. Freddy's not stupid and plans to stop her before she stops him. Does he succeed? Does she happen to remember an old nursery rhyme at the most opportune time to defeat the man of their nightmares? Duh.I loved this movie on so many levels. I have the entire movie memorized, shot-by-shot, frame-by-frame and all the dialogue in between. So much so, I have to consciously stop myself from quoting it so I can enjoy the 30th time viewing it. I loved the soundtrack, but some songs were vacant. For those, I had to search  way pre-internet  by asking around school while just humming some of the lyrics. (The ones missing went onto become some of my favorite songs: Anything, Anything by Dramarama and I Want Your Hands On Me by Sinead O'Connor. Do you know how hard life is without the internet to look things up!?!?) I always love a good female combatant, but the nerdy-girl Alice (the very BEST Nightmare heroine, sorry, Nancy fans) turned warrior wasn't just awesome, but beautiful and a great challenge for the exciting climax/showdown in the church in the closing. In addition, since I was about the same age, give or take a couple of years, of most of the teens in this movie, I can safely say: they got how teens act and what they say down to a tee, much like any of the John Hughes movies.The death/nightmare scenes weren't just clever and topical (for the time) but they kept the story going, whether you were laughing or reminiscing in the moments. Freddy proved himself as the number one villain of all 1980s horror franchises. It's no wonder this was the top grossing of all the Nightmare films (if you don't count Freddy Vs. Jason.) I loved seeing Freddy at his best and especially his glove  many a scene they acted like his claws/knifes sprung like Wolverine's. I loved seeing him in different costumes and with as many one-liners as most comedies.On a personal note, as a critic (in my own mind-dammit) I generally will always try to be unbiased. Such as, a movie of this stature would be 4 to 4½ stars with all the (non-personal remembrance) positives I mentioned. But, for once, I am taking this to a personal level and how much this movie meant to me. To hell with the majority of critics, the audience and my own personal impartial views  even when the movie is dear to me. I am selfishly rewarding this the highest rating due to how much it means to me.See it anyways. It's fun horror. Something they rarely get right in today's time.
The ugly truth is this movie is enormously unfunny and predictable. The uglier truth is that only a handful of actors, dead or alive can pull off screwball/slapstick humor and Heigl/Butler are not on that list. The ugliest truth is that I appear to be the same man-pig Butler describes in the movie (a trait I despise) as I only watched this movie for Butler.Now that's out of the way, The Ugly Truth isn't truly the worst movie I've seen, or in 2009 and it wasn't 100% unfunny. I might have laughed two times. Unfortunately, I cringed at almost all the attempts at humor or the blatant crude behavior/talk just to be like the Judd Apatow films. The difference is, Apatow is generally fresh, original, funny and actually contains a story. The Ugly Truth harbors none of these qualities. (In fact, the only similarity was Heigl, who was oodles better in Knocked Up.) We've see it all before. Uptight woman (Heigl) is looking for love, but her standards are too high. Easy-going, smart-alecky and fast talker male  with a past!, (Butler) helps said woman romance her neighbor when, you know he wants, well, it's obvious thatreally? Is this a spoiler? Roxanne anyone? Sure it mimics a hundred or more movies, plots, stories and honestly, that wouldn't be a problem if it was well executed or at least you cared about the characters. Heck, maybe you could throw in a surprise or two. Not one person did I give a second thought to, not one scene in this movie wasn't foretold; even the poster gives it away. It makes you wonder why they even tried.Butler was the only saving grace. He was funny once or twice  he did have some quick moments, and it was nice to see a male be so unashamedly open and honest about what (majority of) men want. I'm sure a lot of what he was saying is true, but he blanketed the entire male population, whereas there are gay males out there who don't really care that much about breasts. (I'm sure some do, but you get my point.) And speaking of which, I guess his character and/or this movie could be described as homophobic, if I cared enough. I mean, the character is really a low-life himself, so I don't give him enough credit to worry about his anti-gay remarks.As for Heigl's character, she was so predictable, literally boring and so clichéd I barely could watch her on the screen. And the secondary characters? Oh mythe neighbor looked like he belonged on Desperate Housewives, although since he's so dull, I'm sure one of them would kill him off within the first few episodes. The newscaster "hot-n-heavy" older couple was so incredibly over-the-top and unfunny, they were hard to look at. What were the writers thinking? That their problems are so hard to find in their marriage that TV guy's man/butch host Butler can bring them together on the air live, have them perform sexual acts in front of the audience and BOW! we'd like them or even laugh along? I'm absolutely no prude, so when it came to them making me feel uncomfortable, it wasn't about the sexual nature; it was about how incredibly bad their attempts at humor were and how far they fell. They belonged on the Mary Tyler Moore show or any 1970s sitcom  not in modern comedies.I love hearing the phrase: "If you see one movie this year" or "one comedy" For this movie, you're best off if you have never, ever, in your entire life, or past life, seen a movie. Then you might enjoy it as something fresh, original, funny and surprising. However, if you've seen more than one comedy, or dramedy, then skip this one. It's just too painful to watch and I'm only guessing here: comedies aren't meant to be painful.
Unbelievably, Howard the Duck was the first Marvel movie. Not sure why they started with him, but luckily they followed him up with Blade, X-Men and Spider-Man. But, this comic-turned-movie wasn't necessary to test audiences. Howard the Duck wasn't a masked superhero or a vigilante crime fighter.It wasn't a great movie, either. And still, it wasn't as terrible as I've heard ever since it was released until I saw it for the first time last month, in 2014. I mean, I see where they were going with it, it was very 1980s and you couldn't bring any realism to the table here.Basically, after a freak accident, Howard T. Duck's thrown from his home planet to ours, spends half his time yelling at the people trying to help this giant, talking duck and another portion trying to defeat what seems like an afterthought villain.Oh, and Lea Thompson is creepily and thoroughly sexually aroused by the birdman.Admittedly, some of it made me chuckle and I saw little harm in this Rated PG (but should've been at least PG-13) adventure, this middle of the quality road movie is not worth a watch. Personally, I only watched it because the gang over at the How Did This Get Made podcast had it on their list and I've been watching all they covered. It's been nearly 30 yearsIf I hadn't watched it before they encouraged me to, I would never had.* * * Final thoughts: I love flashbacks to scenes that took place less than 10 minutes prior because the director has almost zero confidence the audience wouldn't remember. Oh, I forgot, Georgie Lucas helped make this. Explains a lot.
Oh, dear Lord, this was awful. Usually I like to start my reviews with something funny I observed during the feature, whether or not I liked the movie. But, I, Frankenstein, was so bad, so unintentionally hilarious and so dumbed down to the lowest depths of hell, I just wanna pray for mercy that God, or, ah-hem, gargoyles, don't destroy the rest of us for these people's sins in making this.I'm gonna try and make this one quick because I already wasted 90 minutes of my life on this garbage. What's sad about this movie is the fact that no one phoned in their parts. They all took pride in what they made and thought  unbelievably thought  they were making a quality experience. Heck, they probably even thought this would go onto becoming a franchise. I also pray that won't happen.So much is wrong, I would have to rewatch it just to write down the hundreds of things that made me laugh, cringe or get bored enough just to waste time on Facebook as it continued playing. I was too uninterested to make a list the first go-around, and to Hades, if I wanna see this again. From memory: > Laughable script and I mean really LOL dialogue, actions and thoughtless direction of story.> Almost zero creativity. With the exception of turning Frankenstein's monster into an action hero that's more Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter than Underworld  even though this movie is a Bmovie version of that franchise they're responsible for.> And the best aspect  or worst?  was the 100% most ludicrous and sometimes painful CGI I have ever, EVER seen. Sure, it was bad, and I have seen my share of bad CGI, but in my entire life, I have never seen such effects that made me burst out laughing. This will go down as either number one or tied as first (with A Sound of Thunder, I still remember that mess) for worst effects I've witnessed.Story? Ha. Well, changing the story of Dr. Frankenstein, the undead monster kills the doc's wife and then inadvertently, his creator, and within minutes, gets involved in the war between the vampires and lycans. Oops, I mean, regular, easy-to-kill demons vs. gargoyles. Yeah. They literally could NOT come up with "good" supernatural protectors, so they got the idea from rewatching the 1000% superior Ghostbusters and stole that as they did every other aspect of this movie.Incredibly, Yvonne Strahovski, who would've inevitably played "the Bride" had a sequel been green-lit, actually did a good job in her role. Not enough to elevate anything above 1 star, but I do have to give her kudos as she actually was present fighting against the bad and showed she had more depth than anything else in this movie.Other than that, there isn't a single thing to recommend about this movie. There isn't even any logic  the gargoyles are upset at "Adam," or Frankenstein's Creature, at his vendetta fight in broad moonlight, and yet they fly all over the place looking like extras from Birdemic: Shock and Terror. Yeah, they looked that bad.SKIP IT!* * *Final thoughts: I had to see this mess, especially after it landed on so many people's bottom ten of 2014. Now, that doesn't guarantee I would absolutely hate the feature, in fact  I liked some of the ones others called the worst of the year. That said, this one was even worse than I thought possible and yet, maaaaybe, it might work as some drinking game, or some campy classic to ridicule years later. Possibly, you could get some amusement out of that. But, I would have to be dragged back, kicking and screaming and possibly reanimated myself from the dead, before I see this again.And speaking of which, movies like this make me miss the old classics. Like Re-Animator. Go see that one. Much better and a lot more serious fun.
Unlike a lot of people, when I think of M. Night Shyamalan, I think of good times. As in, I laugh practically through most of his movies. The others, I hate life. On Christmas Eve Night, 2010, I wanted to laugh. So, I plugged in Devil.Sure, it's not fully the typical Shyamalan-snoozefest  he just came up with the "original" story. OK, that made me laugh.Most people probably never heard of The Lift, the killer elevator movie of 1983. I saw that, and though it's not exactly the same as Devil, does involve the "supernatural" on board a lift, er, elevator.The religious security guard at a nondescript skyscraper narrates this story of the, well, Devil who walks amongst us merely for fun. But, he's got rules. Someone must commit suicide and then there's got to be a group of no-good movie and extremely clichéd characters who fight each other while dying. There's some kind of moral, and of course there's gotta be a way to beat the Devil!Our group of "heroes" are stuck in an elevator and absolutely no time passes before the heat rises, from within them and they act out against each other while they're being monitored by the helpless and frightened narrator and his trusty disbelieving partner. Enter in the (yes, another cliché) cop with a past and everyone's trying to get them out as one-by-one perishes.Will the real Devil stand up? You'll spend half the mere 80 minutes attempting to figure out who is Lucifer and the other giving a rat's ass.Sad, the movie starts off with promise: it has a great upside down flythrough of the city as its opening credits. It's downhill from there: poor acting, laughable dialogue, a terrible ending, boundless and unoriginal twists and some of the most hilarious "ohh, so scaaaary" scenes such as: the jelly that proves the Devil exists! THE JELLY? There's a good laugh in itself.I will say the Devil did, in fact, show some mercy: it was only 80 minutes after all.
In the beginning, I was in-between feelings for The Inbetweeners Movie. I didn't find it bad by any means, and most of my feelings were based on my somewhat ignorance of British humor and lack of any knowledge of the TV program it's based on. I just thought, it's somewhat funny and I liked how the movie that reminded me a lot of the original American Pie but was very unabashed with its characters compared to how backwards we're here.Luckily, as the movie progressed, it became more and more comical, hilarious and those four "boys" really grew on me  all individually.Perhaps that was because I finally did get more used to the humor and understood more. But, I believe it was how invested I was getting with the depth (and hilarity) displayed in the main stars.Yeah, if I saw the TV show  that I've never heard of before this screening  first, perhaps I'd already be into their individual personalities.Here, nor there. This movie, brilliantly made to stand alone, follows four British lads after their (to us: High School) graduation and then immediately on holiday to Malia. Obviously, they're going there to get laid, boozed up, celebrate their friendship and let us enjoy their misadventures with four girls they meet.The four guys are pretty much England's version of the American Pie dudes and each uniquely fun. Will, the cute and nerdy one, aside from his Austin Powers grill, is the virgin and smart alecky one. Jay's the horn-dog selfish one and Simon's the hung-up on his obviously bad-for-him ex-girlfriend. And finally, one I didn't like up front, but really grew on me: Neil, the jolly chap who's probably the horniest, most positive and innocent of all.After awhile, I loved watching them and their interactions with the females, who were also entertaining. Enough so, I would like to get the series this was based on and then rewatch this supposedly movie made to close out the TV program.Finally, from a personal perspective, its nice seeing how guys overseas aren't so hung up on sexuality and nudity as this prude country is. If you were to put a copy of American Pie and The Inbetweeners Movie in front of me, like all my other choices I make, I'll go with this  the unedited version. Any day.
As 'Scream 3' opens, it automatically gets that typical sequel feeling that the series is running out of steam. That's only in the first 10 minutes or so, and unfortunately, the movie only goes downhill from there. Make that, it crashes/burns way before the ridiculous finale. Apparently, Sidney Prescott is the most wanted (for dead) woman in the world. Everyone wants to kill her. And like the 'Saw' franchise, they keep coming up with new (but highly uninventive) ways to want to kill everyone on screen just to prove they want to kill this character. As much as I am a fan of the other Craven-created series, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street,' it would be an incredible drag to see Nancy be stalked in all 7 original movies. Luckily, for more than one reason, they stopped this incessant need to murder Sidney with #3. Now all grown, Sidney follows something she mentioned in #2: living alone in isolation to prevent another killing spree, but alas, it happens again during the production of another movie-within-a-movie: Stab 3. So all the series regulars return, a la the Scooby-Doo team, to solve the ooohhh mystery of whodunit this time. This movie was awful, awful, awful. The "clever" cameos couldn't save this mess. Horribly edited, scenes just begin without reason and just as quickly end without conclusion. The script/dialogue was laughable and stale. Cox who looked great in #2 now looks like (probably intentionally) Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, but unfortunately the Kidder from 'Superman IV.' In other words, Cox looked like a plain mess. The suspense on who's behind the mask was gone, Kennedy's return was useless, and Posey? What theI guess no actress is perfect. Summary: it was like Craven simply gave up half-way through. Suggestion: don't even watch that much of it.
I'll admit I've had my fill of "guilty pleasure" films in the past. Predator 2 was one of them. Was.What starts off with a good concept, bringing the Predator from Jungle Predator to the city, it solely falls flat. Unfortunately, two other examples fit this same mold (Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan and The Lost World: Jurassic Park) and both had the same crummy result.The difference here is, I'm a huge Jason Voorhees fan  but his (so-called) Manhattan scenes don't happen until about 10 minutes until the movie ends. Same with Jurassic Park; the dinos journey to San Diego, just in time to see the finale of the already-too-long film. I'm not so much a Predator fan, though the concept of bringing him to an industrial jungle of sorts intrigued me. On paper, it's cool, but it's the execution that's lackinganything good.And, ironically, what I hated from the first film  the lack of a solid plot, was the thing I really hated about this sequel: too much plot. We have voodoo gang members, a rogue cop, a visiting Predator, instant Global warming, the future world of crime, a secret government agency and a miniature history into the Predator's existence. This movie was all over the place and wanted to cram too much in, when it would've been just fine with the simple concept of Predator taking a wrong turn in Albuquerque and ending in L.A.Also, what gives with both a "Robocop" theme  probably not coincidentally, the other Sci-Fi "Future" Part II, Robocop 2, came out a few months before this one. Or the exact duplicate scenes stolen from Aliens? It's no wonder the Aliens would battle the Predators soon enough. Heck, even Before-He-Matured Bill Paxton was in both Aliens and Predator 2. (See a MUCH better side of Mr. Paxton in Frailty and A Simple Plan. Shoot, he was better in Twister and his The Terminator extras scene.)While I barely want to comment on the addition of Morton Downey, Jr.  God, he was a horrible personality in TV and he's not much better here, I will have to mention poor, poor Danny Glover. Sure, no one can replace Arnold Schwarzenegger  NO ONE  and I'm sure that wasn't their 100% intentions, but come on. Glover did the best he could with the role, but only played a more serious version of his Lethal Weapon character: Sergeant Roger Murtaugh. Granted, outside of the Lethal Weapon franchise, Grand Canyon and the original Saw, he hasn't been in the best movies. (No, I have yet to see The Color Purple  I can't reference to which I have not seen.)The movie takes place in the far-distant future of 1997 (7 years from when the actual movie took place) in Los Angeles. It's 109 degrees and it's crime filled with a Voodoo Cocaine Gang that holds both Lieutenant Harrigan (Glover) and the Predator's (Hall) interest. Technically, the invisible hunter Predator is helping the police, and World, as a whole, but tracking down and slaughtering the gang members, but this doesn't stop Harrigan from investigating and getting his partners killed in the process.Eventually he meets up with 1980's icon (yeah, I know this was released in 1990, but his career wasn't quite over yet) Gary Busey who plays super-secret agent out to trap and harvest the Predator for the military. Sound familiar? Anyways, along with goofy, and completely unfunny sidekick, Jerry (Paxton) they get deeper in the web of the Predator's plans for, well, hunting.The movie ends cleverly  and I won't spoil it, this is one of the movie's highlights. Okay, I'll give a clue: they'll eventually produce a similar scene in Bride of Chucky's opening scene.All the key players from the 1980's/1990's action films are here as are the clichéd scenes, but the movie has zero heart and the potential for a unique sequel was squandered. And that scene where the soldiers are about to be ambushed and Harrigan tries to get their superiors to get them out of harm's way while watching from monitorsp#ssed me off. It's one thing to mimic a movie, but to blatantly steal from the superior Aliens is just plain bad taste.
But, if you must take The Call, make sure you disconnect before the last 1 minute.Now, I've worked in call centers since 1996, and being on the phone can be tough, repetitive and even emotionally drainingbut, in the end, when the call ends, there's no more. None of my call center/office jobs involved 9-1-1 calls, thank goodness, so I do not know how I would or could handle them and successfully detach myself. Hell, the volume alone  the back-to-back-to-back calls these operators take  would send me packing on day one.But, back to the movie. As the movie began and through the first half or so, I wasn't hating on it so much. In fact, watching these 9-1-1 operators work, if realistic, was interesting to me. Unfortunately, to have one half, there has to be another. And worse, that's what generally that defines the entire feature.The movie was horribly shot  as if someone was trying some artistic and experimental ideas in the wrong format  try YouTube first, man, it had terrible music even when they were trying to be "current" with the retro crowds and Halle Berry had absolutely terrible hair. Sure, that's incidental, but damn, it looked awful and was very distracting throughout.I digress. The movie highlights a "senior" 9-1-1 timid-as-a-mouse operator's two calls that involve a Jame Gumb-rip-off killer and her nervous way of helping the victims on the other end. Eventually she gets too close to the crime.It dives deep into suspension of disbelief and would've be just "okay" had it not been for the very last shot of the movie that was so out of left field, so not in conjunction with the rest of the movie, George Zimmerman could've shown up and shot Berry and that would've been more plausible.I'd skip it because the payoff is not worth the mediocre first 98%.
Believe it or not, I started to watch this movie about a year ago and stopped it around the 15-20 minute mark. It wasn't because I thought the movie was bad, or I was bored, etc. I either got distracted or had to go to bed and, unbeknownst to me, those minutes were the only good ones of the entire Trespass.The only reason I restarted this movie recently is because of the How Did This Get Made podcast. I vowed to watch/re-watch the movies they covered and ridiculed and this was on their list. Once I started fresh with this movie, I questioned on why they would include it.Well, get past those 15-20 minutes and you'll find out why. Well, #1, it's Nicolas Cage and they love to review his movies. And I don't blame them. Thanks to them, I've seen several of Cage's films for the first time, including Drive Angry, The Wicker Man and now this, and I am now a fan of the freaked-out Cage. And #2, it's just a bad movie that has absolutely no idea where it wants to go or what lie it wants to stick with.I digress. We have here, in Trespass, the worst excuse to get bad guys into a secure home of the 1%...or so we think. A troubled family of three invite in burglars into their home and then it's Funny Games, but without any of the fun or games.We learn about the family's finances, the wife's lusts, the daughter's tyranny and, of course, have the laugh-out-loud Cage-outs that we, well, me and the How Did This Get Made audience, seek out.Truly, there is nothing here. It's supposed to be tense, emotional and we're supposed to care for one or more characters, but their stories incessantly go back and forth so much, that you don't just stop caring if they live or die, you simply get bored of them.If, and only IF, you like to see Nicolas Cage go nutso and you want to see this to cross it off your How Did This Get Made checklist, watch it. Otherwise, please don't waste your time.* * * Final thoughts: Now, there aren't any real "OH, NO! NOT THE BEES! NOT THE BEES! AAAAAHHHHH! OH, THEY'RE IN MY EYES! MY EYES! AAAAHHHHH! AAAAAGGHHH!" moments, but the lines that do come out of Cage's mouth when he's trying to negotiate him and his family out of letting the inept robbers into his house, are still worth a good laugh. Much like the camera angle when they let the baddies into the home. I could not stop laughing. So, I guess this is one of those "So Bad, It's Good" films
Hulk was remade, or, ah-hem, rebooted with The Incredible Hulk. While neither worked, the second film was a slight improvement over the previous. They felt the need to remake the first one, because, well, it was pretty shitty. So, why did they feel they needed to remake the original The Evil Dead?Perhaps, I should recommend people watch Evil Dead II (which, by the way is NOT a sequel, but a remake, as stated) before they make it to part one. This is because I just re-watched the first one last night, part II tonight, and will watch #3: Army of Darkness tomorrow night. All in preparation of the second remake: Evil Dead (2013.)And watching it in order makes me feel lousy for giving the first one only 3½/5 stars. This disaster, alone, should throw an extra star onto the first chapter. Much like what Jurassic Park III did to either of the first two installments of that series.I have heard that Sam Raimi wanted to remake his first cult hit because in 1987, six-years later, he was allotted a budget he didn't have in the first one. Humph! This part II seemed to have half the budget of the first one, more claymation than Wallace & Gromit and worst of all, replaced ALL scares with slapstick humor. Yes. Not one scene, not one frame, was either scary or eerie or even gross. And Brucey, boy, manof course you're embracing the, by this movie's release, B-Movie status, but come on. Even you are better than this garbage.Oh, and don't get me started on the numerous inconsistencies. Doors break, and are replaced, only to break again. Night seems to last for 15 minutes, the day even less, and then just when you get used to a short calendar day, it fluctuates back and forth between day and night within seconds. This is all the while, sunlight hurts the demonssometimes. And one of the greatest tricks, is the cabin goes from one story to two and back to one within the next shot. Maybe that's so the writers can throw themselves off the balcony before the movie was done.The plot was not found, but I can tell you what I observed: the first six minutes is about 80% of the first movie, so, basically, a fast forwarded recap of innocents going to cabin  A, B: having demonic words read and finally demons coming alive to possess and taunt. Then, just when you get somewhat used to Bruce Campbell  sorta  reprising his role as Ash, or previously, Ashley, running around higher than a Cheech & Chong guest at one of their midday parties, they attempt to throw in the replacements for Ashley's friends from the first movie, only dumber. Hell breaks loose, but at least they may have outs this time to stop the demons surrounding the transforming cabin in the woods.One incredible feat I will credit Evil Dead II for is that, incredibly, it's one minute shorter than number one and feels indubitably four times as long. And we're talking only 84 total minutes!Since, as mentioned, this is now a comedy, not horror. When the single and minutely humorous thing doesn't even make sense  Ashley holds down his severed hand with a copy of "A Farewell to Arms" when it's, uh, again, the hand Ashley had to say goodbye to  you got problems. No horror, no suspense, and certainly no comedy in a movie that's "made" for all three.Now, I did like the very ending  meaning the final 30-40 seconds, but I had already checked out by that point. For now, since I haven't watched the 2013 remake yet or the third film in order to review, I would just stick with number one. It's a lot better (now) than when I review it last night.
You gotta admit three things about Hot Tub Time Machine: They knew the 80s, they had heart and they didn't lie about the title.Going into Hot Tub Time Machine without expecting slapstick is like watching Snakes on the Plane while searching for a serious Shakespearean adaptation. You have to know what you're getting yourself into, and if you don't, I'm going to yell at you.Now, while they had heart, knew the 80s and got the title correctly placed, they made a very, very funny movie. Funniest movie? No, not really. But they had just enough to entertain audiences, especially anyone, like me, that grew up (mainly) in the 1980s. It helped having both old and new  sad to say (for my age) John Cusack, Chevy Chase and Crispin Glover are now considered "old" while up-and-comers Clark Duke, Craig Robinson and Rob Corddry are the new "go-to" guys of featured comedies.After Lou (Corddry) ends up in his garage sucking deadly fumes after a night of drinking and driving, he's met by lifetime buddies Adam (Cusack) and Nick (Robinson) who think he attempted suicide and all three plan a trip to a "happening" ski resort of their youth, in tow with Adam's nephew, Jacob (Duke.) It turns out the "happening" place happened to fall on bad economic times. This doesn't spoil their attempts at fun and at one point they end up in a hot tub (duh) that doubles as a time machine (double duh.) 1986 here they break-dance.They do attempt to follow the butterfly effect, but in reality (if there is such a thing in this fantasy,) they've already broken the "rules" by bringing Jacob who mingles with the residents of almost two decades ago. You might as well throw out all reality  for some reason everyone (including themselves in the mirror) sees these time-lost souls as the younger versions of themselves. All except Jacob, who remains as-is from 2010, aside from the occasional and unexplained computer-generated flash-gones. (Yeah, it's late and that's the best I can explain that. Sue me  I'm doing this for free.) At any rate, the rest of the movie with little-to-no spoilers for anyone who can predict the obvious: they are attempting to "live" again, get back to 2010, make amends, find themselves, gamble with "future" knowledge, learn about each other, have sex and wait for Crispin Glover to lose his arm  long, but HILARIOUS story.These are my takes on the main performances: Cusack was surprisingly and refreshingly funny. It was nice to see him back in good form after a rocky career of late. Duke seemed to try his best with his role, but I've seen him do much better. (Sex Drive, Superbad and Kick Ass.) Chase was alright and Corddry was actually funny as a genuine asshole. Glover was awesome in his reoccurring/throughout role and what a great throwback to the other "80s time machine movie" Back to the Future he was.The one person that really stood out, however, and not in a good way, was Robinson. I love him in The Office, and many movies, but here, he seemed like he was sleepwalking through this or phoning his performance in. Honestly, he looked as if he was going through the motions and truly wanted to be someplace (or time) else.But, did we watch this for any of the performances? Hell, no. Maybe the nostalgia? The music? The legwarmers? Perhaps. But, for the raunchy humor, definitively. I don't want to ruin a lot of this. Instead, if you're into an adult "put the kids to sleep early, so we can watch a grownup" movie and you know what you're getting yourself into with a flick with the name "Hot Tub Time Machine," then check this out. It's harmless for the selected audience it was indented for.
For those of you who don't follow film directors, listen up: watch 'Red Riding Hood' and you'll KNOW who directed this crap. Her name is Catherine Hardwicke and she damned herself with the laugh-out-loud 'Twilight' and now she makes Wes Craven's 'Cursed' a second thought as the worst werewolf movie ever.This abomination, this cheap-ass werewolf movie without a single transformation, started bad, became increasingly painful and ended up converting nonbelievers to begin praying this nightmare would end. And believe it or not, the terrible dialogue and hilariously bad acting wasn't the worst of it...It was the Catherine Hardwicke signature STARES she brought with her from 'Twilight.' OMG I laughed hard when I did see the 'Twilight' gazing, longing, boring STARES, but unfortunately, here, it was just simply dreadful.There is ZERO reason to see this, even for die-hard "Red Riding Hood" fable lovers. This has as much to do with the original story as 'The Lawnmower Man' film had to do with the Stephen King short story.Skip it!
Granted, my only exposure to The Planet of the Apes mythology was the 2001 remake, Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, though I might have seen the original only, but I don't remember. That said, I already had the story down, the "secret" the 1968 origin held in the final seconds and the characters.So, what does Rise of the Planet of the Apes (RPA) bring to light? Oh, the how and why. The similarly titled, 2007's Hannibal Rising, also answered some predated Lecter questions. Come to think of it, there's also The Dark Knight Rises coming soon, but that's neither here nor there nor a prequel.I digress, RPA was oodles better than the Hannibal Jr. show and quite entertaining on its own, even if you've never seen the originals. They did a fantastic job of making a prequel its own. Sure, there were the inevitable homage to the Charlton Heston "classic"  one that made me smile (LOOK UP)  but RPA definitely stood on its own. So much so, if they continue this "new" series, it would surely welcomed by me.RPA tells the classic tale of Apes vs. Alzheimer's, whereas apes are being experimented on to cure the disease. James Franco's Will is the idea man and one of the movie's major flaws is the obvious reason why he wants to cure the incurable old-age ailment.Get past that! (Yeah, including myself, Mr. Criticpants) RPA is the main definition of popcorn-fare. The movie's A-B-C with evident conclusions. Granted, it's better than most popcorn movies, such as ANY Transformers disaster, but it's still not to be taken too seriously.At any rate, the target chimp of this movie is Caesar who begins his "learning" on day two and only gets smarter from there on. The movie jumps years like they were Tom Hanks' time spend on the Wilson Island and when Caesar's grown, he's imprisoned when he defends his "grandfather" Charles (John Lithgow) and guess how happy half-human Caesar is about that.Enough examples are shown on why Apes are more human than, well, humans and we get to the foreseen finale.I'm not dogging the movie  on the contrary, again, it was entertaining even when it slowed to a halt in the mid-section or when it was predictable. It has incredible special effects  tell me once when the Apes looked, acted or blended (with live action) unconvincingly and I will defend the movie.It's worth a shot. Heck, they didn't jump on the 3-D bandwagon  KUDOS to the movie for that bold move. SEE IT.Side Note: I will need to see it again soon. Laughably and sadly, we had this imbecile sitting to my left that snorted, laughed at the wrong times, talked and read out every word on the screen. EVEN when it was just a police car driving by on the screen "HEH! Police. Hee hee." Sure, I made fun of him; I turned to him and said "First movie?" and later, I laughed myself, saying: "I can't decide who's the bigger primate: the one on the screen or to my left." Alas, it didn't shut up the ass. Eh, similar to the movie's "motto," some people have to believe in evolution. Here was proof.
It doesn't help the title, or continuity, of a film when a film called Dark Skies never actually has just that. During the short timeframe the movie took placed it always had a full moon in the sky.Perhaps, they were trying to confuse people with the much more successful TV series, Falling Skies since they both have alien invasions. I'm not sure.What I do know is: Dark Skies should've been made and released in the early 1980s. From the style, special effects and storyline, it might as well have been. But, further, I probably would've liked and been scared by this a ton more back when I was a kid.Whether it was released in its more accepted time period, or today, it was just okay. Plot holes aside, the acting was decent. You could tell the actors, including Keri Russell and Dakota Goyo, who played her son, Jesse, did give it their all. But, overall, the movie was underwhelming and took way too long to get to the Signs/South Park aliens finale.Yes. To pause there and not trying to spoil much, but both this and Signs share the same LOL aliens in the last third. My guess is that the creators "don't want it to be about the both poor special effects in regards to the aliens form or the unoriginality on the design" and pay more attention to the story.If that was true and not just a cop out on a low budget, then they had problems from the beginning. The movie was trying to be too much: Yet another family-in-a-haunted-house story, a supernatural/alien fear and a Paranormal Activity rip-off. I guess even if you're a fan of all three of those overused genres, you'd still feel a lacking here.Heck, even if you're a J.K. Simmons fan, you'd still feel something lacking. Like his heart invested in his third-tier role.Basically, we have a family terrorized by weird things happening in their home at night and mortgage servicers terrorizing them during the day since they're late on their payments. The list of "weird things" range from, again, Paranormal Activity activities to an unexplained magnetic bird attack.The movie's okay, just so you know. It's not a complete waste, but, it's nothing special. If you liked Paranormal Activity  and I didn't: it lands in my bottom ten list of all time  then, just stick with that. If you liked Signs  which should land in that same list  then stick with that.Avoid this, unless you think Keri Russell's still hot. Then, by all means
Despite my high rating (5/5 Stars) for Dirty Dancing, I admit: it's a guilty pleasure.Sure it's not perfect. Sure, some lines could be considered "clichéd" and the movie's not that unpredictable. But, it's my life. Literally.No, no one calls me baby, or puts me in a corner  I do that very well on my own. But, I grew up on this flick after my sister, who was the world to me growing up, introduced it to me. Since then, I've probably seen this roughly 34 times. And each timeit gets me.The songs  oh, God, the fantastic soundtrack, the love  proved very well by the wonderful acting of Jennifer Grey as Baby, and the comedy  I still laugh at the jokes, comedic scenes and the silliness portrayed by the boss's son, Neil (Lonny Price) and Baby's sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker.)In my traveled opinion, this movie is an absolute timeless classic. No copy, including the (still unseen by me prequel) can touch it or move me like this movie does. And even the by-a-mile foreseen finale lifts me each time. Yeah, even with what some (not me) would consider the corny line to get Baby onto the stage and away from the judgmental father, Jake (Jerry Orbach.)Setting the movie back in the 1960s was clever. For one, it was a good way to make this movie timeless to avoid the typical 80s haircuts, outfits and attitudes. Also, it got to introduce black-jacketed Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), a (fairly decent) character. A new "Fonzi" (Henry Winkler in Happy Days) or "Danny Zuko" (John Travolta in Grease), if you will.Daddy's little girl (Baby) gets a little too curious at a summer retreat when she gets bored and meets the dance crew of the resort. All but immediately, "Miss Fixit" gets involved in trying to help Johnny's (the dreamboat of her affection) dance partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes), with getting an abortion. With a little hesitation, Penny accepts the help (cash from big daddy's wallet) but this sets off a chain of events.Number one: inexperienced dancer Baby must replace Penny in a gig at a local hotel  enter in dance-instructor Johnny and let the sparks fly. Number two: the abortion from the backdoor doc nearly kills Penny and Daddy must intervene when he originally didn't know where his money went. And number three: Though Baby did nothing officially wrong, Daddy's trust in his #1 child (shhh, don't tell the idiot sister) has been waned.Will Baby set things right with Daddy? Will Baby grow up to be with Johnny? You'll just have to tune inas if you haven't seen this movie before. If you ever wanted to, you have, at least a dozen times. Or if you're the football lovin', macho male who despises "chick-flicks" you really should put down your guard and see this one of a kind film.One of a kind is right. Aside from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and the more recent Dancing with the Stars, you can only really enjoy Jennifer Grey here. Her acting was spot on. Her subtle glances have me rolling, but deeper, they're very true to her character. It's what a lot of us go through.And too bad for two of the leads who are no longer with us. The extremely kind-hearted Patrick Swayze was very good for his roll, not to mention danced awesome (with a little help from the equally impressive Cynthia Rhodes.) Also, Jerry Orbach was perfect for what he needed to be as Baby's daddy.While the rest of the cast was great for comic relief or additional (and superb) dancing, the cinematography was wonderful, the editing great and as already mentioned: it had one of my favorite soundtracks. One song in particular  She's Like the Wind was sung (and (co-)written!) professionally and beautifully by none other than Mr. Swayze, himself. The music was so abundant and fantastic, they needed to add a "More Dirty Dancing" soundtrack. Though, not as great as the original, it's a certainly necessary addition to any fan's collection.This movie should also be featured on the AMC's Movies That Shook the World collection/TV series. For, it had its share of controversy  Ooohhhthey really are DIRTY dancingPER SHAME! and check out Baby's age in comparison to Johnny's. Also, it spawned a completely unnecessary prequel  again, I haven't seen, so I will try to keep my judgment out of it. However that turns out, this is a heartwarming and complete story. No need to go expand or see what happened beforehand. And finally, it should be labeled as influential for the spinoffs (as most movies don't get that far): the short-lived TV series and the stage version. If I remember correctly, they once toured here, in Phoenix, for the AZ State Fair in the 1980s.Dirty Dancing is a must see. Period. It won't change the Earth, it won't cure cancer and it's certainly a "leave your brain at the door"/guilty-pleasure film. But for film lovers, true movie connoisseurs, you have to watch all types of films and this 1980s classic absolutely should be on your list.
There's a scene early in All About Steve that gets Mary (Bullock) fired. The Sacramento newspaper she works for prints a crossword she developed and since it's confusing and  duh  "All About Steve" she gets fired. Seriously? They let this dumbass crossword make it to press without, say, uh, editing/reviewing?? This singular scene sums up the whole of All About Steve.I hated this movie. I HATED, HATED, HATED this movie. I hated her (Mary Horowitz played by Sandra Bullock) character  and to really get into this movie, you kind of need to like herA LOT. I hated the stalking, the horrible coincidental meetings. I hated the misplaced music. (Actually, it's good on its own, but horrible here.) I hated those red (HA HA HA HA) boots. Dear Jesus, this movie sucked.Aside from one scene involving a so-called "dead horse," I did NOT laugh one time. (Even that time, I only snickered.) Bullock's about to finally win her Oscar for The Blind Side and wasn't that bad, or near this bad, in The Proposal. I guess this is like Eddie Murphy, nominated for an Oscar for Dreamgirls and followed that with Norbit. She rightfully won the Oscar for The Blind Side and rightfully the Razzie for All About Steve.Weird lady Mary gets a blind date set up by her parents, whom she lives with, and instantly she's attracted to the said date, Steve (Cooper.) He quickly (and thankfully) realizes she should be locked up and bolts, despite the free and easy sex he would have. She gets fired for obsessing over him in her weekly crossword puzzle (SEE: above) and decides to stalk him across country.Steve gets undermined by his incredibly dumb (character) journalist who provokes Mary into the locales they will be at.Seriously. I am going to stop here. I, honestly, and in good graces, cannot go further. This movie gets progressively worse. And it ends on such a horrible note. She falls into a hole that an astronaut would see from MARS.The secondary characters are dumb. The "feel-good" aspect is awful. The script is painful as are those red boots. Ha Ha Ha, she has those red boots for a reason! No, they're just dumb.Bullock cannot be fully blamed as all actors have their emotionally bad moments or films they apologize for. ALL ACTORS. So, this is just a misstep for her. (Oddly, previously mentioned Murphy, has had dozens, even though he is still funny and should be forgiven for the past 10 years.) She already recovered with The Blind Side and will continue to do better, I'm sure.I honestly watched this to see how bad she was, i.e. Razzie nom and win. But, overall, this was an extremely painful movie to watch. And it was incredibly sad to see how many people were involved and how they gave their heart out to make a "feel good" movie when all it made me want to do was vomit. SKIP THIS MOVIE. Don't even watch for the "soooo bad, it's good" factor. I urge you, no, I demand you never see this mess. Heck, it's not even well edited. Who filmed this? Expelled film students? Ah, just return to sender! Side Note  yes, this was on the vomit scale. I really did want to up-chuck during this. Very few movies make me want to throw up. This is now in the top ten worst I have ever seen.
(Despite my efforts, this review contains spoilers. Please completely avoid reading this, or ANY review, until you see it. But to sum up my own review: YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE. Okay, then read my review. At least, I didn't say you MUST READ MY REVIEW. That part's optional.) The Game was very close to receiving the rare 5/5 star rating. What held it back to 4½ stars was the very ending, meaning the last 1½ minutes that were slightly "off" and the repeat-viewing dilemma. I'll explain: The entire movie is one surprise after another leading up to a shocking finale and after one viewing, the entire suspense is, well, gone. And I'm not talking about just finding out Luke is Darth's son or the ending to Planet of the Apes. Heck, Fight Club also enjoyed its twist ending, but regardless of that revelation, you can watch that over and over. In this case, we're talking the entire movie.Whew, the negative I hate to start on, is over. The Game is a great, suspenseful, fun, ingenious, crafty and original film. It's also funny, namely in the beginning. And to top it off, it's got excellent performances from both Unger and Douglas  who rarely lets me down. In fact, this is one of the top five best movies he's done. In a role that could've been easily played by someone "confused" on what was going on, Douglas added so much depth. You think you know him as a ruthless, soulless Wall Street tycoon, who's used to bullying people to his own needs, but as he breaks down in this movie, you really see the onion being peeled. In fact, I think the most underrated aspect of this movie, as good as the whole was, was Douglas's masterful performance as a lost soul who needs it back.Douglas plays Nicholas, someone so rich (through both inheritance and his own determination later in life as a huge multibillion-dollar money-pusher) that even Bruce Wayne would ask him for a loan. It's shown early on that his father took his own life, I guess greed is not always, for lack of a better term, good. Nicholas is stuck fathering the young brother who grows into Penn, or Conrad. Due to these critical plot points  no spoiler, this is like in the first few minutes  Nicky never has a childhood, nor enjoyed life. But Conrad sure as heck did.In what seems like a normal rehab, begging for money visit from Conrad, Nicholas is presented a gift from CRS from Conrad. Reluctantly, Nicholas coincidentally falls right into the CRS office and begins, what else?, the GAME.The movie then turns very Total Recall-ish, but saved by reality and the real-life settings (all over the continent) and performances. Nicholas doesn't know what is real, or what is fake, neither does the audience who just sat back to enjoy the enormously fun ride Nicholas has to endure to solve or even survive the GAME.Nicholas eventually befriends Christine (Unger) who may/may not know what's going on. When I say befriends, I mean, he thinks she's part of the gameHeck, it's hard to give anything away. Just watch this movie. Anything I reveal can be considered a spoiler. So, if you like mystery, suspense, action, adventure, Douglas and the great style and art of Director Fincher, you must watch this movie and explore and be intrigued by every minute, turn, twist and revolution.Side Note: I wish I could go on, namely how unrealistic I found everything to be the first time. Really think about it when you finish, think about the tests andI've said too much. Watch this movie!
Sometimes, you know you're going into a bad movie. It's evident from the trailers, the reviews, the feedback, the history, heck  the posters even. In most cases for myself, despite all I hear from others, I do all I can to go in with an open mind and give the movie a fresh start. And, typically, a truly horrible movie doesn't begin that way; the set up, plot development, atmosphere and characters typically don't sink the movie within the first minute of departure.Battlefield Earth was not very typical.BAM! Right out of the gate, this movie sucked. They wasted no time in the telling the audiences this movie will be bad, and should never have been made. In fact, I am very curious to hear from the very first person during production to question the morality of the filmmakers. I certainly hope one person had their eyes open during filming.Probably not. From a laugh-out-loud opening back-story naming the aliens as "Psychlos," to hilariously and amateurishly tilted shots, to special effects that would only take up a tenth of an Atari 2600 memory cartridge, to sidesplitting dialogue and acting, this movie immediately takes you for a fast ride on an unfinished roller coaster. And all I described there, you can see for yourself within the first 5 minutes of this overlong 118 minute film. Sadly, yes, this movie that was intended to go on to be a trilogy  HA  was nearly two hours.Of course, I've heard of this movie, ever since it premiered in 2000 and even before that when they were filming it. I had no desire to see it, even when people hadn't spoken the horrors this movie would produce. Once word got out, I had less a desire to see it  especially when I learned more about this new cult: Scientology and its connection to the movie.Years passed and it got brought up time and again as one of the worst. Now, I might have been a bit curious just to see what many did label as "the worst movie ever made," but part of me thought: well, it seriously couldn't be that bad.My excuse in seeing it for the first time in almost 14 years since its release, was that a fantastic podcast (How Did This Get Made?) ran one of their segments on it. In order for me to enjoy that podcast where they dissect a film and make us laugh at the craziness the subject film was, I needed to see it.As mentioned above, my eyes, my ears, my soul could not have prepared me for this. I've been watching movies for over 30 years now and remember timeframes pretty well. Now, I wish I had seen this in theatres in May of 2000. This is a rare movie for any generation, and especially back during that time. Rare as in, most movies, as bad as they might be, would not be as colossally bad as this. So, it would've been a hoot to have my eyes wide open and mouth agape on some turkey like this actually being released during that summer.Obviously, I've bashed this movie and its, ah-hem, "quality," and you might think I'm over exaggerating the depth of madness here. Don't take my word for it. If those first five minutes doesn't tell you that you're in for a disaster bigger than the Titanic, watch on.After the first blow to my stomach, i.e. those opening five minutes, the movie, mercifully, didn't get that much worse. Most movies, as described in my opening here, start okay or somewhat bad and get progressively worse as they continue. Here, what you see (in the opening) is what you get for the rest.Some movies are "so bad, they're good." This is not one of those. It was an extreme chore to get through this. The clichés, the unintentionally hilarious scenes, the Travolta outbursts, the camera angles, the clumsy editing, the Star Wars rip-off scenes, the lack of charismatic "heroes," pointless plot twists and numerous flaws were all so tiresome to keep up with.Some actors go crazy in the public's eye, and still, they appear to be doing their job on screen. This was everyone's chance to see John Travolta hitting rock bottom on screen. (Actually, during this year's Oscars, he pretty much proved he's not just crazy in movies.)If you don't subscribe to How Did This Get Made?, run away. Don't waste your time. There are plenty more "so bad, it's good" films out there. Like Troll 2, The Room, Birdemic, anything Syfy makes. Heck, Syfy films could actually remake this and put some rogue sharks with laser beams on their heads in space. And THAT would've been a better movie.* * * Final thoughts: When movies are as bad as this, I generally take hundreds of notes and turn my review in to a "Top Twenty-Nine (or so)" list of what I think are the funniest thoughts that entered my mind during the film. I did in this case, but gave up on #5, which is not enough to make an entire list. The reason? This movie literally bored me to tears. The shock of how bad it was over about 20 minutes in and then I just lost interest. But, not enough to turn it off. I was just determined to make it through this sewer of sh|t so I could listen to the guys (and gal) at How Did This Get Made? rant about it. At least, that part  the podcast  was worth it.
Hammer time will have to wait for The Avengers movie.This feature length version of Thor and his origins was only marginally better than Marvel's Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Spider-Man 3 and Daredevil. That's not saying much when you factor in the better Marvel films: Spider-Man 1-2, Iron Man 1-2, X-Men 1, 2, 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Fantastic Four 1, Hulk and Incredible Hulk and Blade 1, 2, 3. Hmmm. Of the 18 Marvel movies (including Thor) I mentioned, that means, Thor ranks as 15/18.That's not good. Nevertheless, if you're slightly curious, or like CGI-laced movies a lot more than I do, check it out. I wouldn't waste the extra fee for 3D or IMAX, like I did unfortunately, but it's harmless comic-book entertainment. And be forewarned: DO NOT STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS for that extra teaser they've been known to get people hyped for The Avengers movie. At the end of this review, I will SPOIL IT to save you the extra time. Heck, the movie's too darned long anyways.The movie immediately begins with Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman as Jane Foster who's studying with her colleagues in the New Mexican desert and inadvertently runs into banished Thor (a gorgeous Chris Hemsworth  one of the few pluses of the movie). But wait! How did he get dropped into the desert?Well, thanks for asking. Over the next 45 minutes or so, you'll learn the background story of Thor, his King Daddy Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and his oh-so-mysterious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston  one of the many negatives of the movie.) They run the realm of the good guys, and they don't like the ice baddies who want to make everything and everywhere cold. Their leader must've lived in Phoenix, AZ at one point and for that, we will take their side.The story appears on the surface as kind of complicated, but deeper, it's almost as basic as can be. Thor leads his misfit friends after the ice giants and thus gets banished to Earth  full circle  and now we're back to Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman and her interest in alternative universes and of course, hunk of a man Thor, himself. He, however, is battling everyone to get his precious star-laced Hammer back. Unfortunately, he must learn to be humble to get it back..blah blah blahI never bought his transformation, I just wish there were more of super-powered Thor and the not "Oh, can't we all get along" idiot they put on the screen.The performances were okay. One in six jokes worked. The graphics were decent  MUCH better than 2010's Clash of the Titans. The only thing I looked forward to, aside from seeing the breathtaking Chris Hemsworth on screen, was the never-ending The Avengers/S.H.I.E.L.D./other superheroes either seen or mentioned. There were a lot, but it was welcomed as I was more interested in the "coming attractions" and less involved with the actual film I was watching.Again, recommended for the curious, and not recommended for those few that are, to stay through the final credits.(And as promised, SPOILER, here's what you'll see after the seemingly 15-minutes of credits one of the scientists, Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) who worked with Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman's Jane is invited into an underground bunker to meet with, yep, you guessed it: Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) again. Nicky wants to use this power cube, but doesn't understand it and Erik is mucho curious about it untilwe find out he's Thor's evil brother Loki in disguise. Yawn. NOT WORTH IT. Couldn't you have shown Thor VS. (or at least, meets) Hulk? Or even Iron Man (in the suit) going at Thor? Sorry, I love Samuel L. Jackson as much as the next human, but enough. Give us something we haven't seen.)Oh, and by the way, I hope someone had noticed the "Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman" as sarcasm. And that's another discussion
Allow me to start with: I'm not opposed to stage-cum-film movies. But, I am not a supporter of simple Carnage on screen.What we have here is bullying, the newest hot-topic of American talk-shows. One kid "bullies" another into either snitching or being in a gang  it's really unclear, or I just got too bored to care anymore when the background synopsis is given. And 90% of the rest of the film is pitting four "adults" against each other in a room to discuss said display of unruly kids thanks to their guardians.So, the entire 80 minutes  yeah, really short and yet it felt sooo long, deals with two couples "talking/screaming/drinking/puking" this incident out. Don't get me wrong; I don't condone one child smacking another with a stick. But, I do think they had the wrong target(s) in mind.I got the simple concept, but what I didn't buy were the numerous, and I mean 5-6, scenes of why a visiting couple has to stick around where they're both unwanted nor do they want to be there. There are also numerous attempts to shout out moralities. So the writer (or adapter) is desperate to get these parent's lost souls and marriages out on the table  literally in one scene, but at every chance of desperate escape, the unwilling couple caves barely without a whimper.The issues at heart is the bad parents, Nancy (Kate Winslet) and Alan Cowan (Christoph Waltz) and their son who was previously and utterly wrong at smacking the taunting kid of bad parents number two: Penelope (Jodie Foster) and Michael Longstreet (John C. Reilly.) The Cowan's are invited over to the Longstreet's to discuss the incident, I'm believing more for the avoidance of a lawsuit, and when the 5 or 6 times the Cowan's attempted to leave, they're repeatedly coaxed back into the apartment to further state their points to deaf ears.Our ears become deaf, as well, and though I'm sure some would find this intelligently written, even humorous and sad at times, I never, ever got past the fact that the Cowan's would never leave. It was almost if these four, who rightfully deserve each other and whose kids deserve more, were magnets of misery. Granted, I might be "corrected" with someone stating that was the whole message, but to me it was as realistic of a concept as if the actual (Spider-Man) character Carnage showed up to referee the battle within.The only two performances worthy of notice came from the always great Reilly and Winslet. But, sadly, they just played it by the letter this time. Foster was just all over the place, even though you could clearly see she was thoroughly focused in understanding the role. Mission: FAIL. And Waltz didn't even do what his name suggests. For the most part he was there for the paycheck and when he attempted to wake up in the movie it was long since over.Overall, it's a small, unique and mercifully quick film, but it doesn't get any kind of recommendation from me because there have been many more and better films made on the subject of bad parents and bullying.
Quick! (Just like the Mask) Let me tell you my story.Honestly, I don't remember if I saw this in theatres. I probably did, because what I do remember in early 1996, is buying the VHS copy of this movie and I watched it a grand total of 5-6 times in under a week. I recall watching The Mask over and over and never getting sick of it. Sure, I had plenty of other movies to watch, but this onewas so much fun.And it still is today. Recently, I bought this movie on BluRay, because I remember loving it, but haven't seen it in over 10 years. I seriously had just as much fun today as I did with those multiple viewings when I first bought the VHS. This movie really holds up from the many years since its release. It really is timeless.Goody-Man Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is transformed into the daredevil Mask figure when he finds, and dons an ancient wooden mask, and his inner desires come out tenfold. He goes for the girl, inadvertently pisses off the mob and takes care of business as "The Mask" superhero/cartoon character that mild-mannered Stanley couldn't.The story isn't exactly new, even for 1994, but it's take on the age-old underdog/superhero is fresh, exciting and most of all HILARIOUS.As a matter of fact, when prepping and watching the movie to write this review, I was puzzled on which genre this movie fit in: Action/Adventure + SuperHero? Or Comedy + the rest mentioned? And as I found myself laughing and laughing, even after my 5+ original viewings, I settled on: This MUST be a comedywith a close second of Action/adventure + SuperHero.I think this is a very underrated film. It was a very old concept that was a ton of fun, thanks to Jim Carrey at his peak and newcomer, Cameron Diaz who (almost) stole every scene she was in. She was gorgeous and talented and it was hard to believe that this was her first outing. Honestly, as much as I do like her, but not so much every movie she's been in  though I do enjoy a lot of her films, she was fantastic in this. And I understand that dog was like a prop, I still LOVED little Milo. You have to suspend your disbelief a lot during this movie, so you might as well believe all the dog accomplished.This movie is so straight forward to typical movie viewers and still, it's a lot of fun. And it contains one of my all-time favorite scenes/songs in any movie: The Cuban Pete dance segment. Pricelessas was this movie. See it! It still holds up today and despite all the smoking, especially if you're against that, it's a helluva lot of fun.
There are so many things right about Kill Bill Vol. 1, but let me focus on one of the best aspects: Tarantino makes you so enthralled, you want more. So much more.One of my biggest complaints about movies is the length and not knowing when to shut up. (Rarely, will I say the opposite, though Children of Men needed to be so much longer, or a series.) Heck, I've even complained about other Tarantino movies being too long. (Inglourious Basterds) But, Vol. 1 is just perfect in pacing and longing. He masterfully made us wanting more, or, Vol. 2. And I'm not just talking about the absolute spoiler in the final few seconds. The whole thing seems quick enough with barely a down minute and gives enough background to know there is so much more to this story line.Plot line: "The Bride" is immediately "assassinated" in the opening and immediately reveals her unborn baby is the ultimate killer, Bill's. Then the movie moves fast-forward, reverse and in-between, much like Tarantino's other work, i.e. Pulp Fiction. It's not easy for the average movie-goer, but I felt he made it a lot smoother, and easier to follow this time around.Tarantino gives enough background on what led her to the El Paso church where she ultimately "died" and why she eventually wakes from a four-year coma to seek revenge on the five responsible for her and her unborn child's attempted murder.In Vol. 1, you get to see her vengeance on Green (Fox) in front of Green's daughter  spoiler alert, this is supposedly the setup for a Vol. 3 in years to come, and Ishii (Liu.) In between, she kicks some ass on bystanders and loyal gang members.This movie is Tarantino at his best. The best he wants to be: a Grind-House voyeur. An excellent story-teller. You can't take this movie seriously. It's silly in a lot of ways, but that's the Grind-House in Tarantino. And this leads me to another fantastic quality of Vol. 1: Thurman.Despite the foretold silliness, Thurman as "The Bride" does an excellent job, and in my opinion, at least an Oscar-Nominated acting job. She brought extreme realism to an otherwise campy character out for revenge. And, you wanna know another perfect quality about her? Tarantino makes you root for her despite her being a ruthless assassin. A real bad-ass-gal.I don't want to give away too much about the plot, subplots or scenes in the movie, but almost everything works in this movie: Music, score, style, acting, originality, suspense, action, cinematography, dialogue and uses of both color, B&W and anime. This is Tarantino at the top of his game.To expand: I loved this movie. The action was tight; the movie was extremely well paced. The music, both score and soundtrack was wonderful. The choreographed scenes were fun to watch. The twists exciting. The dialogue and writing was pitch-perfect. I would say this was his best work, if not for his even better earlier works (Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs) or movie to come: Vol. 2.Just remember the origins of this movie: it's basically an explicit Japanese exploitation martial arts/revenge movie and you can get past the silliness, the plot-holes, such as how she always seemed to have money and no one ever investigated her murders, i.e. Buck during her multi-hour recover scene (speaking of which, why were her upper muscles so accessible while down-below were so, well, weak?) Word of advice: don't look too deep, enjoy the master Tarantino and sit back, have fun and look forward to the (so-far) conclusion in Vol. 2.
You knowthe more I think of Legion, the movie I watched last night, the moreI didn't like it.Usually, it's the other way around. Most times, I hated a movie at first, and after more and more thought, I find that I was too harsh. In this case, we have actual angels of Heaven above that use their metal wings for shields and actually get hurt withbullets. HmmmThis movie, Legion, is so much too like many other movies: The Seventh Sign, The Mist, Michael, Dawn of the Dead, I Am Legend and even Terminator 2: Judgment Day. It's a Trapped-Survivor film, whereas, a group of clichéd "heroes" must band together for the unknown, scary and unrealistic monsters outside. SEE: Night of the Living Dead (or any of the Dead series) or Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight.So, now, we've established this movie is NOT original. Do they bring anything to the table? Well, sorta. We have a choose-to-be-fallen angel who fell because God wanted: Noah's Ark II: Baby Got Back. Apparently, He's upset because mankind's, well, you know how bad we are, and he wants to send zombies and flies, yes, flies to wipe us out.Thankfully, a group of men and women  all with their fantastic (no, I'm joking) backgrounds - hold up with a know-it-all Michael, the aforementioned dropped angel, who happens to have a large number of guns, unlimited ammo and Biblical knowledge to predict the bad/good angels from their attack and to save an unborn child who supposedly supposed to save ALL MANKIND.Incredibly, this "Good-VS-Evil" tale involves gun-toting angels and never really dives into why the baby is the key to proving God wrong. Let's stop there. Who the bleepy-bleep can prove God wrong? Let's go further back: even if you don't believe in God, but you know what kind of being He is, do you really believe an action of an ex-angel and a single mother can make God wake up and say: "Oops, My bad. Sorry, let me call off my rage"?It starts off good, improves with the presence of both a mean ceiling-crossing granny and Dennis Quaid  though that's his weakest performance/character to date and then progressively gets worse. There is nothing original or redeeming here. Just plain skip it. Read the Bible. At least that "Good Book" doesn't contain all those incredibly fake JAW DROPPING creatures. (Sorry, those, like the ones featured here  the ice cream man, or the all the baddies in I Am Legend, make me laugh so hard. C'mon, Hollywood. They're not scary, they look stupid and they're physically impossibleeven for the supernatural.)
What horrible timing this movie had. Sure, even though it came out months before the Sandy Hook school shooting, it's still arriving on home video just weeks following the massacre.Looper should have a warning, or at least, a tribute, if they keep with the December 31st release date. Spoiler: (and there might be a few more minor ones  fair warning,) there are scenes where a man hunts down to slaughter very young children. They even show a scene of a very young boy getting shot.Sure, this was made months, perhaps a year, before the Connecticut shooting, but I believe it should be shelved for a bit longer.I digress. My opinion of this 15-subplot film was that I was puzzled it wasn't actually another network 1-season failure on TV. It was amazing that they seemingly fit one Sci-Fi Action/Adventure Drama season of 24 episodes into 2 hours. Since they can do that, that gives me hope for a 24 movie, finally.The movie was all over the place, since they, like I said, fit 2 dozen episodes into 2 hours. It starts off with one bland and clichéd future and speaks worse of another future. The plot holes are wide and before you get a chance to get hung up on those, it shifts to another movie. And another. And another.Oh, and before you think: Well, at least we have our hero to attach onto throughout the multiples of ideas presented, think again. There's barely a character to latch onto. Everyone is an asshole and the only difference between the characters are levels of asshole'ness.Let's see if I can come up with even a basic premise for this random movie: Young Joe shoots and kills future mob trash sent back in time because for some dumb reason, it's apparently harder to bury a body in the future than it is to travel through time.Eventually every "Looper" must kill themselves, pending they lived long enough to see time travel invented. So, Joe knows he must kill old Joe, and despite what the misleading trailers of the film told us, he has no problem with this. He's just a bad shot, and old Joe gets away.There. I gave you the first of about 14 more story lines to discover. That's the gist of what you'll really need to know. Well, that, and the blah (only in this performance, that I've seen) Joseph Gordon-Levitt either had a digitally re-mastered face to look like old Joe (Bruce Willis) or he's just damn good at squinting for weeks of shooting.As mentioned, this might have worked as a one-two season Sci-Fi show on TV, and it might have been more interesting that way. We might have had more fleshed out characters that we would be more invested in. Perhaps, I wouldn't have thought they were all assholes, or actually believe them when they finally do the right thing.Still, despite all I said, it kept my interest barely enough to complete the loop of the movie. It might be hard for those lost loved ones recently or still in shock of what happened on the East Coast, but other than that, it's a harmless, albeit below-average, flick.
Out of thousands of movies I've seen in the theatre, I've walked out of the theatre in disgust prior to the climax only three times. (Actually, one movie I actually walked out on TWICE, because after I initially walked out on the movie, Cadillac Man, my friends dragged me back to that movie at a later date. 20-minutes in, they agreed with me, and we all walked out.) The People Under the Stairs was one of the other two I walked out on and get this, it was literally 10-minutes before the end of the movie!I remember this movie vividly. Picture it: Phoenix, Arizona, 1991. I've always loved horror and since I loved Freddy so much, Wes Craven was high on my list. For a new and "original" film, this was a must see. Unfortunately, half way through, I thoroughly disliked this movie and by the time the movie got to almost the ending, I couldn't care any less on how it ended and I bolted. This has never happened to me before or since and of those three movies I exited early, I never made it this far and left early.Nowadays, I write a ton of film reviews, but I would never on a movie I didn't complete. It's unfair to the movie by not allowing it to fully explain itself. Rarely will a movie redeem itself in the last ten minutes, but it has happened, I recall.Fast forward, 22 years, and during October/Horroween time, I decided to *finally* give this movie another shot. I mean, why not? It's not like it's another 3-vested-hours of goofiness I have to endure; it's only 102 minutes and 10 of which I hadn't seen before.To be honest, I didn't hate on the movie that much this time. Sure, it's still bad, and though Craven was trying hard to be original, though failing some, it was so convoluted with way too much going on to enjoy. The basics of this movie was a creepy house and a trapped-inside boy trying to escape and eventually does, but *has* to go back for a captive girl living there.Literally, that's the core of this movie. There's roughly 23 other plots going on  and yeah, I know, I'm exaggerating, but not too far off, but breaking it down, the movie's somewhat focus is on the boy, a dog and the escape plan.One of the things I had a problem back in 1991 was Plot #17, the sadomasochism (S&M) "father" in leather. In my defense, I was in High School, living in a pre-internet age and was brought up in a very sheltered, Christian household, so I had no clue what S&M was or why this man decided it would be a good idea to disguise himself in full leather in his own home to continue to chase the boy.Today, knowing exactly what it is, and whyit still makes zero sense for him to do this. Previously, it's stated that "every generation more insane than the one before it" in this household. But, being crazy does not equate the desire to participate  in this case, unexplainably  in S&M.Now, here's the million dollar question, but mostly for myself: Should I have stayed for the final 10-minutes in 1991? And the answer is: No. I would've hated it all the more. The finale, and sorry  spoiler for the 22-year-old movie, involves blowing up a room full of cash and despite the grand explosion, the cash survives and intact and is distributed to the poor.The movie gets a little too out of whack, too many times. Reminded me a lot of The Evil Dead original, but for no solid reasons for it to mimic that movie. Also, the "message" felt like a Lethal Weapon unneeded addition to the already overloaded script. Totally: Not recommended to meet the people under the stairs.* * * Final thoughts: I was right. Back up, I was right to walk out on the movie, but I would've been more right not to see it in the first place.
I hesitated, almost a full month, before seeing Avatar, a movie that apparently the world saw first. And when I saw world, I mean everyone, even people who have never see a movie, or even have the technology or places to go to see movies, saw it. I delayed my viewing as it was not a movie I was interested in seeing in the first place and the trailer made me snicker at the tall, skinny Smurf people.But, I broke down and saw it, as I knew I was going to see it anyways and the small screen, or even a 60" would probably not do the large scale/action flick justice. Even further, I needed to see it in IMAX-3-D just to get the whole effect. Was I disappointed? Yes and no.The special effects were amazing as was the cinematography. That was breathtaking. But the FX and scenery was only good whenthe blue people (or the Na'vi) weren't on the screen. Yes, I realize they're on practically the whole time you enjoy the rest of the CGI-world of Pandora, and I think the technology has thoroughly advanced through the years, but I just didn't buy it. I just didn't think they're there just yet. I almost laughed each time I saw them, but I never truly believed them to be anything but computer generated images. Everything else, aside from one of the dog-like creatures looked absolutely fabulous.Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving. For example, as stunning as the 90% of the graphics were, in addition to the flights, the story looked as old and stale as most of the moments in human history it mimicked. I guess it was no secret the plot is without any teeth or any bit of originality, so stating it's a VERY A-B-C movie is just irrelevant. My guess is they (or just King Cameron) knew this, he's not stupid, and just said let's just throw in as many tricks/CGI/gadgets as they could possibly think of as distractions to deter from the central plot. It is very well known to people I associate with, that story comes first, always. I could be thrown a million things (even in 3-D) but that doesn't stop me from looking deeper for anything resembling not only originality, but heart.Was the movie bad? No, I wouldn't go that far, but the race to cover up the lack-of-story with a billion FX kinda got old and made me look at the time more than once. Not only was I kinda bored with the attempts to impress me, but I was still waiting for the basic "C" elements of the A-B-C plot-formula (which, mercifully, finally arrived.) The basic storyline (a Dances with Wolves with the Titanic theme  dang, I got really frustrated with hearing Titanic all throughout this film, because Titanic was 12x better a movie) involves a last minute death of a man who was supposed to inhabit a Na'vi body in the long-distant future in order to infiltrate an alien species on another planet. His mission was to bring back information or (ha-ha, like I believed this) negotiate a "relocation" of the Na'vi so that Earthmen can harvest a rare substance in order to reboot Planet Earth after humans did a fine job of destroying it.Well, thank goodness, the dead spy had a twin brother, but unfortunately, he's also paralyzed from the waist down. That doesn't really matter when your mind is transferred to a 12' Na'vi body. I'm spending way too much time on this 15-minute-plot, so I'll fast forward (and it's no shocker when it's all spoiled in the previews, anyways.) He joins scientists, gets separated and meets up with a Na'vi (or make that naïve) woman, Naytiri (Saldana,) who spiritually think he's the chosen one.She trains him while he remains loyal to a very bad man (or high ranking military cliché who works for someone so incredibly cartoonish  Parker (Ribisi)  that I had to laugh at every unbelievable moment he was on screen.) But lo! He starts to see life in the blue, becomes one of the blue and its: Red, White and Blue vs. the other Blue.The handicapped character-turned-spy, Jake (Worthington, or, again, I should say Worthless,) is so brain-dead that whenever Naytiri hits him in the forehead and calls him a child, I wanted to join her, but instead just punch him. Yes, I get the fact they wanted to show a transformation, but this extremely-dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks was so hard to watch, it should've been played by Keanu Reeves who might have given him more depth as a surfer-dude.Would I recommend it? For special effects and fantastic scenery/scope, alone and the inevitable "Ewoks" finale made up for a lot of the movie's downfalls. Obviously, the general movie public (or in this case the entire Earth) likes familiarity. I, on the other hand, like to be amazed by screenplays that took more than a few hours to construct.Either way, I would recommend, if you would ever see it, you need to see it on the big screen. I did, and I am thankful, now that I did and saw little to no depth, I can safely save money on foreseeable future Avatar sequels.
It's well known in my small circle that I'm not an overall fan of the Harry Potter seriesbut damn, what a great finale.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Deux, or HP7b, was not just fun, exciting and adventurous, but it was a wonderfully written and tight conclusion wrapping up multiples of story lines without over doing it. It's for die-hard fans to pinpoint all the singular references from the previous seven movies. (It helps me that, instead of waiting the year  or in some cases, TWO  in between, I watched them all within 9 days. Yeah, even I had a day off in between)The revolutions in this, including some major character's motivations, were enjoyable and it was nice to finally get the answersespecially after having to sit through an astounding 1,178 minutes of film to get to a conclusion that was foretold from all-but minute one.Basically, I've already given the synopsis, but with more clarity: it's the final (and thoroughly EXCITING) battle between No-Nose and Harry Potter, the boy that livedthrough their first meeting 16 years prior. There will be destruction. There will be deaths. There will be blood. And mercifully, no one spoiled who died, or when, but I actually expected more deaths from more significant characters.In fact, as spoiler free as people were courteous to be, the way they ranted about the deaths in Deathly Hallows, I had it narrowed down to one of two (of the countless) main characters who were going to kick the wicked bucket. I was wrong.At any rate, I had a ball. It certainly was one of the best (and thankfully, was the shortest) of all Harry Potter movies, although if I were to rank them, it would go something like this:1. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix 2. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 3. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 14. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets 5. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 6. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 7. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire 8. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Well that concludes, and probably for good, my Harry Potter journey. As much as I complained (okay, RAGED) through some, as much as I got excited in other parts, I did have fun and will be happy I got through all 19½ hours to say, once and for all: I do have an open mind to all cinema. Even ones that aren't typically my cup of British Tea.Cheers!
Talk about 80s. Perhaps my first time seeing Critters should've been back then.I have seen Critters 3 when was young, but then it was only because I was into Leonard DiCaprio at the time. (Actually, admittedly, I still am.) I just never got around to this, Part 2, 4 or whatever how many more they made that I have even less interest in.This original film (meaning, #1 in the series) dealt with fur balls from hell  uh, space  and their need to chop everything with their piranha teeth. They crash land in Smallville, U.S.A. on the most cliché family farm in movie history. I.E. Dad wears overalls all-day and drinks from a jar. (Even his real name is "Billy.")In normal 80s fashion, the family fights off the rolling little balls of Satan while two emotionless, direct from a bad 80s music video, bounty hunters aid.Despite me never seeing this before and it's been just shy of 30 years since its initial release, it holds up for me because it's 100% 80s horror/comedy fair. Even if you've never seen it, but love the 80s horror movies, you might like this little gem.* * * Final thoughts: I know they were trying to tap into Gremlins success, just like every other 80s horror film was a copycat, but at least this movie tried to shake things up a bit with the background story. Sadly, that entire (and basically, right off the set of the 1970's TV program: Wonder Woman) sci-fi opening was truly hard to get through.
1. There's more clapping in this movie than at a Sunday Baptist church service. Hell, the clap-on/clap-off lady didn't do this much clapping.2. Any paranormal story disclaimer of "Based on the true story" should be accompanied with "well, if you believe in this sort of thing." 3. To be fair, maybe the "true" part was that the Demonbuster Duo believes their own fairytale and did publish it. Sounds like another demonic duo that dreamt up a religion in the mid-1800s and also published it.4. For being thee most "malevolent" case of the Demonbusters' 1000+ entries, does this mean the inevitable sequel is guaranteed to be less "malevolent?" Will this "truthful" disclaimer be on the poster?5. "So far, it hasn't done anything violent, and that's a good sign," says Demonbuster Ed. The family must've only had that recently slaughtered family dog they loved so much for only a day in order for them to forget about her so quickly.6. The debate, or inconsistencies within the story, of whether this is a ghost, demon, witchy-woman or Shadow Person, raged on with the contradictions in the script. Suffice to say, don't listen to anything the characters tell you and just know: it's a very bad thing.7. Ghosts  or demons? - who have been dead for a long time start to stink badly. Which makes sense if they rotted, but do "ghosts" really decay? 8. I know it's 1971, but has anyone really ever cleaned with elbow grease? 9. If I softly close a kitchen cabinet, it wakes my roommate up. And yet, half a dozen picture frames fall hard against the staircase and the sound of shattering glass echoing throughout this house doesn't wake the five timid girls.10. Nor does the mother stepping on the glass loudly.11. Nor does the mother falling down the stairs.12. Nor does the mother screaming.13. Heck, screw this family. She should be the first to leave and alone. Especially when her girls don't hear her from within the house and the returning father hears one of the girls screaming inside from the outside, on the street, 200+ feet away and around a semi.14. Don't fall for the "it's getting late" excuse from your Demonbuster Duo for hire. Remind them that there's at least five more hours of daylight left.15. As with most of these fictional tales, entities can teleport beyond walls. However, children and dolls still shouldn't be able to. Making this up as you go, eh? 16. Even though it seems like our Demonbuster heroine drops six floors in a two-story home, it shouldn't take five minutes to get to the basement to rescue her. Well, if you don't waste all that time pounding on the walls verses just going to the basement, that is.17. You will only be reminded it's 1971 becauseone character says "groovy" and The Brady Bunch is on TV.18. Oh, and in the seventies, only the rich could afford flashlights. The rest had to settle withmatches.19. Demonbuster Lorraine's mother questions her daughter's suspicion that her child might not be alright. Has this mother been in the dark this whole time to what her daughter does for a living? Or even her "special gift?" Have the mother and daughter met? 20. Fear not! This apparently blind demon, who can pass through walls, knock things over, pull sleeping children out of sleep, lead kids astray, possess people, reveal itself when the plot requires it to and turn the Narnia Wardrobe into a nasty place, actually needs to be told where her target victim is hiding. In her own home.21. One of the daughters is dragged across the room by her hair, is saved by scissors and yeteveryone retreats to their rooms to have a good night sleep before finally deciding to leave the property in the morning, several hours later? 22. It was nice to see Chucky's Seed return to theatres.23. Suggestion #1: So they "can't move out because they'll follow you?" Huh. Well, then, let them follow you into a one room studio apartment with easier opportunities to catch the bastards.24. Suggestion #2: So they "can't move." Fine. Forget privacy and take all the doors off. Actually, why do any of these characters have doors when the entities seem to love locking people away from their loved ones? 25. It's pretty convenient that the tape recorder went silent during the family's "story" of the demon/ghost's activities. Lemme guess: the video tapes also went blank and I suppose I just need to take your word on these "truthful" hauntings? 26. At very least, it wasn't found footage. But, then again, these movies will make a ton of money anyways due to the seemingly never-ending need for horror-lovers to see the same thing over and over and over. I mean, do you really think this was an 27. original movie? You judge: New family moves into a haunted house cliché. Demon taking a very long time to get stronger, cause havoc and possess someone cliché. Toy ball used as demon plaything cliché. Nearby Demonbuster team and they're available on the spur of the moment cliché. Can't move out of the house because they put all their money into it cliché. Setting up cameras throughout the haunted house to document the entity cliché. Wacky secondary Demonbuster team cliché. "It must've been a draft" when a door closes on its own cliché. Door opening, scaring people and turns out to be the comic relief character cliché. Ghost wearing a white sheet cliché. Birds attacking haunted house cliché. Expert savior of the day not close, inexperienced hero steps up cliché. Peaceful music at the end cliché. Box office gold for the constant remake cliché.
I'm a huge Jason Statham fan. I love his style, his acting, his demeanor, accent and most of all, his fighting. Even the worse movie is good when he is fighting.Well, that's how I used to think. Recently, I discovered the How Did This Get Made podcast, where they (mostly) ridicule movies for about an hour, in the most hilarious panel-style way. My mission was to watch/catch-up on all the movies they did and this included this movie, Crank, it's follow-up and In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale.Those three, and yeah, again, including this one, were utter garbage. I even listed them in order from really bad to the worst. So, that said, comparatively speaking, this is the least offensive Statham outing.Basically, no-good, surprisingly charisma-less, Statham plays (the most outrageously horrible name for any character ever and always reminded me of the breakfast cereal, Cheerios, when his name was spoken) Chev Chelios who must keep his adrenaline up the entire movie until he gets a cure for the poison another baddie injected him with.The entire movie is a blended video game, rave home video, a live-action anime cartoon, obscene music video and snuff film. It's crazy and it knows it, thankfully. If it took itself seriously, I would have liked it even less. But, that didn't mean I bought in on the horrible camera angles, over-the-top lines, action and acting and the extreme madness.I can see where someone might like this sort of insanity, so more power to them. Personally, I like a little more realism and would've liked it if I gave an ounce of sh|t on whether Cheerios lived or not. Or any character for that matter.Okay, I take that back, I did want the Asian(?)/Hispanic(?) bad guy to live. But, only because he was so damn cute.* * * Final thoughts: The ending of this movie was a perfect conclusion for this tale and is the reason I 100% avoided part 2. But, then again, I need to see the movies the podcast, How Did This Get Made, covers so, finally I did see it. And it was bad. Soooo bad.
Oh, thank God someone had faith in Freddy.I mean we start with the great A Nightmare on Elm Street and follow that with an abomination, A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge. Not only did they believe there's more story and more depth they can explore, they made A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors much better than most of the other 1980s horror franchises.Usually in the said horror series, especially in the 1980s, a part 3, 4 through 10 was inevitable due to the low cost to produce and return, even if small, was enough for the big wigs (see Saw series of the 2000s.) So, this part 3 was probably going to be made anyways, but wow, did they make an actually good movie.Freddy's back to take the remaining "Elm Street Children." He supposedly dies in both part 1 and 2  though they ask you kindly, as any rational human would, to forget part 2 existed. I absolutely love it when series do that, when they made some bad sequels (Also see: Superman Returns that said to heck with parts III and IV.) But due to some of the souls (explored more later in the series) gave him enough power to continue.Now, the remaining teens, coincidentally enough, are all sent to a psych hospital due to "attempted suicides." One of them is (very high-pitched screeching) Kristen (Arquette) who has the power to bring people into her dreams and she starts with Nancy (Langenkamp,) the only teen survivor from the first movie, who begins to work there, apparently not coincidentally.Nancy rallies the rest of the team and a suspicious, but obvious love-interest doctor, to fight back in the dreams with their own special gifts before they are picked off one-by-one. Oh, and there's a mysterious nun that aids the good doc in their quest.The movie's not perfect; it does have its share of inconsistencies, such as Kristen is the only one with the power to bring people into her dream, yet, they all join her later on their own. On a side note, laughably, half the movie her name is "Kirsten" while the other half it's "Kristen." Also, Langenkamp played the teen somewhat or fairly well (ok, just "okay") in part one. Apparently, she does the teen role mucho better than the adult, because, I'm sorry; as much as I liked seeing a familiar face (after the dreadful part 2,) she was just plain awful here. (I'm talking about the acting, not to mention the disappearing & reappearing act of her white hair streak  it literally has a mind of its own.) And finally, even though 97% of the special effects and inventiveness was good, the claymation/Clash of the Titians skeleton in the climax was a bit laughable  especially the men's reactions.With that out of the way, I really, really liked this movie. Freddy, though not all the way out of his shell, came out mostly and was funny, actually scary and proved he was worth more visits in sequels to come. The dreams were good  not just the back alley way, or bedrooms, they actually took us places, namely to what would #1 scare the victims, but use their fears against themselves.The soundtrack was good, the depth they gave  finally some sort of Freddy background, was very interesting and the jokes were actually funny. Also, you never knew (if you haven't seen part 4) who was going to live or die, so the suspense was up, as well. For example, most of these horror sequels have bad tempered/mannered/villains that are sure to be offed due to making the audience reel in their demise, but this has plenty, yet they remain unharmed. That's part of its originality and showed the movie was focused on what it was  killing the teens of the parents who killed Freddy originally.Even if you're not a fan of the series, you should see this 1980s horror throwback. Though recommended to watch #1 first (always, ALWAYS skip #2) and then this, it gives you enough background to see this as a stand-alone feature.
Well, it was a good start.Actually, let's begin before the start. Way back in the day, I wrote for The College Voice at Glendale Community College. I even had a column named "Reeves Reviews" and had long hair in my mug shot. (A little after the mug shot was taken, I had cut that mullet I had, but the boys in the newsroom loved it, make that mocked it, so much, they made sure it stayed in my column.) One enormously unpopular review I wrote was for Reservoir Dogs. It probably would've been criticized elsewhere, but namely it was trashed on a "college" campus. I gave it 1/5 stars and named it "irrelevant." (Reprinted article follows this review.) Since this was not only Quentin Tarantino's debut film, neither me, nor the movie watching audience had any scope of what Tarantino was capable of. After watching his future directed projects, such as his enormously improved second outing, Pulp Fiction, I strongly say again: this was a good start.Reservoir Dogs starts off well, with a soon-to-be signature rotating camera view of a cast of off-beats discussing highly irrelevant topics, in this case: Madonna songs and an awesome anti-tipping monologue. But after the strong and fun opening, the movie moves on to the real story. These men, cleverly named (mostly) after colors (Pink, Brown, White, Orange, Blonde, Blue, Nice Guy and, uh, Joe) attempt a heist which, of course, gets botched and one of them is no longer a color but a rodent, or rat, to the police.The film, in (again) soon-to-be classic Tarantino fashion, is told in multiple flashbacks and decisively never actually shows the jewelry robbery, which I liked. In fact, the majority, if not 99% of the film plays out like a theatre production and gives the movie time to breath with great dialogue.Granted, the movie is hard to watch, and I am not just referring to those so lost when a movie's not shown in chronological order. It's hard due to the excessive violence, blood, torture, language and being almost completely void of any characters to root for. These men are bad, very bad and I am guessing this is the message Tarantino wants to get across: this is a movie about bad, very bad guys. It's not a nice cop/western show where the good guys wear white and you applaud them on.Recently, I began re-watching all of Tarantino's directorial flicks, mostly in reverse order, of which, I finished here, with Reservoir Dogs. If you happen to watch them that way, it's easy to see how great and definitively quickly he grew to what I strongly believe to be one of the best directors to live. But, therein lies the problem I had with Reservoir Dogs and this has nothing to do with the original review I had with this movie. (By the way, I did upgrade my rating - slightly, but it did take a few additional movies of him for me to, well, "get him"  my bad, and it did take more than one viewing of this film, as well.) This film had a lot of what Tarantino wanted to say, to do, with rich dialogue, interesting characters with absolute depth, and film, comic, music and pop references, but it really didn't allow Tarantino to really take it to the next level, or what Pulp Fiction did.So, don't do what I did, unless you have seen his entire directorial collection. Watch them in order, starting with this one and ending with (so far) Inglourious Basterds. Sure, you might still like/love this one, but, you'll soon love to explore the depths he takes his talent, both on screen, behind the camera and in the scripts. And here is my original review written in late 1992 for The College Voice. By the way, I've since lighted a lot of the subject of homophobic lines and characters in movies. Unless it's blatantly against and rallies people to burn gays, I rarely even bring it up. In addition, I remember specifically those guys in the newsroom, the same ones who thought it was fun to make light of my mullet, were ready to kill me for my opinion on this. I get that a lot."Dark humor and violence dog irrelevant 'Reservoir'"A confused film usually can't tell if it wants to be a comedy, drama or a speak-out-against-society film."Reservoir Dogs" is a movie in that category, and it's more a black comedy than anything else.Somewhat funny at times, "Reservoir Dogs" is not an interesting film. It's too much of a confused and angry movie, lashing out against law enforcement, homosexuals and African-Americans.The film's weak plot begins in a diner with six or seven gentlemen, and an array of obnoxious, annoying criminals who sit and talk about today's lighted topics, including Madonna.After the diner scene, which is the best part of the entire film, they switch to the events that take place after the crime, which they were hired to commit.Violent, gory scenes follow as "Orange," (Tim Roth) a criminal, has been shot and is quickly dying due to loss of blood. "White," (Harvey Keitel) his partner in crime, takes him to their "hide-out," an empty warehouse, in fear the police will find out who they are.The story line suggests a strong hatred for police officers. It even shows one of the men bringing in a police officer to question why the police showed up so quickly after the robbery.Later, this officer is brutally tortured. It is obvious to see debut-director Quentin Tarantino's respect for law enforcement.The profanity and violence in the film makes it realistic, but at most times, it's irrelevant. "Reservoir Dogs" receives one out of five stars on my film rating scale. This film should be avoided.
Without spoiling it, the end to Martha Marcy May Marlene (henceforth known as MMMM) has been questioned considerably within internet circles. It is so clear cut that it all-but has the director entering the screen and stating: "No, don't wait for the audio commentary, you know what happened"It's a sad ending to a tragic story. Not mind-blowing tragic, but downbeat nonetheless. I mean, the story could've been a lot more vicious if it wanted tothink 2011's The Woman. Hell, it could've even been 2002's Dahmer.Poor MMMM, an already lost soul gets sucked into a back-wooded "cult" and escapes to her estranged sister and new husband. She must be "lost"  they have one of the most gorgeous on-the-huge-lake houses in cinema history and she's only mildly impressed. Of course, she's got a lot on her mind.Roughly 50/50 of the movie dwells on the past and present as MMMM tries to cope with existing amongst the real living, but the real living can't cope with her.OK, here's the problem: ONLY once did they prove to me her cultish family of sex-fiends were actually a cult, or even minutely dangerous. If you see the movie, you'll know what I am referring to, and yes, it's awful and horrific, and you add that to VERY mild controlling issues, it didn't look all that scary to me. Granted, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near their farm (house) land, even if a zombie apocalypse occurred.Regardless of the lack of threat, it was a deep and purposely slow moving fare that gives you hope for this lost soul, but never enough to actually like her. It did have some great cinematography and the music played was nice  except for one goofing off scene that was painful. It's a dead even "eh" recommendation.
They waited 5 years to reboot the other green comic-book character, Hulk. I hope they don't take five weeks to decide they made a huge mistake.Make that many, many mistakes with Green Lantern.Oh, I don't know where to begin with how many things were wrong with this movie. Terrible editing? Shitty dialogue? Unforgivably boring action sequences? Tedious characters with such little depth and even less charisma? A script that felt both rushed and too crowded? Open-ended story lines that vanish? Plot holes bigger than Hal Jordan/Greenie's (Ryan Reynolds) imagination?Let's go with: the movie has no heart. There was nothing to hold on to. I found myself caring less as the movie progressed. Heck, they gave us a boy, Hal's nephew who, I suppose we're supposed to sympathize with, and he's gone within a minute to never be mentioned again. Or, how about the best bud, Tom (Taika Waititi) who appears briefly and only to partially explain Greenie's situation, though he does it in the most boring manner.Or we can latch onto Hal, who's supposed to be a top notch pilot, but irresponsible human, turned hero who quits, wants love  sometimes, and gains some momentum while solving a problem that an infinite number of "guards" and immortal "idiots" couldn't even think of.I'll pass on those characters. So, where do we normally turn when our heroes, sidekicks and love interests are boring and/or pathetic? Ah, the bad guy(s). Joker, anyone?Ha. Ha ha. Beyond the enormously unmotivated and uninteresting Tim Robbins as some Congressman ("Hammond") who literally only showed up for "green" and a black cloud with a LOL face who was as shapeless as his character, we have poor, poor Peter Sarsgaard in his most embarrassing role to date. And I really like Pete. He has toMUST!...admit he's ashamed of what he did (or what they made him do) when he saw the finished product.Barely three seconds of screen time is devoted to explaining his motivations, ambitions and love triangle background with the mutual love between him and Greenie. Worse, his powers are presented to us, but they seemed to come from thin air without much explaining or reasoning. The fact he was ugly and unimaginatively constructed is only incidental to how little time they spent on a proper foe for Greenie. Kinda reminded me of the laughable "Electric Man" villain Hulk's daddy becomes in Hulk Vol. 1.The irony of this all is: this is a film that's built on an imagination-induced superpower and yetit lacks any imagination.I've seen the (un)Fantastic Four films. I've managed to get through Daredevil and even Catwoman. Greenie lands solidly on the list of worse comic-book (make that, ANY) adaptation I've ever seen.Wow, I made it this far without a single positive. OK, I'm positive that if they reboot it with 99.1% less alien interference (I guess you gotta have the ring granting one, fine) and keep Greenie grounded, it might be 10% better.
Let the games explode. Despite liking the direction 'Saw II' took, 'Saw III' was actually an improvement over 'II.' (Still, the original 'Saw' was the best, but this is second best.) The only unfortunate thing I can report, after saying how much I liked this feature in the series, is: they didn't just take the gore to the next level, the exploded it on the screen (in some scenes, literally.) I have seen a lot of horror movies, a lot of the "torture porn" films, slasher ones, etc, and this ranks #1 as the goriest movie I have ever seen. And that's too bad. The writing, acting, suspense, mystery and dialogue make me want to watch it, but at the same time, it's, well, "torture" to get through. (Spoilers ahead, but only for those who haven't seen #1-2) The now established team of Jigsaw and Amanda once again take on multiple people to prove a point: appreciate life, letting go, moving on and understand forgiveness. It would take an article seventeen times this size to go through all the plot points, so, to sum it up, just read the previous sentence. Yet again, they are now falling over their so-called twists and connect-the-dots and once more they are prepping the audience for more 'Saw' chapters. Unfortunately, they should've ended it right here. (See the closing, forget the cliffhangers and you'll see why this would've been a wonderful closing.) I did really like this installment, but sadly, this will probably be the final viewing (of 3) I will have of it. The gore is really in excess here, and the one test towards the end, involving literal "twists" is the most gruesome of all (five, to date) 'Saw' films and probably one of the most heart-wrenching to see in any film.
I remember going all the way to Harkins Camelview 5 to see My Own Private Idaho in 1991. Thinking back, this was a milestone for me: my first gay themed movie and before I was out. It was when I was barely beginning to "know" what the gay lifestyle was all about. Thankfully, I didn't take it all to heart, as this was not only more than a "gay themed" movie, but it's also a much darker side as well as just one aspect of the lifestyle, namely prostitutes.Of course, it helped, I was in love with River Phoenix at the time (who, sadly passed on a few years later.) And it opened  wide open  the future viewings of independent cinema. After watching this now, the very first time since late 1991, I can see this is the epitome of independent movies.Mike (Phoenix) suffers from a lot of what life dealt with him, namely and most obviously, narcolepsy. He's lost (literally) and holds on to his one love, Scott (Reeves) and his hope of reuniting with his mother. Scott takes care of him, and shows the one human side to his character: looking out for poor/always falling (again, literally) into a deep, uncontrollable sleep.Mike lives on the street, hustling to mostly men in order to survive, but through his many sicknesses. Meanwhile, best bud, also street hustler Scott is set to inherit a rather large amount of money on his 21st birthday within the week from when the movie begins. Scott hopes to just live it up with his zany co-prostitutes and street robbers/sex-for-hires until he can safely turn his life into fame and fortune. But, again, he continues to take care of Mike and furthers his journey (possibly as a way to break up the boredom) to reunite with the mother of his memories.In a time where gay was still relatively taboo, I applaud Gus Van Sant for making the movie he wanted to, despite the still-general public ignorance. It's rather weird, and certainly not mainstream by any means. And having it not only based solely on the Shakespeare play of Henry IV and V, you'll truly feel that "theatre" presence in many of the scenes.In addition, the movie is mostly a sad romantic road picture about wandering and lost souls. At least you have a character to root for (Mike) and as sick as he is (inside/out,) you'll want to find his lost home. His lost mother.The movie's only real downfall you'll experience  that is, if you didn't get most of the symbolism, or what Gus Van Sant was trying to say  is, once again, Reeves. He continues to prove himself to be the world's worst actor. Ever. Phoenix and the rest of the cast were not only astonishing and believable, yet, Reeves is as wooden and stale as a 30-year-old fallen dead tree. As in most of his movies, it's as if he's standing as erect as he can while reading cue cards. How he would benefit if film students would simply give him some acting lessons.Nevertheless, the rest of the movie has wonderful cinematography and good music. Recommended for lovers of independent films and for people with the understanding of groundbreaking (for the time) film-making.
On a side note, Wrath of the Titans stars the hunk of a man, Édgar Ramírez, whom I first noticed, albeit briefly, in The Bourne Ultimatum.That's it. That's pretty much all I have to say positive about this 1970s adventure made with today's technology.Okay, fine, most of the graphics and cinematography were pretty well done  not the 3D, mind you, which sucked, as usual as of late. And I would be lying if I didn't say, for the majority of the time, I was impressed with the technology. It sure as hell beats the crap out of the first one, the 2010 remake. (God  ironically enough  I remember laughing my arse off at Zeus's Glow-in-the-Dark dress.)The movie seemed rushed, the script all over the place, the actors bored and confused and the point of the film sprouted in so many directions, even the Titans, themselves, never knew when they were supposed to make their entrance. I'm probably not too far off since this was most definitely rushed into production the minute the remake made some good bucks in its opening weekend.If you look at the movie from a distance, it would be unfair if I said it was the worst I've seen, this year or any. And even though barely any scene actually worked, or hardly any character was minutely interesting enough to give a more positive review, one could do a lot worse. I say "hardly" as Hades (Ralph Fiennes,) this time, that is, was a bright spot. Go on, give me hell for that one.Let's see if I can sum up the experience I just had: Fairly weak gods to begin with are now even weaker because despite everyone (in this universe) knows they exist, no one's praying to them. If their power reduces further, bad demons may/may not  depending upon what version you see of this  roam the Earth and that's the end of man/god-kind.Meanwhile, the so-called powerful god of gods, Zeus (the disappointing Liam Neeson) gets locked up in Hades and his power is needed to release his dad, a baddie of fire and arm motions. Meanwhile, Perseus (the bored Sam Worthington) is trying to keep his incredibly, and unintentionally, hilarious son close while fishing. Meanwhile, he needs to go somewhere to pick up another half god/half loser to venture to get someone to guide them to hell and back while hell comes back on its own.Oh, and there's a queen, an army and out-there jealousy and hatred. Did I get most of it at least?Blasted. I forgot the threesome of giant Cyclops that literally looked like enlarged white Shreks on the screen. Thatmade me burst out into laughter.The movie is just not worth it. Again, it's not the worst I've seen, it's thankfully short, although it feels longer, and it matches (minus special effects) any 70s throw-way adventure/fantasy sequel you might have grown up with/loved. I wouldn't even wait for home video. Just watch the trailer and know (SPOILER) good prevails.I saved you money and time. You're welcome.
1. There was enough testosterone in Fast Five for me to get married and divorced three times, due to dozens of affairsall with women.2. To even use the phrase "Leave Your Brain at the Door" to describe this movie is like describing Phoenix, AZ as hot.3. They gave The Rock a goatee so you can tell the difference between him and the other meathead.4. The group-heist scheme was so juvenile, even Danny Ocean would call them amateurs.5. Of course, they left it open for a sequel, which, no doubt, should be called The Fastisix.6. Pregnant women that leap from two stories and crash through the roof of a structure should at very least get a spot on the next Planned Parenthood promotional video.7. What comes after the following series of battles? King Kong Vs. Godzilla; Freddy Vs. Jason; Alien Vs. Predator; Pacino Vs. De Niro..uh, Dwayne Vs. Diesel? 8. Not everyone likes sequels being made. But, I'm sure as hell Paul Walker does.9. The movie's not going to be considered for Best Picture anyways, so I hope they fired whoever made the decision to delete the scenes that the series is known for  racing cars to win other fast cars.10. Thankfully, EBay sells everything, including an entire, full-size vault, exactly like the one you plan on robbing. Heck, in one click, you can get it delivered in hours. To Rio, no less.11. The movie opened in April 2011 to $86 million which spun Hollywood Honcho's heads until summer began. Then their heads were just shaking.12. Expecting Fast Five to be realistic is like believing there really are prehistoric piranhas in Lake Havasu, AZ.13. Calling this predictable is as predictable as calling it predictable.14. Incredibly, there wasn't a writer's strike during the production.15. Sooothey steal four cop cars, and their first instinct is to race them in plain view?16. Also, now that four cop cars are now missing, much to the bottomless pit of luck to our antiheroes, the police never bothered to GPS the cars, much less write a theft report.17. Joker burned money to make a point. These guys did it because they couldn't come up with one original idea.18. These guys have more lives than Jason Voorhees and yethave only about half as many sequels.19. You could mute this movie and still know what's going on.20. Cops turn bad so frequently in this series, they should turn to politics next.21. The cartoonish finale is so "Yeah, Right" that it makes Wile E. Coyote's schemes plausible.22. Why is it in heist movies, it's always their last gig? Their last take? Their last job? Their last everythinguntil the next installment?23. What is Monica Geller doing in Rio robbing crooked police?24. UFC called and asked Vinnie and Rockie how they can make their fights now not look so school-yard-brawl'ish.25. When you find out you're gonna be a dad, asking the nearest tough guy his fondest memories of his own dad is like Ted Striker asking the guy next to him to pinch him to see if he was dreaming.26. Wow...Vinnie's actually smarter than he looks. He took an additional role as Producer.27. With everything wronghow on Earth was this just simply entertaining and probably the best of the series? (Yes, indubitably, I actually enjoyed this mindless flick.)
I am not exactly sure why Carrie needs so many remakes, reboots and sequels.As a huge (pre-sober) Stephen King fan, I appreciate his visions and horror. Granted, of all the dozen or so books of his I've read, his first, Carrie, I have not yet read. I know the whole story behind both the fiction and true story of it being written. In this particular case of fiction, the true story out-shines his book.(Google it for the entire Carrie background, or better  buy and read the fantastic "In Writing" by Stephen King.)I digressinto another story of mine: Back between 1992-1994 when I attended college, my film professor chose the 1976 film as "the most influential horror movie of the 1970s." Many, including myself, disagreed.Some would say it would've surely been the 1973 cult, The Exorcist. I would say: 1978's Halloween. But, I would concede that the Sissy Spacek version of Carrie was fantastic and haunting. Especially if the ending hadn't been spoiled by multiples of horror documentaries since.Fast forwardto last year. 2013's Carrie stars two established actresses. Well, one to get even better, I believe: Chloë Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore. But, they could not pull it off.First off, there was zero reason to remake this again. Second, they not only didn't bring anything new to the table, they actually took the film a few steps back with terrible CGI and bad acting. And third, with most remakes/reboots, just stick with the original. This is no exception to that third rule.I would highly recommend the original and that alone. PLEASE don't let this be your first experience into the world of Carrie.* * * Final thoughts: I'm not joking. Read In Writing by Stephen King. Granted, there's other ways to get the whole story of the making of the novel, Carrie, but In Writing explains it best and from his own words. And speaking of which, in a wordTabitha. Thank you!!!
Now, I liked From Dusk Till Dawn a lot and that was a two-movie feature. First part: sooo Tarantino while the second movie was very vampires, or Rodriguez.This "third chapter" in the Nick Frost/Simon Pegg trilogy is, essentially two movies in one and, though The World's End is enjoyable, it certainly is the weakest of the three. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, or the deadpan humor from Pegg or Frost, but it almost feels like overkillsince they're labeling this as the third, albeit, unofficial film in the "series."Basically, Gary wants to relive his youth and finish what he left unfinished with a pub crawl many years previous with his old chums. Reluctantly, they agree and off they go. Unfortunately, things have changed in both their normal lives and this small town they grew up in. Bad things. Think: Stepford Wives. Sorta.Admittedly, it's been several months since I've viewed this and most of it has left my memory. I wouldn't have a problem to revisit it, but since I remember only thinking "Eh, nothing special" I'm probably going to wait to have a Pegg/Frost evening to recap this.* * * Final thoughts: Honestly, I love "End of the World" film ideas. But, in 2013, and in recent years, there have been too many apocalyptic movies. When this was announced, or the "coming soon" trailer released, I was actually turned off due to the titleeven with the two stars I love (Pegg/Frost) attached. Mercifully, there's meaning behind the title and despite the "second movie" here, it manages to deliver without overkill.
Okay, it might be unfair to compare The Hangover Part II to the part two of the George Clooney's Ocean's series. After all, I am one of the rarities that actually liked Ocean's Twelve and at least Danny's gang changed the plot for their second outing while this "wolf-pack" literally modeled their sequel after the first movieline by line. Shot by shot.Okay, that all said, let's compare. Shall we?Both Ocean's Twelve and The Hangover Part II's source movies began in Las Vegas, NV, U.S.A while the sequels took place in another continent. Twelve and II had superior and hilarious origins and followed up by "how did this happen again" premises. And (HOPEFULLY) the third segment of (the inevitable) The Hangover Part III will be the "make-up" movie Ocean's Thirteen was, much like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was to Temple of Doom. (Okay, that last part is jumping ahead a bit)I literally watched The Hangover Part II to laugh. I needed it, after a long, LONG, week of work & dentist (long story) stress. Unfortunately, minimal laughter came from me. Slightly from the reoccurring character "Mr. Chow" (Ken Jeong) and mostly from "Alan" (Zach Galifianakis.)I'll admit: it just wasn't that funny. I got quickly past the "it's EXACTLY the same as part one  aside from the locale" part. That was obvious. I was at least hoping for something new or fresh, of which, I got neither. I did get a good, and different, look at Bangkokone that the tourist industry doesn't want you to see. And believe it or not, it did serve as a good, though mediocre "mystery" while watching these blind fools retrace their stepsagain.Okay.so we have the same gang from the original (Phil, Stu, Alan, sometimes Doug and Mr. Chow at times) who travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding along with the clichéd, disapproving father. Eh, forget that last part, cuz it's so insignificant to the synopsis of the foolish group of men who misplaces the bride's brother, Teddy (Mason Lee) during a drunken night of mischief.Have you seen the superior, The Hangover? Stick with that. I did really like that original first movie. And unless you're a Die-hard fan of these characters that do, say and act the same in this inferior follow-up, EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, skip the sequel.I have a feeling, The Hangover Part III will be the apology both Last Crusade and Ocean's Thirteen were. For that, I'll give the third hangover a shot. But, for now, I've experienced more entertaining "real" hangovers than this movie gave me
(Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointCheers.)Bad Boys my arse. Somewhat bad, unless you're referring to Michael Jackson-Bad. This 1995 film was even too formulaic for that year, worse now 17 years later. Slowly paced and filled with already over-used clichés, it was almost as if they just wanted to make the full-on black Lethal Weapon. I figured I'd finally see it just to see what all the hype was about, especially since they followed it up with a sequel and talks for a third one is in the constant works. I wasn't impressed enough to move on. It doesn't help that I'm not a huge Martin Lawrence fan, although I do like Will Smith. Just not enough for a recommendation.
I remember those days. We were all fooled and I was part of that fool's parade, playfully called: Will Smith Can Do No Wrong During the Fourth of July.Following the fantastic Independence Day, came the very fun Men in Black. Two years later, WWW, or Wild Wild West premiered. Granted, it sometimes can take three years to nail a great action/comedy/adventure. But, come on, guys, you had plenty of time to get a better Will Smith vehicle than this piece of horse's manure.I remember seeing this on opening weekend in 1999. For the first part of it, I remember kinda liking it, but hoping the great talents behind and in front of the screen would make this a grand western  probably my least favorite genre.Nope, the movie got progressively worse and worse, more and more preposterous and ended with the most WTF climax that was an absolute chore to get through so we could go home. Leading up to the laugh-out-loud finale, were a ton of silly scenes poorly edited together without the sense of logic, humor, grace or entertainment.I vowed, easily, that is, not to ever see this movie again. Thankfully, this movie did fall off my radar and was easily forgotten until fifteen years later. It was then that I discovered the How Did This Get Made podcast. It was/is my mission to watch/re-watch all movies on their show list and then list to their podcasts where they spend about an hour ridiculing, often very hilariously, movies. Sadly, this movie was on that list.Fine, I'll get through it one more time. And with every viewing I have of a movie, I give it a chance. Meaning, here, I went in with an open mind and thought, maybe I was wrong before. It was a decade and a half ago, after all.Again, nope. This movie was actually worse than I remembered it. My only advice is to listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast. Don't even bother watching (or re-watching) this waste of time. The podcast is hilarious and gives much more depth to the making of and behind the scenes I didn't know about which far exceeds any joy you'd get from this turkey.Andthe podcast's guest star isKevin Smith. He was incredible. This movie was not. Skip it.* * * Final thoughts: Mercifully, Kenneth Branagh is great in so many other things. Besides me mentioning him here, forget he was ever part of this. His character was classless, humorless and, ah-hem, had no legs. I forgive Will  he was probably pushed hard to be in this, Selma wasn't huge at the time and Kevin had to take anything he could get a hold of. But, Kenneth was just plain embarrassing to see on screen. Just go see his other fantastic films, instead.
(Absolutely contains spoilers  sorry. Too late for me to edit and remove said revealing comments. My apologizes: I don't even know how to use this word processing programme.)Maybe, I missed it. Perhaps, I got caught up in the endless narrative that captured the journey of a young girl/boy through a "nameless" storm in the south.Beasts of the Southern Wild, I assume without researching prior  a trait of mine to give movies the benefit of the doubt, takes place during both the Katrina hurricane and its aftermath. As far as I caught, they never name the "beast" that devastated (the also unnamed city of) New Orleans.Also, uncaught by me, for the majority of this film, was the sex of our little "hero/heroine" of this tale. Immediately, I thought the character, ah-hem, Hushpuppy, was a young girl, but after the fifteenth (or more?) time the child's father refers to her as "the man," I got confused.Granted, you have to understand where the not-all-functioning-upstairs father is coming from. His IQ might be in the low single-digits, but his heart is in the right place: he's trying to teach his (verified) daughter to survive in a flooded, disease-filled and destructive land following a monster storm.She states a lot of quotable quotes while they travel to one makeshift hut to the next until they get rightfully rescued, but wrongfully reject such help. Then she travels, or leads other uneducated kids to a strip club and brings back catfish to her ailing father because, well, I guess this is all supposed to mean something.The movie, while very well shot and yeah, most of the lines delivered by Quvenzhané Wallis's Hushpuppy are memorable, is way out there. You will have to find some peace in such madness and understand: some people would rather die to protect their way of life than help themselves, or their young, out of the hole of the abyss.It's not a movie I would ever want to see again, but it's a decent and experimental one-shot-viewing for those tired of seeing the same ole from Hollywood.
Not only is it refreshing to see movie makers go back to the traditional "vampire lore" and rules, it was very nice to see what a "potential" future vampires would have if they ran the show in Daybreakers.Aside from "real" vampire movies  sooo sorry, Twilight fans, that's Goosebumps territory comparatively speaking, another one of my favorite aspect of "futuristic" films, is showing news programs, debates on TV or anything to show what mankind (or humankind) has become with plenty of examples. Daybreakers has it in truckloads. I loved that.In what reminded me a lot of Blade, in reference to "marketing and distributing" humans for the blood needs of the vamps, Daybreakers shows the future (2019) IF vampire ruled the Earth, or say, 90% or so of it after an "outbreak" supposedly caused by a (get this) vampire bat. Obviously, they need blood and without the fake-blood in the equally entertaining HBO True Blood series, they're gonna turn into a bat-like creature and wreck havoc and cause chaos.In comes plainer than day, sympathetic vampire and scientist Edward Dalton (Hawke  who literally feels like he either slept-walked or phoned in his performance) who takes to some humans trying to come up with a cure to the "vampire curse" while banding remaining/hunted humans from the big, bad corporate guy (Neill) and his army bent on harvesting humans for blood/profits.You see, the vampires are restless. Hungry. Thirsty. And the local blood-providing diners are dry. The government's supposed to be handing the supply and demand, but they're desperate and running low on ideas.The movie starts off promising and refreshingly original. It veers off into familiar and predictable territory. And aside from Hawke being as plain as day, it's incredibly worth a viewing for the originality of the dominance of vampires, the information provided in the future and for the suspense and nice reminders of what vampire movies are really supposed to convey.Not to really spoil anythingI love the cure. And the cure's cure. This will certainly rank high on my best vampire movie list and I'm sad to see it didn't do all that well at the box-office. Either way, watch it at home. Don't miss this wonderful horror film.
I need to get something off my chest really fast and then we can get to the good stuff, or my positive critique: I hated the forest battle scene in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. I loathe slo-mo scenes in movies without explanation, as much as I hate CGI that takes center stage in films (i.e. Transformers.) And for 90% of this particular sequel, they craftily explained slo-mo, like the original Matrix did, so I was cool until Director Guy Ritchie took an unexpected, unexplained and unoriginal turn with showing a slowed down bombs-away scene amongst trees.WhewI'm glad I got that out of the way, because for the rest of the experience, I had a blast. A LOT more than Robert Downey Jr.'s first turn as the famous genius detective in 2009 remake: Sherlock Holmes.Holmes (Downey, Jr.) and newlywed Dr. Watson (Jude Law) work together to solve the alleged crimes of famed Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) as bombs, murders and nations against nations take place in good ole 1891. Much like Dr. House and Dr. Wilson  which took from Sherlock's M.O., there's the typical reluctance, yet joy in their relationship.That's all incidental to an extremely fun adventure, great and believable cinematography, a smart and often hilarious script and another fantastic performance from Robert Downey, Jr. I love seeing him in "the smartest person in the world" roles, although I was corrected today saying Sherlock's brother, Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) is actually smarter. And, in addition to that person who knew more Sherlock's history that I did, another individual gave me the background today of a lot that happened in the books (and real-life history) that also appeared in this movie.Admittedly, I'm not a huge Holmes fan. I am a Robert Downey, Jr. fan and he led me to these two (and, hopefully more) films. He did create an enormously believable, fun, funny and adventurous already-established character brand new for me. And, though I appreciate them sticking to legend in this tale, I'm just happy with what I saw on screen and not have to watch countless hours of celluloid or read numerous books just to appreciate the two hours of film here.Honestly, there is not much more I can say about this project  without spoilers, that is, but that I had a roaring good time (outside the forest, that is) and that it's a tremendously enjoyable time with how brilliant both the character Sherlock was written and how great it was to see Downey, Jr. play him perfectly. I hope for a Part III, and pray they look past the so-so American box-office to justify it.
Yeah..I know. I know. I'll get heat for this one, but Source Code is so much better than and the movie I thoroughly expected from Inception.Was it the hype for Inception I heard for the two months it took me to see that after it was released? Eh, I can get past that. And Inception wasn't a bad movie, but it didn't impress me than this admittedly smaller, but more entertaining sci-fi thriller.Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakes on a train headed towards Chicago and he's unsure how he got there. (I can relate, but mine's usually an unfamiliar beduh) And within eight minutes, the whole thing explodes! And that's just within the first eight minutes of the movie!Next, Colter awakes in a pod with Colleen Goodwin (played the always fantastic Vera Farmiga) asking him questions on a screen while telling him his "frivolous" inquires on where he is/why he's there are irrelevant and he's wasting time. Well, if you didn't know how you got on a train one minute and in a pod the next and you thought you were supposed to be serving your country in Afghanistan  oh, I left that part out: he's a soldier  then you might be a bit puzzled yourself.And repeat. He's constantly sent back to the train scene where his "mission" is to find out who's the mad bomber within eight minutes so Colleen and her military gang can prevent another attack  one that's actually in downtown Chicago. Only, we've sent a human to do a computer's job, à la: the Robocop syndrome. He falls for Christina Warren (played by  again  the always fantastic Michelle Monaghan  I wish we could see more of her), a woman Colter keeps seeing once he's "magically" transported back onto the train while he's inhibiting a body of a victim who's fate will be sealed (yet again) in eight minutes.There's a lot more, and it would be hard to write a synopsis without blatant spoilers. Suffice to say, expect a lot of twists and on the edge of your seat suspense, EVEN when they supposedly solved the "problem." Literally, even though the movie could've ended 15 minutes before the finale, I was still on edge because humans always seem to mess things up, even when they "won." And lo, I was thoroughly surprised and pleased with the conclusions.Much like Moon, Director Duncan Jones made such a "small" film seem so large. I can absolutely see this making only a third of what Inception made, and that's okay. Avatar made TRILLIONS (not really, but anything over $100 million was unjustified) and that doesn't make that anywhere near the top of hardly anyone's best movies lists. I can absolutely see this movie making my own top ten of 2011 (at least.) And it's so short that, it's an easy movie to watch repeatedly.Strictly for entertainment purposes only, Source Code, a more serious and more relevant (for today's time) Groundhog Day experiment, is a must-see. The performances of the two leading ladies were very good and Jake  eh  was still good, but the idea, originality, twists, fun and absolute suspense make this a train ride everyone should be all-aboard. (Dang, that was cheesy. Hope that doesn't make the poster and deter viewers)
Much like Nicole Kidman in To Die For, this Training Day was a Denzel Washington vehicle. Both movies were ho-hum, but held the character of a lifetime and is highly recommended just on their command performance.This is not to underplay Hawke's almost (90%) equally acting  he was very good, himself, but Washington was so good, that when I first saw this back in 2001, long before the Oscar Nominations were announced, I said: "He better both be nominated and win." On a side note, unfortunately for Washington Fans  he has tried to recapture this high since and that's made me very sad to say I once was a devote Washington follower. Meaning: almost every role since 2001's Training Day, he has screamed "OSCAR!" without acting much.But, I digress, this is about Training Day, a good (again, not great) film, but one you should see concerning the troubling day both Rookie Hoyt (Hawke) and Harris (Washington) are having.Eager to please and diligent to keep his job for his growing family, Hoyt is joining the narcotics hard-core L.A. team, but he needs to deal with drama-filled Harris, who may (or may not) be on the take with the crooks he's paid to take down. (Watch FX's excellent series The Shield for further adventures on the same plane.) You see, Harris might be in over his head with a deal/incident gone wrong in Las Vegas, pissing off the wrong people, despite his demeanor. And he must trust the Clark Kent'ish Hoyt if he's to get away with it.That's pretty much it. I don't want to spoil much more than that, and the fact I brought up The Shield, which covers pretty much the same ground. That's pretty much itfor the plot. Watch this fantastic performance from Denzel who, up to this point of his excellent career, hadn't played a true baddie. And he does it in spades. It's worth the Orientation Day for him alone.
The Road, or A Man and his Boy.I don't know how many times I've repeated myself on this Hollywood cliché: in life things are supposed to happen in threes, but in La-La land things happen in deuces. A Bug's Life, Antz. Dante's Peak, Volcano. Deep Impact, Armageddon. Mission to Mars, Red Planet. Infamous, Capote. Paul Blart: Mall Cop, Observe & Report. Killers, Knight & Day. And on and on, these VERY similar movies come out very close to the same release dates of each other. Now, I get to add The Book of Eli and The Road.Even though the above movies are very similar, there's always one better than the others. I will give you a list, just for fun, of which are the better of the two ending with The Book vs. Road.1. A Bug's Life surely stomps out the Antz. 2. Dante's Peak is bigger than that of a mere Volcano. 3. There was a Deep(er) Impact before the Armageddon. 4. I've seen neither the Red Planet nor any Mission to Mars training video. 5. Capote was great yet I have not viewed the Infamous version. 6. Paul Blart was the ideal Mall Cop who Observed & Reported Seth's terrible follow-up. 7. Knight & Day is King where as Killers remains, in my to-see list as unseen. 8. Take the back-Road. Eli's Book reigns.I'm sure I've left out a few (dozen) but this should give you an example of Hollywood's obsession with releasing ideas they think are so desired by the general public, they need two films to stretch out the American dollar. Unfortunately, in the case of The Book of Eli and The Road, audiences weren't that interested in the age-old post-apocalyptic genre. Neither were the Oscars.I honestly thought, seeing the early previews of The Road it surely will be nominated. Well, of course, that was my trailer-impression. I hadn't seen the movie, and afterwards, I'm glad it didn't get celebrated.Was it a terrible movie? By all means, no. Depressing, average and so little going on, it wasn't one I'll ever watch again. Mortensen plays a man who is heading South on, duh, the road, with his son to protect him, not only from all the post-apocalyptic cannibals but his own mother, seen in flashbacks. Literally, that's the entire movie, other than a few little things. We get a little father/son time, a little life-lessons, a little food found, a little interaction with "the good guys" and a little background what happened prior to the world becoming ash.I've heard the book, with the same name, it's based upon is much better. Unfortunately, since I barely had enough desire to spend two hours watching desolate and torn world, I have even less yearning to spend my average time of three weeks reading about it. (Slow reader, here.)I found the action was okay and the acting mediocre  I've seen both Mortensen and Duvall act circles around their performances here. (And speaking of which, oddly, coincidentally or from the book, Duvall's character's namedEli.) I'm sure someone else sees some depth in the movie, I missed. But I was just so..bored. The best parts were the flashbacks, but they didn't give me everything I wanted, such as the reason for the "end of days."Leading me into one of my great desireswhy not see an IMMEDIATE post-apocalyptic movie. Such as what Terminator 2: Judgment Day did in Sarah Connor's dream or in the wonderful opening of Reign of Fire? Meaning, why not show a nice day, some blast and the next few days to months. Heck, 28 Days Later, was in fact, 28 days later. Planet of the Apes was long after monkeymen took over. The Book of Eli is 30 years following some unexplained aftermath. Mad Max didn't take place 5 minutes later and The Boy & his Dog had already known each other for awhile. Heck, even the so called "true" Judgment Day/Terminator movie: Terminator: Salvation took place years following the events of Judgment Day. What's wrong with these people? Isn't there anyone else out there, other than me, who would like to see a full-length pre-to-immediately post-apocalyptic film and not just in flashbacks? I'm sure if I do some research, I could find one. In the meantime, I have to settle for people moping around, searching for both shelter and food/water.True, I did feel one great thing following this movie: be thankful for what we have  in a flash, it could all be gone. This film didn't necessarily teach me that lesson, but it reminded me how we truly live in excess as something like this truly could happen.Until it does, I'm going to enjoy life and forget movies, such as The Road, that make the world gray. If you must watch this, take from it I did and move onto happier topics, don't take things, anything, for granted, and help others as the spirit of a child would. No need to dwell on what "could" happen, but what we can do now.
If Safety Not Guaranteed was made 5 years ago, no doubt the character played by the hilarious Aubrey Plaza, would've been played by Ellen Page and Mark Ruffalo would have replaced Jake Johnson as Jeff.Now, as mentioned, Plaza is very funny, but sadly, she, almost note-by-note, reprised her Parks and Recreation TV role. That said, if you liked her there, she'll continue to crack you up here. (Thankfully, both Mary Lynn Rajskub from TV's 24 and The League's Mark Duplass, did not follow suit by mimicking their TV characters. Not in the least.)Safety Not Guaranteed follows the typical set pattern for independent filmmaking, leading up to and including the ending. And even with that, this was highly enjoyable. It's funny, touching, inventive and keeps you guessing until the end.Magazine interns Darius and Arnau are forced into joining Jeff in investigating a possible wacko in the form of a "Time Traveler," Kenneth, outside of Seattle, WA. (Oh, and nice to see my favorite city again.)Kenneth's building what he thinks is a time machine and is seeking a friend for the journey. Darius "volunteers" and you know where this is going, but they keep a few little surprises along the way. Incidentally, the other characters grow in often hilarious and deep ways.The movie also has a great song, Big Machine, played surprisingly beautiful by Duplass and very decent cinematography. Despite the independent feel, these people knew what they were doing.It's also short, and it runs exactly how long it needed to run. The characters were developed, the humor and "lie-part" of the story was adequate and the heart was definitely present in more than a few shots.Highly recommended.
I have one word for 'Mirrors': yllis.From the annoying "hey, this movie's about mirrors, people!" opening credits to Kiefer Sutherland's revival of his "Jack Bauer" character from '24,' 'Mirrors' was about as bad as it could be in such a so-called suspenseful genre.Honestly, I can't even remember the explanation they gave to the spirits behind the numerous mirrors, but I remember getting the feeling we're watching another chapter in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street.' Here we have some supernatural being that kills at will that baffles anyone in the real world, frightens those who do believe and must be stopped by some reluctant nun. That and a million other clichés, including separated parents with the male (always the male-half) trying to clean up so he can see his children, a night-watchman in a creepy haunted house and a cast of characters who don't believe the potential psycho/demon until, well, the plot asks them to, ruined what could have been a better movie.Synopsis: Soon-to-be reinstated cop gets a job at a recently partially burned down NYC department store only to fall prey to something behind the mirrors. This entity apparently follows him and his loved ones anywhere/everywhere for some weird reason. Yes, I actually jumped 2 times in the movie  I admit I wanted to be scared, or at least, entertained. I let myself go, but couldn't help but laugh out loud at the "shocks" and "twists" towards the end that, I guess, was supposed to be the "mystery."Though Sutherland says "Damnit!" in the movie, he might as well has said, "Damnit, Chloe! We don't have time for this!" like his signature line in '24.' There was absolutely no change to his character from the show. Despite me loving '24' and his Bauer character, I would've appreciated to see some range, as he had in 'A Few Good Men' or 'A Time to Kill.' He has the talent; this was just him being lazy, as was the script. Skip. It was as predictable as an episode of 'Gilligan's Island.'
He's getting too old for this sh*t. Apparently.I am reminded of Lethal Weapon 4 (hell, Part 3 was the beginning of that series) during The Dark Knight Rises. True, people grow old and weary, but these are fictional characters and that's not what I wanted to see, for Gotham's sake. Likewise, I wouldn't welcome Sean Connery's return as Bond in today's world  I want to see my "super" hero be just that, not one hobble from retirement and doesn't "go back for that one final job" cliché.Allow me to explain. In The Dark Knight Rises, many years have passed from the previous installment  although you wouldn't know it with the many flashbacks, Bruce is sequestered and all-but in a wheel chair. Naturally, someone(s) sparks life back into the ancient Wayne and back-from-retirement comes Batman.Now, stating Batman returns (again) is not a spoiler  but this is: don't get used to seeing Batman for too long. He's in barely 10% of an almost 3-hour film. This very well-crafted film with very good cinematography and deep characters  both older, established ones and new ones, is an entertaining character-driven story, but light on both action and Batman.Personally, I like my Superhero/Comic Book movies with the actual Superhero at center stage. Obviously, that wasn't the goal, and so be it. It was entertaining for the other aspects.Bane (a barely understandable and muffled Tom Hardy) enters the realms of Gotham with a mission  and bang while burglar Selina Kyle (a delicious Anne Hathaway) steals various items for (no spoiler, but for very, very weak) reasons of her own. After countless conflicts with practically dozens of character pairs, Gotham is under siege and it's up to a broken man to "learn to pick himself up" again and save the day.(I really didn't want to give away the majority of the story or spoil any more  but in a nutshell, that's the gist.)While the movie isn't terrible, or bad by most reasons, it's filled with plot holes, pacing issues and a grand minimum of 40+ minutes could have been cut easily. That all said, it's worth a viewing and it was a nice conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy. Also, I loved Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anne Hathaway and their characters.Suggestions for the inevitable reboot: MORE BATMAN. Oh, and keep a great story with great performances, definitely, but fit MORE BATMAN in there, please. Please.
After being disappointed (originally) with Chris Tucker in The Fifth Element, as I was with that entire movie, I didn't want to see Rush Hour thinking it would be mainly a Chris Tucker vehicle, even though I was/am a huge Jackie Chan fan.Well, I rewatched The Fifth Element and actually liked it a whole lot more and was willing to give the 1998 opposite buddy cop movie a shot. With just the first viewing (of future many) I wasn't let down. For a single minute.I sincerely love this movie, and ranks as my second favorite buddy/cop movie behind Lethal Weapon 2. Only some slight flaws cause it to lose a full 5/5 stars, but then rarely is a movie perfect.Super Cop Lee (Chan) in Hong Kong is summoned to the USA after Consul Han's (Ma) daughter is kidnapped. Since the F.B.I. doesn't wish to use outsider Lee's help, they team him with "I don't want a partner" LAPD cop Carter (Tucker,) not that anyone would have such a loose cannon.Yes, I realize this is predictable and as unoriginal as it comes, however, if not for the fantastic quick wit of Tucker and the fantastic quick punch & creativity of Chan, none of this would work.At any rate, they team, Lee fights and Carter uses every available to investigate the daughter's disappearance while uncovering a conspiracy. All to an exciting finale using both Chan and Tucker's charm and talents.I'm not doing this movie much justice, but suffice to say, each and every time I've seen this, I have been rolling with laughter and excited with all of Chan's enormously original fight/flight sequences. This is a must-see for fans of comedy, heart, action, adventure and, of course, buddy/cop films. I could watch this movie a hundred times and still get the same effect. I probably have already.
1. I'd really rather watch a movie about Anastasia Beaverhausen. 2. The only difference between this movie and the vampire movie, Twilight, is the lack of fangs. Oh, wait. Neither had any fangs. 3. "Fvck the contract. You think it's a little redundant, don't you?" asks Christian. Yes. Yes. Yes. And YES.4. Oh, and the two-hour suspense of Miss Wishy Washy's "will she/won't she" sign the contract is as riveting as watching a bill get debated on C-SPAN.5. I've seen more nudity, sex and fake bondage on YouTube. With the safety function on.6. Considering Anastasia has the mind  and almost body  of a 5-year-old, the police should really look into Christian's porn stash. 7. "Listen to me: I don't do romance," says Christian perfectly as this is about as romantic as a hot tub filled with bleach. 8. Confusing an adult playroom with one that contains an "Xbox and stuff" makes me wonder if the target audience saw this as a double feature with The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge out of Water.9. People might have wondered where Arnold Schwarzenegger was had this kept its original title of Predator. 10. We saw Walter White teach more chemistry in all five seasons of Breaking Bad than the director did to these two "actors" in this one movie.11. A third grader could conduct a more stimulating interview, even without the use of the internet that seemed to be absent in the college student's research. 12. Laughably, homophobic actor, Jamie Dorman, gets asked by his costar, Dakota Johnson: "What are butt plugs?"13. There's more "grey" in this than The Grey. 14. Anastasia's constant excuse for lack of emailing is that her computer is downin one of the most technically advanced cities in the world. 15. "Seattle? That's where we're going?" is the perfect question to ask someone who you know lives there and is headed homeand you have the brain of algae.16. Too bad Kristen Stewart's clone experiment was a failure. But, on the bright side, if Dakota Johnson continues to "act," Kristen might very well be knocked off the top of the worst actress list. 17. It's an insult when you realize this doofus ditz is based on Bella from the Twilight series. And that's saying a lot when you know how awful Bella is.18. Actually, Bella still has the prize as worse on screen chick. Bella's smart enough to use and destroy her many men. Anastasia holds but a tenth of those smarts.19. Really, the safety word should be "R-Rating" as this was so incredibly safe, it should've been PG-13.20. Anastasia strings Christian for so much of the movie, I almost wanted to tie her up myself. With a noose. 21. At least they perfectly matched the soundtrack with the manipulative lead character.22. Unbelievably, this makes the similarly disastrous Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor look competent. Score one for Tyler Perry. Sadly.23. I always say, "To each their own, as long as it doesn't harm another." Way to go, America, for eating up this horrible crap with unredeemable characters that set women back 90 years.24. It's one thing to be introduced to a bumbling and tripping fool of a character, but for her to go around and around in circles and barely learn a single thing for two hours is just exhausting. But, in the movie's defense, it really does make you want her beaten up by the end. Preferably non-sexually.25. Spoiler Alert! The truly laugh-out-loud, writer-just-gave-up ending was Pretty Woman, but without a climax, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings, but without the yearning for chapter two and The Matrix Reloaded with knowledge of what's coming next. It seriously reminded me of Wile E. Coyote falling off a cliff and holding a sign that read "How about ending this cartoon before I hit?"
Life of Pi, it turns out, isn't about that tasty dessert or a boring series of numberseven though they do list them out in one fairly decent scene.Actually, this movie has multiples of great scenes. Namely the enormously gorgeous cinematography. Ang Lee is known for that, or at least, used to be in such excellent films: Brokeback Mountain, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Wedding Banquet and yeah, even Hulk  but that was the only real attribute to that film.The dialogue was great, the acting too. The originality was refreshing and I loved all performances. You would never know in an Ang Lee film (well, skipping Hulk) if actors are trained prior and are amateurs, or professionals. Not only does he have a great eye, he knows how to lead.Boy Pi recounts his life journeys to a novelist and it's an amazing adventure, mostly on a lifeboat following a ship wreck to a new land from India. On said boat, he shares the ride with a hungry tiger and incredibly survives (I did say he's telling his back story in present time, so no, that's not a spoiler.)That's the basic premise, even though there's a lot more to the story.To me, the real beauty was in the filmmaking, the breathtaking out-to-sea scenes and the actor's, Suraj Sharma (Pi,) excellent ability to carry the majority of the movie on rough seas. I'd probably die within days, or kill the so wonderfully named tiger: Richard Parker, for food. Sorry, (big) cat lovers out there.The movie did not have great marketing, and maybe that's because they didn't know how to show this adventure in a few quick minutes of screen time. Nevertheless, it's highly recommended, and if you get a chance to see it on the big screen, you better.Side Note: Richard Parker, the furious tiger, actually made me take a second look at the house cat at my residence. "Don't get any ideas, hungry one," I would say through my eyes the very next time I saw the house cat following watching this.
Truth is more entertaining than fiction. At least for Snow White and the Huntsman. The background story of slutty Stewart and the director was far more fun than the drab movie they made.Before the movie retelling of the old classic, I never thought I would compare this with The Matrixbut here it is: Both feature the luckiest and most awful actors in film history portraying "THE ONE" characters.My god, I thought Kristen Stewart was bad in the Twilight series here she shows as much life as some that just died, as much depth as a jellyfish's skin and as much charisma as a Republican in a Planned Parenthood clinic. As usual, she's moping around and, as usual, people swoon over her without the slightest evidence, outside of spoken words, on how or why she's worth it.Beyond her  and you'll see too much of her, the movie is as bland as her acting. Even the powerful Charlize Theron couldn't hold my interest for too long. And the action sequences, story lines and twists felt as old as the Snow White tale itself.Normally, I would explain the plot or give a summary, but I'm afraid I would begin to fall back asleep typing it out as I did watching it. I will give the movie kudos for decent, albeit not great, cinematography and the score was fairly good.But, neither of those was worth watching this. Watch Disney's first animated classic before even thinking about this. Even though that was 2-D, it held ten times the depth as Snow White and the Huntsman did.
I should really give 2009's 'Avatar' a chance. When I watched the recent trailers, the blue fish people look really fake in the trailer and it makes me either not want to see it or go for a good laugh. In 2002, I said the same thing about 'Spider-Man.' Spidey looked so fake in the trailer and the action/swinging was so slowed down, I almost didn't see it. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance opening weekend and waited a long time in line. Man, I was not disappointed. Somewhere in translation, they sped up the action sequences and you truly believed Spider-Man was swinging from building to building, fighting, etc. But, there was more to this movie, much more.Director Raimi and writer Koepp added so much depth to the characters, setting and took Stan Lee's age-old teenage comic book hero to new heights, literally. I've always loved the talent of Maguire (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) but you really felt every blow, physical or mental, he went through. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson) and Harris (Aunt May) were absolutely perfect from the comic books I grew up on. Oh, and I always love Bruce Campbell (aside from 'My Name is Bruce') so I am glad Raimi loves to continue to use him. Unfortunately, not everyone was pitch-perfect.Dunst (Mary Jane "MJ" Watson) was just "okay" though she did seem to act her heart out in each scene. (Strangely, I always envisioned her with rich red and curly hair  of which neither were true, though she did have just barely a red-tint.) And what was with the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn (Dafoe)? Sure, in the 'strip he's either literally green or in a costume  I can't remember him much, he was always my least favorite of Spidey's villains. I guess they needed to upgrade to make him more believable with a horrid mask (again, I'm guess, that's the best they could come up with) which didn't make much scene, since supposedly they made the suit/mask before Osborn went wacko, and it just happened to look sadistic? At any rate, they did a fantastic job, making you truly believe in Spider-Man/Parker and all of his troubles and triumphs while keeping to the core of the always-broke, always-bantered teen who's trying to do good and always vying for the girl (MJ.) Here we have the origin story of Spider-Man, but, like 'Superman: The Movie,' you won't see the super-hero in red/blue tights until about half-way through. You'll be fully introduced to this nerd, his girl-next-door crush, his living arrangement with Aunt/Uncle and the infamous bite that spawned the teen web-slinger.Meanwhile, in the movie's weakest story, Pete's best friend's Dad experiments on himself with some green smoke that, well, uh, makes him stronger and angry. Not Hulk angry  though he's got the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde thing going on, but just upset at those that are against the green smoke in the first place and eventually, of course, Spider-Man. This is one of the same problems I had with 'Daredevil's completely underdeveloped super-villain "Bullseye." You're simply asked to believe these two bad-guys have some kind of super-power and that they want to rid the city of the hero because, well, it said so in the comic books.The only other flaw I could tell (and Raimi never seemed to correct this in the following two sequels) was the length. All three movies (so far) are way too long with scenes that could've obviously been trimmed. Granted, this one is the best paced one, but standing alone, it still could've been cut easily down 20-25 minutes.Nevertheless, the movie, as a whole, is highly recommended. The fantastic score (one of Elfman's best,) graphics, dialogue, comedy, romance & longing and the setup were all great. It was a perfect introduction to the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. It can easily be viewed by all audiences, and they did a great job of making it almost virtually timeless so it can be enjoyed by generations to follow.So, thanks Spidey, you not only saved the city and the girl (oops, spoiler), but you might've persuaded me to buy a ticket to help probably the most expensive movie ever, 'Avatar,' make back at least one ticket's worth.
Does this series get better and better as everyone proclaims? Well, yes and, sadly no.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban sure as hell started that way  good, that is. The film actually, for once, felt like a real film, meaning well made. Though the previous two entries were not an amateur's projects, this one showed real signs a higher talent took the wand and ran with it. The cinematography was my first indication  it was crisp, expansive and absolutely gorgeous. It almost made me wonder if Hogwart's Castle had "magically" relocated in the year since the previous entry.That was the first sign that I noticed we were heading in the right direction. The second was a visually older Harry, inside and out. He's running thin on wonder and amazement and he's finally showing signs of frustration. Good. Let it out, Harry. But don't go all Anakin on usThirdly, with the locations, most names of creatures, teachers and bleachers (in the backdrop of the never-ending Quidditch matches) and the themes, score or otherwise, established, finally the storytelling can settle in and have fununtil roughly the last third of the movie. I wouldn't necessarily say that's "where it all fell apart" but it was a rather tame and lame finale(s). Sure, I guess, Harry can't always thwart a giant snake (#2) or play a game of chess (#1) as the final battle, but this one  no spoilers  was so ho-hum and was completed with one of the most ridiculous final second shot of a movie that I've seen in a long time. I was half tempted to literally erase half a star from my rating for that final moment before the credits rolled. But, as much as it didn't fit and as much as I hated it, I'll just mark it as a "WTF" moment in Harry History. (Like when Harry stole a sucker. I didn't know he was a thief. ??)Leading up to that disappointing third act, there were sure signs of the book here. Now, I haven't, nor plan to, read past book one, but the utter randomness of multiple scenes and characters indicated to me they were just trying to appease the book fans. Although, I'm sure there are a great majority sooo sad that everysingleplottwistanddialogue wasn't involved in every movie. GET OVER IT. I was ecstatic that this was the shortest one, albeit still too long at 2 hours 21 minutes and I DO NOT care to see a 6-hour miniseries of each book (or 42 hours) to ensure every single line was shown on screen.I digressOnce again, Harry's being abused by his adopted family and takes the long journey back to school after summer break. Upon arrival, once again, he's warned not to be there and once again he ignores such "rubbish"  I'm guessing he's thinking. And finally, once again, Harry & Pals must combat a mystery/terror that threatens to shut down the most unsafe harbor of mutants since Professor Xavier's school, long before J.K. Rowling thought of Hogwarts.Sure, I made that last paragraph out to sound like a complaint, but I confess: it doesn't really bother me. I understand this is the common theme, at least from the first three chapters. What I like is, aside from the obligatory (too long) 25+ minute running time of getting him to Hogwarts, is that once there, the mystery starts sooner and sooner with each film. I'm an impatient guy and can only take so many shots of the kids learning proving to me that A: there's teachers, B: there's classes and C: there's students. Yeah, I get it: it's a school, but can we get back to what Harry needs to solve?Oh, and I also understand we need comic relief, but I've never been a fan of the Three Stooges. The appropriately named Ron Weasley is definitely one of the three stooges and is completely useless. It's painfully obvious that Harry won't be dating miss know-it-all, Hermione, but it's still best they drop him like a bad spell.I know, I know, all of this sounds like criticisms. Allow me to backtrack  for the first two-thirds, I did enjoy this feature and I liked the addition of David Thewlis and I always like both Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Albus Dumbledore  although, Richard Harris was much better in the first two.As much as I wanted to proclaim this series has "increasingly gotten better" when it was about an hour over, it was that dreaded middle-of-the-road final act that lowered my score to make it actually slightly dip in quality from Harry Potter #2. I said slightly as I still awarded both 3/5 stars.Here's to Gobleting some Fire for the next movie(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)
Bad work day means good comedy night. (Jackass Presents:) Bad Grandpa didn't disappoint.Of course, it also didn't astonish either. While I did laugh and laugh  I probably wanted to much more than I would have any other night of the week, I kept thinking "Oh, it's gonna go there! No, wait, they missed that obvious comedic angle, they're gonna do this!" but they never did.This movie was funny, and not just for the Jackass crowds. It even had some heart to it. But, sadly, it didn't press the button, at least not hard enough, for it to be the extreme R the preceding films did or the fans look forward to.Mrs. Grandpa dies and this old man's dancing like the other old man from the old Six Flags advertisements did. But, unfortunately for him, his cockblocking grandchild needs to be escorted cross-country to the kid's deadbeat dad.Naturally, this just sets up skit after skit while using countless bystanders to crack up, help or video-phone the antics of said Bad Grandpa and his obnoxious, yet lovable grandchild, Billy.Again and yeah, it was funny and worth the time  if you're in the mood for this, that is and can leave your brain at the door. Unfortunately for Johnny "Bad Grandpa" Knoxville, Sacha Baron "Borat" Cohen already did this, and with much more hilarity and originality.* * * Final thoughts: How any of these "bystanders" didn't catch on instantly, even without knowing the "bad grandpa" character from the movies/TV series, is beyond me, but it's fun to imagine this is all real. I do that a lot these days. I love to hear those "phone taps/prank calls" on the morning radio programs even those my friends say "they're fake." As long as I can believe it's real, it's fun. So Borat or Bad Grandpa, it's all for fun.
How Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time didn't end up as direct-to-DVD cartoon is beyond me.It was, in fact, an all-but cartoon, with thousands, make that MILLIONS of CGI clips; it's almost like watching a cartoon. Now, that's so the (probably near-bankrupt) Disney can make a buck on something they probably weren't too sure of. Uh, like Mars Needs Moms? Too soon?Now, it's not all bad. It's entertaining if you leave your brain on a magic carpet by the door, and know the source material. Only, I played thee original Prince of Persia  as early as 1989 and not the ho-hum remake of every other desert adventure that's out there. I've seen the previews  of the updated game that is  and a lot of shots of this movie version does look a lot like it. So, kudos to them for keeping with the (times and) video game.But, it's also not all that good. What starts off with enormous plot elements thrown at us as well as what seems like 50 different locales that you're supposed to "get" up front, ends up with the age-old story, in an age-old Iran  formally Persia.Oh, and before I go furthercan someone please remove the "SIR" before Ben Kingsley's name? Seriously, the ratio of bad movies to good outweighs the number of good Friday the 13th movies.So Persia wants to rule the world and an "Aladdin"-type Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the adopted son of the King and has two brothers and an Uncle (unsir Ben Kingsley.) Side note: I would like to call this Uncle after another "Uncle" from another Disney classicbut that would be too much of a spoiler. Though, if you don't see that coming, you have never, ever seen a movie before, let alone played a video game beyond the Super Nintendo. (Heck, let's say the Sega Genesis.)Anyways, King Daddy dies and Dastan is destined to be accused. Meanwhile, he's in possession of a switchblade (of sorts) thatwait for itcontrols the sands of time. Well, for a minute at least. Meanwhile, Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) wants the cutting-through-time knife back. And it does, in fact, go back and forth between the two leads so many times, you'd think this was Groundhog Day.Oh, and the evil one(s) also want the sharpy thing. (See how I'm not taking this seriously?) And neither should the audience. The movie's just an excuse to throw cheesy (and obvious) CGI-controlled scenes at you in both rabid and slooo-mo (Also see: The Matrixwait, aren't we 12 years past yet another Matrix-rip-off?)I'll repeat (one part, at least): It's not all that bad. It's entertaining enough just as mindless action, but with zero depth, originality or creativity. You can just watch it because there hasn't been an Indiana Jones, Mummy or Lara Croft reboot in the works recently. Speaking of which, Prince of Persia doesn't even come close to those movies (okay, maybe Lara Croft: The Cradle of Life and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  it's certainly on par with those.) Heck, even the mostly-bland National Treasure movies are better.And that's all too bad. You can tell Jake put his heart into this; I'm sure he worked out at the gym for more hours than he put in for Brokeback Mountain. But, sadly, he also put his time into a tired script with a truly foreseen finale that takes way too long to get to and yet another movie Kingsley phoned his performance in. Skip!
Taking a satire and turning it into a real movie takes an incredible amount of talent, all-around. Sure, everyone, including me, loves Simon Pegg and his (best) boyfriend, Nick Frost, and they get huge credit, on screen, in turning Dawn of the Dead's spoof Shaun of the Dead into a raging success, even by today's standards. But, it was mainly the writing by both Pegg and (also, Director) Edgar Wright.I used to be a huge spoof fan, until 2000's Scary Movie, one of my all-time favorite comedies, put an end to actual funny spoofs. Four years later, unbeknownst by me, came Shaun of the Dead, another great parody. I didn't know about it because it fell far under my radar and I probably didn't see this the first time until 5-6 years later. Just recently, (8/31/13) I watched it for the second time.I am fully aware this lands on a ton of people's top list, and I truly liked it, myself, but I wouldn't go as far to land it in my top whatever list. Okay, maybe spoofs, since there's so few really good ones, but that's about it.My only real problem is the movie runs out of breath in the last act. Gore replaced comedy in the last third and yeah, it's to remind us this is *also* a zombie movie. But, to me, it felt more like they ran out of jokes and lost focus on what the first two-thirds were all about.That said, the first two acts were fantastic. Absolutely hilarious and ingenious use of both comedy and the zombie genre, all with deadpan deliveries. Basically, Shaun (Pegg) lives the same droll life and this is affecting his relationship with his girlfriend, but not so much his (best) boyfriend, Ed (Frost.) Unfortunately, for the threesome  eh, maybe also the world, a zombie outbreak occurs and, not coincidentally, mirrors Shaun's existence.There were many opportunities to exploit the potential humor in a zombie outbreak film, and I doubt writers Pegg and Wright missed a single one. Leading up to our heroes finding out what's going on, and a little beyond the acknowledgment, it was one hilarious scene following the next. Mercifully, they chose the (much preferred by me) slow-moving zombies in order to give the cast a lot more time to give us more entertainment.If you haven't yet seen this, and are a fan of zombie films, or even dislike them and would like to see them ridiculed, this is your movie. It is also the teaming of Pegg and Frost's absolute best film, even though they would make a couple more enjoyable flicks.Gotta love lines like: "We're coming to get you, Barbara!"  Ed.
Dang, you were so close, Kim Jong-un. You failed at stopping probably the only comedy I've ever seen that could make The Love Guru incredibly funny.The Interview should never have been conducted. Not with this talent. Awful were the "jokes," predictable were the set-ups and uninterested was the cast. Seth, James and everyone involved should've known better. Should've known most screenplays need more than one rewrite.A lot of comedy premises take after ones before them; that's a given. The trick is to improve on them or at minimally least, add your own spin. None of that was present here. Heck, even the enormously lazy set-up (an old friend pushes our "hero" into serious news when all he's accustomed to is interviewing real-life guests and basically showing Shia LaBeouf'isms, but without any humor) takes all-but 10 seconds of screen time that sets him and his non-gay soul mate to interview the supreme leader of North Korea. Yada, yada, these bumbling idiots  but not the funny, on-screen kinds we're used to, especially from Franco and Rogen  get "trained" by the CIA to assassinate said leader.I cannot count how many scenes that were humorless, but suffice to say, it's from minute one to the over-long conclusion at just under two hours. But, unbelievably worse than that, not one actor in this movie looked happy to be there. They were merely here to cash a paycheck one that might not have come to pass due to all the real-life threats.Speaking of those threats and hacks and controversyseriously, attacking this terrible movie only drew the worst kind of attention back to the attackers: proving the movie right. I really wouldn't want to be on this movie's side, even for a split second, but attempting to block this movie and trying to prove to the world you're the opposite of how they portrayed you in this very movie, is so very funny.Maybe the only thing funny at all about this bomb.* * *Final thoughts: Oh, and even if the movie was near-masterpiece level, threatening human lives over one person's art and fiction telling, is what makes me ashamed of the human race. I am very troubled that, even with the multitudes of progress our kind has made since I was born, I strongly doubt I will live to see the day that we become even a tenth of our potential. The Star Trek universe of humans actually working together for a common goal, for the common good, is fictional, but oh so desired.
I used to love the follow-up 'Toy Story 2' more than its predecessor. After a good 3-D viewing in 2009, I flip-flopped them. Yes, I think #2 was awesome, near perfect, and just as much fun and inventive as the first one, but I think it was slightly off. Just barely. I think it's Cusack's 'Jessie' that I found almost unbearable to watch. Sure, I get her character and where it's coming from, but God, she was annoying and hard to get past. On the positive, she gave the only notable song, and a good one too, in the series so far: "When She Loved Me" by Sarah McLachlan. Other than that, they certainly up'd the ante for the technology (even with only a few years in between), the action/adventure, comedy but all the while kept the great "family/friends" feel and morals. To switch things up, Woody now has been "toy-napped" and it's up to Buzz and peers (still great, never missing a beat from what made them all masterful in #1) to rescue him. I loved the additions to the "story" such as the Barbie's, Knight's Chicken/thief, the new Buzz (love the explanation given to what stores did wrong the previous Christmas) and Buzz's nemesis. This was a fun movie to start with and as it progressed, it got a lot better. A lot more fun, adventure, touching and inventive. Rarely will a sequel live up to its original, and 'Toy Story 2' is one of the best ever. It's very apparent that the crew, directors, cast, animators all had enormous fun putting this out, adding all of their own little homages (also seen in #1.) Side note: the 3-D was good, but Disney can never blow me away as other studios have: SEE: 'Monsters Vs. Aliens.'
Just watched Lara Croft: Tomb Raider on BluRay...easily the best of all video game-turned-movie films.(Uh, but stay far and clear of the horrible follow-up.) Sure, it's silly, toned down and incredibly basic...and still a lot of fun. And NO ONE could have pulled off Lara like Angelina.Pre-Bond Daniel Craig was interesting, and you can see why he was picked years later. And it was an interesting pick for father/daughter, but then, that really didn't work  them working together.While it's a good Indiana Jones lite, it's mindless, leave-your-brain-at-the-door fun... 4/5 stars.
Had I had any points with people in my inner movie-loving circle, I'd lose the rest of their respect when I say: I didn't hate Crossroads.Sure, it was a chore to get through, had its ups/downs, clichés galore and enough melodrama to make the Lifetime channel sue for copyright infringement. But, it's a harmless movie with not-horrible acting stints from our main leads in the road-trip "comedy." Oh, sorry, I mean "drama." No? Okay, "Suspense." Or is it: "Coming of Age?"Whatever genre it is, or pretends it is, it's a nice reminder of the timeframe it was shot. Meaning, I loved the songs of the late 90s into the early 2000s and this has plenty of them. So, when I found my mind wandering off from the "action" on the screen, I was brought back to my kind of music.Basically, we have three BFF girls who bury some kind of lame time capsule barely six inches into the ground (but, protected by a plastic bag, damnit!) only for them to open it on their High School graduation night.Well, these friends drifted apart to become caricatures of said Lifetime Movie females and reluctantly, they do dig up the box. Suddenly and coincidentally, they all have missions to complete across the country and a could-be killer agrees to drive them to their individual destinies.Wow. The more I type this synopsis out, the less I think it's a good movie, but I do remember (again) not hating it. Surprisingly, Before-Crazy Britney didn't perform that bad, the Star Trek chick was interesting to see while "on leave," and the pregnant one  who was she?  was okay. The maybe killer male of the foursome cross-countriers was more creepy than sinister, and he did what he could in this.Not a life-changing movie, nor even great for young teen girls to get a lesson out of. AndIt's Not a Great Movie, Not Yet a Rifftrax Target.* * * Final thoughts: My excuse is the How Did This Get Made? podcast which (really didn't make me, but I'll say they did) made me watch this. If you must watch this, make sure you listen to their take following. You will not feel your time was wasted then.
I was teeter-totting back and forth between 3½ and 4 stars through this recent viewing of 1996's The Rock, a movie: A> I haven't seen in a long time, B> Always loved and in fact, C> I originally gave it 4½/5 stars.Well, time's a changin'. Or maybe I have. Or maybe Bruckheimer/Cage's enormously inferior follow-up Con Air kinda drove the following point to light.It would be a huge surprise (disappointment) if this film got an endorsement from the large gay community in the very area its set in. And they thought Basic Instinct was bad.I only point out the few, but extreme, scenes of homophobia because, well, it's just not right. (They elaborate in ridiculing homosexuals in Con Air, but that's another story/review.) It's not right, because it teaches the core audience, teen boys to mid 30s, that making fun of gays (or blacks, or any creed) is not only an acceptable practice, but funny! It's not and I digress The other problem I had was Cage. Over! Under! Acting seems to be his moto. Too bad "Good" isn't part of his forte. Man, he was distracting! Thankfully, not only did Connery act circles around him, but went beyond Cage's performance to balance out the film.Get past the two negatives, and Action and Movie fans rejoice! There is, in fact, a way to combine plot with leave-your-brain-at-the-door action. But, I hate to say, they might have overshot it a bit. There was just too much.Suffice to say, it's a Hannibal Lecter (Actually, Mason, played by Connery) story in which Goodspeed (unoriginal and inconvincibly played by Cage) takes on the aid of "The Prisoner with No Name" to break into "The Rock" when he was the only one to break out due to some treasonous/mercenaries who are threatening San Francisco with toxic green balls. And not from The Hulk.Oh, there's a lot more: a distraught daughter, a confused and stupid and pregnant girlfriend, a dead wife, dimwitted military bozos who should be dead or discharged, soldiers on this side, that side, all with ulterior motives and much, much more. Sure, it's my quest to get intelligent action (SEE: The Bourne Trilogy, or The Dark Knight) but enough's enough.That said, it's a fun movie. Connery makes it really worth wild even though he doesn't show up until the movie got going. But, unfortunately for him, the director, writer or idiot, kept him running around in circles, literally, in the final act. I don't blame Connery for that; I think he was just given poor direction. Sure, his character was supposed to be the iffy hero, but they had him trotting around like a buffoon until he did what we all knew he would.Spoiler alert, the ending? Could it be any more Shawshank? If you can get past the homophobia (please do,) the enormously bad acting from Cage and oh, lest I forget, the far-too-many (director Bay's favorite) slo-mo scenes, the extensive action alongside Connery was good enough for a recommendation. It's always refreshing to re-visit pre-CGI movies. Don't call me old-fashioned. I like movies that took more time out of the computer room and into realism. With heart. Sorry, Avatar fans, we're still not there yet, so make action look real.
WOW. Those previews of this movie, The Wolf of Wall Street, couldn't be any more accurate. Basically, it told me all I needed to know: everything.Upon watching this undeserved Best Picture Nominated movie, I couldn't believe my eyes. There wasn't an unpredictable part of this movie, as predicted by the movie's trailer. I take that back. I did not predict that this THREE HOUR MOVIE would have a good hour of cut'able footage.I could've easily sliced out an hour of unneeded and obvious footage in the movie and even though the remaining two hours still wouldn't be fresh by any means, at least the audience didn't have to waste three hours on the same ole story  they just had to waste two.Let's see: Young hotshot wants to make it big for him and his wife. He's still wet behind the ears, but dives right into the greed of Wall Street and makes his own mark after a speed bump derails him temporarily. He's  get this!  consumed by the money, power, girls, drugs and luxury. Oh, no! What will ever become of him?Supposedly, though probably, true, this rise and fall story is so blatantly obvious from the get-go, you'll wonder why you need to see another 2 hours, 59 minutes of the story you already know how will unravel from minute one.Granted, the performances are decent  no, it wasn't Leo's best, and the film was professionally made, I just could never get past the A-B-C story of the Rise-and-Fall of the greedy. Nothing new was brought to the table with the exception of a few jokes and scenes so extended that they should've been in the extended cut BluRay and not in the original cut.While absolutely not a waste of time or film  it does boast the most F-bombs that you're sure to become immune to  it's so old, you'd think you're watching a "true story" of the old west.* * * Final thoughts: How this got an R-Rating for this extreme amount of nakedness, sexuality, language, violencemakes me wonder who owns the MPAA. Especially when But I'm a Cheerleader almost got an NC-17 rating because it involved lesbians but not 1/1000th of the debauchery here.
They must've known there would be another two dozen Bond movies because by Part IV, or Thunderball, they're taking their sweet time.While better than the first two, Dr. No and From Russia with Love, but nowhere near the exciting adventure of Goldfinger, this chapter was simply, just there. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Although it's the longest of the so-far Bond features, the script felt like just one chapter of a novel and it would be one you'd want to get through quickly.Thunderball, or the codename operation to reclaim two nukes, has the least complex plot to date (of 1965) and yet it's stretched out amongst too many minutes and females. The eeevil SPECTRE's back with the cat-petting, no face #1, and quite straightforwardly, they want more money. For today's standards, the enormously easy theft of two nukes would be a joke, but I'm guessing back in the mid-1960s, kids still hid under tables to avoid the aftershock of a nuclear blast.Enter in what has to be the most inept spy since Inspector Clouseau  I mean, what spy drops his gun and alerts the baddies of his whereaboutsreally?  Bond, kinda, sorta figures out what's going on with the nukes. But, this was just to lead us to an overlong underwater fight segment where Bond uses a 4-minute air supply Q-gadget for roughly 15-minutes.This really is a throw-away chapter and, again, not terrible  I didn't find myself bored as in Bond's first two "adventures," but I didn't relish in any great scene and only laughed at one of his lines (after the dance) and one of his scenes: think shoes and a bathtub. That, I admit, was good.Too bad the rest of the film didn't equate that amount of fun. Well, here's to You Only Live Twice(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the "odd one out": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)
So, for those who do not know what The Tree of Life is all about, allow me to (roundabout) quote the prophet, Elvira, el Mistress de Darko: "Yeah, I'll tell you what it's aboutit's about two hours too long!"Actually, I'm not going to be pompous and pretend I know the meaning of this movie. Nor am I going to ask anyone to explain it. It wouldn't make a difference. Even if someone granted me the grand ole secret of the movie that meshes a fast-forwarded version of the creation of time with a dysfunctional family and its future grown up son, I would certainly NOT waste another almost 2½ hours of my precious time on this boring piece of work to rewatch it.No one can argue that this film wasn't beautifully shot, nor could they dispute the score was anything less than gorgeous. But that's it. Really, there's nothing more that I haven't already explained: We see a somewhat version of the Earth forming and then miraculously there's jellyfish, and before you know it, there's plants, dinosaurs and the infamous asteroid coming to take 'em all to oblivion.All the while, excitedly!, we have 1950's (I'm assuming it's the mid-20th Century) home life filled with endless, countless scenes of close-ups of young boys. That's not my bag, but if it's yoursget help. Oh, and there's Sean Penn  again, I only have assumptions here  as one of the boys grown up?You see, in the 139 minutes, you'll have about six lines of dialogue. SIX. Oh, and a bunch of whispering. Mostly the word: "Brother." So, we don't have much to go on for story.Okay, the six lines was a bit of an exaggeration, but don't hope for a complete story here through spoken word. And because of all this built up, wordless tension throughout the entire endurance of the running time, it's makes for one of those movie-experiences that you honestly expect tragedy to strike, someone to get dismembered or worse every three-to-four minutes, and that's taxing for more than two hours of sitting. Waiting. Endlessly praying for someone to actually die so something would happen.Look. Listen. I'm sure this is one of those movies that you'll either hate or love. Either appreciate or fall asleep to. Or either leave confused or understand the meaning of the tree's life. I've already admitted I didn't comprehend the message here. But, I also said it wouldn't matter. I'm not getting my 2 hours 19 minutes back, so, even if I was told, it's not a washit's a waste.
The Satellite of Love crew would've had a field day. Manos: The Hands of Fate's opening scene stretched amongst about 60 min of film. Wait, there's more! Within the first 2/3s of the film we have the hero do amazing things! He buys gasoline & Chinese food! He drinks coffee! He buys a Coke! He takes a shower! He kisses a complete stranger in a park! But wait! There's more! Most importantly, he drives! And drives and drives. And thendrives some more. Watching someone drive such a distance is like watching someone read for an hour. I have read reviews where people complain nothing happens. I laugh at the movies they pick for these comments? They need to go back to edit their reviews on those movies. This could've been rated G until the finale, a completely unnecessary sexual scene (or two). We get the point; we get to the surprise twist. I watched to the end, every minute of his journey from the East to the West; his loneliness. Yes, I liked the ending, the reason for all the madness but for shock value alone was the graphic closing scenes. I gave it 1.5/5, an additional .5 for the meaning at the end. I'll be kind & save you some time? He is lonely and depressed, he drives and if you can skip to the final 2-3 scenes, you'll understand why & save yourself 1.25 hours of watching one drive to get to the point. I have two side notes: #1 I am a true believer in extras on a DVD, the delete scenes, the making-of, etc, and thank GOD, this had no delete scenes? Boy, anyone could do without extra **exciting** hours of driving from Albuquerque 2 Vegas. And #2, though I love Las Vegas scenes in movies  I'm a gambler, sue me- he would've taken a long detour to go from where he was headed to Sin City. Don't screenplay writers ever research their material, their physical journeys before putting pen to paper? This is a story of one man, his journey and a director's vision of hard porn for about 3 min. Buckle up, it's gonna take you 90 min to get what you rented the film for.
Some people say The Tall Man ripped off another movie by substituting Slender with Tall. I was more concerned with them stealing from the Phantasm series.Either way, it's an awful experience of a movie to get through. So if you're planning on boycotting it for copyright infringement or for any other reason, go for it. Or even make up a reason to chose another feature.I really don't want to claim as much ignorance on this movie as I probably should, but damn this movie went all over the place. By the time it finished, I kinda got who was who and why, but I really didn't care that much because the movie was beyond a Twilight Show episode. The odds are surely against any of this ever happening, but in the extreme off chance 1% of it did, the reactions and actions of the townsfolk probably would be more human. I would think.A town died when the mining left and it is claimed that the town went completely broke. Yet, people still remain, wandering about and spend their time wondering where all the children went. You see, supposedly, there's this "Tall Man" who's snatching all the kids and the cops/FBI sort of care. Really they don't, it appears, because not only had nothing been done to either find the missing children or heavens, corpses, but nothing is being put in place to prevent further kidnappings.This movie literally could've been a realistic Freddy Kruger kid snatching tale and the aftermath of a small town, but instead it ended as further from realism as Freddy ever dreamt.Oh, by the way, there's more. Our "heroin," the ugly  at least in this film  Jessica Biel, plays Julia who shacks up with her friend/sister/lesbian lover/whatever to care for Julia's child. Naturally, there's an attempted kidnapping and Julia's a suspect. Not really sure if any of the other mothers or fathers were suspect to the lazy investigators, but anyways, she's on their radar.A few other stuff happens that makes almost zero sense and even if someone were to explain it to me, chances are, I will never want to revisit this small movie again only to slap my forehead and say "Oh, I get it, now!" The movie does have fantastic cinematography, but call me biased because I love Washington State and refuse to acknowledge the Twilight series as actual movies.This is available now on Video on Demand and will be in theatres at the end of the month. Pleaseplease, make this movie go away like the children and make the USA care as little about it as this town did about the disappearances.
I don't remember the first time I saw Big, but I remember watching it many times and, of course, relating, since I was the same age as the boys in the film. So much so, the Billy character, played by Jared Rushton, was born just 12 days before me.So, naturally, this is many boys' fantasies come true, as was mine back then. But, beyond that, it was a special, heartfelt, deep and often hilarious film. That all said, it should come with a warning:STAY AWAY FROM THE EXTENDED CUT.It's been many years, decades even, since I last watched this. Recently, I purchased it on BluRay and incorrectly, I chose the Extended Cut when prompted after the disc was inserted. Even though it had been many eons since I saw it last, I instantly caught EVERY SINGLE UNNECESSARY SCENE of the 26 additional minutes. Not only was it wise to withdrawal these from the theatrical cut, but they sincerely took away this experience of revisiting one of my childhood favorites. Hopefully, I will rewatch this again sooner than I did last time, but I sure as hell will cut out the Extended Cut.Whew, getting that out of the wayTom Hanks hasn't always been one of my favorites. Granted, back in the late 80s to mid-90s, he was on fire and I was right there with him. So, since we're focusing in on Big, he was fantastic. I could see the boy/man in him the whole way, even though we only briefly saw the boy he grew from in the first act.I'm getting ahead of myself. After a string of "you're just a kid" moments of embarrassment, normal 13-year-old, Josh, wishes he was "big" in front of a fortune telling carnival machine. Mercifully, the machine he uses to make that wish knew what he meant by "big": to be an adult. Overnight, he does, in fact, become an adult and all Hades breaks lose.Nicely, writers Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg explored all angles I could think of on what would happen if suddenly a 13-year-old boy becomes a 30-year-old male. The confusion and mindset of said boy is shown perfectly in (adult Josh's) Tom Hanks.Luckily for Josh, he has his BFF, 13-year-old Billy, to aid him in the transition to adulthood, even though neither knew what they're doing.Obviously, the results of Josh making it as an adult with virtually no money, life experience and in New York City, is highly unrealistic, but then so is the initial premise. So, it's safe to get past it, and enjoy his often hilarious fly-by-the-seat-of-their-pants journey to get Josh into a VP  VICE PRESIDENT??  job at a toy company. There, he meets some great supporting casts and grows up too quickly.Like I said, he does grow up rapidly, but the transition is believable and helped with the great direction, screenplay, co-stars and Tom Hanks' abilities.This movie is often forgotten and totally 80s, but if you saw and loved it as a kid, you'll appreciate even the more adult humor that most  I didn't  catch when I was a youngling. Also in our time of raunchy, juvenile comedies, it was a refreshing PG-rated fantasy/comedy/romance.Absolutely recommended. Go Big!
Ah, the last great Schwarzenegger flick. Almost definitively, from here on out.He had plenty of features after Eraser (and before his governorship,) but none that reminded us why Schwarzenegger was a justified big-budgeted action star. And though predictable, silly at moments and mimicked Schwarzenegger's Terminator in more than one way, Eraser is still thoroughly enjoyable. As was Vanessa Williams. She stole every scene she was in, and it would be nice to see more singers-turned-actor take a performance like this.Schwarzenegger stars as John Kruger whose job is to, well, "erase" the lives of people set up for witness protection by faking their deaths and setting up anonymous new identities. Sure his methods might be severe, unorthodox, unethical and obviously confidential, he's the best and gets the job done. The movie's main target is Lee Cullen (Williams) after she's approached to rat out an illegal weapons manufacture. But, wait! Inside the branch Kruger works, there's a mole! If you can't tell who the mole is in first few shots, don't worry; they'll tell you soon enough. Kruger spends the rest of the movie on the lam with Cullen as he's being, get this! Set up! And he attempts to clear his name and save the dame at the same time.Sure the movie's as predictable as most Schwarzenegger movies are, but due to a lot of great action sequences, Williams' performance and a real ode to The Terminator (Terminator 3, a few years down he road, doesn't count as it sucked bad) this movie is highly recommended for die-hard Schwarzenegger fans.Suffice to say, it's hard to go further into this without giving away so-called "surprises." Skip everything since this 1996 gem and enjoy the real Schwarzenegger.
Here's how interested I am in this movie: I watched ParaNorman on January 26, 2013 and I'm just now (February 8th) getting around to write the review.That's not to say I didn't like it  I did grant it 3/5 stars, but it was, by far, not in my top favorite animation movies from the past couple of years.Perhaps, it's because of the story that's really not that original. Or that the characters were pretty much not fun and for the most part: annoying. Heck, even the dialogue was just okay and the animation was just the same as many other cartoons as of late.That all said, it's worth a watch for younger kids. It's a harmless and entertaining small tale of overcoming bullying and doing the right thing, despite the odds.Norman, who can see ghosts of all sorts, finds his calling and his mission is to stop a curse on his town and is joined by those who doubted him.Really, that's the entire synopsis. Sure, there's just a few additional and incidental story lines and characters, but that was the gist of it. There's no need to completely discourage you from seeing this if I mention the shallow, clichéd and hard-to-watch-at-times secondary characters  they may appeal to those who don't care about unique sidekicks.Probably the highlight (and to avoid a spoiler, I'll leave out the name of the character) is that in a kid's cartoon, there's a gay character. I thoroughly admire them stepping out of normal animation bounds by adding someone real: a homosexual. I mean, how many animated Disney films have been made and, though it would fit sometimes, they never pulled the trigger and went against the grain to include a gay person?At any rate, I would mildly recommend this, while leaving your brain at the door. It's not for both kids and adults, it's strictly just for kids.
Though this as my only third Spike Lee Joint I've seen, behind Malcolm X and Inside Man, I can tell the obvious Lee Twists of film-making  that is with the camera angles, tricks. I did have a problem with that aspect of the film. Once I saw them coming  they're not hard to predict where he'll insert them  I knew I had to just bare through them to see what was otherwise a great film. I loved the direct-9/11 approach, the sharp dialogue, the performances and the tension between the rich characters, actors  always a huge fan of Phillip Seymour Hoffman  and although I am also a fan of Edward Norton, I really don't think this was his best work. In fact, he never showed his anguish to me, at least; he just consistently told us. Any great performance relies more on showing over telling. (Not to compare Norton to Keanu Reeves, but that's the best example of what not to do: Tell VS Show. Reeves continues to tell us his character on screen  FBI agent, Vampire hunter, The One, etc  but never do we feel his character.) Despite Norton's acting, you do get an excellent feeling of what it would be like for any one of us that was scheduled to go away to prison in 24 hours for seven years for drug trafficking. And there was a lot of tension in the film, never really letting us know what is going to happen, so there was a lot of great story telling in the film. I admit it was hard to put myself in Norton's shoes on what would I do or choose one of the three options he faced: suicide, flee or take the punishment. One of the twists in the movie has to do with who ratted out Norton to put him where he will be in the 25th hour. If it were me, and I had to face seven years for what I've done (and the violence of prison to come), I guess I would have to accept it and eventually thank the person who sent me away. But, then again, I haven't walked in his shoes. Uh, nor have I sold drugs.
Granted, I am not drawn to musicals, but when I am, it's because they have great songs and a fantastic score. Story is good, as is acting and sets, etc, but it's wonderful lyrics and music to move the action along. Into the Woods simply does not work because, frankly, the songs suck.And this is sad, because the movie's somewhat original direction from multiples of fairy tales and meshing them into a sometimes interesting yarn. That said, every time I wanted to like the movie, it broke out in a terrible musical number that reminded me of the awful (also, Disney) Frozen soundtrack. Okay, the saving grace is, once again, Meryl Streep, but even she isn't masterful. She just does what's needed to be done in her role. And with her caliber, it's fun to watch herand nothing else on screen.The 52 story lines of the film revolve around Mr. and Mrs. Baker and their quest to rid an old curse by means of a scavenger hunt. Along the way, they sorta learn things, fight and inadvertently cause the needless last half of the feature. I exaggerate, but, yeah, there are far too many things happening here to be invested in even a handful of them. I'd almost like the movie had they cut back, to say one main plot surrounded by two side plots. Even with the horrible and completely forgettable songs, I might have invested my interest in any of the characters. Hell, even the bright spot, the witch, played by Streep, was so incidental, I couldn't care less what happened to her.It's too much, too long and far too late to the game, as this Shrek theme of taking old fairy tales and interconnecting them into main theatres is tired now. Maybe they thought the musical aspect would save it. No, it didn't. In fact, after seconds of liking parts, I was back to hating it once they began singing.There is nothing here to recommend and it's an absolute skip. Maybe with a few more re-writes, it might have been decent, but we'll never know. This reminded me of the horrible 2012's Les Misérables with its equally dreadful songs and 24 story lines too many. Skip it!* * *Final thoughts: I lied above. I said the only saving grace was Streep. Actually, I am a dog and loved looking at main character/star, James Corden. He is gorgeous and kept my interest up because of his looks and decent acting. That said, I don't grant movies higher stars due to good looking actors. It's just a nice perk when you're trying to fight your way through a two-hour snoozefest. And believe me, this was incredibly difficult to get to the end without shouting at the screen for it all to be over.
With another interesting concept for an "infected person" movie (over the typical "zombie" film) they certainly stuck with the usual platform for a sequel: 2x the gore, 2x the madness. '28 Weeks Later' takes an already wonderful movie and actually continues with originality: what happens next? How does society survive an outbreak? Well, if we were a smart race, we could certainly overcome this "rage" virus that spread roughly 7 months prior. And after a very scary introduction to those unfamiliar with the original '28 Days Later,' the movie continues with a "good solution" to rebuild humanity. Of course, the movie then dives into stupid people doing stupid stuff and the virus, supposedly eliminated by the infected starving to death (loved that over just having to shoot zombies in the head), actually resurfaces. This causes man to do even more stupid stuff to stop it once again. Watching it on a grand scale/Bird's Eye POV, it's hard to even imagine trying to contain such a brutal fast-spreading virus, especially with hordes of victims at its disposal. Though I really liked this movie, at times, it was hard to watch, due to the excessive gore (I take back what I previous said about it being 2x gorier  this was probably 10x more gorier than the now subdued '28 Days Later') and the one thing that irked me in the last third. Not to spoil it, but a certain "infected" person always seems to pop up always at the most opportune times, just when the script needs this person to, always finding the victims he/she wants when they are supposedly just running on instinct. Despite the gore (#1 didn't need that for a good story) and the Super-Infected-Phantom, it's a very good follow-up and I look forward to any more to follow.
A friend recommended The Monster Squad to me and I have one thing to say to him: Where werewolf you 26 years ago?!MeaningI grew up on these very monster characters when I was a wee-youngling. Heck, I even adored, to this day, the Monster Cereals, such as Count Chocula, Franenberry and Booberry. The tad-bit history on that: I've always loved and have been infatuated with horror since I can remember. But, since I was forbidden to watch Rated-R fare, and since 99.997% of real horror was R or worse, I had to latch onto Movie Horror Greats of decades before me. I.E. Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and especially the Wolf-Man.This movie was beyond-below my radar growing up and even into my "adulthood" (yeah, even at my old age, I'm still wondering when I will feel like an adult.) Sure, I've heard of it, but since I missed it as a kid and heard so little buzz, I never thought of seeing it.Until that friend recommended it to me.I'm very sad I did NOT see this as kid. It would've satisfied ALL of my needs: adventure, horror, all the monsters I loved and all in one place and best yet: these kids were my age when this movie was released. How could I not relate and absolutely fall into the film and create my fantasies of how I would react? I did that with Escape to Witch Mountain and Back to the Future; I would've certainly seen this dozens of times knowing myself.I digress. I cannot change the past and despite my 5/10 star rating, I really didn't have a problem seeing this as an adult. It's enormously eighties and gory-yet-mild enough to really get a PG rating vs. its PG-13 rating. It's fun for what it is, despite all its obvious flaws.Without giving away too many spoilers for the other loved-horror-as-a-kid-now-adults who haven't seen this either, the number one flaw was the fact a "virgin" is needed to read some scribe so the kids scramble to find the closest female virgin to read the words that might banish the villains when, all the whilenever thinking to pick one of the boys in the title's "Monster Squad" of kids. They're all obviously virgins, especially the fat one.(Before I get hate (e)mail, I would ever have referred to him as "fat" if the script didn't call him as that multiples of times.)Uh, I'm getting ahead of myself. The movie's about the legend band of cinematic monsters, mostly portrayed in the 1930s/1940s classic Universal films, who are real and face a (mostly boys) club of horror-movie monster fans. Inevitably, they find the way to destroyallmonsterswhen no one takes them seriously.The special effects are surprisingly good for the type of film it is, the acting isn't too bad, some of the comedy is actually pretty amusing and the adventure for the young at heart is intact. Deep? Not really. The Goonies kind of take on horror? Yeah. But, if you're a boy at heartuh, I mean, I'm referring to those like me: maleyou might find this (mostly) family-fun and scary adventure a joy to watch.Thank you, you-know-who-you-are, friend. I will most certainly watch this again, and you know what? I doubt that 5/10 star rating will remain that low.
And FINALLY, he got it (mostly) right.Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith was the closest film in the mostly disappointing prequels to the original and great trilogy. It also held one of my all-time favorite openings to a movie, in this series or stand-alone films.The film starts with a bang: a 20-minute, non-stop space battle filled with excellent special effects, sound, humor, adventure and suspense. Mercifully, the movie that follows is still pretty darn good. Not perfectyet (stay tuned for IV and V)but the best you're gonna get from the modern (at the time) Star Wars films.This is also the only prequel movie I wouldn't mind seeing a few times; I made a silent vow to never watch I or II again. It's fun, funny, action-packed, has the best FX of the prequels and best of all: it FINALLY connects stories from the original trilogy and this back-story.Now, that said, not perfectly. Maybe the best they could do. Case in point, watch the first four, or I, II, III and IV, in order and they do NOT mesh completely. It's good enough if you suspend your disbelief and call the characters that appeared in both the new trilogy and the old one senile and they can't remember much.I digress. Basically we're to understand that the bulk of the "clone wars" took place between Episode II and the start of this chapter and it's now winding down. So much so, in fact, that the (sort of) "good guys" have just two last people to hunt down and either kill or bring to justice and the whole thing is decided. And they do just that.But, they also need to get little Annie into the black suit, the (always terribly written, acted and spoken) love story wrapped up and a half dozen other lose ends to finally put this puzzle in line with Episode IV.I think they did the best they could. Sure, it could've flowed a little better from this chapter to the next one that came out nearly 40 years ago, but from what they were working with, I.E. Georgie Lucas, it was as close as you'll probably get.Unlike the previous films, this one I do recommend. Of course, for first time viewers, I guess I would recommend all (currently) six movies, but if you have already partaken in I and II from years past, this is the best one to get any Star Wars marathon started.* * * Final thoughts: Keep in mind, there's still some bad dialogue and acting: "Hold melike you did by the lake on Naboo!" to the "NOOOO!" from Frankenstein's Monster at the end, this movie wants to be great, but has two hands from Georgie to tear it down a few notches. Get past these and a few more "memorable" lines/scenes and you should enjoy yourself.
Yes, it's enormously sad and heart-wrenching to see how the animals are treated while alive and how they simply end up on the dollar menu in the fast-food industry. I don't think that's too much of a secret. Though that was a good portion of 'Food, Inc.', I think the main focus was the evil behind the evil. They went after the "how could you sleep at all" people that head up the select few companies that send people to their death as they make a profit. I love how none of the big wigs commented for this documentary. I guess they could've justified it by saying they don't need to defend themselves. I just see them as cowards for not even trying to tell their side. Unfortunately, that was one downfall of this documentary  it was extremely one-sided. Sure, it's no "Michael Moore," but not too far off. You see the side of the mother of the child, Kevin, who died due to the corporation's tactics to make money. You see the sides of the chicken farmers with heart who make pennies comparatively speaking. You see the "illegals" arrested to save face. But none of the positives  if there are any. I don't know if there is any good that comes out of what these corporations are doing. I wasn't told any. I was actually told this film was unbiased, but it isn't. It's just another slice of evil-humanity. And I agree. People that void thoughts of humans over profits are utterly inhumane. Yes, I liked this documentary, and it gave me a lot to think about and how to vote  Dollars over Congress. But, what it should've asked from us: do your own research and "Don't take our word for it. Learn and make things better."
The nicest thing I can say about the Cars 2 is that it's not the worst movie of 2011it's only the biggest disappointment.Pixar is usually untouchable and makes near to perfect masterpieces. While the original Cars was rather weak, at least that had heart.This genre-changed lemon actually dropped further and it only helps if you like Red-Necked humor (I don't) and enjoy "The Doofus Spy Who Knew Too Little" variety.Much like The Cleveland Show, they spun off the wrong character. While, it's technically not a spin off, the focus was on the wrong character for a sequel. That's like making Superman II all about Jimmy. Really?For ages 2 and under. 1½/5 Stars.
1. Billionaires know how to cut costs to maintain their fortress. Beginning with security.2. Multi-ton safes are no match for one-inch metal-link chains. 3. Why waste your money on a dryer you need, when you can rely on a "Master Dick" to swing clothes around until partially dry like a pro. 4. Where Las Vegas uses this same tactic to attract visitors, Batman is literally trying to scare people off with his Batmobile's armor ofneon. 5. Being trained to fight off dozens of hoodlums doesn't come from The Ninja Academyit begins over a net. With your parents. In the circus. 6. At the rate Bruce is progressively losing brain cells in the original Batman films, it's a wonder they didn't explore his alcoholism over his dead parents. 7. A 25-year-old actor may be able to get away playing a teen, but not one that already looks over 30. 8. "Genius" Edward Nygma spends more than half the movie just deciding on the costume that rests two feet from him. 9. Recently, one of DC Comic's Green Lantern characters was deemed gay. But, Jim Carrey's own green DC Comic book character, The Riddler, actually came out 17 years prior. 10. Amazingly, Director Joel Schumacher didn't just play homage to the campy 1960's TV series; it made Adam West's Batman look deathly serious. 11. Myth: many believe George Clooney killed the bat in Batman & Robin. Fact: Val Kilmer had already put him on life support. 12. Asking your lover an important question and interrupting his answer with a kiss might, in fact, give you that answer. 13. Running out of alley space to escape those expendable villains? There's always the wall to drive up on, regardless of the lack of an exit plan.14. Backwards thinking: This one should've been called Batman & Robin.15. In the case of first two movies, or the two that follow, you will learn once again how Bruce became Batman with a flashback down that alley. Thank you; I have such a bad memory. 16. The Bat Signal is a perfect "beeper" for Commissioners, half-burned ex-D.A.'s dressed as the homeless or Australian lingerie models. 17. Actually, anyone can call upon Batman, even if you just wanted to "get drive thru" with him.18. While it was impressive that the Riddler invented the very first 3-D TV, the only programs to watch were cartoon-rejects andfishing.19. Two-Face had no idea how lucky he was that Bruce Wayne was in the same audience of fifty when he threatened to bomb the place in order for a spectator to reveal Batman's identity. 20. Even when the movie borderlined a serious topic, it quickly reverted back to the target audience of toddlers. Whew. 21. Alfred's good for two things: making lunch and consistently allowing strangers into the Batcave. 22. Oh, and snarling isn't going to stop a "teenager" from stealing the Batmobile, even if they wrote in the real Batman character in this picture and he thought of, God, any antitheft measures. 23. Further, while cruising Gotham, the Batmobile's hydraulics must come in handy for someone who shouldn't know how to drive the vehicle but can impress older women with the leaps. 24. The budget could've been cut in half if they simply made this live-action cartoon moviea cartoon in the first place. 25. Much like the Spielberg-less Jurassic Park III made us rethink our opinion of The Lost World, Batman Forever caused us to cherish Tim Burton's visions all the more. 26. Tommy Lee Jones channels Jack Nicholson's Joker fairly close as Two-Face, but that's not a positive. Who knew, in the future, Heath Ledger would be the one to reinvent Joker perfectly and Aaron Eckhart would shame Jones as Harvey Dent. 27. Catwoman can kick Chase's ass any day. 28. A decent score, workable cinematography and fantastic soundtrack does not equate a great movie. Otherwise, the middle Twilight films would be top notch. 29. In the future past 1995, Val Kilmer would get fat, Jim Carrey would hit and miss, Chris O'Donnell would, would, waitwho?, Tommy Lee Jones would thrive in black, Nicole Kidman would pass Tom Cruise's baton to future Dark Knight alumni Katie Holmes  who would eventually do the same and sadly, Michael Gough would just pass. But, above all others, thank God, Drew Barrymore would recover.
It's amazing that, after eight years and the only other time I've seen Collateral, the main attention was on Jamie Foxx. And people didn't even know Tom Cruise was crazy back then!I take that back  I never bought the Tom Cruise crazy talk crazy talk. I couldn't care less what happens in his personal life. Sure I see a snippet of "what goes on in his personal life," much like Mel Gibson's, but who knows the real story, but for those around him and himself. Nevertheless, the guy continues to amaze and entertain me.Here, he gave once of his best performances and quickest wit and the focus was on Foxx and while he was decent, nearly great, that is, he was overshadowed big time by both Cruise and the fantastically written character, Vincent, Cruise plays.Remembering back in 2004 when I first saw this, I really liked it, and sadly gave it very little thought until a 2012 Black Friday special presented me with the BluRay for only $5. Since I liked it a lot back then, why not? Five bucks and BluRay  my favorite combo.Well, I liked it tremendously more this time than last. I will admit, the ending, or climax, kinda weakened the project, but the overwhelming positives, shots, music, score, acting and dialogue made up for the last 10 minutes or so. And furthermore, the film's premise could've died out in a few moments of screen time, and yet, it continuously reinvented itself to freshness with each transition. I loved this movie.Big time dreamer and taxi driver Max is coerced into aiding Vincent's, a hit man, night of kills.Really, that's the premise, and as thin as it is, the movie is still wildly original and is pleasantly, methodically and completely slow, and yet, suspenseful from the get-go. And this is coming from someone that both steers away from slow fare and Michael Mann directed films.Mann's sooo slow for the most part. Here, is no exception. But, with the powerful performances, excellent interactions, smart lines and ongoing build-up, I would watch this over and over.Oh, and I loved Vincent's character, even as brutal as he is, as violent as he is and as unremorseful as he is. Cruise's portrayal was a breath of fresh air eight years ago and holds up today.Highly recommended.
Well, the Cube seemed to realign itself and made up for part 2 with the cleverly titled Cube Zero. And thankfully, to date (2010), they ended it here, as they should, unlike the never-ending Saw franchise it mirrors. Perhaps the Saw creators should've taken note.Cube Zero's a prequel with almost all questions answered that no one I know, including myself, asked. So if you wanted to know all the going's on during part 1 and more about the staff behind the imprisoned victims, watch this. Actually, you can safely skip Cube 2 and just watch Cube 1 first, followed by Cube Zero. Normally, I would recommend the prequel first to go in chronological order, but this reveals just about way too much and will ruin the first movie's great premise and suspense.Again, like Saw (and Cube 1 and 2), more people are trapped in an endless supply of cubed/metallic rooms, but unlike it's predecessors, the movie shifts to focus on two order-following, game playing nitwits, one of which questions authority when he, Wynn (Bennett), falls for one of the victims he watches on the monitor. The only real tension here is the other male paper pusher attempts to remind him the penalty of insubordination and anyone's whose seen the original 2 will know why, hence the "tension." But that can only carry the film so long. Thankfully they shift gears to plug the lovelorn Wynn into the cubes to rescue the princess  actually make that anti-princess as, any rational human, she's pretty stressed, paranoid and lashes out against anyone, including Wynn, who might have caused her predicament in the cubes.Wynn jumped in definitively not feet first into the cubes, all but relying only on his knowledge of escape, but would still need help from the outside. Unfortunately for all involved, an eeeevvvvilll and relatively annoying bigwig takes over the office where Wynn used to work  yeah, I think this act of heroism he portrayed would not only fire him, butwell, if you made it this far, you know the consequences.Anyways, as always, it's a race against time for our hero and anti-princess to escape. There are a few flaws toward the end and they attempt to tie up all three movies (or at least part Zero and the first one) somewhat cleverly.As this is a prequel, it's humorous to see the lack of technology and the obvious first mishaps these evil cube-creators had to endure to get it right. But for all the androids, machine eyes and brain microchips there were an equal share of filing cabinets and newspapers. I kinda liked that aspect and I'm guessing it was done intentionally.While the acting was mediocre and the dialogue somewhat hideous, I would still recommend as a companion to part 1. But, again, only for those interested in the who, what, where, why, when and how's of part one. (To me, the first one was best simply because they didn't give you this information, but still there are those who would want to dive deeper.)
Stupid. There's a word I rarely use to describe a movie in a review, but I can't help it. This movie is stupid. Bad, boring and weak also describe it best. The best things going for it are the swear words from Rose Nylund, Oliver Platt was sometimes funny and unbelievably, the croc didn't look half-bad. And all those accounted for a half star increase...because everything else was just trash. Not even B-movie fun. Bridget Fonda was annoying as all Hades, Bill Pullman hated to be here and it showed and the "awww fvck it, we ran out of money for a real climax" ending was laughably incoherent and incomplete. I love When Animals Attack films, so skip this and watch or re-watch the top notch B-movie of that genre: PIRANHA 3D. Cheers!
If not for the very, very end of Killer Joe, I would totally be on board for this feature.Seldom do I reveal too many spoilers in my reviews, and I will refrain this time from stating the far-out-of-left-field actions of said Joe, but needless to say: it's finger-licking weird.Leading up to that ending that kinda diminishes the whole independent feature, is plenty of nudity  the female species that is. This will both satisfy the straight male porn-addicts and the pedophiles. In more than one scene, a very young character, Dottie, is shown full-frontal nude.Even though I'm not attracted to the opposite sex or younglings, that last part, the preteen nudity, worried me some until I looked up the actress playing Dottie; Juno Temple's real life age. She's a 23-year-old playing a 12-year-old.Surprisingly, she pulls it off, but it's still creepy for un-sick people.Nevertheless, the movie mirrors other amateur bad guy plots like A Simple Plan: Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) concocts a scheme with his single-digit-IQ father (Thomas Haden Church) to murder his mother/dad's ex-wife to pay off gambling debts. Only, their deathly serious hit man, "Killer Joe" (Matthew McConaughey) isn't buying their pay-in-advance-of-insurance-moneys ploy. Luckily, for the father and son team, Joe wants a little taste of the underage sister of Chris, the dimwitted Dottie.We have a very bad family wanting to do very bad things with a very bad man. So, maybe this is more suited with the already used title: Very Bad Things.The movie was surprisingly directed by the very man who helmed The Exorcist and was not so shockingly based on a play by the same guy who made the almost as weird Bug. That odd mash-up should spell doom and it did in the finale. Obviously, they were trying for either the "WTF" climax or "WTH" happened, leaving it all open for discussion. Either way, it had such direction, such focus and it needed a climatic brutality to finish it all off, but, sadly, it seemed to run out of ideas and added an unwanted shock factor ending.That was a no-go. The movie had potential and a great two-thirds that I will stand behind. Enough to promote a 3/5 star rating. It's the last third that removed a potential fourth star.And if you've seen this and wondering what I'm mainly talking about without spoiling too much: Think KFC.
I think Lex Luthor said it best: "Some people can read War and Peace and come away thinking it's a simple adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the universe." I'm part of the first example there, while most find 2001: A Space Odyssey a masterpiece in filmmaking. And no doubt whatsoever: the cinematography, score and way-ahead-of-its-time space adventure is perfect. I will stand behind that statement throughout this review. But, sadly, those are the only positives I could come up with for this incredibly long and simple film.Before I continue, I must warn: this contains spoilers. I say this, because, as of tonight, April 24, 2013, I had never viewed 2001: A Space Odyssey before and I attempted to avoid as many spoilers as possible. So, if you haven't yet experienced this, watch at your own risk and then continue.Previously, I proclaimed that "I attempted to avoid as many spoilers as possible." Sadly, with a movie that has been talked about, researched and inspired countless of ideas/movies over the decades, it's hard to not view some of the key scenes, listen to the wall-played classical-music score or learn of the film's characters (HAL 9000, anyone?) Well, nothing I've seen, heard or learned prepared me for the absoluteslowestmovieIhaveEVER SEEN.The movie begins in darkness, for a few minutes. Sure, I heard music, but nothing on the screen. Quite literally, I thought my BluRay disc was damaged.(Oh, sorry. Backing up a bit: Since I've never seen this before and it's deemed a "classic," why not watch it for the first time on the excellent BluRay format? That, however, wasn't my first intention, actually. I wanted to purchase The Shining on BluRay, but after pricing the disc, I found, for just a few dollars more, there was a triple feature of The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. I've already seen numbers one and three, but heck, why not experience my initial reaction to 2001: A Space Odyssey on BluRay? Purchase: made.)Just when I was about to give up, the infamous primate scene emerged. Well, okay, not quite yet. Enter in many landscaping scenes and then about 20 minutes of zero dialogue and primates eating, drinking and eventually enamored by a good sized monolith, or black rectangular prism. Many years later, Wall-E would attempt the same feat with its opening act without a shred of dialogue. Pixar was much more successful in keeping my interest.I digress. Fast-forwarding to (oh, what year was this based in, again?) the "far-distant future" while retaining the styles and dialogue of the 1960s, doctors embark on a mission of wonder of said monolith (now, ??) on the moon. Without explaining too much and opening up way too many doors, we will fast-forward again, but now, on a mission of wonder to Juniper. Only this time, we, well, 1960s American Audiences, get their first taste of later-down-the-road Android Ash from Alien. Apparently, after a communication breakdown  literally, HAL/ASH must complete the mission even when the humans are wiser to him.This should make me laugh, but like the opening 2-3 minutes of nothing, the movie chose to keep in the merciful INTERMISSION the audience was blessed with back in 1968. And I almost did laugh, thinking this snail-moving movie needed one. But, after a few minutes, I was tempted to fast-forward myselfsomething I never do while watching movies for the first time. Finally, what followed turned out to the most acid-tripped and psychedelic third act I've ever seen.Now, I didn't necessarily rate down the movie for the, what we call today: a cheap screensaver, because these are aliens and in their minds back then, anything's possible. But, what followed proves to me: Director Kubrick was on drugs. He had to have been. Truly.If you do travel down this hallucinatory journey, you'll see what I saw, or what I couldn't believe any more if Godzilla miraculously had showed up and explained, in English, verses his native Japanese tongue, what the last third of this movie meant.I fully understand where this movie was coming from and the year it was released, but what I couldn't get past were some basic and major flaws:A> Computer program HAL 9000 controlled the entire ship, and even the vessel to kill one of the men who wanted to shut him downbut couldn't control the second shuttle when another man wanted to rescue the obviously dead astronaut? Or, further, he failed to control the temperature, pressure or live-support when said "hero" returns to the ship and goes to deactivate the deadly computer program?B> People of Earth, or higher-ups, that is, wanted to make first contact with the alien race that "faced" Jupiter's planet from Earth's moon. So, they programmed HAL 9000 to make sure the ship got there. The first sign of trouble was a transmission breakdown and HAL 9000 thought best to let it fail with "hopes" of fixing it later. If the higher-ups wanted to both explore the alien race and document it, wouldn't it be a top priority be to keep the communication up and running?C> Since I've never been to space, nor plan to, it's hard to prove this is a flaw: when one character decides to venture into the vacuum of space without adequate protection, albeit briefly, he's perfectly fine. Even though, I GUESS this could work, it was hard to get past and take the rest of the movie seriously.The movie's based on a short story, and it shows. It's an extremely thin plot stretched to the max. While I appreciate the scope of this project, especially the timeframe of release, I do not believe it holds up today. I'm glad it inspired numerous other projects, because it takes one good idea to make the future better.
Back when I was a little tyke, I was never allowed to see Gremlins because the little critters were deemed "satanic" and it wasn't until I was in my 20s, or a decade or more past the movie's release, I finally saw it the first time.This re-viewing is only my second time and I have to say, I wasn't/am not the biggest fan, but I sure did like and admire the attention to detail, creativity, humor and the fact it's an roundabout remake (or, homage?) to one of my favorite monster movies, The Blob.The odd thing about this flick was that it started off as a comedy with tons of sight gags, cute and imaginative scenes and nods to multiple of movies, including producer Steven Spielberg's own movies. Butthen it turned dark, disturbing, actually gruesome and I'm shocked it only got slapped with a PG-Rating. Granted, in 1984, the PG-13 was just coming about, and though Rated-R would've been harsh and a box-office kill, PG was really generous.A little Mogwai creature is brought home by a comically horrible inventor father and given to his way-older-looking-than-he-was son (the actor was 20, but looked 30,) but with three simple rules: it cannot touch water, it doesn't like bright lights or the deathly sunlight and don't feed it after midnight. Naturally, the (supposedly) teen son breaks all of these rules and after the water multiples the Mogwai, or the better and cuter name for him: Gizmo and they're all fed after midnight, with the exception of Gizmo, they metamorphose into what my mother referred to as little Satan demons, and attack the town. It's up to man-boy, his equally older-looking teen girlfriend and Gizmo to stop the madness.Oh, those rules. While simple and a fun addition to this well-written script, the restrictions/instructions made no sense, with the exception of the bright light. Water is everywhere and in almost every  if not every, food and liquid. So what would you ever feed it? If they elaborated, like: Don't get water on or in it, but you can feed him dehydrated foods And about this midnight ruleWhich midnight? (They actually bring this flaw up in the sequel, but for this movie's sake...) Is this a curse and is only good for the time zone the Mogwai's in? And it's never, ever, brought up "UNTIL WHEN." Again, elaborate: Don't feed it after midnight, to say, six in the morning.I might be looking in too deep in a movie that was supposed to be half light/half horror, all entertainment, but I seriously couldn't get past those open-ended and vague rules.Okay, fine, I could get past them  eventually, and I did have a good time in this totally 80s movie. Overall, it's not a bad flick, and the invention of both Gizmo and the eventual Satan's little evil fiends, was worth the watch. Especially, cute little Gizmo. Recommended if you haven't seen it, or if you want to experience 80s nostalgia. (That is, if you were alive thenOh, I'll shut up now.)* * * Final thoughts: Many years following, and equally since, my only other viewing of this movie, I was with someone in a dark room and he flicked on the lights. Since my eyes needed and didn't get split second adjustment, without thought and only on instinct, I shouted out, but with a tiny voice: "Bright lights! Bright lights!" He couldn't stop laughing and though he remembered it, I couldn't even recall where I got that line. Now, I appreciate it more after seeing it a second time.
I am NOT one who will walk out of the theatre and proclaim this sequel is the best one of the series simply because it's the freshest in my mind. Despite on how long it's been, I always remember how I rank franchise entries and I always remember "The Classics"  generally, but not always, the first chapter.That said, I did that with 'Underworld: Awakening.' (8/10 Stars) I walked out at the end and exclaimed: This was the best of the series.Sure, it helps that I'm not a fan of the Underworld films and that I pretty much only love both the character of Selene and the acting of Kate Beckinsale in the role. But, beyond that, this movie brought to the table a few things that made it better than the previous installments, such as no more "ancients" story lines, more action and no more Viktor! In addition, the action was intense, the vengeance in Selene was real, raw and fun to watch and had one of the best climatic final battles in my recent memory. (Even the great 'Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol' reached its peak in the center of that film.)Did I mention, along with some pretty good lines ("I'm counting on it") and a very nice take on Selene's machine gun escape route, it's a swift and needed 88 minutes? After the film's original way-too-long 121 minutes, the series has progressively gotten shorter. I will NOT complain about this; the story and sometimes unintentionally humorous werewolf CGI cannot sustain more than a buck and a half of screen time.Now the movie's not perfect, mind you. Story, eh. Predictable, yep. And the 3-D was anything but worth it. In fact, this would be high on the list of 3-D-haters who complain it's only added to make a tad bit more in revenues.On the same note, however, the IMAX was welcomed. Its sound was deafening  in a good way, and the grand scale was nice. I don't think you can have one without the other, so we should (ah-hem) suck it up and pay the extra just to see the fighting vampires on IMAX.Selene returns (Thank you, Kate!) and with a cold-hearted (or is that broken?) vengeance. After the world's now aware of vamps and werewolves and we promptly swept the cities to get rid of them, Selene's captured and frozen only to be awakened 12 years later. Still cold blooded  ha  she's p*ssed and NO ONE will stand in her way. In fact, she's SuperSelene, a big improvement on the already ass-kicking character.I don't want to give away any of the film's "secrets"  though most will see them coming anyways, but suffice to say, she's on a mission and it's almost non-stop action until the fantastic 3-4-way fight out in the conclusion.Okay, I'll give one awayconsider it a present to open on Christmas Eve: The actual ending, i.e. the last 30 seconds might as well had the world famous "To Be Continued" stream across the screen like from the 'Back to the Future' final shot. Me: REALLY? (For horror fans, this was also so incredibly integrated with the 'Halloween' franchise. Repeatedly to the point of why even bother when no sequel's guaranteed.)Eh, get past that and see the movie. Even if you're not an 'Underworld' fan.
Lucky Number Slevin was one of the only movies I've ever pressed stop when the movie's end-credits rolled and started over from the beginning and watched the entire feature in its entirety all over again. I was that impressed when I first watched it.Fast-forward four years andwell, not so much. Yeah, I still liked it (hence the 8/10 stars; I think my original opinion was 5/5.) It was still clever, had good acting, but it didn't have that sting that caused my original double-watching. I don't know what did it for me this timemaybe it was trying too hard to be smarter than it was, or that Ben Kingsley has lost a lot of respect from me over the years  A Sound of Thunder, anyone? And even though I hadn't seen Thunderbirds  I really can't bring myself to do so.Sure, Benny, sorry, SIR Benny, has been in a handful of excellent to good movies  Schindler's List, Shutter Island, to name a pair  but here, he just plain sucked. Lucy Lui  I always like her ("Hubba, Hubba, Hubba"  Payback) but here, she seemed to just play the part. Willis and Tucci  ditto.The only duo that stood out was Freeman and (oddly) Hartnett. I say oddly, because, after his premier in the way above average Halloween: H20, he's been as reliable as Keanu Reeves in film; you always know he is going to be terrible.The real winner here was the script. It's witty, fast paced, fun, original and a lot of the times, you will, in fact, do what I did: rewind and play again to see what you might have missed. I didn't see this in theatres, but I did for Fight Club, and I might have done just that for that movie.Aside from the movie's intro that jumps all over the place  though it's a great scene with Mr. Goodkat (Willis) in a wheelchair  we begin with Slevin (Hartnett, and incidentally I LOVE that name: Slevin) who's sporting a broken nose, a missing friend who he was supposed to stay with while visiting in NYC and a nosey neighbor, Lindsey (Liu) who does see more than he wanted her too.Not too long after Slevin's arrival, he's kidnapped via being mistaken for the friend he was supposed to meet. In nothing but a towel, he's taken downtown to meet a crime-lord, "The Boss" (Freeman,) who explains he owes him money, but a hit on his nemesis, "The Rabbi"'s (Kingsley) son will do just fine.No matter how much Slevin tries to talk his way out, truthfully explaining he is not his friend  mistaken identity, etc  he gets further thrust into the battle between the two mobsters and the police all the while judging Lindsey and her "investigation" of trying to help this complete stranger to her.It's a very well made movie with great dialogue, twists/turns and successfully takes itself from the realm of dark-comedy and quick wits to a more serious movie of revenge and retaliation. Despite my opening remarks, I highly recommend this little seen movie  especially if you like superhuman characters (Slevin) as much as I do. In fact, I think his only Kryptonite, though it was integral to the story, was the wildcard Lindsey. SEE IT!
I'm one of the few people that enjoyed both Open Water 1 and 2. And you kind of have to like those movies, or at least part 1, to like Frozen.Two best buds, Joe (Ashmore) and Dan (Zegers) along with third-wheel, Parker (Bell)  Dan's girlfriend, swindle their way to the top of the snow covered mountain in an attempt to save money. They do this by bribing the "guard" Jason (Ackerman) with $100. ?? Okay, so I don't know how much it costs, but is it really a lot more than $100 between three skiers to take the lift up the mountain?At any rate, they get up there, argue, become friends again and we learn that Joe's horny and is enormously jealous of his BFF's newest partner. Of course, this is all both incidental and just the basic set up to what's to come.They want to get down the mountain on the last run on Sunday since the ski-lift's closed until the following weekend. Well, this leads to that and that leads to a "leak" and the threesome gets stuck over a rather large drop.At first it's funny, though a bit scary, but when the lights go out and the blizzard begins, it becomes rather desperate for our stranded "guests." Multiple options they come up with to get down the, probably, 4-5 story drop. You'd have to ask yourself: What would you do when it becomes increasingly fruitless that no one knows they're up there and it's not expected to move for another week?Oh, and throw in: no cell. No food or water. A razor sharp cable above that's not easy to get to. A drop surely to either kill or maim you. No one can hear you. A forest below with wolves. A mile or more from civilization. A week to wait. And well below freezing temps.Though this could happen, the set up seemed pretty silly and ill-constructed, though a bit plausible. The main movie starts when they feel they're doomed.I won't give away the depths these characters go through or the events they must endure, but I will say, despite the weak set up and almost terrible and unbelievable acting, the suspense was ENORMOUSLY high. There were times I had to look away, or fret about upcoming scenes I saw in the trailer  think A Christmas Story.So, Writer/Director Adam Green, who also did the similarly enjoyable Hatchet, did an extremely effective job of keeping me both on the edge of my seat and grossed out. I hope to see more from (and of; sorry, he's cute) him despite his movies making pennies.If you like to be frightened and love those "If I were in their shoes, skis, fins, what would I do" (Open Water) films, this is the movie for you. Let it simmer for a bit because when the terror sets in, it almost doesn't let up. It also helps the backdrop of the mountain's gorgeous. At least enjoy that while waiting for their fates.
(May contain slight spoilers.)Kevin's been a bad boy. From day one. And when momma's got to drown out her son's incessantly crying with a construction site's jackhammer, she's going down in the blame category.We Need to Talk About Kevin explores the true blame of disobedient children: parenting. I've been saying it for years, but mostly about homophobia. Kids learn hate and it stems from parenting who have held on and now teach it to their offspring. Here, the anti-gay issue is irrelevant and what's left is much more disturbing.To watch this unique movie as just a regular movie-watcher, you might be lost. It has more timeline jumps than all of the Back to the Future movies combined. It was the writer's (Lynne Ramsay and Rory Kinnear) way of telling the dark tale of the birth of Kevin to his bad teen years, back to his toddler "phase," the movie's present, to right before the present and all the while, they show the absent, albeit present, parents. In other words, the movie is literally all over the place.So much so, it's tough until the finale to grasp which timeline is present day, although they do make it clear where we're at when you look at the age of Kevin.My point, get past that. By the end of the film, there is a very clear message that you should let sink in. For my journey, I not only had to let 24 hours pass before I wrote this and I spoke with a parent/friend of mine whose seen this and his thoughts. He was able to open my mind and I've thought more highly of this project than my initial opinions.The basic synopsis: It's blatant from the get-go that Kevin's not a well-balanced individual, and what absolutely doesn't help is the fact that the mother (the fantastic Tilda Swinton) clearly doesn't want to be a parent, nor likes the child much. When the inevitable, albeit VERY EARLY, rebellion appears, she either ignores it, gets frustrated with it (and you'll definitely see that) or makes half-ass attempts to "talk about Kevin" with the figuratively blind father.Needless to write, and all attempts to avoid spoilers are on my mind, things go south. All around.Perhaps in an age of anti-bullying rallies, movies about bullying and even a President putting his two-cents in about bullying, this is a perfect movie to watch to explain the seeds of these horrible acts. Why aren't more people focusing on the solution to the problem, i.e. going back to the beginning? Rarely do people snap without a long series of unfortunate events leading up to a horrible event.I am thankful to my friend who opened my eyes wider with this movie that's not so much about a bad kid, but bad parents. He believed, and lead me to further see, that the actions in the movie could and probably really do happen. Unfortunately, like most Americans, we only see the problem in front of us  in most cases: the actual bully  but never go outside the box to solve the problem. And save lives, both physically and future mental states.See this movie and see what can happen to those who should never be parents.
Well, at least they made a much better decision with this reboot thanah-hem, Ben Affleck.Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit isn't necessarily a bad film, nor a good one. In fact, this movie is one of the most dead-even mediocre films I've seen in a long time. The movie goes from mostly cold  and slooow, to action  and just okay action. It just gets by.Introducing Dr. John "Jack" Ryan for a third time, or his second re-introduction, is really plain this time. Basically, a Marine that carries none of his training expertise with him when he gets brutally injured is recruited into the CIA because of just two papers he wrote a while back.Undercover, he uncovers a Russian stock market scheme which somehow makes the CIA think this broken man with a broken back the perfect spy to thwart the whole bad guy operation. Oh, well, they needed him to be the Jason Bourne/James Bond lite spy. And he was.Okay, Captain Kirk, er, Chris Pine does try to throw in some emotion into the character, but comes nowhere close to when Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford played the same character. (Just forget Ben Affleck's shot at Ryan  pretty much everyone else has anyways.)You could do worse, especially for a January release. When the action starts  much too late into the film, it's decent enough to not regret the movie ticket price.* * * Final thoughts: Hollywood needs to listen to me, i.e. my idea for a Trio of a Crossover: Jack, Jason and James. Call it J³. C'mon, who wouldn't want to see the analyst, spy and brute all in one film?
The funniest part of That's My Boy was that since the movie was void of any humor, they couldn't even come up with the obligatory outtake scenes in the closing credits.This movie, as stated, is lacking any comedy, any originality and it's a wonder people still flock to an Adam Sandler film with a string of horrid and over-long films starring him. Watching this painful mess  and I use those terms extremely lightly, I kept wondering if it would be Sandler's worst. As disgusting as this was, Grown Ups remains his worst.Of course, this comes in a VERY close second. Let's just see how bad Grown Ups 2 is and where that'll rank.I digress. In an age old lie-film plot, a young boy impregnates his teacher and when the time comes, said boy leaves his (milking this "achievement") father and becomes successful. When daddy tries to make unpaid tax money off his son, so-called hilarity ensues at his son's wedding.You have to give this writer credit, or allow his punishment to become A Clockwork Orange's repeated viewing of this abomination. EVERY SINGLE JOKE either tanked or was seen coming from 600 frames back. Sandler even did his World's Most Annoying Voice again. I've always loathed that whiney and unimaginative sound and here, he performed that for a solid two hours.Yep. This movie with a 5-minute premise is stretched for almost two hours. What the bleep is wrong with Sandler, aside from his dried out "humor," that he feels that every movie of his has to exceed the needed 90-minute comedy mark?Mercifully, virtually no one saw this. Could this be a sign equivalent to World Peace? Could people finally saying NO to Sandler? I hope. Wishing he would retire since he's pressed snooze on his fifteen minutes 27 times is probably like requesting the Circle K clerk to give you the winning numbers when you buy a Powerball ticket.But, here's to hoping.
A Superman II opening recap for the four people who had never seen any of the previous films, yet actually bought a ticket to a sixth installment of a series, only proves how incredibly silly these films are. And truth be told, I finally gave up "critiquing" the franchise and had fun with the nonsense known as Fast Five. I had fun, here as well.Furious 6  with all the name changes, I can't wait to see what they'll call part VII, is just as silly and over-the-top as the other entries, but at least they don't pretend to be anything but a big-budgeted Grindhouse movie. That trend began with #5 and that's probably why I enjoyed both of those and rank them the best of the series.Really, the paper-thin plot is incidental to the number chase and fight scenes. But, just for fun, the faux pas Ocean's Eleven crew is reassembled in order to take down an even worse bad guy and in return, they get pardons in order to return home to the US.Seriously, that's all you need to know about the script. And chances are, anyone who bought a ticket to this had no intention of finding any depth here. Just fast cars, beautiful women and muscular men doing macho thingsyou know, the norm. And you'll get all that in spades, even though it slows down for a tremendous amount of the film.When the heat is on, it's great, no-brainer, entertainment, despite the incredibly ridiculous stunts at times (Vin Diesel's mid air rescue was about as real as Jason Statham's over-the-bay car bomb heroics in Transporter 2.) There were a lot of "Wow. Really?" moments I had, but more stuff I had fun watching, such as when they introduced some huge dude towards the end, I knew instantly he was going to be The Rock's match. When that came to pass, albeit a far-too-quick scene, it was enjoyable.It's best just to sit back and enjoy. I mean, when I was a kid, the man in the rubber Godzilla suit looked just as realistic as these guys.
It was my bad for thinking watching REC³ Génesis in Vegas while relaxing in my room and on a 15" Laptop screen was a good idea. What was the not brilliant part was how much dialogue was in thisi.e. subtitles that I had to read on such a small screen. When some horror movies get to part III, they advertise: "3 times the suspense! 3 times the horror! 3 times the etc!" This one had 3 times the dialogue!Beyond the endless reading  and I wouldn't really be complaining if it were actually from an in-depth or even remotely interesting script, the movie barely added anything new. Sure, as the film progressed, it opened up the floodgates on the previous installment's anticlimactic final revolution of which I thought was absolutely absurd. And it had a different setting. Beyond both of those points, there was nothing new under this sun.Basically, and that's putting it extremely mildly, there's a wedding of true loves: Clara and Koldo, both from different backgrounds, yet both obviously pretty privileged. If you've seen the first two movies, or hell, even the first one or the American remake, Quarantine, you know someone's going to be infected with some kind of rage/quasi-zombie virus and all hell's gonna break loose.Sadly, for such a short film  80 minutes, it takes a very long time to get to what we pressed play for, and even longer for the gore factor to pick up. When it does, however, it is satisfying to see who the strong hero is and how that person reacts.I didn't hate on this movie, but I thought it was thoroughly uninspired and if it weren't for the good looking males, I would've probably not care to stick around until the ending.Skip it: there are plenty of good looking men on the net to see verses spending 80 rehashed minutes here.
While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word  no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The "fear" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993.In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals.Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human.Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children.Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them.As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew.I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that.It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change  sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark.The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale  yes, I cried"Goodnight. See you tomorrow" and the Bruce Springsteen song, "Streets of Philadelphia." Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music.While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild  I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.
OK, I understand 'Serendipity' (6/10 Stars) is a fan favorite, and even star Kate Beckinsale has been quoted to say most men that approach her claim this is their favorite movie of theirsbut I failed to get past the old plot  even for 2001. No, nodon't get me wrong, I did like this, I just didn't find it "GREAT" and despite the same ole story, SEE: the superior 'Sleepless in Seattle,' I was kinda disturbed after the first act because I found these two characters/actors (including John Cusack) had such beautiful chemistry. And like fate, they're torn apart and we're to spend another 1+ hours of them trying to reconnect. Worse, they're both engaged to their own partners and not enough  make that VERY LITTLE  was shown to me that they didn't belong to their current fiancés. Thankfully, that hour I wish I could see that "chemistry" growing, we have some decent secondary characters, namely Jonathan's (Cusack) friend, Dean (Jeremy Piven.) My only real complaint, as this was a decent movie, was it's really hard to find wonderful chemistry between two leads and here they had it and then hid it in the form of "fate." Sad and yet, I recommend it, if not just for the first twenty beautiful minutes.
My sister would just say "my" instead of "our" since she's my only sibling. And believe me, she has, on many occasions. But, if I could have even half the heart that Paul Rudd's Ned does in Our Idiot Brother, I'd claim that title with pride.This movie was so under-appreciated when it was released. It's hilarious, touching, smart, sad and uplifting (usually simultaneously), original and a great lesson. I also loved the entire cast of characters and actors. Every single person on screen thoroughly helped the movie and each contributed in helping the movie elevate even further.The title threw me (and maybe that's why the low box office receipts) because right from the beginning I didn't really label Ned as an idiot. Okayselling dope to a uniformed police officer was pretty bad, but what I saw following that was a truthful, positive and loves all kind of guy. We don't get too many characters, even real life ones, that are this open, happy and honest. We need more.The movie follows the misadventures of almost-hippie looking Ned from his release from jail after selling said marijuana to a cop, and his dysfunctional sisters and ex-girlfriend who's holding his dog, Willie Nelson, hostage. Everyone dumps on poor Ned, whether he gets the insults or not. Oh, and that's another admirable thing about this good-natured guy: even if he gets the "abuse" his sisters and their significant others are dishing, he just lets it slide.Since his ex kicked him out, he's bumped from one family member to the next and supposedly, he screws up their life.Actually, I'm going to stop there. Spoiler-Territory. Suffice to say: SEE this movie. It's a small yet wonderful delight that had a lot of underlying humor. Including some hilarious scenes with Omar, the parole officer and Ned.Our Idiot Brother is welcomed into my home any time. One of the best films of 2011.
The best I can write about 'Humpday' was how real the made everything feel, as if this was a literally "genuine" reality documentary. The characters were believable enough and the film, though on a shoestring budget was well made. But the closing leaves a lot to be desired. There's a point of putting "Spoiler Alert" and flat out ruining the movie. So, suffice to say, I cannot give away the last 1/3 as that would pretty much make the film's "shocking surprise finale" a bust. But it's hard to write without mentioning it was a disappointment and that the entire premise of the movie is built up for the conclusion. Married and settled-down Ben is reunited from his past slacker best friend and drifter, Andrew and they immediately reconnect, putting a strain on Ben and wife-Anna's relationship. (This, by the way, reminded me of the enormously better 'Rounders' set-up.) Well, one night after boozing and smoking dope, Ben and Andrew make a pact to produce/star in a porn film that's "art" because it involves two straight men. Uh, just an FYI, this is nothing new. There's literally thousands of "Straight Man-on-Man" (or men-on-men) videos out there (whether you believe they are heterosexual or not,) so that part of the movie made me wonder if they thought this idea up in 1978 and just now got around to making it into something "new" and "shocking." One of the characters later in the film, while trying to back out, excuses his possible departure as that this is not really "art." He has a point. Since it's been done countless times before, they would really need to find their niche or twist. Side Note: as in most/if not all of the "Mumblecore" films, Mark Duplass steals the show and best reason to watch.
Okay, okay, I guess we're gonna just have to settle for Rounders as the best and only good Poker movie ever made.Fine, The Grand was okay, good even, but as many times as they try, they cannot make a decent movie revolving around poker like either The Grand or Roundersout of the dozen or so attempts.The name Runner, Runner alone is taken from Poker slang and our "hero" does play a little online poker along with eventually working at an online poker site. But, the connection to the sport of poker kinda ends there.The movie breathes and lives in B-Movie, direct-to-home-viewing land and is barely worth a mention for a Saturday Night Netflix pick. And this is strange with such highly popular actors involved, like Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake. (Note: I said "popular" and not "talented." They're, specifically Alleck, not great by any means, but they are headliners.)In a very basic story, Timberlake's Richie (really?) goes broke with the "absolute gambler win" theory and finds a cheater within an online poker site. After bringing this to the attention to the so-called Howard Hughes of online gambling, he gets hired on and really lives up to his name.But is everything as peachy as it appears to be? Um.if not, then congratulations on the very first movie you've ever seen.While not a complete waste or horrible movie experience, it's nothing new or inventive. It's kinda The Firm's distant, twice removed cousin and that's probably giving it a little too much credit.* * * Final thoughts: Basically all of the above is a bash on this. And I'll admit: I didn't hate life during this. I've seen a ton worse, especially from Affleck and Timberlake. So, maybe I'll backtrack a bit and say: fine. See it, but don't expect a Royal Flush. Hell, a three of a kind is being too, well, kind?
Yet another masterpiece from the master, Hitchcock. Sure, I've seen very few of his films and I'm really partial to Psycho and The Birds, but North By Northwest is no short of a classic.Granted, this movie may seem dated now, 50 years later, and furthermore, I doubt, if remade, like Psycho, any of the events of this movie couldn't even be remotely possible today, given its time and shape of cinema in the late 1950s, this was a perfect movie. It had absolutely everything: adventure, mistaken identity, comedy, romance, spy and the everyman charm of one of the greatest actors of all time, Grant. He was absolutely perfect in his role, an instant charisma that made you believe in, root for and be like at all times. No one could do it better.As for Eva Marie Saint, she was wonderful too. It's funny. I'm a huge Superman fan (since age 3) and during this updated viewing of the classic, I kept trying to picture her nearly 50 years older in Superman Returns as Martha Kent. I couldn't do itthey just didn't look like. Despite that, she was great in her seductive role.Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill, a thriving ad-exec, who is mistaken for super-spy George Kaplan and gets thrust into a world he's unaccustomed to  the other side of the road. See, he's a self-proclaimed liar (advertising) and now that the shoe's on the other foot, he must adjust.Not before long, he's accused of drunk-driving (which, as I pointed out before, most of these scenes wouldn't work today; here, the DUI's all but comical), murder, eluding the police, etc, etc. He's trying to solve the mystery, survive and romance a stranger (oooorrrr, is she???) on a train, Saint.As in most Hitchcock classics, I'm always drawn to the intrigue, suspense, originality and acting, but I think overall  the dialogue. Here it's pristine. Sure, Grant is responsible for 90% of it, but Saint also delivers some zingers. And to this day, again, 50 years later, is still fresh, funny and moves the story in a perfect rhythm. I can't even think of many movies today that develop such a punch for such witty and sharp dialogue.I think all should see this: young, old, people that first saw this in theatres, or to those who need to put the Wii down for a few hours. It's a fun, extremely family-friendly film that has tremendous depth, layers, adventure and allows the audience to pretend (or I would as a kid) to be someone else, this Thornhill/Kaplan character.
More like House of 1000 Birdies.The number of shots of gore almost equals how many times someone flipped someone else off. I'm actually puzzled on that. Maybe it was a symbol. Perhaps Director Zombie wanted to send some kind of message to a friend (I'm sure enemies would get worse) or the critics. Not sure, but it kind of ran out of steam or effect, I don't know, the seventeenth time.Viciously unscary, Zombie clearly decided on substance over suspense. His House of 1000 Corpses would be an easy target for anyone to compare to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Heck, it was (strangely) set in the 1970s (and in Texas!), had a house of related loonies and a group of young adults who go off the beaten path to a creepy old white house. Coincidentally, or not, the Massacre remake, came out almost 6 months to the date later. (Hmmm?)The biggest difference between the (true) 1970s classic Chainsaw and this mess is you got into those victims shoes. You felt for them, you were scared for them, you saw their angst. Here, you barely see them, much less give a second thought if they lived. I'm guessing, again, that Zombie chose to show off his new camera angles he learned at movie-making 101 night classesonline, over any bit of human connection. (SEE ALSO: Rob Zombie's Halloween II.Sure, I know who rocker Rob Zombie is, so saying this movie is basically an hour and a half music video shouldn't be surprising. But it really is. Unfortunately, that's all it is. Weird here, weird there, ideas start, sometimes stop, mostly leads nowhere. Everyone seemed to be doing their own thing that makes me think Zombie was hands-off and allowed the improv'ing to prevail. Was there even a screenplay? Did he whisper in his actor's ears: "Think Chainsaw, well, without the 'saw. Go."Most of these "Wrong Turn" movies are almost step-by-step the same: (usually) set in the 1970s, a single road that's hard to find and leads to a house full of back-wooded crazies and (generally) involves 2 males/2 females that are about as dumb as the drugs their on. (In Corpses's defense, I didn't recall seeing them use any narcotics, but, ironically, you really need to be on some to enjoy this feature.) I think Zombie saw that, and only ambition to "change the way" is just to make it as crazy as ever. Congratulations. Next time, remember there's the plot part of the screenplay.Okay, I'm being too harsh. It wasn't the worst, but if you're expecting to be scared, look elsewhere. I believe the reason it lacked thrills was, again, the lack of human connection. Besides the obvious  a man in clown paint 24/7  you rarely see the "main victim/stars" of the film. Half the time, it takes more energy to remember where they're at in the house than to care if they're still alive.Quick plot synopsis, if there is a story: Foursome writers forget the written cliché about curiosity killing the cat and head off to "Dr. Satan's" domain in the middle of nowhere after already being subjected to beyond abnormal characters, ones that don't hide their killer instincts. After their stereotypical tire blow-out, they head for "safety" from the obligatory rain and have the seen-it-before gross-out "let's introduce the clan" dinner before the been-there slaughter/run-like-hell begins.This movie is so point A-to-Z, it's not hiding this is homage to horror movies of true terror Zombie wanted to mimic. So, if you want to rekindle all those old Chainsaw knockoffs, and possibly have a little stash of drugs, watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake instead. Really. Besides the superior (from what I can recall) sequel, The Devil's Rejects, there's no reason to visit this house of 1000 corpses. Speaking of which, I wonder if there really were 1000 corpses here. Perhaps there were, but I have no interest in rewatching and counting.Disclaimer: I don't do drugs. Drugs are bad, mmm'kay. Maybe if did, I would've enjoyed this more. Maybe I would be scared. Maybe I would've actually understood it. The movie's just not worth the effort to start drugs just to get into this film. Say Nope to Dope(y Movies,) mmm'kay.
Horror goes in cycles, and as all circles, you always end up where you started. At times, they bombard us with Zombies, then Psychos, then demons, then haunted houses/spirits, etc and back. A few years ago, they did rejuvenate the zombie lore, and none pleased/scared me as much as the 2004 remake 'Dawn of the Dead.' Yes, I loved 'Shaun of the Dead' as well, but that was more dark-humor. 'Dawn' follows very closely the Romero original: All hell breaks loose, literally, one "dawn" and a group of survivors hold up in a shopping mall to figure out what to do, how to escape, survive and/or get rescued. Gone is the social commentary that had a lot of fans disappointed. Though I am a fan of the original, I wasn't one that was let down. I liked this one for the acting and realistic fear-factor. (In reality, I'd rather be up against Romero's zombies; you could all-but walk past them whereas here, if they see you, it's probably too late.) Polley: I love her! ('Go' is one of my favorites.) She is an excellent actress. Rhames was powerful. But probably the key element was Weber, whose very screen presence was astonishing. The rest of the group wasn't bad, but I think they did try their own social commentary by coincidentally putting all walks of life together, no two alike. It wasn't a perfect movie, but it's one I've seen at least a half-dozen times. Gore, soundtrack (this one introduced me to one of my now all-time-favorite songs: 'The Man Comes Around'), realism and tension all worked for me. Word to the wise: I didn't like to see the epilogue, so if you don't want to know what happens in the aftermath, stop the film when the credits roll.
Oy vey. I actually defended Jaws 2. Did that come back to bite me on the ass for the horror Jaws 3D was? And just to clear up my last statement: I meant horror as in HORRIBLE MOVIE and not a suspenseful scarefest.At any rate, Jaws 3D is so bad, so full of its gimmick of "3D"  which was NO WHERE NEAR new in 1983, by the way  that they actually turned the one-hit-wonder (the original, 1975's Jaws) into a jokefest. Sad.The one positive thing I can say about it, is that they really paved the way for Piranha 3DTWENTY-SEVEN YEARS LATER in 2010as there's a lot here that they held back on  it was Rated PG for some strange reason  that Piranha 3D took to the next level, or twenty.Seaworld's under attack by not one, but TWO sharks this time. Way to step it up from the previous "wimpy" films in the franchise that only involved one shark each. Somehow, without any investigation, its deemed the two sharks are parent and child. But, that's neither here, nor there. It's all about the fake 3D carnage.Really, I don't want to waste too much more time on this mess. I can even safely say, the Director and Writer feels the same way: they made a mess of poo and continuously wrote themselves into corners.There is no redeemable reasons to see this movie. Nothing that stands out, such as the "Okay, it's bad, but you gotta see this" scene.Of course, that makes me conclude with: You think this is bad? Wait until the next installment  I mean, who the *BLEEP* believed so deeply in this series, by this point, that they green lit the abomination that was to follow?
'Zombieland' is a fun, exciting, action-packed comedy-horror, but unfortunately, I didn't like it as much as the general public and critics. Sure, it was all I just mentioned (the "special guest appearance" and the rules not only flashed on screen, but used as props, were all great) but when it comes to Zombie-humor, you could do better with 'Shaun of the Dead.' That all being said, this one's worth a viewing. Columbus is a loner who lives by rules in a land overrun by zombies, but he meets wildcard Tallahassee and the buddy-comedy begins. Add in two annoying brats (you could say they turned more selfish in attempts to survive because of the outbreak, but they clearly show these two are fiends prior) and you got just another group attempting to maneuver through the living dead. As much as I, personally, have a distain for Harrelson, at very least, this movie gave me two characters who I loathed even more, said brats: Wichita and Little Rock. I especially hated Little Rock more. Eisenberg ("Columbus") holds his own, funny for some part and Harrelson (Twinkie-obsessed "Tallahassee") is actually enjoyable. The movie's hardly original, and wildly predictable, but overall I'd recommend for light-hearted (despite the gore) fun. The surprise cameo had to be one of the major highlights, yet was ruined by Michael Phillips on 'At the Movies' (shame on you!) Again, though predictable outcome, the cameo has the best line (albeit one word) in the film: "Garfield." I've seen more zombie movies than I probably can count, so I do know the rules, however it was fun how they presented and reminded us of them. I would like to have the entire list, just out of curiosity.
When 'Scream 2' came out, now more than a decade ago, I loved it. In fact, it landed on my top 10 superior (or equal to) sequels to the originals. Now, watching the trilogy complete, it's not as good as I remembered it. Sure it has a lot of good points: Courtney and Neve look great! The tongue-in-cheek sequel jokes/statements are great. I always love Olyphant, Pinkett, Jackson and Gellar. And they really up'd the ante on making the now-familiar "whodunit" storyline a little more mysterious. Unfortunately, the bad way outweighs the good. Though, I loved the creativity, dialogue and theme to the opening, it was just plain way too drawn out and pointless to the remainder of the movie. (I see how they matched the first movie's intro, but at least that was more scary and interesting, overall.) The rest of the movie follows suit  it's way longer than it needed to be, so much could've been cut. And the coincidences/plot holes were pretty thick. It's years later, they've made a movie(-within a movie, 'Stab') which apparently sparks another blood bath for anyone who hangs out with the survivors from part one. I don't want to sound too harsh; I enjoyed this feature, it has a lot of creativity to it and it's worth watching. It has some intense scenes  my favorite is the courtyard search, but coincidentally it saddens me that my favorite character is off'd during this scene. I can't spoil too much, but the closing (another long and drawn out scene) had me rolling my eyes. As did that horrible 'Top Gun' homage. I am not at all a fan of Jerry O'Connell and definitively not one of the worst actors: Liev Schreiber, and he didn't do much to change that here. Still worth a view.
When the 8-DVD, 7-Movie A Nightmare on Elm Street Collection finally came to DVD, I bought it, instantly as I am a huge Freddy Krueger fan. No other horror series produced more top notch films than the Nightmare series  namely #1, #3, #4, #7, and an honorable mention #5. As always, there are misfires that practically destroy the legend and franchise.While #2, A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge is the worst of all, #6: Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare comes in a very, VERY close second. Sure, it has its moments, as in a few funny Freddy lines and motions (SEE: Freddy dancing behind one deaf victim) the rest of the movie sorely stunk.The movie was horribly written including a wildly predictable script made up of enormously incomprehensible subplots, inconsistencies, plot holes bigger than the town it's based on and legends either rewritten (incorrectly) or its own "rules" it breaks at every turn. Don't even get me started on the horrid "guest stars" namely Roseanne and (then husband) Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp  who, even in 1991, should've known better to return to this now "DEAD" series and Alice Cooper who should've agreed to appear when the films were at their peak not in the pits.In addition, the special effects were awful especially and mainly during the joke-use of 3-D-scenes and monsters. (Here, wear these "special" cheap 3-D glasses during your dream and you can enter Freddy's mind! Or put them on to tell the audience when to put theirs on since we didn't have a budget to shoot the whole thing in 3-D.) Also, the mystery of Freddy's offspring was a joke as were the discrepancies in the story  Freddy wants the last teen to escape Springwood, OH (which surprisingly looks closer to, say, California) to "fetch" and can't follow with/without him but then can leave whenever and that same survivor has amnesia, but can remember Freddy when the plot asks for it. And don't even get me started on the cop-out ending that's already been done many times in the same series. (Not to mention  spoiler  when Freddy's pulled out, once again of the dreamland, he's supposed to be in our realm, but can easily climb ceilings, repair broken fingers and change from his burnt skin to Robert Englund's mug. If you've made it this far in the movie, then not only shame on you, but you deserve what you get in this laugh-out-loud horrible finale.) I'm not going to bother wasting too much more time on the plot line, but said final-teen survivor leaves Springwood and inadvertently sets off yet another chain reaction of Freddy killings while Nightmare Stalker Krueger gives a new reason for his previous-human mass killings: they took his only child. (This is contradictory to the real legend of him just being a child murderer who got burned alive, by the parents of the victims, after caught and released on a technicality. I'm not sure why they changed the story, but for laziness.) I understand Freddy finally managed to kill off Nancy (the original heroine from #1 and #3) but my heart always goes out for Alice (the take-over heroine from #4 and #5.) Though no direct reference to either character, I'm assuming Freddy finally got to Alice, as they mention ALL children/teens have been killed, but one, this guy in this movie. (I'm so disgusted with this feature, that I won't even bother looking up his name.) I'm not sure if that's true or not, because last we seen of Alice in #5, she was pretty much grown up. This is neither here nor there, but again, as a fan, you want to see the heroes prevail, no matter how dark the source material is.I will admit, I liked some of the lines from Freddy and despite the disgustingly bad script and film making, at least Englund tried to give the fans what they liked best. The music wasn't too bad and lead actress/character played by Zane was actually good. All of these qualities produced a mere ½ more to 1½/5 stars, making this the 2nd worst Freddy movie.This movie is an abomination and along with #2, should be avoided. The rest were either great, really good or watchable. #2 and #6 should be burned along with Freddy.
I'm at a disadvantageI'm just not that into musicals. Especially the odd types  still haven't seen 'Moulin Rouge!'But, I appreciate my friends' recommendations. After the second  or is this the third or more?  recommendation to see 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' (4/5 Stars) I finally gave in. I was so unfamiliar with what this was about, aside from the main character being a drag performer and it was a musical, I thought the title ended with: "and the angry ITCH" and thought that made sense.I admitthis one is hard for me to review. It's certainly not mainstream. It's also not black & white. In fact, I hate reviewing movies like these because my mind's going around in circles. (This is certainly above my pay rangebut since I don't get paidthank God, right?)I did like the movie, very much. I loved the music, the songs, the story. The acting of director/writer/star John Cameron Mitchell, aka "Hedwig" was phenomenal. The movie's wildly original and for the most part I could follow it. ButFine. I admit, I was a bit lost, especially in the absolute finale This MUST stem from my lack of interest in musicals because I guess I'm supposed to "get" the finale and see where this incredibly interesting character headed when naked down an alleySo, I will be watching this again. It sincerely helps that I loved the music and (pretty tragic) story of a lost boy. And then, perhaps I can answer some questions of mine(Spoiler alert) Such as: Who did he end up with? How did he end up with that band? Was his co-lead singer a woman in drag? And finally, why the hell did they select places that went against his/her grain?Hopefully, one  or more  of my friends will answer these questionsbut I still want to see it again. With further understanding, perhaps my rating will increase. Either way, I'm definitely ordering the soundtrack soonokayordered. The soundtrack will be arriving between Monday, January 30, 2012  Tuesday, February 14, 2012. Just in time for Valentine's Day or Arizona's 100th Birthday!
Yes, I am aware Spider-Man comes from the comic books. And I've read enough of them that the word "meanwhile" shows up quite often. Unfortunately, they didn't place "meanwhile" in Spider-Man 3.I don't know how many subplots are in Spider-Man 3, but I'll try to list them. All. And with the appropriate word "meanwhile" to transition them, as they should've in the movie:Mary Jane's finally on Broadway. Meanwhile, Harry's still seeking revenge on Spider-Man for the supposed murder of his father, a.k.a. Green Goblin. Meanwhile, Peter wants to marry MJ. Meanwhile, an alien force lands on Earth. Meanwhile, Flint, related to the death of Uncle Ben, breaks out of prison. Meanwhile, Flint's fighting to make his sick daughter alive and his ex at bay. Meanwhile, Harry gets temporary amnesia. Meanwhile, Brock is yearning to be Spidey's new press agent. Meanwhile, Gwen is dangerously modeling during an accident and Spidey rescues her. Meanwhile, her father, the police captain, grants Spidey the key to the city. Meanwhile, MJ gets fired for bad acting. Meanwhile, Peter proposes and gets turned down from MJ. Meanwhile, romance sparks up between MJ and Harry. Meanwhile, Sandman and Spidey fight. Meanwhile, the black goo, a.k.a. alien Venom attaches to Spidey. Meanwhile, Spidey gets loose and becomes a real person, albeit aggressive. Meanwhile, Spidey loses the Venom to Brock. Meanwhile, Brock becomes a cartoon black Spidey. Meanwhile, Harry's father's ghost visits and convinces him to blackmail MJ and fight Spidey. Meanwhile, Sandman and Venom team up to hurt Spidey. Meanwhile, Peter makes MJ jealous with Gwen. Meanwhile, Dr. Connors warns of the black goo. Meanwhile, Peter's apartment manager, daughter and Aunt gives good advice while either criticizing his place or again, asking for rent. Meanwhile, J. Jonah Jameson is having pill problems. Meanwhile, Peter learns to dance, horribly, but it was meant for comic relief, I suppose. Meanwhile, the "Alfred"-butler reveals at the most opportune time what Harry needed to hear to move the plot along.(That last one made me actually crack up in the theatre  Seriously? He chose that moment after 3 movies to reveal the truth behind the death of the Green Goblin?)Wow. Did I miss any? I understand that's not entirely in order and that's not all of the multiple subplots, but I count twenty-six subplots. Twenty-six??? Seriously? This has to be a record.I've seen this movie a few times, and though it's not horrible, in fact it's decently filmed and Grace brings a lot to his role as Brock/Venom, there are way too many things going on. It certainly had the "Batman" dilemma. By the time the original Batman series got to part IV, there were so many villains, so many characters, so many subplots, it was so bogged down, it was unwatchable. And that's sad. This could've been so much better if they focused on only Venom as a villain. Or just Sandman as a villain. Or signaling out Gwen as a love interest. Or even Spidey going bad. Or the now-age-old New Goblin as a rival.No, they had to put 26+ ideas in one. The biggest problem with the entire series is pacing. Going on way too long. Here, in part III, they not only decided to actually increase the length, but add way too many ideas.Unfortunately, that was the movie's undoing. Despite some awesome action sequences (Harry Vs. Peter in the opening and the absolute comic-book ending fight) the movie seriously should be skipped. I remember watching this in theatres thinking: "Oh, I can't wait to watch this on DVD, so I can just skip to the 30 minutes (of 139) that I actually liked."Speaking of which, I'm guessing we're not supposed to side with aggressive Spider-Man, made that way with the alien goo. Unlike the other Super-Hero Part 3, where Kal-El goes bad in Superman III, I actually liked Peter/Black-Spidey much better than the red/blue good-guy. At least this Dark-Spidey got paid for once.Let's hope they get back on track for part IV. Ideas: go back to one villain. Lose the "love conflict story" between the two leads  Oh My God, that's been played out for almost seven hours of the series. In addition, if there is a wedding, yeah, like there won't be, make it quick and get back to the action. And, finally, fire Willem Dafoe  enough with the Green Goblin!!!!
Aside from all I read about the changes to the "real" true story of the family portrayed in The Impossible, the movie did manage to move me in spots. Of course, that was the main reason for the movie, I believe.The movie is a real straight forward account of a family of Christmas breakers at a holiday resort swept away, literally, by a tsunami they had absolutely no chance of escaping or could possibly know was on its way. Not only must that be scary, but they surely showed how caught off guard they were and what anyone of us would experience.The remaining story is the family either staying together or separating and trying to get back together in one Hallmark moment after the next. Really, I'm not trying to downplay their plight, and again, the movie truly got me going at a few scenes. But, then that seemed more its mission than to tell a great story.To me, it might have been even more moving had a story been told about a completely less fortunate family or islander's struggles. This family was wealthy and had the grand fortune of the mother being a doctor. And I don't want to spoil the ending, but damn, I felt incredibly less sorry for these folks once you see the privilege they had compared to all the less financially backed families "our heroes" left behind.(Just the next paragraph is a spoiler. If you object, skip just one paragraph.)Example: with so many either dying, infected, in agony or had dead family members, this family of 5 take up an entire plane to go get "top medical" help in another country, when so many seats could've been used to help those left behind to rot or die. If that ending doesn't p|ss you off on how little they did or what could've been done to aid even just a few dozen more victims, then your heart is in the wrong place.SPOILER OVER. Okay, the movie wasn't too bad, and mercifully, very quick. That was probably because there was so little build up, and even less plot during. But, if you're looking for an intentional tear-jerker, this is your Lifetime movie for a Saturday night.
'Role Models,' they're certainly not, but when it comes to dealing with kids, I would trust these guys over Adam Sandler in 'Big Daddy' any day. OK, not by much, but at least this was a thoroughly more enjoyable movie and you had people to root for. Anyone should prepare themselves for this movie, if you're a movie lover or at least see more than 3 a month, you'll need to dumb yourself down a bit for this movie. Forget all the predictability  if the trailers don't tell you the A-B-C plot this is, the first five minutes will  and you'll probably enjoy this as much as I did. It strongly helps I'm a huge Rudd fan as well as 'MadTV' and 'Reno 911!' I recognized a lot of the cast of both now-defunct shows, but I had no idea about a few of them I recognized, but couldn't place them in their new surroundings/get up, until, of course, I looked them up on IMDb. Again, despite the A-B-C plot, I really laughed out loud, and unfortunately could sincerely relate to the Rudd character. Both Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) get into trouble and must do community service headed up by the 'Glee' lady  outstanding (and nutso) here. They must take care of two boys, a la Big Brother, one a menace, one a soldier. The two "Biggies" remain selfish in their predicament, until, well, you know how this will play out. And despite a very convenient "sitcom" closing, overall, it's recommendedfor adults. Really, this is a Hard-R, despite messages placed in here for kids. Perhaps they were aiming high for the kid in all of us? Side note: despite the usual leads  Rudd/Scott, it was refreshing them using new cameos, and funny ones to boot.
Thanks, Fox for cancelling 24. This is what you get. You'll see how much we appreciate Jack as he would've absolutely adverted this movie's catastrophe. If they hadn't cancelled 24, I would've just assumed this was one of Jack's day off.Right at Your Door tells the story of several dirty bombs going off in downtown LA causing all kinds of havoc, sickness, and chaos it caused. But more directed towards a married couple, one stay at home male and his female counterpart who supports the (new) household. In fact, she's on her way to work when the bombs go off and she lands directly in the middle one of the dirty bombs.The male half, Brad (played wonderfully by Cochrane) goes after her, but is forced back home and when a neighbor comes over, they're both forced to seal off the new home to avoid contamination. It's so new, no cable installed yet  so no TV on for the news, just radio. Also, the a/c's not on, so it's enormously hot. Wife Lexi, (McCormack) returns, but too late to get into the house. As much as Brad loves her  and Cochrane sincerely shows this, he still can't allow her in, unless he would just be as damned as she's turning out to be due to the infected air/bomb.The rest of the movie plays on the confusion, claustrophobic atmosphere, hopelessness and conversations between the couple through plastic. It was an interesting story, a more human approach to a huge terrorist disaster in a major city. The movie screams Independent cinema and/or the theatre. So, if that's your bag, you should see this. Even if you're not, the performances are above notch and worth your time.
Mercifully, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire fixed the error made in the previous feature: they remembered to include an exciting, action packed and door-opening finale. Sadly, they just had to sacrifice the first two-thirds to get to that good conclusion.So frustrated, I am. I've listened to the fans, to my social circle and to my social media friends. And I've been warned that these movies are made for fans and you MUST HAVE READ THE BOOKS to follow the movies. Hogwash! This is a separate medium and should be treated as such. It should have the elements of the book, but understand there could  and is  a new audience out there.I'm losing this battle and fast. Even more random scenes cloud this enormously rough entry in the series. In fact the movie is so far all over the place, with ideas, characters, scenes, names, legends, games, grudges it all seems like: YES, YOU NEED TO READ THE BOOK TO CONTINUE.Well, since I won't read them, after I finished book one, I might be in more trouble as the series progresses. Sadly, I feel my ratings will decrease because I do not feel the writers/directors are going to do the right thing. No lost soul should enter a Christian Church for the first time and be greeted with "So, why are you lost? Have you not read what Christ has done for you? Buffoon! Get out and come back when you read the Bible cover to cover. I don't have time for you."At any rate, with a surprisingly new opening  i.e. gone are the abusive adopted parents and the vicious warning Harry ignores of his pending death  that involves a kind of game, I guess, that will make someone  wait for it  victorious. Obviously, Harry will be involved, by his own doing or not, though the way the game's played out is less foretold. Including, the three-part game that apparently is spread aimlessly thorough the year. ??That's the basic synopsis of a film that wanders from here to there, that holds one door open while reaching for the next, that fast forwards teen adolescent, love lost, gained, anger, betrayal, redemption, secrets, etc, etc, etc, and so on and so forth. I get the fact that these are excellent elements to make a good story, but you don't have to use half a dictionary to make one sentence. Pick a direction, a path and have the conviction to stick to it. Here are some additional thoughts I had while trying to wade through this mess: - I'm actually finding myself caring less and less for these side characters. YES, its Harry's story and journey, but his annoying counterparts could meet their doom by series end and I wouldn't bat an eye.- Ron's bipolar and it's getting increasingly tedious. He's acting hurt, upset, okay, angry, jealous, etc, etc and all the while he's sporting a 1970's Leif Garrett hairdo that's more distracting  and awful  than anything else.- The first three movies, aside from a few key elements, are essentially the same film and should've served as the first hour of ONE movie that these people stretched to four. This chapter, Goblet of Fire, could've filled out the final hour of Harry Potter Part One.- ARG Robert Pattinson. In their defense, he wasn't the UnAlive Creature Bella will lust over in the Twilight series yet, but here's evidence he's been injected with Botox since, at least, age nineteen.Since roughly 75% of this film's fluff doesn't matter  or at least, they've given me, to date, no reason it should, I would suggest people watch #2 while skipping the first and third movies and just be told that things get darker in part four. And not more clearer, as the dark comment indicates.(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)
Honestly, The Box wasn't as bad as I've heard from a lot of critics and people and certainly not on my list of "worst of 2009" lists. (However, it's definitely not in the top 10.) In fact, before I saw the movie, I was intrigued on the concept of the age-old "button-pushing" theory/idea. And after the movie started, all I could do is admire the director/writer for coming up with multiple interesting ideas.Let's begin with those strange ideas/subplots, shall we? We have a movie set in the 1970s, for whatever reason. We have a wife/mother with a deformed foot for some strange purpose. We have a NASA astronaut-seeker who does love his wife and child but loses his advancement. We have that husband/wife experiencing "financial woos" however, in today's time, or back in 1976, they don't really look like they're hurting too much. We have a mysterious half-faced man who presents a "box" with a big red (EASY) button and a proposal: press the button and receive $1,000,000 (which in today's time is probably $2,500,000  still a lot of money) but someone "you don't know will die." And then, of course, you have mystery surrounding the man with the half-eaten face.Immediately in the film, you're wrapped in all the mystery of the previously mentioned subplots. And I was absolutely intrigued on all they put into this film for whatever reason. Sure the finished product isn't the best made movie, but it was so unusual to begin with, so many odd occurrences and uniqueness, I was compelled to finish the film.The said couple and child are presented with a "box" (which, by the way, isn't a box, but let's not get technical) in which, again, if the button on top is pressed, they will receive one million dollars, but someone they don't know will die. This is absolutely no spoiler, but they press the button! I say no spoiler because, really  would there be a movie otherwise? Presto! They get the dough and now someone else gets the same option with the button. (Plot point!) They're told not to investigate and again, no movie is without the main character snooping. Mr. Lewis (Marsden) does, in fact, poke around and eventually all hell's breaking lose. The mystery's slowly unraveled around the strange man with half his left cheekbone gone, a la The Tall Man from Phantasm.I don't want to give away too much, but I did like the fact that they do explain everything. They don't just go off the deep end, despite how strange the movie was and leave up everything for interpretation.And the explanation is silly, but plausible in the story's realm. Despite its "Twilight Zone" background and inspiration, it feels centuries old. Also, it feels very Halloween III: Season of the Witch-ish as well, for those unfortunate enough to see that single Michael Myers-less Halloween chapter.Even then, it's worth a viewing for the very fact that it's so incredibly interesting that they made it so far out-left-field that it makes it watchable.Side Note: as incredibly selfish and greedy as I feel I am sometimes, I could NOT possibly press that button and get the million bucks, "Scot-free." As much as I would love that to live comfortably on, I could not possibly harm or cause the death of any human. Stranger or not. And besides, it's fairly easy to detect the underlining of the rules: the box/button will be passed onto someone "I don't know." Well, it doesn't take a genius to put two-and-two together when I'm also told: someone "I don't know" will die. Duh.So, despite the fact I can't bring myself to harm another, there's always, always a catch. No free lunch anyone.
"She told four people today they were 'One in a Million.' What are the chances of that?" - Martin.At 98 tight and wonderful minutes, Philomena, was an often hilarious, always touching and grand adventure in storytelling.Imagine your (or a) grandmother, who is conservative yet, down-to-earth, funny but doesn't know it and is secretly in on what's going on around her in the world and barely shows it, telling the story of her journeys in her life. It would be good, and I would want to listen, but coming from the mind of this third party, this Martin Sixsmith, I wouldn't be able to leave my chair.I was captivated in hearing how this Irish Catholic little girl (okay, teen) commits the ultimate (not really) sin of sex and nine months later trades her child's life for a life of church work and repentance. When the story turns into ex-communicated (sorta) journalist who aids her (now a senior) plight to find her missing boy that was horribly sold to an American family, I couldn't take my eyes or ears away.Steve Coogan (the reporter) has always been on my radar for a good time at the cinema. He's hilarious, deep and charming even when down. He takes on the same motions as I do when we both realize our audience doesn't fit our sense of humor. He was a joy to watch and kept me engrossed.Dame Judi Dench (the title character that I cannot spell without copying/pasting) was wonderful, as always. I loved the layers she displayed when needed, her spunk that was sporadic and desired and her trueness to the life of the woman she was portraying. She never ceased to amaze me and made me smile. I would love to know a woman like this in real life.Follow along the journey from England to the States as Philomena (I did that one on my own!) searches for her son the nuns made her give up at birth 50 years prior. There are surprises along the way, subtle and welcomed hilarity and extremely touching moments.There is nothing over the top here (THANK YOU,) the length of the movie is perfect and the movie was not filled with Hollywood Hands or clichés. The acting was suburb, the cinematography delightful and the heart and involvement just perfect. SEE IT! * * * Final thoughts: Great, what started off as an interesting story ends with me HAVING TO BUY THE BOOK. I seriously want to know all the other ins/outs that they cut from this experience, this film. This is the kind of movie that does inspire me to know more. Well done.
I'd guess you'd have to call 'Rumble in the Bronx' an extreme example of a guilty pleasure. Though back in the 1990s, it was not my first introduction to Jackie Chan (the inferior 'Supercop' was) it was the one that got me hooked on his work. All the way through this viewing  the first in many years, the word "silly" kept popping up in my mind. It's dialogue, acting, stereotypes and shoddy cop work was so hilariously bad, I could only think this had to be written by someone who's only contact with the U.S.A. involves watching old 1970s cop hour-long dramas. And while some scenes were actually funny (SEE: the wrench threat) some were downright unintentionally funny (SEE: the toddler-toss and the entire closing on the golf course.) Leaving all that negative behind, it was an extreme joy watching Chan perform his own stunts in many, many inventive ways while simultaneously creating a very human and good-hearted character. The stunts were simply amazing and if one were to watch today for the first time, they need to know: he did them all himself, without a green screens, cables, etc. As arrogant as Chan is  I've read his biography, it's dripping with arrogance, he does have great gifts in originality, showmanship, pride in his work and making sure he never uses traditional American trickery/stunts. (This changes later in his work, when he was forced and got older, but this work and ones around it were all pure Chan.) Synopsis: Good-natured nephew Chan visits NYC and gets thrown in extraordinary circumstances: fighting both gangs and mob bosses while helping 2 women, his Uncle and a handicapped child. All that's irrelevant; what matters is once the action starts, it never lets up. And with an open-mind, what a fun rumble you'll have.Side Note: Wow.. not only was it painful for all the actors to get hurt during production (not to mention the roughly 16 dozen vehicles) it was also gut wrenching to watch the closing credits that showed mostly the unintentional crashes, broken bones, etc. You really have to hand it to the devotion of the crew, cast and Chan. Definitely Chan. My comments about his arrogance does not mean I don't admire the man, especially his extremely poor and underprivileged beginnings to the entertainer he became. He's one of the very few actors/action stars that no matter how incredibly silly his movies look to me  it has to be a culture thing, it's always a rush to see how long his fight scenes last, how inventive he becomes and simply how exciting they are.
In a surprisingly superior sequel and mercifully shorter, 'Underworld: Evolution' (7/10 Stars) wasn't perfect, but it was a breath of fresh air over the over-long original. Sad we were still subjected to the dreadful (character) Viktor and an outrageously and hilariously bad use of CGI in the opening prequel. But good that we still had the ass-kicking Selene. She's worth the entire viewing and even her sidekick/lover Michael did a bang up job himself. The score, action and soundtrack are all good and it's not as heavy handed with the ancient mystery as the first was. It's recommended, especially over the first and definitely over the horror that follows it.
What a charming movie that teared me up in the end. Man, I love this man, Bill Murray. Rarely has he ever let me down and had me rolling a few times here. (And I am still, 12-years later, upset he was snubbed for Lost in Translation, to date, his best movie.)Overall an obvious setup that does take some more realistic turns. Not perfect, by any means, but enjoyable to watch to the end. And FINALLY, Melissa McCarthy can act out of her tenfold Tammy role. She is often hilarious, but her bad bitch you wanna hate shtick is literally killing her real talents. Really not for kids, and it's mega-independent, so don't expect the normal Hollywood ending. Cheers!
Wildly original is Charlie Kaufman. To date, I've only seen four (ranked from best to still damn good): Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. And as much as I liked Adaptation, it currently ranks as #3 of 4.Does that, ranking Adaptation third of the 4 Kaufman-written movies I've seen, make it any less grand? By no means  it's a great feature. Wonderfully inventive, great acting all around and a story that moves you, interests you and keeps you around to the closing. As great as everyone, including Director Jonze, was (and I'll get to them in a bit,) it's ringleader Kaufman that controls the seas here. Believe me: if I were in Hollywood, I would follow him. Blindly.Screenplay writer Charlie (Cage) is a part of one of his last projects (realistically shown) Being John Malkovich when he's summoned to adapt Susan Orlean's (Streep) novel The Orchid Thief. But he doesn't know how to adapt a movie based on flowers. He seeks out help from his twin while fantasizing about multiple women he masturbates to as he's a lonely soul.His world gets darker by the moment as he tries desperately to solve this dilemma on his own. The movie jumps from present (screenplay adaptation) to a couple of years in the past to explain the story. You're basically seeing his real-life screenplay unfold in his real life as if this is a real life true story.The dialogue, especially between the brothers, is excellent, intriguing and humorous. As is the bond between brothers. In addition, there's drama, suspense, mystery, lust and creativity abound. Cage, who I loved (pretty much only) in Leaving Las Vegas is solid here playing both Kaufman and twin. Streep is wonderful, as usual, but adds more to her résumé as a depressed, lost soul hooked on the plant (literally.) Cooper is superb as "the smartest man he knows," or so he tells us. He's wonderful in his plant-loving role. And I definitely love (much later in Michael Clayton, but I just saw Adaptation for the first time) Tilda Swinton. Too bad she (and Livingston, who I will also favor greatly) isn't in the movie too much. The time she is, is good, however.The movie's weird, by all means, but it shows true escapism, originality and depth. For any struggling writer, in/out of the silver screen, this is the movie for them. Its presence should inspire the weakest of blocked writers. And should show that, if you have an idea, no matter the oddity or cost, explore it. Envision it. Produce it. And get it made, on paper at least. Who knows? Perhaps one day, you can explore your dreams with an audience one day. Or have Brian Cox yell at you until your bones shake.
'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' is kinda like coffee or smokingI don't think anyone jumps head-first into either. Neither did I. This being my (LONG OVERDO) first viewing, took me awhile to get into the fashion of animation that's completely different than anything else I've seen  including Pixar, normal CGI and Wallace & Gromit. Butwaitonce you do go down this fox hole, chances are it will surely grow on you, make you smile more than a dozen times, warm thy creative heart and laugh out loud. One running gag I loved so much and never got old: the cuss word(s). This movie is weird, and continues that way to the end and I'm guessing we're rooting for the bad guys/thieves  boy, George, he can really make you side with him, even when animated. Oh, and those are not complaints. BIG Thumbs up.
And the Bond reboot trilogy comes to a close. Although, I believe they might have left it open to another sequelI really don't know what to think, immediately, at any rate, of Bond's latest, Skyfall. Well, of course, I'm happy to see him (and Daniel Craig, my favorite Bond) back on the big screen  IMAX, no less  after such a long and unnecessary absence.The reason for my hesitation was because I was disappointed in the poor script, plot holes, and terrible villain  although I should be proud of what I think they were portraying him to be. In addition, there were so many references to the older Bond flicks that I just re-watched or watched for the very first time recently that I just didn't care about. Injunction with the seven or eight attempts at homage, all they talked about was the same boring cliché Lethal Weapon kept reminding us of: "We're getting too old for this sh|t."Enough! I am a James Bond fan, for the most part, and I put him in the same category as a super-hero. I don't want to see him fall from the sky, get shot, complain about cramps, want to move into a retirement home or act human. Sure, it makes it more realistic, but Jason Bourne was pretty banged up for most of his trilogy and he didn't make us listen to all his wines or grunts. Ironically, Judi Dench's M was tough as ever and she's twice Bond's age.Regardless, take out the meager writing  including the most obvious twists, the crying and one-too-many homage's  even the so-so title song was one, it was a very decent action film that started off with a fantastic chase scene, had a great silhouette shot and included one of the best cinematographers in the series. I also enjoyed the Bond Girls, albeit they were fairly absence throughout. The lesser of the two girls in relation to screen time, Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) has to be one of the best looking Bond Girls of all time.Bond's chasing a man with a drive, hard drive, that is, containing the secret identities to all MI6's agents and inadvertently gets "dead" for several months. When the sh|t hits the fan, Bond pulls himself out of semi-dead mode to aid M find the computer hacker while she's dealing with, ah-hem, politics to continue funding the spy organization.Things get personal and hit home for our heroes and once again, our Bond villains always stop short of either killing Bond or escaping and giving Bond more than adequate time to basically reload or recover.That last part is a Bond film signature, and as much as they tried to make this the most realistic, I found myself pointing to the screen to the most obvious exits or actions the villains should be doing while waiting for Bond to catch up. They might as well be tripping over some bushes at Camp Crystal Lake while Jason Voorhees slowly walks to them.I'm really not trying to dog the film that much, and it was a slight improvement over Quantum of Solace, but it was a letdown from what I expected. I still love Craig (and his Dumbo ears) as Bond, and Judi Dench as M, and I will be excited for the next chapter, but I hope they get away from all those Bond references and just start making individual Bond movies again.Forthis movie truly made the exceedingly superior Casino Royale look like just the first part of a reboot trilogy. With all that came to pass, all the way to the finale of Skyfall, it finally looks like the series came in full circle. So much so, that the movie basically felt like it immediately preceded Dr. No.In regards to that, I praise them and I yearn for an energized and original Bond to come next.Side Note: The movie touched on one topic close to my heart and opened the door wide for people like me. I'm being very general here, because I don't want to spoil anythingbut, I was shocked and pleased with Bond's reaction and statement while tied to a chair and being interrogated, sort of, by the villain. Way to go. I'm glad this Bond film has an open mind. I just don't want to hear the backlash from the general public.
As preposterous, unfunny, immature and horrifyingly bad, believe it or not, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the best of the three movies. But, that's like saying it's better to be deaf than blind.Aside from the blatant swearing, this movie should've come with the warning: Not for those over three years of age. I mean, the cuss words were so obviously put in to give this juvenile film "an edge" as was Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's flaunting of her body for the young teen boys.I'm no prude  in reference to the profanity, but just to add it to make the laughable cardboard characters "tough" is just plain stupid. And weak.I'm aware this is a part III of an already established dumbed-down action/Sci-Fi series based on toys, but there's a point of leaving your brain-at-the-door that goes too far. The point for me, aside from the ridiculous mismatching of this "story" and stock footage of President Kennedy, was about 20 minutes (of 157) when idiot Shia, er, I mean, Sam played with his obnoxious little Transformer pets.The positives for this feature was the fact they toned down the lengthy and complex story finally and made it a lot easier to tell which robot was which  they added color to the Autobots. Neither of these attributes elevated this above 1 star out of 5. It was just a speck of a gift for all we had to endure to get to the end of the film.Quick story brief: previously outed-alien metal race Autobots is helping humans thinking the bad aliens, the Decepticons, are out of commission. Well, obviously, they're not and both parties are trying to regain planet-destroying materials from their defunct planet. Oh, and Decepticons want to use humans as slaves, à la Borg/Matrix.Really, the point of the movie is for us to sit through painful dialogue, pitiful acting, awful jokes and minimal action sequences to get to the inevitable crushing of Chicago in the last 40 or so minutes. Matrix Revolutions, anyone? In both Matrix 3 and Transformers 3's over-long final battle scenes, I was literally left bored despite all the efforts they put in for "heart" and special effects. Numerous times, I just looked away from my screen and played a game on my phone.Even when Leonard Nimoy ("Sentinel Prime") barked his signature Spock line, I had already checked out and could care less when he said it. I seriously can't recommend this to anyone. Again, I would for the under three crowd of toddlers if not for all the deliberate vulgarity.I guess I could end on a positive note. I did laugh hard a couple of times. Both scenes involved Sam being thrown in the air sloooo-mo while his yellow friend Bee went to catch him. That was (unintentionally) hilarious!
There should be a rule in Hollywood. When Cameron makes a "Part II," that should be the end to the series as he sure knows how to complete any story with both a bang and an absolute conclusion. Want evidence? Terminator 2 was a great ending and a complete story to the Big-Screen Sarah Connor chronicles. But no, they ruined it once with Terminator 3 and further beat that horse with Terminator: Salvation.Piranha II, I've been told, isn't exactly his fault and I'm glad they did end it there. (The incredibly superior 2010 "remake/reboot" Piranha 3D doesn't count as part of that series.)As for Avatar 2: Electric Boogaloo, I sincerely hope that's the finale. But, then, I wasn't a fan of the first and probably won't see his follow-up anyways.And nowAliens solidified a story so vividly, brilliantly and completely, there should've never been an Alien3, and if you want proof: Watch this, absorb it, love it and then view just the first few minutes of Alien3 to prove it should never had been filmed.I digress; this is about the masterpiece Aliens. It's not just one of the, if not thee, best sequels ever, it's a perfect film in its own right. Much like what Cameron's ex-Linda Hamilton did to transform an already good character, Sarah Connor, into excellence (from The Terminator to Terminator 2: Judgment Day,) Sigourney Weaver also blossomed her already good character of Ellen Ripley into an Academy Award nomination (she should've won.)Beyond her awesome performance, Aliens is pitch perfect in all other categories: mind-blowing cinematography, sets, landscaping and special effects, excellent and eerie score, completely believable acting and dialogue, suspense, drama, action, adventure, science fiction, comedy (thanks, Bill "Game Over, Man!" Paxton,) the human touch, etc. etc.I can't literally express on how this movie works everywhere.There are those out there that state the movie Alien is the best science fiction movie ever and the best in this series. I wholeheartedly disagree. Alien was the warm up for the real deal. It set the stage and introduced the characters and setting, though it was enormously toned down and 134% slower, comparatively speaking, but still: Alien gave us enough to want 10x more. And Mr. Cameron and the rest of the excellent cast & crew delivered 50x more.Stuck asleep in a cryogenic tube in deep space for 57 years (or so we're told in a dream sequence, I'm guessing we have to believe she was told that awake at some point,) alien-survivor Ripley is rescued and brought back to Earth. Incredibly, well, maybe not  we're dealing with humans here, she's blamed solely on destroying a multimillion dollar ship in order to destroy an alien no one on Earth heard scream.She's really screwed up: she's having chest-breaking nightmares, she's been demoted to working grunt jobs and she's concerned about colonists who just happened to be on the same rock where Ripley and her deceased crew intercepted the fateful signal that unleashed the first alien. Again: Humans.Now, she's coerced into returning to the lion's den, in one of the most believable reasons in movie history to get the original movie's stars back for more. In most lame sequels, you can all but see dollar signs in the original actor's eyes when they stumble back in for some more torture.She's quite suspicious, uneasy and doesn't even trust the tough marines that follow her in a rescue mission to save the colonists who failed to (surprise) report in.When they get to their (mostly final) destination, it's up to everyday woman Ripley to attempt to knock sense into the otherwise senseless brute force called soldiers. Without much time lapsing, they learn and pretty fast that, though one alien is badass and hard to take on, 600 are simply impossible. Much like the aliens are really larger versions of ants, it's relevant to say it would be easier for snail to escape an ant attack.Pretty much, I've given you the set up. There's so much more in this movienamely from the new characters  remember everyone but one died in #1? Oops, spoiler for anyone starting with just this one  and their back stories. Such as the lone/young survivor Newt (Henn,) the possibly corrupt android Bishop (Henriksen) who will become a staple for the series, the after-series, and elevate his movie status from simple B-movies and the personification of "The Company" Carter Burke (Reiser.)Did I mention there's a special guest in the closing? Well, if you haven't seen this, but undoubtedly have seen Avatar, you'll see where Cameron got all his ideas from. Unfortunately for this next generation, the exceeding advanced Aliens proved to have not only one of the most fantastic, exciting and suspenseful conclusions on record, it really blew anything Avatar produced out of Pandora. On a related note, I remember Aliens's premiere on local TV and I was blown away they allowed the word "bitch" in the famous "Get away from her, you bitch!" line to still be said. And that must've been the downfall of America, right, right-wingers?AnywaysI can't say enough about one of my all time favorite films. If the original theatre version is still in your collection or that's all Netflix will carry, disregard or eliminate it from your queue. Sure, the Special Edition, the one you should see, is longer, but the motivations behind Ripley are more clearly defined and there's a cool shoot-'em-up scene that might be irrelevant, but fun to watch nonetheless.Weaver put everything into this role, made the entire experience come together and more accessible to a wider audience as I am aware most women's idea for movie night doesn't include the space-alien genre. This was thee video game movie to watch before video games became as real as they are today. This is real filmmakingnot the horrid CGI generation of today.
Granted, I was only phive when Phantasm was releasedbut it equally took me phive times to finally see this mess of a movie.I've heard so much about this, and even saw Phantasm II first, when it was released 9 years later. (They like to say 10, but who's counting.) But every time I tried to watch the original, the opening not only failed to grab me, it literally bored me. Weirded me out. And it was probably only partially due to it being sooo dated.So, quite frankly, I'm not joking when I say it did take me phive, er, five times to finally force myself through this. I'm not happy I did.Some might consider this a "classic" or "true horror" and I say phooey! Wow. That one actually worked.Despite the few advantages the film had, such as creating a menacing funeral director and his stress ball or the fairly effective score, the low-budget movie was just all over the place. It was as if they invented it as they filmed it. I could hear them say: "Let's throw in goblins!" and "Oh, that's coolbutwhat about a killer flying-sphere?" (Though you'll have to wait for part III to learn more about the ball, their initial explanation, at least to themselves, probably went: "Oh, if we haven't lost the audience by now, they'll simply be amazed at the FX! Look, it's killing, drilling, draining and no strings! Awesome, dude!")After a funeral of a family member, the younger brother, Mike (Baldwin) observes a tall man, named appropriately, The Tall Man (Scrimm) lift a casket he couldn't possibly. Oh, and then there's some little (Star Wars) Jawas scrambling about.Naturally  and that's where the realism ends  this disturbs Mike. Nevertheless, he still follows around big brother, Jody (Thornbury) in fear he'll leave him much like his parents, who died previously.I'm just gonna fast-forward here, because the movie really is a trip, as in drug-induced experience. Mike has to convince brother and Ice Cream Man Reggie (Bannister)  yeah, an ice cream man who's more interested in saving a young boy thannever mind  that something's up at the mortuary and he does. After a little investigating, the evil thugs, that comes in all shapes and spheres, attack at will, whenever, wherever.This should be labeled as the first live-action Mike in Wonderland movie because whoever made this was seriously tripping. And if one were to follow it coherently and agree it's a well made film, is equally using. Eh, to each his or his own, and I have no problem with horror flicks that make up their own sense of reality and rules, but when you consistently break them, make new ones, and fade in/out of the real worldI just find it uneven and sloppy writing.And don't get me started on the unanswered, incoherent and literal out-of-this-world revolution in the finale. Simply put: they wrote themselves into a corner and felt this was the only way to explain everything, as if apologizing for writing something that even Stephen King, on his most strung out day of old, would say: "WTF!?"
Hollywood needs to produce more G-Rated, Family-Friendly fare as You're Next.I am a sucker for real horror, i.e. things that can happen or have solid enemies vs. ghost stories. I think I avoided this home-invasion horror because the advertisements seemed a little: The-Strangers-ask-Would-You-Rather-Trespass-or-Purge? and I am done with unoriginal concepts.Mercifully, I finally gave it a shot (to the end of the film) because for about the first 80% of the film I thought I had it pegged as I've seen these movies over and over again. I was wrong and the twisted (or realistic?) ending had me loving the movie as a whole. In fact, it's been about a month since I've seen it and I cannot wait to see it again.Yes, it is a home invasion movie, sort of. Yes, it does involve ludicrous masks and an age-old plot  once discovered. But, it does have a KICK ASS Heroine of this Horror. The likes we haven't seen since 1984's A Nightmare on Elm Street  which this does borrow heavily from.Basically a richer than rich family settles down to dinner in the typical cell-free outskirts home and all hell breaks loose as someone/people attempt to kill them one-by-one. Why? Well, you'll learn that soon enough. By whom? Again, that's coming, too.The real joy is journeying alongside our heroine and hope she makes it out alive.Give it a chance. Try and figure it out. Even if you do, just sit back and love it like I did with our heroine and her creative ways.Like slasher horror? Things that could actually happen and not spooky ghost tales? This is one for you. Or, as they say, you're nextin line to see this.* * * Final thoughts: Personally, I really did like the film, but AJ Bowen really added the eye candy I needed throughout. I wish more horror movies would have hunks like him to give us, the selected few, who enjoy real men and not just the poster boys they all think we only like.
Oh, God, this movie, Fright Night Part 2 (or II as some sources say) was a mess.From the already pointed out mismanaging of the sequel #, to lame and irrelevant bowling jokes, to the once awesome Peter Vincent reversing his belief in vampires only to remember at the appropriate time, to the lame excuse to get (SOME of) the original stars backthis movie was a tragedy to those who loved part one. Like me.When I was a kid, I loved the original Fright Night and didn't really get into going to see as many movies as I could, on my own and mostly at the dollar theatre, until I was about 15ish. And coincidentally, both my movie-outing and this film were in 1989. Surprisingly, I wasn't as much a critic back then: I loved going to the movies, action and horror were my favorite, didn't matter about plot, depth or characterizations  I just loved entertainment. And stillI hated this movie.Really quickly, let's explore the wonderful plot: Charley Brewster has moved on from his encounter with his neighbor/vampire of years past through therapy and college. He's got a new girlfriend and the infamous Peter Vincent friend he ignores. Well, SHOCKING, Peter's new neighbors are vampires and maybe a werewolf, though that's not really explored. This time around, Charley is slowly  and weirdly  becoming one of the undead. Too much a spoiler on why, but the reason is just as boring as this slow paced, barely recognizable sequel, is.Yeah, I'm aware they produced countless horror films in the 1980s and multiple that by five for the number of horror sequels. A lot hit, mostly miss. This is the latter. There's absolutely no reason to see this follow-up. The first classic is simply sufficient.
Let's start with, I LOVED Part III a lot. So this unlikely follow-up due to the poor box office of the third one would really have to show a lot to take over as the best Mission: Impossible entry.My God, was Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol fantastic. Excellent, even. Funny, adventurous, real, exciting, thrilling and a movie I am dying to see again are just a few emotions I had when I left the theatre. Best Action of the Year doesn't quite sum it up. (Of course, we're talking the worst action-film year in history, so let's say, it's the best action movie since the last Bourne film and James Bond's Casino Royale.)If you will see this movie, your mission, choose you to accept the alternative  jail time for not seeing it, is to see it in IMAX. And no worries, mercifully, it's not in 3D. The whole movie looks brilliant on the extra-tall screen, but if just one scene will convince you, it's from the trailer: Hunt (Tom Cruise) scaling the World's Tallest Building: the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. That alone is worth the entire ticket price.Funny about that scene, during super-spy Hunt's accent and decent outside the 130th floor, they say (and show) a gigantic "Dust Storm" is approaching. My roommate and I, who both live near Phoenix, AZ were like: "Eh, it's just a Haboob. No biggie. Go inside, wait it out and wash your car the next day."I usually give a synopsis with my reviews. It's just better not to. Let them surprise you. It's a fully action-packed, almost from beginning to end, spy thriller. Let them tell you the story, the twists, the suspense and allow yourself to feel what they feel. Trust me, this is a ride you'll want to take a few times. I know I'm going back to IMAX as soon as possible.Don't wait for video or Netflix. Don't see the smaller big-screen version. And don't remember your distaste of Tom Cruisewhich, by the way, I never had. See this movie ASAP in IMAX. One of the best of 2011.
As ifyou haven't seen this 1990s classic, you should now.Back in the mid to upper 1990s, I first saw Clueless and as much as I laughed hard and thoroughly enjoyed it, I knew right then, as fresh as it was, it was going to be a dated movie. Fast forward 18 years, and it's  totally!  still enjoyable, but I agree with my original thought.So, I can see someone saying that it's dated nowadays, especially kids, or anyone that missed it back then. Luckily, I caught it new and still love it just as much.Normally, I hate to be around or watch either bimbos or mimbos, but I had a feeling this movie wasn't glorifying them; instead, they were severely mocking them. But, when the very talented (at least for this role) Alicia Silverstone can play someone with less than half a brain and selfish and yet, contains a full heart, I admire the movie  and her performance  even more.Totally Valley Cher (Silverstone) and her pal, Dionne, spend their time: using up their rich family's money by incessantly shopping, grouping fellow high school kids into segregations and occasionally caring about "the lesser and unfortunate" people, which, in real life, have more going for them than 3 of both Cher and Dionne combined. But, this is a slapstick kind of comedy, so let's try not to get too deep.The first half of the movie is just one example after the next of perky Cher and her high zest in life and an actual "second movie" appears when the ultrathin plot is revealed: Cher's outward appearance doesn't match her insides. She wants companionship and the movie tries to convey that with little success, but enough to give the movie a slight spark of a conflict. It's the second half where the film, unfortunately, loses a little steam and overstays its welcome a bit.All of that doesn't matter; Clueless is not really just that. In a lot of ways, it's brilliant, absolutely hilarious, contains fantastic secondary characters and has both some enormously quotable lines and very funny scenes. Not to mention, the incredible soundtrack that I recall buying immediately following my first viewing. While I like practically every song on the album, Kids in America, the opening title song to the motion picture, is one of my all time movie favorite songs.Since I was part of the pack that saw this before it became passé, I believe it still holds up today and it was great to revisit a lot of the scenes, lines and songs I grew up loving. See it, gurl!Side Note: Oh, and Paul (Rudd): I had a huge crush on you back then, and still today. You look so young here, at 26, even though you haven't seemed like you've aged much since. Many people credit this as your first movie, but I knew better  I first noticed, and fell head over heels for you, in the atrocious Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. Waitoh, that's why you want people to believe this is your first role. Good call.Side Note II: As many lines in this I still quote today, this was my first introduction to the phrase "A Friend of Dorothy," which means, um, "Not a Fan of Hustler." I died laughing hearing that for the first time, even though it was obvious to whom they were referring to as such in the movie. Maybe, Cher was, in fact, Clueless. Um. Maybe?
For every one problem with Twister, there are approximately two positives. It was predictable, but original (how many feature length films involve tornadoes throughout?) and exciting. It had clichéd characters, but it had very good acting (Hunt) and believable actions. It had the typical love triangle you'll see in the majority of disaster movies but it put a, well, twist that it was finally the girl (Hunt) chasing the boy (Paxton.)  That last one I loved the most. FINALLY, the girl was at fault as males always seem to be the wrong ones in movies.I absolutely suspended my disbelief (and knowledge as I'm not a storm chaser, nor have little to zero knowledge on the subject) for Twister. I just sat back and enjoyed, as I do for a lot of disaster movies. (SEE: Dante's Peak.) It helps that Hunt's performance was convincing, had depth and interesting. Also, the CGI was well done (for the most part) and believable. Again, I'm not a storm chaser or meteorologist, so I have no idea how many they would just "stumble" upon, though I would have my suspicions it seriously wouldn't be this many. (ADD: dramatic effect.)Bill (Paxton) left his storm chasing life, crew and wife, Jo (Hunt) a while back and (literally) settled for a quieter weatherman's life with therapist, Dr. Reeves (Gertz.) It's barely a coincidence that he shows up with the divorce papers for Jo who decisively left a signature blank on the last page at the peak of the largest (to date) outbreak of tornadoes. Part chasing her with Dr. Reeves in tow, part chasing the twisters is pretty much the rest of the drama. (Aside from him learning where he needs to be, Jo getting over childhood fears and a loved one & dog in trouble, that is.) They moved fairly quickly onto what the movie really drew the audiences in, obviously multiple twisters and more obviously, they got progressively worse, or F1-F5s, until the climax.To me, despite the fact it's hard to believe all these storms were perfectly places all but directly in their paths, it's a lot more believable than all the preposterous and simultaneous events in 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow. It's just a fun show. They throw in comedy ("Cow!") and fully uses the always impressive character actor, Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Throw in a very good score and great soundtrack, you'll have a great time. (Love Van Halen's Humans Being, Goo Goo Dolls's Long Way Down and Alison Krause's Moments Like This.) Definitely, a must see.
Lucky me. A couple of months ago, I got to experience the entire BEFORE trilogy and not have to wait 18 years to reach the (possible) end.When Before Midnight was released in summer 2013, I had a full day of BEFORE movies and was pleasantly pleased.The first, Before Sunrise, is the only one I'd seen before. A long, long time ago. I really did like it back then, and with this second viewing, I still admired it and loved how it holds up today, 18-years-later. I absolutely loved the dialogue, the originality and especially the camera following these two strangers who were destined to be with each other.The movie starts with the unlikely pairing of an American on holiday in Europe who meets his instant attraction, a French student. Both are on a train, but with different stops and yet, he convinces her to debark with him in Vienna. For one solid day/evening/morning, they literally walk and talk and get to know each other. Of course, they fall in love  so much so, that the "lust" they thought they knew was relevant at first, wasn't that at all. These two were meant to be together.It takes balls for Director and Writer Richard Linklater to pull off a 105 minute movie based solely on walking and talking and only truly starring two unknowns, buthe pulled it off. The dialogue was crisp, the connection and charisma was present and the originality of such a basic, yet deep, film was refreshing.People in real life only dream about this kind of chance encounter. This may be fantasy, but it's one that many, including myself, would yearn our whole lives for. If you don't get the sense of true love, true connection and true meaning upon the finale of this film, you might want to restart the film.I did laugh, I did admire and I did fall in love with these two. I even loved the ambiguous climax. This was a love story that you'd love to read in a great novel and cherish every moment.Finally, I loved the simplicity of this film. Kudos to Linklater for such a great experiment that worked. If there were no sequels, which are certainly very good on their own, I would be okay with how this movie can stand alone.
I admit my knowledge of Woodstock is limited to knowing where & when it took place, a few of the bands that played, the impact it had, the multiple numbers in the crowd, the drug usage and nudity (freedom) and the antiwar crowds. So, basically, what I could read about it. The background, the set-up or how they got it all together never crossed my mind, or interested me in the least. But this film stars Martin, Dano and Hirsh  three I happen to like a lot and was directed by Lee, the mastermind behind the gorgeous Brokeback Mountain, The Ice Storm, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Wedding Banquet.Taking Woodstock was directed by Lee? Shrug, I guess he was also the man behind the original Hulk. I just don't think this was a "powerful," "grand," "mind-blowing" or even "intriguing" movie as the others mentioned. (No, I'm not referring to Hulk, though I would watch that one again before this one again.) I will say this, as a self-proclaimed ignorant party on the background of Woodstock, it was an interesting twist to show a movie from the POV of a nobody who all-but saved Woodstock instead of the usual stock footage or straight up documentary.Comedian Martin plays a gay Jewish son, Elliot, of his two parent's rundown motel in the middle of nowhere. He attempts to help them remain afloat, despite his enormously nagging and mostly annoying mother all-but pushes him away. He's also the head of the town's council and helps with permits. In comes an old acquaintance, Michael (Groff) who lost the rights to the Woodstock festival in a neighboring town and Elliot convinces them to play there.Chaos ensures as the town rages against Elliot and the hippies that are to come. Some kooky characters arrive, including one of the worst looking drag queens of all time (Schreiber.) I guess the movie's about Elliot finding himself (amongst all the disorder within the family and town) and coming out of the closet.There were a few funny moments and Groff does a decent job. But overall it's just a ho-hum movie. I guess if you're really into the history of the event Woodstock was, you might be interested.
While the world was a fan of Lord of the Ringleader or Harry Pothead, I clung to the Chronicles of Narnia movies. After all, I idolized (just one of the) book(s) as a kid: The Lion, The Witch & the Wardrobe.I both read the book and watched the British cartoon. I never went past that chapter (of seven?) but I am still very fond of that and when the modern-day first movie came out, I loved it. I even liked part II: Prince Caspian.Despite my liking of the first two movies and the chance they wouldn't make a third chapter, due to studio battles over box-office, I skipped #3: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (TVOTDT) in the theatres. (PAT ON BACK) I just saved some money.While visually stunning, and I mean: this CGI-heavy sequel was TOP NOTCH, the story sucked, the dumbed down plot/moral and almost complete lack of action/war scenes (you'd find fun in the first two) made this a tedious "adventure." In fact, I'd just call it a chapter of a series you can't wait to get past to get on with the series.One of the biggest problems I find, and again, this is coming from someone who hasn't read all the books, is that the original author, C.S. Lewis, apparently wrote himself into a corner with the stipulation: no one over a certain age can enter the land of Narnia.I enjoyed the four brothers/sisters together in the original two movies. They all fit and had great chemistry together. Here, in TVOTDT, only the weaker of the four, Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) are allowed into the magical land leaving behind the superior brother and sister duo: Susan (Anna Popplewell) and Peter (William Moseley.) Ho-hum. And it wouldn't be so bad, but they introduced another young boy, Eustace (Will Poulter) that will undoubtedly be the "next generation" of Narnia-adventurers in the future installments. HE WAS SOOO ANNOYING, not to mention hard to understand with such a thick English accent.That's neither here nor there, in regards to the dialect, he was just so unfun to watch and I'm stopping here (with TVOTDT) so I don't have to see more of himand especially less of the more interesting children.The basic plot (and its basic  it's really for the G-rated audience) revolves around Lucy, Edmund and brat Eustace thrown into Narnia after the war (featured in parts one and two) is over, but there's an evil presence that's stealing people.There's a mystery involved with that, a large ship that just sails around and a fantastic mouse named Reepicheep (voiced very nicely by Simon Pegg) who should appear in the Shrek franchise, but does just fine here as the swashbuckling teacher to Eustace.Gone is the big battle scenes and in comes the "heart" and "message" from the Lion (once again, voiced by Liam Neeson.)This movie is for (incredibly) die-hard fans of the books and not necessarily for "new" (like me) fans of the movies. It's sad, though. I am a huge CGI-hater, and this movie contains some of the most breathtaking CGI-effects I've seen. Too bad they wasted it on a movie that should've gone straight to Bluray.
Scent of a Woman is one of those rare movies that I will spend years apart from viewings and fall all over in love with it once it begins again.This beautiful  no, creation  film had so many attributes, it's hard to sum them all up in one review. So many, that this film could be studied as part of a film class's curriculum. It would be easy to just compliment the cinematography, score, dialogue, originality, deep comedy that holds up more than 20 years from its original release, suspense, dramatic themes, depth and character spot on interactions. And while all of those were absolutely astonishing in this fantastic film and each could be dissected in said film class, my favorite aspects of this film are Pacino's iconic role, the remaining acting and the big finale.I used to think that the Oscar Pacino won for this role was a "pity" one since both he's had plenty (more than, actually) of extremely fine performances prior and the Academy does, in fact, do that, which is a wrong move. But, taking aside all his previous excellence, he was above and beyond great here as recently blinded Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade.While he had me both cracking up and witnessing greatness, the rest of the cast was also very good, namely Chris O'Donnell's quiet, but deep teen role and a just-noticed-by-me Phillip Seymour Hoffman.And finally of my favorites, and one I hope to completely memorize one day  I have about 80% of it down, is the big, climatic showdown. I've already listened to it so many dozens of timesthat it's hard not to shout out at the screen line by line of what Frank is preaching. (I did, this time too. I had to reverse back to enjoy it without my own interrupting.) Now, I don't 100% agree with Frank, or Charlie's stance  if you hadn't seen this by now, I will not spoil it  but Frank's passion and drive and Charlie's uncompromising ethics made me stand behind them one hundred percent.Besides all that, it was a fantastically written scene of heart, humor and depth. It ranks up there with Jack Nicholson's A Few Good Men courtroom scene and Pacino's own The Devil's Advocate's Devilish finale speech.The movie breaks into two separate story lines: One involves angry ex-military Frank Slade and his free spirit bucket list in NYC and prep-school on a scholarship teen Charlie Simms's dilemma on whether or not to rat out fellow students.Charlie reluctantly accepts a "babysitting" job of caring for Frank over Thanksgiving so he can earn the plane fare to see his parents over Christmas. Only, he didn't know the "easy money" would require chasing blind Frank all over New York City and beyond.The movie's hilarious, touching and makes me emotional every time I watch it. I laugh hard on the lines, marvel on how imperfect Frank is but we still believe in everything he says and enjoy the crisp scenery and movement of the story. Truly, this is one of my all-time favorites.
Ohmy'Stan Helsing' is just a plain, awful mess. It's completely unfunny, uninteresting and unbelievably stupid. There is not one moment of humor, and when they try and set up a "joke," it's already seen coming a mile away. It's hard to describe how bad this was, but I will try: It would be more fun to watch paint dry, listen to keys stuck in a running garbage disposal for an hour or bungee jump without the bungee cord. It's equally hard to describe the plot. Again, I will try: boy-wonder, Stan, commonly mistaken for the original "Van Helsing" (Ha, ha, ha, that is so funny  no seriously, it was so funny, you will hear that joke 2 dozen times) and his gang are off to a Halloween party, but get detoured when Stan has to drop off videos. On this comical (sorry, I cannot lie, make that sobering) journey they meet the Garbage Pail Kid's versions of Freddy, Michael, Leatherface, Chucky and Jason. A lot of the time when I dislike a movie, I can safely say, "well, to each their own, someone's gotta find value in this." For this piece of trash, I will confidently say: "STAY AWAY. DO NOT RENT OR WATCH, EVEN FOR FREE. EXORCISE THIS ABOMINATION." Am I being too harsh? Well, anyone that didn't adhere to my warning, you tell me. Please also tell me how this got green-lit? It couldn't be the sad Leslie Nielsen cameo. It couldn't be the producers even though people remembered who "Van Helsing" was  this is like spoofing '13th Warrior' now in 2009. All of the actors looked amazed they had jobs, though they honestly shouldn't  their lines appeared to have been read seconds before the shot. This jumped quickly to the top 10 worst I've ever seen.
Okay, fine. I'll admit Westerns are my least favorite genre. I chose to review this one, Unforgiven, as my final of my "I Love the 90s!" special review series as not only did I love this movie and that it made a huge impact on me, but it opened my eyes to the world of the Western. It taught methey, too, can be well made.I always like to get what I don't like about movies out of the way first. Only two this time, thankfully. The PACING is sooo.slow. And the line "I ain't going back to the way I was," or the like, was used roughly 12+ times.I will both criticize these two bothersome attributes and defend them. I didn't like how the pacing was at a snail's speedyet, I think it was necessary for the time it was portraying. In the movie's defense, this is how time was. It wasn't paced with the current I-Phone or the Droid X. It was in tune with the dust devils and people liked it that way back then. Heck, I might like it toned down to finally enjoy life.#2: that line by William Munny (Eastwood) was repeated multiple times, both by Munny and his peers. Obviously, it's done as a "premeditation." Fine, that might be a spoiler, but it's an obvious conclusion as whether Bella will choose Jacob or Edward. (I promised myself I'll never use a Twilight reference, but I thought it fit here.)Okay, on with the movie. Unforgiven is NOT my favorite Western, but it's damn near close. It has awesome acting, superior cinematography, fantastic lines (aside from the aforementioned "ain't" line repeated) and an incredible story with excellent characters. Take the sheriff, Little Bill (Hackman) who's bad, but has reasoning behind his badness. And Munny, himself, who was bad, and must make money (no coincidence there in reference to his name) to support his post-killer lifestyle and his (now) motherless children.Here's the synopsis: a female prostitute is cut up bad and is aided by her slutty peers in a reward to murder her attackers. Sheriff Little Bill actually does try to make amends, but it isn't good enough for either the "owner" of the whore, or the scandalous ladies so they seek revenge.Ex-Murderers Munny and ex-partner Ned Logan (Freeman) join thrill-seeking Schofield Kid (Woolvett) to gain more in their pocket book with the "right motives" this time. But, Little Bill has plans of domination of the town and a travelling writer.There's a lot more and I would encourage everyone to be as surprised as I was while watching this, time and again.The scenery is crisp, gorgeous, in fact, and it's a wonderful reunion of the Western and Mr. Eastwood that has long since abandoned both the genre and his career. If this wasn't the career rebirth (i.e. Travolta in Pulp Fiction) of the century  SEE: all of his accomplishments since, I don't know what one is.Everyone acted extraordinary in this piece, but Freeman and Hackman stood out. Even though, I'm not a follower of the genre, I loved this movie. SEE IT!
Wow, if you're a fan of late 1970s and early 1980s horror films, you'll love the homage played out in Cabin Fever. Not to mention those pesky virus/infected movies in addition to cabin in the woods horror flicks. This movie has practically every cliché involving those horrors of days/decades past.And it's gruesome. Bloody. Gross. Weird. Somewhat funny. Pancake! It's the usual suspects: graduating buddies, 2 girls, 3 dudes head off to a cabin for a week. We have the sympathetic weakling of a man: Paul (Strong), the dumb jock: Bert (DeBello  and on a side note, personally the cutest, yet dumbest of the group), the Preppy: Jeff (Kern), the sex-crazed: Marcy (Vincent) and the innocent: Karen (Ladd.) Wait  did I just describe The Breakfast Club? Perhaps, but this is one of hundreds of movies this imitates.The Scooby-Gang immediately encounter the normal hillbillies stereotypes (SEE: Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or any Wrong Turn-Type movie) at the normal general store before hitting up their cabin. Soon after, they encounter both a druggie and dog (M.D.) in tow and a very sick, blood-infested male that Bert inadvertently shot with a BB gun earlier in his manly-man-macho act of killing "gay" squirrels. Nevertheless, the very-ill man needs help and appears to be attacking them. The group accidentally destroys their only set of wheels and sets him on fire to, well, shoo him away. And it works...for the most part.The guilty conscious they experience is nothing to the disease one of them encounters. Without any transportation, they (strangely) place the infected in a disgusting barn and that member getsworse."Cabin fever" does set in, and they begin to turn on each other, meet the striking locals and come up with individual and "unique" ways to deal with their predicament.The movie is very original even though dealing with a hundred of movie references, including Night of the Living Dead, Evil Dead and even Donnie Darko (speaking of which  love the end credit's tribute to this), just to name a few more. It's crazy at times (SEE: The Pancake Pounce and The Mile High Sex Club at Ground Level) but it's worth checking out, especially, again for those sick and twisted horror fans of the 1980s, like myself.Side & Final Note: (Spoiler) Despite the "how could it end any other way" finale, that I actually liked in this feature, it would be nice, for once, it wouldn't actually conclude and not leave open for a sequel. I've seen every Living Dead film (to date) and it's always the same. I understand the theme of the movie, but aside from the movie Outbreak, it rarely ends on a positive, "WE BEAT IT!" conclusion.That said, it's an appropriate climax to the overall feel of the movie. As it's really not marketed as a "Feel-Good" movie, is it?
Wow. Do I have to mention to my reader(s) or friends or peers that I am not a sports fan, let alone boxing fan?YetI LOVED the following: Million Dollar Baby, Rocky (yeah, including part VI) and even Diggstown. Does Fight Club count? Or The Wrestler, even though it's technically not about boxing?But I didn't love The Fighter. Sure it was genuine in its surroundings and characters (SEE: Winter's Bone) and those, I believe, drove the movie to better than average (for most  me, just to average.) Like the mother, Melissa Leo as Alice Ward. She was great. Or the brother, Dicky (Bale) who was also a phenomenal creation.Beyond the wonderfully thought out characters and actors, I was literally bored for most of the sports scenes. Even the workout shots. With the exception of the finale that absolutely didn't let you know one way or the other on how this will pan out.The story goes: aging no-ambition boxer Micky's (Wahlberg) trying for a comeback with the aid of his rednecked mother/manager Alice and druggie older brother, Dicky. When they continue to bring him down, he (RIGHTFULLY) turns to outsourcing and does, in fact, start an upward climb in the ring.Naturallymeaning, no spoiler here  it is based on a true story, as alwayshe can't leave his family back, no matter how bad they are. So they regroup and things go as you might expect. Well, except for the finale.Honestly, I wasn't impressed in the overall product. Sure, it's well made. Leo did a great job and some are stating so did Bale. He did, and probably will win (FINALLY!) the Oscar. But to me, throughout, it was basic and by the numbers with no heartfelt moments. Nothing like when I watched Million Dollar Baby or Rocky. I can't even see past the blah film to credit such fine performances. Even the music was mismatched with the scenes.Finally, it's not necessary a movie to skip this Oscar season. But, it's not gonna rock any boats. It's simply just a movie to see. You won't take anything from it, unless you're marking it off your list of Best Picture nominations to see before the big night. And if Bale wins, kudos to him. I just wish he won for something more deserving, such as American Psycho or The Machinist when the Oscars were used to snubbing him. In fact, if they give it to him in pity, as they do, I'll be ashamed I actually watched such sell outs.
My parents actually took me to see Lethal Weapon 2 in what still consider the greatest summer movie season of all time: 1989. I hadn't seen the original but you absolutely don't need to; this incredibly stand-alone sequel tells you everything you need to know about the two leads, Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover) in the very first 15 seconds.I was absolutely blown away from the get-go and planted at the edge of my seat in the theatre the entire screening. Now, 21 years later and probably that many, or more, viewings, I'm still on the edge of my seat with excitement and awe in this fantastic film. In fact, this recent time I watched it, all the magic (SEE: Movie Poster) was back and I couldn't help but clap in the closing on how much fun I had for the 21st time watching it.A lot of films advertise the multiple number of improvements in sequels in reference to the # in the series. For example, 2x The Action, Three times the Suspense, etc. This one, if I recall, did that obligatory: 2x times the action, 2x the comedy, 2x the fun, or something like that. Though I liked the original Lethal Weapon, this did take everything to the next level. In fact, they elevated the magnitude of all that was right in the first one not by 2 but by ten.Though Pesci (Leo Getz) is a great and comedic addition to the gang (though no matter how many times I've seen this, I still can't follow his "laundering money" speech) with such classic lines like "They F**K you at the drive-thru. *Repeat*," nothing beats the original members. Gibson is on top of his career as the rejuvenated "lethal weapon" from the first installment and Glover just goes along beautifully for the ride. You can sincerely see both having a blast, as if when they're laughing on screen and Director Donner yells cut, they continue rolling in laughter.The boys are back in L.A., this time researching the mysterious cougarans and the racist South African diplomatic immunity protected baddies while babysitting a state witness, Getz. The three cause city-wide chaos, uncover a mystery left open in the first Lethal Weapon and Riggs "getz" some. No, not with Pesci.Throw in some political statements (SAVE THE DOLPHINS!) which I literally hate when I see them either obviously or subliminally inserted in this series, and that's it. Really.I've heard that they had some "rough outline" of the script and the Director let the actors mostly improvise. So be it; this movie was hilarious, action-packed, deep, well paced, starts with a bang and ends on a justifiably tearful note. From beginning to climax, it's just one incredible scene after another and the writer/director knew enough when to give us a break, but not for too long  just enough to get ready for more excitement/humor.Oh, and the score's great, the soundtrack's wonderful: George Harrison's "Cheer Down," The Beach Boys's "Still Cruisin' (After All These Years)" and Eric Clapton's "Knockin' On Heaven's Door" are three of my all time favorites for movie music, the acting and even the over-the-top at times action sequences are believable and the lines were classic. 21 years later, I find myself quoting this movie, and most people I speak them to, know exactly what I am referring to, or can finish it for me. Such as the "They F**K you" and my friends will fill in the "at the drive-thru!" or "Whatever Leo wants" "Leo Getz. Get it?" This is a MUST-SEE for any fans of the action-comedy and is the ultimate buddy-cop film. Two decades later, it holds up beautifully today as if it were just made.Side Note: Later in 1989, or perhaps in early 1990, I only owned three videocassettes that I watched over and over and over, well, because they were the only three I had. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Lethal Weapon 2 were my very first two, followed closely by Batman. So, I did watch and rewatch the second installment of Lethal Weapon multiple times, even without seeing the first until years later. Heck, I don't think I saw part one until after the third one came out in theatres. I was a tad bit disappointed in the original, only in reference to seeing all the action and comedy of part two whereas the first was more of a serious take on the "lethal weapon" Riggs. Nevertheless, part one's still good, butLethal Weapon 2 is a classic.Side Note 2: The only other times that comes to mind where the first installment is really good and the follow-up sequel tops in spades: Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II and Aliens.
Not 2 Much Maybe I'm losing my "grip" but I actually had fun with 2 Fast 2 Furiousthe final Fast & Furious installment I had yet to see.Even though it's #2, I skipped over it when I was disgusted with the first movie/remake. Somehow, I watched The Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift  perhaps because I like Asians. Ah-hem. And I know why I specifically watched the fourth film: Fast & Furioussimply for a laugh. And boydid I shed tears in laughter on how bad it was.As corny as this movie was, as badly acted, scripted and predictable it wassurprisingly, it was suspenseful, exciting and exactly what it needed to be. Much like 2010's Piranha 3D, it gave the audience all it wanted: fast and supped up cars, pretty girls with muscular dudes, an obvious bad-dude (this one, however, uses a rat (??) for torture) and lotza money up for criminal hands. It doesn't lie to the audienceand believe it, I respect that.This is why I rated Piranha 3D so high. And why I had fun here. If you like what this movie's promoting, you'll certainly have a great time, despite the loss of the series staple: Vin Diesel.Ex-cop (SEE: Part One) Brian's (Walker) trying to make a living off of street-racingand seeing what they're making for 20-or-so-seconds of adrenaline, I can see it as a career. But when he's (all-but immediately) caught for the latest street scene, he's recruited to take down big-time drug dealer.Naturally, Brian brings in his closest childhood chum, Roman (Gibson) who's naturally resistant up front, but agrees to reduce his own sentence by pulling off a grand-racing scheme in Miami. Throw in the clichéd undercover (Mendes) and Brian's feelings, you have the basic plot.The movie heavily relies on predictable races throughout the movie, namely the intro, but during the mid-section as well. And let me assure you: as foreseen as the outcome would/should be, it's still exciting and on-the-edge-of-your-seat fun.Absolutely, I should hate this movie, or even this kind of film. But, I left my brain at the door and despite my obvious predictions, I allowed myself the pleasure of the "joyride" (ha, SEE: Joyride also starring Paul Walker) these characters went through. It's not life changing, nor is it an "excellent" action film, but it's fun. While it creates a wonderful diversion scene  what a wonderful multi-car traffic jam close to the finale, it also shows the Transporter 2 WTF leap in the climax.Even then: sit back, let them do the driving and enjoy one of the best entries in the (soon to be) five-part CGI-laced criminal-car-race series.
I want, want, WANT this technology now!In the meantime, I'll settle for the incredible movie, Her.What started off to me sounding like an unoriginal idea  man falls for inanimate object  was quickly squashed. This brilliant adaptation of real life, but mainly where it's headed, was anything but imitative. And, we're just talking about the premise here; there is so much more to Her than meets the eyeor ear.While I am not a huge Joaquin Phoenix fan, he gives one of his deepest performances, despite that awful mustache. (I wondered how that terrible trend came back in the future, and when I asked myself that, all I could hear is Doc Brown's puzzled voice asking about men's facial hair in the future.) He plays a depressed man so well in this, you'd won't be able to distinguish Joaquin from his counterpart, Theodore.Teddy pulls a Total Recall and due to an ad he sees during his public transportation route, he acquires an A.I., or as they call it here, an O.S. (1) and develops a deep relationship with the O.S. and rightfully so. It's spoken by the sexy voice of the sexy Scarlett Johansson. Of course, all relationships are rocky from time to time, but the ideas presented here and the direction of this mismatched pair is simply wondrous.As was this film as a whole. The score, soundtrack, cinematography and mood were all excellent. I loved how it was shot, breathed and directed. The characters, namely Teddy and OS, Samantha, were so deep, I couldn't take my eyes (or ears) off them and see what they'd do (or say) next.While not a mainstream film, it is a refreshing view on the love story and where we're headedand should be headed by the film's end.I would completely recommend Her.* * * Final thoughts: Yeah, yeah, I pray frequently for the day of the holodeck, but in the interim, this would work. At very least, to tide us over, bring on the sequel more geared towards me: Him. (They can even be clever with the title: Him, Too.)
I know a lot will disagree with me on this, but I am still uncertain that black & white adds depth to either moving or still pictures. And the more I hear "it's called STYLE, Steve!" the more I hear someone too pretentious to listen to anymore.But, there you go: Nebraska, which I think would've been a gorgeously shot film otherwise, was in black & white. Oh, and by the way, I got over it right away. Despite being disappointed in not seeing the lush backdrops of the states our "heroes" occupy in color, I concurred that it was what it was.Every year I attempt to watch all the Best Picture nominees and have been successful for the past decade or more. This year, I had about four left on my list and I barely made it through before show time, or the Oscars telecast. This was not only wasn't high on my list of must-see films, but it was dead last in the nine nominee list.Which is sad. I really did like this movie a lot. It was humorous, original  a quality I seek and most of the other nominees sorely lacked, adventurous at a different level than most "adventures," deep and fun. I loved the characters, the interactions, the tension and the backgrounds of the leads. Also, it all felt a little too real  um, except for the whole black & white deal.Woody won! Or so that's part of the premise. Aging alcoholic Woody takes off, sometimes on foot, to claim his prize he feels he won from an ad in the mail. His son reluctantly  to put it mildly  agrees to aid his pop's journey across a couple of states to get rich somewhat quick.The journey of these two might seem subdued, but the leads keep it lively, especially Will Forte's turn as the son. Definitely recommended.* * * Final thoughts: I can forgive Schindler's List for the reasons they chose and Psycho for the reasons they had to, but if it were up to me, if color did exist and the company could afford to shoot in color, I would always prefer that method.
Coming off the action high, Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol, I yearned to watch another action-packed new-to-me adventure. Upon a great recommendation, I watched Déjà Vu.I am a Denzel fanbut only when he's not screaming for an Oscar (such as American Gangster) and when he actually earns it (such as Training Day.) Of course, my favorite of his are the smart action pics like Man on Fire or Crimson Tide. I'm certainly adding this one to that list.With a unique twist on the time machine/look back in a place in time genre, Déjà Vu does, in fact, make one of my 2011 favorites, Source Code, a Déjà Vu. ATF agent Doug Carlin (Washington) is investigating a blown up boat that killed 100s of innocents, including children, women and service men. He's introduced to a program where one can look back exactly 4½ days to aid in any investigation. Handy, eh?Well, it can do a lot more than that. It can go within any structure and recreate every bit of privacy people have. Tell me how people would react today if this were true?In either case, that's incidental to this plot after a few lessons, Doug's got it down and races against time for a gal he actually falls for prior to the explosion and might contain valuable information to prevent the act of terrorism.It's an exciting, albeit popcorn-fare, movie and if you're a Denzel fan, you'd probably really enjoy it. Even if you're not a (Director) Tony Scott fan, like I am not.
Yeah, they were trying to capitalize on all three: Bourne Series, Taylor Lautner's good looks and the Twilight franchise. It did not work.Abduction was an incredible rip-off and they spent very little time making it a movie on its own. And this was unbelievable with the amount of talent they had signed up for the film, including Sigourney Weaver, Alfred Molina and Maria Bello. No, of course I wasn't talking about the talentless Taylor Lautner.Sure, he's fine to look at, but that should stop at underwear ad poster. He cannot carry a movie and even though he's nowhere near as bad as his Twilight counterparts, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, he's just blah and probably should've just gone into porn.The movie follows Lautner's Nathan as he finds out he's a missing child and wanted for literally stupid reasons. He's thrown into a Goosebumps mystery, but luckily his non-charismatic "father" taught him to fight. How this movie didn't just land on the direct-to-DVD schedule is beyond me. Admittedly, it's been more than a week and a half since I saw this and it has 97% left my brain. It was that unforgettable. So, don't waste your time and abduct a real thriller. Like the Bourne movies this mocks.* * *Final thoughts: I only watched this for that fantastic How Did This Get Made? podcast where they ridicule bad movies. Unfortunately, I actually listened to that episode long ago and before I watched the movie  that was my first and last time doing that. This week, I will re-listen to it to hear their take on this terrible thriller.
I really, really liked the newest Muppet film: The Muppetsin fact it's the best one since the first one. But, that said, I need to get three things out of the way first: Shame on them for using my favorite Muppet of all time, Pepe: The King Prawn, for all-but 30 seconds, the newest center-stage Muppet, Walter, is rather lame and how many Muppet story lines involve them trying to save the theatre? 40?Whew, just had to get those out of the wayThis movie was hilarious and brought back all the memories of people who grew up on the Muppets. And it was so incredibly clean and family-friendly, I'm shocked it didn't earn a G-Rating. (Of course, not everyone felt it was family-friendly, thanks Fox News  http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201112020036.)I digress, once again, the Muppets have dismantled and forgotten until an obvious Muppet by the name of Walter convinces them to save their theatre once again. But, the adventure, heart, songs and traveling to get there is a great ride. And the obligatory cameos were absolutely hilarious  especially Jack Black.I'm a huge Muppet fan, and even then, I was disappointed in a few of their outings. This one is clearly the best since the first one and I sincerely hope to see more.
The most surprising thing about the anti-comedic Jack and Jill was that I didn't hate it. The least surprising thing was that I didn't laugh.Much like a small town with an accused murderer everyone knows and it's tough for a jury not to have a set opinion if the trial doesn't change its venue, it would be even harder not to go into this movie without preconceived notions as this movie has been used as toilet paper by more critics than even Twilight. Still, I try my best to have an open mind and every movie has its fresh slate as it begins.Oh, don't get me wrong, by the end of the film  along with it's terrible bookended "Twin" coming out stories, as if twins are the new gays  I was not pleased either. It sure was awful and all jokes, if you can call them those, appeared to miss the mark by a six-hour flight. It was almost as if they started with the premise "What if we can get Al Pacino play himself and ask the audience why he only has one Oscar" and blindly wrote the script around that.The film had ancient ideas wrapped in clichés and bad characters with even worse dialogue. I'm guessing here, and I think the obvious finale will back me up, we're supposed to care about the obnoxious and sad Jill, but it didn't happen. Make that nothing happened to make us care about anyone. Even Adam Sandler's Jack looked bored, confused and tired thorough.How could he possibly think this was a good idea? Or any of the dozens of cameos? And if I may, I can understand Al Pacino is doing everything (and any project) he can to stay in the limelight, but poor once-great Johnny Depp. I think Johnny just gave up. He said he's made his billions did enough fantastic projects and now will just stop all what made him grand once. (SEE: The Tourist and Pirates 3-4.)The basic plot, and yeah, it's flat-basic, is yearly visitor Jill overstays her unwelcome by her twin, Jack. But, wait! If Jack can get Jill to date Al Pacino, he'll star in a Dunkin Donuts ad and Jack won't lose his biggest client.This micro-thin Three's Company lost episode was sad before it began and it appears even Adam Sandler realized it. The puns were lazy, juvenile  and not in the typical Sandler fashion, I really mean a kid wrote them  and were never said with any conviction. And Al Pacino apparently was repeating his Colonel Frank Slade from Scent of a Woman if he would fall for Jill  she wasn't just obviously ugly outside, she was a beast inside, as well.Some movies are so bad they NEED to be seen, such as The Room, Birdemic: Shock and Terror or Troll 2. Mostly for curiosity reasons. After you read my 10-second plot synopsis, you need not spend another hour and half wasting your way through female Adam Sandler falling down or male Adam Sandler looking more indifferent and sad than frustrated.
I grew up on the Hulk. Let me start over  I grew up on TV's (Bill Bixby's) The Incredible Hulk. Oh, that and Wonder Woman (on TV that is  Superman was my movie hero) were it for me. Glued were my eyes whenever those two superheroes were on the small screen.That said, I had an open mind about the first (of two. Three?) Hulk outing on the big screen knowing that they'd probably revert back to the true legend of the Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde comic book character. Personally, I wanted the big-screen version of the TV show where no one knew who David (not Bruce) was and he was always on the run. But that wasn't in the cards.After watching Ang Lee's 2003's art-house take I had mixed feelings. I knew I wanted to like it more since it was one of my childhood favorites. I even watched it multiple more times in theatres and at home, because that's all I had for a "new" Hulk vs. all the TV reruns. I'm guessing people might have done the same when Star Trek: The Motion Picture was it for trekkers before The Wrath of Kahn came to pass.To this day, eight years after release plus one reboot, I'm still divided. Much like Jar Jar, I hated the father story then, and still do. There's other problems with the movie, but the number one is the complete father story. Eliminate that and it would've been oodles better. Notice: not replace, for it was far too long anyways.Adding in more Hulk burst-outs, heck  have at least one during the first 40 or so minutes and stop that annoying split screen/comic book look could have also aided in the movie's recovery. But these are here nor there, what's done was done.The positives were the casting  Eric Bana was great as Bruce Banner, Jennifer Connelly wonderful as Betty Ross and most of all, Sam Elliott was excellent as her father, General Ross. Also, despite the all-but neon green hulk, he did look real on the screen, for the most part. In addition, whenever he attempted lifting or smashing, it looked pretty darn real to what in my mind would happen. Case in point: when he tries to first lift/break the "gamma" emitting sphere and he hadn't counted on it being too heavy. And, with the tanks  with/without his strength, he would have some problems pulling them apart. These are just two examples of what they got right.Ang Lee admitted prior that he was not a fan and further, never picked up a Hulk comic book. He just wanted to make it from his mind. Sad. I'm not going to produce and star in a Shakespeare play without ever reading it. That's ignorance.And his showed. He tried far too many artsy ideas that normally work in his movies, but not in a COMIC BOOK MOVIE. He got so caught up with making it chichi he forgot his (MINE) fan base. Unless it's a comedy, I don't want to see Pride & Prejudice & Predators.In one of the best scenes, the Hulk is tearing up an underground government lair and at the most inopportune time, Lee reduces visibility with his multiple comic book panels. I was p|ssed and didn't want to pay any attention to what Lee wanted me to see on the screen other than the one that showed the Hulk smashing and prancing about. Lee also went further by switching back and forth between the styles: real time and his cartoonish freeze-frames and "Batman POW!" shots. It was as if he, himself, had little faith in what he was doing.It's not a basic plot  another problem for a COMIC BOOK MOVIE  but here's the quick synopsis: Daddy Banner (I refuse to call him what they named him, let's just say he was played horribly by Nick Nolte) was involved in mysterious experiments and after injecting himself against orders by General Ross, he inadvertently fathers a child who, of course, grows up and out as Bruce Banner.Daddy's locked away, while now-grown Bruce does similar experiments and blunders which triggers a jolly green "angry man" (their name for it, bleahh.) Everyone knows it's Bruce and everyone wants a piece of the green to make, well, more green.From there, it gets pretty over-complicated  again mainly from the Daddy-Issues. Suffice to say, Hulk will make just a few more appearances, some a little too big and even making it into San Francisco.Let me stop there. Much like The Lost World: Jurassic Park, how disappointing was it when you have a real-looking giant (sorry, Godzilla) enter a city for just a few minutes? But, even with the few precious moments we had him in a city setting, the movie absolutely should've ended right there becauseIn one of the worst endings in comic book movie history (or just about any film) come following. I do spill out spoilers in my reviews, but I won't ruin the ending for anybody curious. Suffice to say, one word: RIDICULOUS.Thank God, they did give Hulk another shot five years later  though not much better, but it was a bastard Hulk, thankfully. That's another story. As for 2003's Hulk, eh, give it as least one viewing. As bad as some of the film was, it could've been a lot worse.
First I was shocked to see 2010's Piranha 3D received an 80% on Rottentomatoes.com (to date.) Then after seeing itI was blown away that it actuallydeserved that rating.Sure, I expected silliness, clichés and B-Movie quality including tongue-in-cheek acting and dialogue. The previews didn't hide a thing on what to expect. You will, in fact, get silliness, clichés (every one of them) and tongue-in-cheeks, but if you're into horror/When Animals Attack films of the past, like I am, you will LOVE this movie.In addition, I rate movies higher that don't lie to me, like the recent The Expendables movie did. Like the previews, this movie did not hide one fact of its B-movie genre. It dove directly into all the predictability, all the formulas this type of movie typically portrays and if you can get past the fact this wasn't meant for the Best Picture Oscar and understand that you wouldn't be watching a movie entitled "Piranha 3D" or see the previews without knowing what you're getting yourself into, then sit back and have a great time like I did.Immediately in the film, Matt (Dreyfuss  it's absolutely no coincidence who he's supposed to take after, heck, listen to the song he's singing) is fishin' & drinkin' & soon spinnin' in his boat in Lake Victoria (really Lake Havasu, AZ) following an earthquake that frees thousands of prehistoric piranha.Bad timing for the 100s of tourists of the annual Spring Break water events, as seen on (M)TV. Naturally, there's one Sheriff (Shue) with a minimal police squad to keep the peace. To throw in tension, she has 3 kids whom she commands to stay off the lake (even before she realizes there's more danger than the drunken college kids.) And to round out the main cast, we have a dirty film maker (O'Connell) who exploits women, drugs and minors. Oh, lest I forget, there's the crazy scientist who, of course, can explain what's happening to the audience and who definitely couldn't have been played by anyone else than Doc Brown, himself: Christopher Lloyd.By just reading the previous paragraph and if you've seen any, literally any When Animals Attack films of the 70s and 80s, you can put the pieces together on how all that's gonna pan out. The real fun is the fish in the sea themselves.Believe it or not, the movie contains actually good acting, plausibility to both the creatures and how humans would truly react, tons of suspense, tension and originality in regards to attacks (both by them and us) and surprise when they are supposed to occur. In addition, there are plenty of in-jokes, real jokes and, naturally, a boatload of nudity (yes, also some male) and gore.Damn straight it was gory. And for the most part it was the typical B-Movie gore that I barely blinked, as I had expected it. However, the movie takes a turn in a few scenes that flat out shocked me on how far brutal they made it. Though I do applaud them for taking it to the next level, some scenes were really disgusting  you try walking on that leg, for example.As mentioned there were comedy bits and nudity to balance out the whole homage to the genre. Some were even combined. My favorite scene involved both a fully nude water ballet that had me rolling and my favorite line was, no joke, about a man's member, though the aftermath, while funny, was a little overkill.The obvious climax  let's see, 80% of the film we see young mostly-to-fully nude youths in and out of the water  was impressive, bloody, tension filled and satisfying even though it was expected. I even liked the final few minutes of the film. Again, I knew what was coming, but not the actual revolution.I will say the movie was near perfect for what it was supposed to be, yet, there were a few flaws I couldn't get past. Even at just 89 minutes, the middle dragged a bit. The pacing was just plain annoying in a few scenes that went on far too long, such as the dive to the revealed cave. Sure, they make up for it in the full second half and they gave plenty of attack scenes  some that kept me thoroughly interested because they actually were original in a completely unoriginal movie  so I'm not entirely complaining. And if you think about it, nearly all When Animal Attack films contain a minimum of two to three scenes that slow down and let you catch your breath. So, it's nothing but consistent.As for the two other "problems" I had may not have been the movie's fault. In the screening I saw, the 3D seemed a bit off. I could see extra lines or shadows of some of the objects or people. It didn't happen throughout, but it finally got bad enough, my eyes were actually looking for it. And finally, the marketing gave away a critical scene. I won't ruin it, but suffice to say, since I saw it in the preview, it became more and more evident that this would be either the final scene or damn near it. I was right and shame on them  it's bad enough they spoiled Richard Dreyfuss's cameo, but to give awaywell, I don't want to be guilty of it too.Overall, it's obviously not everyone's cup of tea and though it contains the title of Piranha, and its all-but advertised as a remake/reboot/sequel, it has zero connection to the previous two installments. That said, I doubt I could give you any warning of what you're getting yourself into when you sit down with those Buddy Holly 3D glasses. It's like a roller coaster: without too much depth and it's a pretty quick ride, but in this incredibly bleak summer (and year,) strap yourself in and have a blast.
Ever since my favorite summer movie season of all time, 1989, I looked more forward to the summer blockbusters than Christmas time. While I was slightly disappointed in 1990's summer slate, I thought it might be an off-year.Nope. NOPE. At the beginning of the 1991 Summer Blockbuster buffet, I went to go see the "sure thing," a Bruce Willis Comedy/Adventure/Action. He could do no wrong, right?And the funny thing was, I was a ton less critical back then than I am now in regards to movies. I absolutely hated Hudson Hawk when I left the theatres during the credits. Again, back then, I was much more forgiving; I truly felt this was just a mess and it would get better. (Note: it really didn't, but had some notable films: Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Thelma & Louise, Soapdish, The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear and City Slickers.)This movie left such a bad taste in my mouth and even made me completely dislike Danny Aiello, even if he was in better projects. Thankfully, I moved past it and vowed to never see it again. And I would've kept that promise had it not appeared on the How Did This Get Made podcast which I vowed to watch/re-watch movies they hilariously review on their show.So, 23 years later, I finally give it a second chance. I sincerely don't recall hating it back then as much as I did this time. As a matter of fact, watching it this time, the thought: "I fvcking hate this movie" kept repeating in my head.To the movie's credit, I didn't hate on it until the bumbling and so-called best of the best burglars started singing. Yes, it wasn't perfect before that, but that one scene where both Danny and Bruce sang in sync was so awful, so distasteful, I never recovered from my hatred from that moment on.Recently freed from prison Bruce, à la Hudson Hawk, does the obligatory "one final job" but only to be double crossed and must face many opposing sides, such as the CIA, the Catholic CIA, Candy Criminals, a Nun with No Sense and two flamboyantly awful characters that made me turn my head away from the screen every time they showed up. Literally, they were like the traps set in the movie series: Saw. They were so gruesome and disgusting they either belonged in Saw or in Nothing But Trouble.When this movie pretends to be a comedy, it fails. When it states it's a heist movie, it's too damn easy. When it turns into slapstick, it's out of place. When it wants to be romantic, it's like dating your sibling.Nothing works here, nothing to take from it. Leave the hawk, or shoot it down before it makes it to your place.* * * Final thoughts: I see where they were going with most of this. Sadly, it's hard not to check out long before they prove what genre they want to represent. By the movie's end, it's so lost, even the actors seem to be throwing their arms up in defeat. Thank God this bombed so no sequel or talk of a remake.
Yes. I agree. Totally. Absolutely. 100%. Never happen. Just as much fantasy here as in The Lord of the Rings. Republicans and Democrats have a better chance. Glenn Beck and Hillary Clinton have more chemistry.Let me get the positives out first, because, dammit, I hated this movie. OK, it had some good shots; the cinematographer was well paid. And I did chuckle, but not laugh, at a few scenes. FEW. Oh, and I liked them using "normal" guys for the nerds verses just throwing in the usual suspects: Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, et al.Whew, I'm glad that (and the movie) is over. Going back to my first observation, perhaps a 10 would go after (they say a 5+, I say a) 3 (THREE) and THAT is being generous, but there has to be something more. Is he funny? Is he wealthy? Is he self-confident? Is he interesting? Is he caring? Does he have a big member? Does he have, at least, ambition? This absolute DUFUS has absolutely none of those qualities. Seriously? Could they have written a worse off human being? Forget the "looks" or lack thereof; let's not be shallow, shall we? Give me something OTHER than the target it-girl (who looks too eerily like a young Ali Larter) using him to avoid heart break.Nope. On paper, he's supposed to be HILARIOUS! FUNNY! And a LOYAL FRIEND! I saw none of these displayed. Man, can he bore me. Dude, he's as loyal to his friends as Kramer is to Seinfeld. And the actor, Baruchel, didn't even appear like he was trying. Sure, he seemed happy he had a starring role, finally, but he read the script verbatim and went from point A to B without adding any heart or any desire to prove to the audience he was worth rooting for.Don't even get me started on the unoriginal script, bad ideas, thoroughly predictable story lines and terrible attempt at being gross  don't throw in a scene, such as the straight male shaving his best bud's pubes, simply to appeal to the American Pie crowd, when it literally does not fit in with the rest of the atmosphere.Here's my take on the synopsis: Boy, Kirk (Baruchel) meets Girl, Molly (Eve) at the airport where Boy works. He's still stuck on ex-girlfriend who broke up with him  and as bad as she is (duh, I said it was predictable,) she broke it off, rightfully so  two years prior. BAM, friendly Molly with a lot of male baggage enters the picture and falls for "safe" Kirk.Whew, good for him. And they date. Hilarity (yeah, right) ensues with all the secondary characters who simply try too hard at being, well, third-rate, and barely funny, characters.Let's just count the time down to the inevitable "fight" or "lies-turned-truth" all these movies always contains moments before the "heartbreak" song, soul searching and predicatible make-up finale.Do these people try anymore? I would give this turd a higher rating if anyone had a personality range above Keanu Reeves or humor even as minor as Adam Sandler. But, no. They weren't funny; they were as depressing as they looked.Little thought went into this. And less thought you should have in renting it. She's out of his league for good reason. SKIP.
Nothing or nobody could've prepared me for Savages. But, the incredibly inept opening narration should've been clue number one what I was in for.Director Oliver Stone was great at one point, right? Make that: many points of many films for decades. I am curious to find out if even he watched this finished project before it was distributed. How could he miss the multitudes of incompetence of this film? Even a first time director would've been embarrassed or caught even half of the dozen or so fails shown here.The number one problem overall was the wretched script and abominable dialogue in said script. Attempting to not laugh out loud or, at minimum, shake your head with each word spoken, specifically the unintentionally hilarious narration, was a fruitless act. Oh, and speaking of which, acting, particularly Blake Lively's O(h my god, she sucks) character, was second on the naughty list. Absolutely everyone else, including a terrible and phoned in John Travolta, was awful, but the ironically named Lively should've taken home the Razzie. Or hopefully, at very least, never act again.Further, the feeble attempts at cinematic style on screen failed hard with each scene and the laughable stock footage didn't help. In a movie about drugs and heavy usage almost proved Stone must've been high himself when this was shot. Also, the all-over-the-place and endless story was just too dumb to be even mocked. Like the inconceivable length of this movie, the randomness of events, subplots/relationships and pathetic twists felt too much and never once authentic.In a threesome of partners-in-crime have a dilemma when Mexican Madmen want to "monitor" their successful drug business for three years. As with the rest of the script, the boys (oh, sorry, the threesome is two dudes and one girl, but supposedly the two buds aren't gay) go back and forth on deciding on whether to join the Mexican Mafia. So, while they boringly debate, they decide to add a lot of screen time to the movie's length by: going to dinner, hanging out in their pad, drinking, smoking and attempting to launder money  but even that, they keep flip-flopping with a wasted use of the talented Emile Hirsch.To make matters worse, (meaning: unfortunately the film went on) the Mexican Meanies kidnap the female portion of their pact and the boys would do anything to get her back. Unconvincingly, but still. So, they do this, do that, change this, trick thatnothing with continuity, originality or believability.And the predictable climax actually borrows fromthe Twilight film series conclusion? Now, that's rich and so appropriate for this movie that inconceivably took three writers to script. Including Stone.Though completely unintentional, Savages might actually be more hilarious than my previous favorite pot-comedy: Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle. But since it's "supposed to be serious," the movie's over the top gore, violence and language felt more like "Look at what I can do!" than meshing with the actual scenes. The kicker was that the sex scenes looked incredibly awkward and not even believable had it been a teen's first time.Obviously, this is a skip. Save your two-and-a-half hours for your loved ones because if you're headed to hell in the afterlife, why start your torture here?* * * Final thoughts: Showing more male ass than female nudity helps in any movie, but sadly, in the case of Savages, when you start with the two lead's bums upfront, it can only go down from there. And, it did feel like an avalanche of dread from when their respectably nice butts were so nicely displayed to the end credits.
There's a story behind me and The Fugitive.(Said in best Sophia Petrillo, of The Golden Girls, voice) Picture it: Phoenix. 1993. A movie critic, much like the one you're reading now, who writes for a college column with the same name, wants to see a double feature with his buddy: Jurassic Park and The Fugitive. The paper advertises a "free" screening of The Fugitive following the final showing of Jurassic Park at the original Cine Capri. So, he goes to buy both tickets at the box office, but the clerk informs him of the misprint in the newspaper and that only ones with preselected passes can attend the sneak preview of The Fugitive that Thursday evening.Disappointed, but devious, that young reporter has plans and attends Jurassic Park for his third time. Heck, it was Cine Capri  a local legend of a theatre  and it's a big-screen movie. Following that movie, he goes to the lobby and talks to the manager who's scrambling around because this promises to be a not only booked presentation, but over-sold screening of The Fugitive. The manager repeats that the newspaper misrepresented their viewing of the Harrison Ford movie that wasn't supposed to open until the next day. He said to the young movie reviewer, "Unless you have a pass"Smartly, the future Reevesreviews.com admin pulls out his college-press-badge he happened to have on him and convincingly (and visually panicked) states: "I did have a pass, but I left it in the newsroom."Honestly, he did get many passes, but not for this one. Shhh, don't spread it to the manager that probably doesn't work for the same company, now 17 years later. The manager surprisingly okays the deceit and allows the two buddies back into the auditorium to watch The Fugitive. But, before he did, he noticed the line outside, the line of people that apparently wrapped around the building indicating that not all who actually did have passes could see the movie. Even though it was Cine Capri, and it had a large number of seats, it didn't have enough to supply the mass-mailing of the free passes.Smiling, the young male didn't care. He was about to watch a fantastic movie. A movie that would still hold up in spades nearly two decades later. A movie based on a TV-show he has still yet to see.It doesn't matter. He, or rather, I loved the film. It contained great action segments, wonderful acting  Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble was superb while Tommy Lee Jones would rightfully earn his only Oscar a few months later, a powerful score and enough suspense and intrigue that you don't have to see the original source material.Kimble is living the wonderful social life with a beautiful wife in tow until his wife is bludgeoned to death and the good doc is accused, sentenced, jailed and transported until a chance  and explosive  escape leaves him free to search for the, gasp!, the one-armed man who really killed his wife (Ward.) It's up to U.S. Marshalls, led wonderfully by Gerard (Jones) to catch the fugitive(s) in an unbiased and unforgiving way.Against impossible, and I do mean IMPOSSIBLE, ways, Kimble thwarts the authorities and puts the pieces together to regain his innocence and freedom. Will Gerard catch up with the lone doctor? Will he care? He clearly says he doesn't.This movie is flat exciting and simple. Barely a CGI moment, if any and it relies heavily on the acting of both Ford and Jones in classic cat 'n' mouse fashion. And it works, it really does. You will have to get pass the endless "OH! He's gonna get caught here! No, he's definitely done for there!" moments  which worked better in the superior The Silence of the Lambs and most of all, the 93-story-drop Kimble survives off a dam. (Yeah, that's an exaggeration, but not too far off.)This is the first viewing I've had of this movie in a long time, and with what I've been seeing this past decade, this was thoroughly refreshing. I love pre-CGI movies and especially movies that rely on heart, plot and acting vs. special effects. This is a must seeEven if you have to lie your way into the theatre.Did I mention, that young reporter got his pick of any seat as, he and his friend were the first ones in the auditorium before anyone else was let in? Oh, yeah. Those were the days.Side Note: When I originally watched this, one of my first thoughts was: Ford, as shown here as the runaway Kimble, would make the ideal movie adaptation of David "Bruce" Banner if they ever made a Hulk movie. Unbeknownst to me, it would be another 10 years until they did, in fact, finally bring the Hulk to the big screen. By then, Ford was probably too old. Either way, I grew up on the TV version of The Incredible Hulk and saw the late (he would die, literally, a few months following this movie's opening) Bill Bixby in Ford. Maybe it's just me, but watch for yourself and think David Banner on the run here.
Say what you want about Jurassic Park (JP1,) or the inferior follow-up, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (JP2,) you know you had a good thing when the name "Steven Spielberg" is written on the back of the director's chair.This (should've been) direct-to-video mess of a movie, unoriginally called Jurassic Park III (JP3) I'm guessing only because they wanted to show claws for the I-I-I, failed on EVERY LEVEL. So much so, I don't know where to begin.Was the downfall the awful (and over-)acting? The terrible dialogue  including one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes, when the raptor calls out Alan's name? The downsized special effects? The sheer mockery of using the classic original score to remind us of a better film? The idiotic reasons to get both Laura Dern back and Sam Neill as well as Sammy back on an island full of dinos? How about the Saving Private Ryan Spielberg tribute finale or was it Jungle-Boy? (More on that atrocity later.) Orwas it the insanely 568th zoom-in/close up of the both the actors, namely Mr. Initforthemoney Neill, and the dinosaurs?Mercifully, the movie's only attribute was its 92 minute length. After you get past that sigh of relief and the regret of wasting those precious 92 minutes knowing all well you shouldn't have returned to the island with Mr. Spiralingdowncareer Neill, you have silly people running around doing and saying silly things making you wonder why this wasn't rated G. Heck, it was basically animated with some of the dinosaurs. Some that even talk!And what's worse? A character that vows never to step into the land of the lost-scripts, but sells out with the deposit of a check or an actor that does the same? What's that old phrase: Fool me oncewell, Alan (Neill) did make this very same mistake in JP1 but you'll have to forgive him: though he was offered money, he was tricked onto the island of the dinos. Here, he, wellwas offered money and was tricked onto the island of the dinos. How does someone of such idiocy become a doctor?I digress, he isn't real and this just further proof of poor screenplay writing  and from three different men, one of which I WILL NOT forgive: Alexander Payne, author of excellent movies such as Election and Sideways.And speaking of poorly written Part IIIs, I'm sure it's already been stated this is the Jaws 3D of our generation with the coincidence of Spielberg directing both part ones of the series mentioned. Thankfully, in 2001, the 3D re-trend hadn't begun yet, so I can imagine this movie actually could've been worse with the use of 3D. Though they certainly tried towith all those damned close-ups.I have NOT seen so many close ups in my life. Back in 2001, when I saw this movie for the first (of now only two) time(s), I saw it with a buddy friend of mine. We laughed our asses off throughout  yeah, laughing at it, but one of the things that were hilarious, though annoying, were the zoom in creatures, including the actors. This occurs roughly every 2-3, maybe 5, minutes of screen time. The last straw towards the ending when my friend wanted to put his fist through a wall: in the fiftieth time they showed off their graphics of the dinos, the scene was set-up and was, once again another zoom in on one of the creatures. My buddy saw it coming and he warned me: if theyif they do it Of course, we always had the same response of whenever they did: we would say to each other "Alan?" as in the first of many horrid scenes towards the beginning when a raptor speaks Alan's name to himon an airplane.Anyways, I better seal off this review, though I am happy now that I've seen it, it's fresher in my mind to review it and now I never, ever have to see it again. The BASIC plot is idiot male takes Erik (Trevor Morgan, a.k.a. Jungle-Boy) on a "Dino-Soar" expedition of the restricted island of dinosaurs left vacant (of humans, supposedly) from JP2. Inevitably, they crash onto the island.In comes Mommy & Daddy, too inept to barely walk and chew at the same time yelling out idiot lines and gestures. They hire sell-out Alan to "just fly" over the island, but in reality, they're there to get back their son who's been gone for two months. Literally, after the AGAIN inevitable crash the movie turns to some odd-ball screw-ball comedy with all-but zero original ideas of how to now use the dinosaurs on screen.ThenJust when you thought it was safe towait, let me start overJust when you thought JP3 couldn't get any worse, in comes Jungle-Boy to the rescue. And let's give him some credit: he is one humble kid. After incredibly surviving eight weeks without training, adequate supplies, company, help or hope, his first concern when found: "Golly gee wilikers, I hope mom and dad are getting along!"He swoops in (believe me, this had me and my buddy roaring in laughter in the theatre), saves Alan from the seventh near-death situation, who promptly has a very nice and calm conversation about Alan's books (again, see JP1), about how mommy & daddy are getting along while Alan unforgivingly eats the kid's precious final food scraps.At any rate, this leads to that, that leads to more of the same and the conclusion will have you, for the umpteenth time laughing out loud.Just skip the throw-away JP3. Unless you're a filmmaker and want examples of what not to do to ruin a highly successful franchise.
It would be very hard to put a new twist on the age-old zombie/disease genre that's been flooding the cinemas for many years now. I enjoyed Dawn of the Dead (2004), 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later but they can only go so far.So, with the low, LOW budget of Carriers, you'd expect them to rehash everything previously done, except with no special effects. Thankfully, they relied on simplifying everything and the performances.Apparently there was some outbreak of a somewhat air-born virus that give people rashes, sickness and eventual death and the movie picks up with 4 survivors on the road to a hideaway beach resort. We have brothers Danny (Pucci) and Brian (Pine) who are in tow with females Bobby (Perabo) and Kate (Van Camp) and they have "Rules" on how to survive in this now all-but deserted wasteland of Earth. Not rules like in Zombieland. This ain't no fun 'N' games.Neither is self-appointed leader and ass-hole Brian. As dumb as he is in this, you pray he gets this mysterious disease and die off before the conclusion. (You see a little of his arrogance in Star Trek (2009), but nothing compared to his performance here. He should be worried about being typecast. Unless, of course, he really is this bad in real-life.) The movie contains a lot of usual zombie/end of world/infectious disease scenes, emotions and general amateur "militants" trying to restore order, so it's not the most original story. Yet, on such a small budget, it seems real, suspenseful (at times) and they show enough examples of small-town America devastated to satisfy the target audience.It's not perfect, but feels real enough to suggest a rental for those Chris Pine and/or disease-end-of-world viewers.
I've been a fan of the zombie genre for decades now. I even liked when it morphed into the disease/virus genre (28 Days Later, 2010's The Crazies) but my heart goes out for the undead. I loved both the original and remake: Dawn of the Dead. I tolerated both Land of the Dead and most recently, Survival of the Dead. Heck, I've even made it through one, maybe two of the Return of the Living Dead spoofs.That all said, this Diary of the Dead has to be the most realistic zombie movie I've seen, next to the 2004 remake: Dawn of the Dead. And for such a low budget, it certainly was ambitious as, unlike Night of the Living Dead parts 1-4, this one (part 5) was actually on the road a lot versus staying put  making it all too easy on the zombies to pick them off one by one.Sure, a lot would be turned off with the hand-held camera, starting way back in the 1990s with The Blair Witch Project. It never bothered me; I have favored both Blair and Cloverfield and I think George Romero just felt like he finally brought the series into today's trends. Meaning, internet, CAMs, online chats, web chats, etc.After Night, Dawn, Day and Land, the series was at a stand-still. Another angle I liked about Diary, is that it was a fresh start, especially for fans like myself. We got to go back to the beginning from another POV. Actually, make that several POVs.The movie's not perfect. The cast, for the most part, is gorgeous. Of course, its possible for college students that gather to make a class-project film, Mummy  no less, good looking, but the odds are against them. In addition, though I truly believed 95% of the dialogue and actions, there was a bit overacting  probably just dramatic effect since it's not, of course, a real/reality movie. In the same note, the film (meaning, the actual movie) is so well edited and shot, it's hard to comprehend that even experienced filmmakers, in which this crew was most certainly not, could do such a good job at filming with such extraordinary events.Wow, I've gotten a little head of myself. The basic outline, and as much as I loved this movie, it's basic: Students at a Pennsylvania College/University are making a Horror final project involving a rather fast Mummy with their drunken professor in tow. When, all of a sudden, the news reports of "the dead rising." Most believe, a select one or more don't. (In all honesty, though I would be curious to what's happening, I wouldn't necessarily believe.)The group splits into two: two go to one of the rich kid's dream mansion, while the rest go in a Winnebago to get the occupants home to loved ones. Along the way, they introduce themselves on camera to Jason who, apparently, is addicted to filming anything, everything. It actually makes sense, according to the film's plight: the media is once again screwing with people's minds and actually downplaying thousands, make that millions, dying all at once, not to mention rising again to continue the pattern. What I didn't get, was that filming this might be helpful, indeed, but in real life I would certainly put the damn camera down to help out. In the movie's defense, they bring up his bad habit, roughly, say, 48 times.At any rate, the film documents their journey into the abyss of the new life alongside the undead taking over. Suspenseful moments are abound, including the military, the home life, the scavengers and even the Deaf Amish  which was one of the most colorful and needed-hilarious moments in the film. In a word: "Hurry."I truly believed, without the camera, a lot of what happened on film here would actually happen if college-aged students had to deal with this new world of survival and how little the small stuff means. I know this movie begs the question that was asked a long time ago, but not for a while, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?My only question is how no one ever mentions the term "zombies." I'm guessing that in these people's world, the genre that's more than a dozen decades old, they don't exist. But, it would be nice for one person to reference the walking dead.What is nice, is the consistent news/internet updates. One of the qualities I like about these types of films, is the background TV broadcasts that gives us relatively real news programs describing the onslaught. I don't know what that means for me, but that tingles me the most. I guess it makes it more real to me, if I'm watching some CNN or ZNN program giving feedback, instructions or live footage of the outbreak.On a personal note: I was headed towards Vegas in one of my 3-4 visits I have each year, and the day before I had some free time. I wanted to see this Land of the Dead follow-up, but it was only playing at Arizona Mills Mall, roughly 25 miles from my home. Nevertheless, I made the journey and was not let down. (That was the only place to see The Blair Witch Project when it first arrived in theatres, coincidentally enough.) Even though I enjoyed the movie, the last line of the movie hit me hard. I'm sure it's not 100% original, but it's very true in a lot of aspects. It quickly became not only one of my favorite movie quotes, but a true life thought, especially when I watch war movies:"Are we worth saving? You tell me."
Thanks to Emma Stone's "Olive" Branch, Easy A was extremely easy on the I's. Whoa, OK, never mind. I mean, she made the movie elevate beyond the disaster it could've been.Fine, I have to get over my Zombieland prejudices. I HATED her in that movie. Well, more her character, than her. She was absolutely wonderful here (in Easy A) and sorting through IMDb shows me more projects I've either seen and loved or want to view, such as Superbad, Paper Man, The Rocker, or The House Bunny.Now the movie, itself, isn't perfect on its own, butdamnI would personally vote Stone for a Best Actress (Oscar) Nominee. Heck, if Tomei can get the award for My Cousin Vinny or Cusack nominated for In & Out, Stone EARNED the nomination here.Okay, let's forget Stone for a moment. The supporting cast (Kudrow, why did you have to wait until half the movie's over to show up?), the cinematography and the dialogue were all good here in Easy A, a veryVERYloose adaption of The Scarlet Letterbut let's face it: Stone's witty comments and delivery gave this old concept a fresh perspective.Olive (Stone  Oh! I get it) is the 'little miss sunshine' of her high school until one lie to her BFF of getting out of a weekend engagement blossoms into her having (GASP!) sex with an older man. Well, far be it from (100% unrealistic) kids who will judge, envy or mock (or all three) Olive. Unrealistic, as in, a LOT of kids have sex in high school. Sorry, Leave it to (their) Beaver parents. It does, in fact, happen.Anyways, in this fantasy world, no teen has sex, so Olive's immediately branded as a harlot. She does (& doesn't) care so much, until people catch on, like her other BFF, gay guy friend Brandon (Byrd). A lot of people will look down upon his "acting straight" to get through high school as "lying" but let me set the record, uh, straightuntil homophobia goes bye-bye with the back of the bus, it's best to fly under the radar until college. This is coming from experience.I digressHe gets a laid reputation which is followed by others (enter "fat" stereotypes here) who want the attention until her lie snowballs uncontrollably. Will she do the right thing? Well, time will tell in this John Hughes update. Not coincidentally, the late (and definitely GREAT) Hughes is mentioned here.As I've shined more than once, Stone is both the centerpiece and also the glue that holds everything together. She alone didn't make 100% the movie  give it up to a great performance from Clarkson and Tucci as the (somewhat) clueless parents  but she really nailed the lines in an unrealistic film (mainly in the out-of-left field never-would-happen finale.)I've mentioned this is loosely based on The Scarlet Letter film/work, and even though it's mentioned throughout (SEE: her 'Laverne' A on the clothes) it's never actually about adultery. In fact, she never commits (in the fantasy or real world) adultery. In any case, it's worth watching for some quick and fun dialogue  too many very good lines to quote. I'm surprised to like such a film, but again, it's all about the Stone. Look forward to seeing more of you!
Thank you Shrek for not only taking a back seatbut for not even showing up.After the enormously disappointing last two Shrek films, his absence from the feature-length Puss In Boots, reminded me of the last major election when all Republican candidates distanced themselves far from the horrid George W. Bush endorsement. Heck, they didn't want to be even seen with him.Puss's detachment from old pal Shrek was warmly welcomed as was the lack of the usual and over-used origin story attached to a spin-off movie. In fact, the short time they spent on how Puss got his boots, was fantastic, cute, original and a lot of fun. That said, I wouldn't want the whole film based around a Kitten Looking for Boots.The movie as a whole a grand adventure, perfect for kids and adults. The story wasn't completely original and wildly predictable, but it was perfect for the younglings while the adventure, action, comedy and homage excellent for adults.And speaking of homage, the inevitable and integrated Shrek-franchise fairy-tales weren't over done and more part of the story, than (said in best MadTV Stuart's voice) "Look at what I can do!" from the previous movies. On a personal note, these are the ones I most grew up with: Humpty (Alexander) Dumpty and Jack and the Beanstalk. (That last one was one of my all-time favorites as a kid, and when Disney redid it, oh, it was like Christmas.)Puss and an oh-so-not-mysterious dueling cat team up with said Mr. Dumpty to get the goose that lays the golden eggs, but are wanted by the town folk and chased by, ah hem, Jack and Jill. (Now why couldn't Adam Sandler's feature length film take be as entertaining?) Puss needs to clear his name and save the town while finding time for love.There. That was the basic premise. See? Great for kids. As was all the adventure and inventive scenes and gorgeous cinematography and graphics. This all will entertain adults as well, not boring them for a moment.Finally, Antonio Banderas, who already starred in 3 previous films with this same character, breathes fresh life into the best character in the entire Shrek franchise. Unlike Cleveland from Family Guy, this character not only deserved his own spin-off, he can carry it. Further, most minor/secondary characters need to rely on those kooky new characters to fill in the gaps of the normal 90-minute timeframe. Not this time; while the co-stars were fun and entertaining, Puss held his own throughout and makes me welcome a Puss 2 Boots.As long as it's more Puss Adventures and NOT leading us any closer to his meeting of Shrek.
I had two days to think about this movie and wrote two reviews on both days:Day One's Reaction: I get when a movie wants to be incredibly smart, deep, blows you away...and that's okay for people who like to think a ton during a feature. I don't mind that, but it was sometimes hard to think during some of the more brutal scenes, even the less bloody ones as in the first five minutes. I have heard this was one of the most grotesque films made and I was totally wondering if that was true an hour and 10 minutes in and BAM, yep, very hard to watch. Yeah, I had to turn away a couple of times. When it comes down to it, the message isn't too hard to figure out and once you do, you're left with an all- but NC-17 stage play bent on extreme brutality. Eh. fulfilled my curiosity.Day Two's Retraction: Initially I gave ANTICHRIST ★★/5 stars but, since it has haunted me all day today, and I mean, I just can't get certain scenes out of my head, bloody volcano to put it way mildly, and the acting and originality was not that bad, I changed my mind to ★★★/5 stars. BUT...that's not a recommendation. In fact, just the opposite.Years back. I have the most grotesque film I have ever seen, and to date, THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE PART 2 still holds that record, ★★★/5 stars and I warned all over my review: despite the not-bad rating, the movie should never be seen. By anyone. Ever. EVER.Same here. Despite both movies being well made, and mostly original, they cross lines that should never been seen by anyone. I'm even gonna do my best to not ever think about what I saw last night, and I hope for your sake, you don't have to experience that...horror.
I admit I didn't like the title, but the trailers to Despicable Me did look like fun. I have no excuse on why I missed it in theatres, but dang, I wish I had seen it there.This was a wonderful movie, all around. Even the movie's shortcomings were overcome. Such as: old story at first glance, but enough twists and personal stamps to make it original and the minions ALMOST overstayed their welcome before the inevitable sequel  like what happened to Scrat in Ice Age: The Meltdown. They didn't, thank goodness, and were kept fresh, fun, entertaining and great to watch through to the end.You may not even like Steve Carell, but even here, in animated voices, he shows his comic genius and absolutely shows depth, much like what Robin Williams did in Aladdin.The world's full of super-villains, as this movie cleverly focuses on, and "poor" Gru (Carell) is getting older and out-thieved by others so he schemes to steal the moon. Like that's been done before.Unfortunately for him, right when he's getting shut out by the evil bank  what bank isn't these days  and his peers, a new rival appears in the same mold, but creatively different, as Syndrome from Pixar's The Incredibles and three girls come into his life that need adoption. This also sounds like Pixar's Up, but they take it in a different direction.Sure, you know he'll grow to love the girls, but Carell (and the writers, of course  it is animated after all) does a wonderful job of showing the bond grow through deception  he needs them to penetrate his adversary, Vector's (Segel) not-so-secret lair for a device to shrink the moon.It's been awhile that I saw a movie that made me want to put on "repeat" as Despicable Me did. And it wasn't a one-note film involving the cute and resourceful little, yellow minions that aid in Gru's plight. Sure, they were wonderful, as well, but as a whole, this movie is highly recommended to kids and adults. It's heartfelt, adventurous, absolutely hilarious, enormously creative and leaves you rooting for the bad guy. Let's hope they don't spoil the sequel with twice the number of minions forthere's already hundreds in this one.
"Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head."  Jack Crawford.No truer words have been written about the monster, Hannibal Lecter in what I call my FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME: The Silence of the Lambs.I used to work for AMC Gateway on 59th Avenue and Bell Road in Glendale, AZ way back in 1991. I was 16, and one of the perks, was, if you were able to, watching movies at late night prior to movies being released the following day. So, I would say this was February 13th 1991. They did this to make sure the film ran correctly, audio, picture, etc. But, the employees were invited. And it was like a party: only about 10 or so inhabited their biggest theatre. It was a fantastic experience with my peers, as was the movie.Jonathan Demme's masterpiece of sound and visuals rests on many factors: acting, screenplay, sound, mood, surprises, pace, dialogue, suspense, originality, opening, middle and end, comedy, character development, believability, music, score, editing and literal bite. Honestly, I could write an entire hardback on all of these aspects and still have enough for a follow-up publication. In short, this movie worked on all angles. No other movie have I ever seen, in the 1000's I have seen, hit the nail on the head on every single right move on how a movie is supposed to be made upon.In what most people don't know (but it has become more common knowledge in recent years) is the follow-up/sequel to 1986's Manhunter, The Silence of the Lambs begins with Clarice Starling (Foster,) a definitive over-achiever FBI trainee. Immediately into the film, she's summoned by her mentor/soon-to-be boss (she hopes,) Crawford (Glenn) to merely interview the imprisoned "Hannibal the Cannibal" (Hopkins.) She suspects it's concerning on-the-loose serial killer "Buffalo Bill" but takes the assignment anyways.Upon meeting, he doesn't just call her out; he sniffs her previous lotion and dissects her innermost fears. Undeterred, the trainee follows the leads Hannibal presents, while previously bad memories resurface and the status of a Senator's Daughter's life is at stake while in the hands of Buffalo Bill. Frankly, she's juggling a lot.All the while, Crawford's actually (and surprisingly to him) impressed and Hannibal continues to taunt  whether to teach, learn, relieve boredom or use Starling, all for his own amusement. Despite his previous free existence's knowledge, before being caught as a serial cannibal/murderer, he's giving her all she needs to "advance," or, in turn, catch the killer, Jame "Buffalo Bill" Gumb.The movie is only the third (at the time) in history to "Sweep" the Oscars, meaning: it took all five top awards: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and (adapted) Screenplay. (For the record, I've read all the Hannibal Lecter books by Thomas Harris (all but Hannibal Rising) and I'm definitely in agreeance with that last one. No one could've translated the mood, theme or scene-by-scene as well as screenplay writer Ted Tally did.) Despite the 5 Oscars it did win, it deserved more.Score! Or, the musical background music was amazing and in my top list of all time best scores. Creepy, moody and the perfect sound to match the theme/atmosphere of the film. The soundtrack, or music tracks, such as American Girl by Tom Petty and especially Goodbye Horses by Q. Lazzarus were both not only excellent choices for the film (and scenes) but, personally, they shot to my "best of" movie music lists. Also, it should've won for editing. This movie was beautifully cut and carefully spliced together. In addition, another award for cinematography was justified, as the movie's photography was eerie, colorful  when called for and truly put you in the character's shoes.You must see this movie. Everything works. It is gory at times, really gory. And I wouldn't like a movie if that's all they gave me. It must contain a story, character depth/growth and true to the story acting. Obviously, I'm going to say this does, and I'd be right.And finally it truly invented my number one favorite villain, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Sure, Brian Cox already played him in Manhunter and as good as Cox is as an actor, no one could touch Hopkins powerful performance. Apparently he did a lot of the stances, movements, creation of the monster all by himself and it paid off. Thanks to Demme for allowing him to create such an icon. He was scary, smart, deadly and had charisma all in a single breath on screen. This kind of acting job comes but once, generally, to any great actor.Need more evidence that Hopkins did a role of a lifetime? His screen presence was so powerful, he even tricked the audience into thinking he appeared all throughout the film, yet was only shown for under 25 minutes, or less than a fourth of the film. Not the shortest timeframe for an actor to win Best Actor over Best Supporting Actor, but his impact not only impressed the Academy Award voters and audience, but you will truly feel his presence even when he's not on film.This is largely due to the fact on how great Jodie Foster was  another role of a lifetime for her. She carried Lecter's spirit with her when she left his asylum, and on screen, that's not easy. In addition, she was vulnerable and strong, smart and slow, determined and deterred.all of these at the same time. As much as everyone, including myself, focused on how great Hopkins was, she deserves equal treatment on how masterfully she played her part."I've no plans to call on you, Clarice. The world is more interesting with you in it."  Dr. Hannibal Lecter.Actually, he's the one that made our world a lot more interesting.
Perhaps one of the shallowest, barley forgiving, selfish and hardly living up to the title character: Merida proves that Pixar was too desperate to finally introduce a female lead to its lineup. They should've waited until the right story came along.Brave, thankfully, has a much stronger second half, because the first part's old school Little Mermaid'ish plot was really annoying and thoroughly un-clever. And I'll give it kudos for introducing, or transforming, one character half way through that brightened the story and humor.Part-time archer, and I say part-time because they just had to throw in a completely incidental talent in the mix because, I dunno, bows and arrows are the hot thing these days, Princess Merida refuses to marry because she, sigh, wants to be a free spirit and sling arrows. Occasionally, that is.When given the opportunity, she makes a deal with a witch and inadvertently turns her mom into a bear. Desperately, she attempts to turn momma bear back into human form, and sadly, continues to blame the witch for another 45 minutes or so.(SPOILER ALERT  just this paragraph: When she finally, FINALLY, realizes it was her doing, the "I'm sorry" speech is so lame and without heart, I still hated her just as much as before her insincere apology.)I will give grand points to the movie for the absolute beautiful landscaping and design. The movie looked gorgeous, from frame one to the close, it sparkled and amazed me. In addition, the score and songs were decent. Also, some scenes did make me laugh out loud, such as the three little rascal brothers of the Princess helping her escape  having to be bribed, no less, since this movie has little morals  by mimicking a shadow of a bear in the castle's light. Further, the momma bear did provide some comic relief, though she was terribly unoriginal.But, the blah, dated and predictable (even to kids) story really will keep me from ever watching this again. Sad. I wanted to give Pixar another chance after the abysmal Cars 2. And with the upcoming and dreaded Monsters Inc. prequel, I think I'll just patiently wait for the third Kung Fu Panda movie to renew my faith in computer animated films.Side Note: Nudity? Really? I understand these films are also engineered to appease adults as well as kids, but nudity, even the cartoon kind, has no business in these films. Shame.
Don't slap me. I like Will Ferrell, but he's not my favorite. In fact, if you asked me to nominate, or vote for, in this case, a better comedian, it would be Zach Galifianakis.The Campaign is so over the top, it's hard to say this is a spoof of the normal election campaigns. Specifically, 2012's Republican buffoon races. It's so out there, that they really dropped the ball at making true fun of how badly the real-life candidates did this past election.At any rate, it is what it is: a cartoon of elections. Unopposed, and clichéd sex maniac, Congressman Cam Brady (Ferrell) is being challenged by flamboyant  and that's putting it mildly, newcomer, Marty Huggins (Galifianakis.) The only reason Marty's in the race is because, well, to make it short, politics are dirty. And that's not even part of the story, but real life. Reallywho disagrees with me?So, once Marty is splashed into the spotlight, let the site gags prevail, including the punching of both a baby and a dog. It's just one outrageous scene after another, so unbelievable, this might as well be a live-action Looney Toons cartoon than a comedy to be taken genuinely for a moment.And when the blows hit the fan in the "learned lesson" inevitable finale, the movie tries to reclaim some of its audience with some kind of lesson that doesn't flow with the rest of the farce.The movie should've begun with the warning: "Do NOT take this seriously, even the closing. Do leave your brain at the door. And Do NOT try any of this in your district."Watch the enjoyable parts with Galifianakis. Discard, er, vote out, the rest.
Some people say the original 1978 Piranha is a spoof off of Jaws. Perhaps. But, it seems like more of a rip-off than any sort of spoof or homage. (On a side and funny note, it is reported that Universal was going to sue (Piranha's production company) New World for the "spoof" but Steven Spielberg saw the movie in advance and loved it, in effect, Universal dropped the suit. Ocra, anyone?) All around B-movie, this campy, sometimes funny, sometimes actually suspenseful  will they, or will they not eat the kids?!?, is an absolute must for 1970/80s "When Animals Attack" lovers. It has absolutely everything: genetically engineered piranha, a new resort going up (and of course, about to go down), gay jokes, government conspiracies, blood, people screaming, horrible back stories, longwinded environmental/humanity speeches, bad puns, semi-romantic couple out to stop the fish!, men with beards, women in bikinis and boobs, of course. Seriously, for those of us that grew up on these types (Empire of the Ants, Frogs, Food of the Gods and Kingdom of the Spiders just to name a few) this will (ahhh) whet your appetite for destruction.Two campers out for a midnight swim in a restricted and somewhat deserted swimming pool  is there any other kind?, discover pretty fast why it's restricted. Enter in "skip-tracer" Maggie (Menzies) to find the lost pair with her new bearded friend, Paul the Drunk (Dillman), but inadvertently sets government tested (and apparently approved) little 'Nam-warrior piranhas, cleverly named (Operation) "Razor Teeth" free into the lake for the rest of the townies to enjoy.Well, aside from some dangling feet (and if you see him, they could only be tasty to genetically engineered fish) and wandering father/son fishers, the dynamic duo must (and I use this term very lightly) "race" down the river, Huckleberry style, to stop the mean razor teeth from reaching either the dam, the kids at the camp (including Paul the Drunk's own daughter, oh no!) or the new resort with a bunch of extras-cum-bait swimmers.This has drinking game written all over it and I highly doubt anyone responsible for this thought any less. So you have to respect them for making just a light hearted "when animals attack" horror/comedy. That said, of course it's a bad movie, hence B-Movie and it's very, VERY slow at parts. This is probably due to the fact that the title baddies are only in, say, 10 minutes of all 94 total and the majority of the film is watching our favorite couple get from point A to point B that has to be a grand total of 5 miles. With the dozens of obstacles the movie gives them, it's no wonder they can't ever stop anyone as they always arrive after the fish start their feeding. (That, by the way, was always hilarious and every time they're late  I think I counted 4 times, that calls for a double shot.)It's recommended for the selected audience  and after reading this far, you know who you are, despite the lack of actual Piranha shots. Sure it must've been a budget thing, or "what you don't see, scares you more," blah, blah, blah. I just want to see more piranha in the 2010 update!!Side Note: The cop in the movie played by Barry Brown took his life by shooting himself, literally 5 weeks before this movie was released. I'm not one to make fun of someone that commits suicide (apparently, both him and his sister both killed themselves  her's more tragic by jumping off a bridge into an empty concrete river bed) so you do it and apologize later because you must've been drunk when you're watching this. Alright, I will, the movie wasn't that bad!
Little did I know, when I watched Old Dogs for the first and definitely last time, that I would be seeing a "new" (to me) Robin Williams film that I would be very disappointed in just a couple of months prior his unfortunate passing. Now, this didn't and won't change my opinion as I write this after his death, but it's sad to know this was my last impression of him before the world lost him.RIP Robin always, but this movie was purely horrifying. It was a comedy that had no comedic moments, a family story with no heart and an unoriginal script that was as random as Mr. Williams' normal schtick. Everything about this project screamed desperation on both stars, Williams and John Travolta and I pitied both of them having to experience such a fall from grace.Since it's been about four months since I've seen this, I refreshed my memory with watching the trailer online. I actually wish I hadn't wasted those two minutes, even though it reminded me of how awful this movie was. It was just one underdeveloped scene after another with sight gags so bizarre, humorless and edited poorly. Hell, even the OLD plot of "Surprise! You're a Dad!" it took a back seat to terrible characters, uncool kids and depressing setups. Basically, I've already given the synopsis, but to elaborate, businessmen Charlie and Dan "inherit" two twins as the kids' mother goes to jail and this is during an important deal with "the Japanese." (Their words, not mine.) Of course, chaos ensues, and the real Dad, Dan, must learn to be a Big Daddy. Even if he has to robotically become one. Yeah, that's one of the "gags."Robin Williams' death aside, which would not take place for years following, this movie was littered with real-life disasters, including Williams' hospitalization, the death of Travolta's own son and Bernie Mac's death. Not to take any of those tragedies lightly, those should've been more than one sign this should've been scrapped. The real reason was in the movie.Everything failed. Every joke, every visual stunt. Past the predictability level at high alert, the story and believability of the characters never felt like live-action. Williams' Dan was supposedly bad for kids, but the setup scenes didn't work. Charlie was supposed to be a womanizer as Travolta used to be, but here he looked like a botox'ed sick freak who should finally come out of the closest.The cameos were, and I can't believe I am stating this, worse than any Adam Sandler ones, the stereotypes were not so-offensive- they're- funny and the conclusion completely unsatisfying. No need to see this, even as tribute to the great comedian.Pick one of his better roles.actually any. I believe, without making a list, this is his worst movie. Even Toys wasn't this bad.RIP Robin. We will miss you. I will miss you.* * *Final thoughts: If you do decide to see this monstrously bad film, at least listen to the How Did This Get Made? podcast. It is one of their best.
You would have to be high to remotely like Crank: High Voltage.Watching this movie was more of a chore than any kind of entertainment. I would have never, ever seen this movie if not for the absolutely hilarious podcast: How Did This Get Made. And that was the choreI set for myself: watch or re-watch all the films they covered during the years of their podcasting.Despite being a HUGE Jason Statham fan, the second part 1 ended and the trailers were released for this, I was out. Spoiler alert for those who haven't seen the first terrible movie of this series: Chev "Cheerios" Chelios falls to his death from more than a thousand or two feet at the ending of 2006's Crank. This movie opens with him, I guess, bouncing?, and the doctors who give him an artificial heart with a catch.Backing up. This may be in the same and insane realm they created in the first episode, but it isn't Friday the 13th. This man died. Replacing his heart would not change that. So, basically, I was tuned out from minute one.At any rate, Cheerios needs to continuously charge this artificial heart until his previously adrenaline-deprived heart is back in place.Much like the first one, I will repeat what I wrote there: The entire movie is a blended video game, rave home video, a live-action anime cartoon, obscene music video and snuff film. The only difference is, it's twice as crazy this time around, if that's possible. And the concept and the lunacy had overstepped its welcome by minute two.Truthfully, I just prayed to get to the ending as quickly as possible so I could listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast. Unfortunately, it was not one where they ridiculed it; it was one of the rare shows they relished in this crap.That's not really fair to people that like this kind of movie. More power to you if you did. Maybe it's because I don't play video games, attend raves, hate anime, like grounded music videos and never once seen a snuff film.* * * Final thoughts: I know the world is calling for a Crank 3. No doubt the boys (and girl) at How Did This Get Made will review it on their show. I guarantee I will both miss the movie and that episode. I can't take this idiocracy any further.
I made a mistake when I first read the description on IMDb, which has now since changed  ha, of Sinister. The first two words read: "Found footage" and even though I read the remaining synopsis, my desire to see this was lost on found footage.It also didn't help that I'm not into ghost/haunted house stories, or that I was turned off by the tagline: "From the Producer of 'Paranormal Activity' and 'Insidious'"  both, of which, I didn't care for or the over-advertisements, as I saw the film's poster all over the place, including the bus stop in front of my office for months.Nevertheless, with the encouragement of some of my on-line friends and the fact that I do like Ethan Hawke, I gave this a shot and I didn't fully regret it.Sure, the movie does provide (some) found footage  so much so, it's the main definition of the term, and it's a ghost story, but the grand substance involves a deep story of a family man's Red Dragon'ish investigation into several "unrelated" family murders and I always dig that kind of mystery plot.Hawke does hold up, as much as he can, though I feel maybe someone else would've been more active in emotions from all the events. I can't say the same about the cardboard cutouts the actor/actresses who played his family. They weren't just incidental to the actions of head-of-family and writer, Ellison (Hawke,) but their performances were all-but boring and staged.What was interesting was his peering into the murders of several families and subsequence disappearance of one of the children of said families. He lazily uses a far-out Deputy Dewey clone over an easy internet search and somewhat brings his family to the brink of crazy while uncovering the truth.As stated, I'm not a ghost story/haunted house fan, but I'll admit to some actual scares and absolute jumps from me  even when I knew what should be coming. That said, most of the "shocks" were positively silly, including the laugh-out-loud final frame.Sinister is a mostly well-made film with good cinematography, score, decent twists and genuine scares. Despite its just-above average runtime, you'll desire more time to uncover the mystery Hawke's character is writing about alongside him. And for that, it's a recommendation.
Maybe I wanted to like Step Brothers more, or perhaps I need to see it againbut seriously speaking, it was just silly.Silly as in fun, that is. It's harmless fun, though not for all audiences, and it's just plain ridiculous. It's almost like an excuse for Will Ferrell (as step brother, Brennan) and John C. Reilly (as other step brother, Dale) to get together and horse around (listen to the audio commentary for proof.) That's all good, if you're looking for a leave-your-brain-at-the-door comedy. And I did find it funny, knowing not to expect too much. I laughed about a dozen times, though more "at" its screwball comedy, especially during the interviews, namely with the obligatory Seth Rogen cameo.One group of adults: Nancy (Steenburgen) and Robert (Jenkins) agree to marry and bring together their 40ish kids who haven't yet flown the coop. Originally, the "boys," and I'm using that loosely, don't get along. After realizing they have some things in common, they bond and manage to screw up interviews the new stepfather, Robert, set up. Okay, okay, they screw up everything, but in the end, naturally, they're gonna learn to grow up and take on responsibility.Really, there's three minutes of a plot here, and nothing's really new  just the typical grown-men goofing off, à la Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Vince Vaughn, Paul Rudd etc. But, again, if you just sit back and let them do their thingover and over againyou might have fun. Just don't expect much, or even clever jokes. Just gag, fight, rinse and repeat. If that's your bag, this is the movie for you.Personally, I probably have to watch it again and perhaps it will become a guilty pleasure as it really couldn't be anything of substance  just mindless entertainment.
Recently, I re-watched all five 'Saw' movies in preparation (and to review) of the forthcoming 'Saw VI' and the overall message of those films was "appreciate life." Yes, it would sound weird to compare that series with 'Sin Nombre,' however, both are gory/not for the light-hearted, and both gave me the same message.Despite the fact that immigrating to USA without proper documentation/procedures, etc, is illegal (I live in Arizona, so this is front page news 8 days a week), you actually want these lost souls to make it over.Casper is attempting to leave a violent gang (apparently not monitored by the authorities or policed in any way  kill at will) after a brutal "accident" and he's trailed by an innocent girl attempting to escape Mexico to join her family in New Jersey. Casper is marked for death by the gang for something he does (no spoilers here) and he knows it.The movie is extremely well shot and the cinematography is excellent, the acting's in check and even some suspense is thrown in, all the way to the closing. And again, it certainly makes me appreciate life here and all the blessings, in fact, if anything, it makes me want to help others more. (SEE: drive-by-fruiting.) Was the movie great? Time will tell. In this viewing, I really did like it, in spite of some of the gore and boy, I cannot stand street gangs. I liked the extreme realism, the original shots of Mexico  usually we just get stock footage, the shocks and the true loyalty the "heroes" of the story portray. You truly believe these people are family and are close.Perhaps the movie will grow on me; but as of right now, I'd recommend, but I wouldn't put in top 5 of 2009. Yet.
In the 1,516 seasons of American Idol, I have yet to see more than a 30-second clip or ad for the show. I wonder if that show's as bad as From Justin to Kelly.Probably not, but, then again, I also have never seen any of the High School Musicals. I somehow imagine if those yutes went to spring break, From Justin to Kelly would be the result.This movie truly makes me want to say: REALLY? out loud and very loud. The music is terrible, the choreographed dances amateurish, the story nonexistent, the plot unoriginal, the chemistry vacant and worst of all..Justin's hair.Like a lot of the torture I've witnessed in the Saw movies, I had to look away whenever he was on screen. His hair was so terrible, so disgusting, it wasn't even a laughable part of this unintentionally hilarious "feel-good" musical.In this Rated PG, but should've been G, romp, we have teens to early 20s kids pretend that swear words and true sexuality doesn't exist, especially during Spring Break. To put it in perspective, this is the 2003 equivalent of the I Love Lucy's two beds for married couples in the 1950s.Basically, two Disney characters briefly meet and have, ah-hem, chemistry (or so they tell us) and spend the rest of the movie trying to hook-up (meaning, just have a convo) while someone tries to keep them apart.I understand this movie was planned before it had a script and before it even had a cast  so I guess also before it had a title. It all shows. It was thrown together last minute and it will go down as one of the worst excuses for a TV/Movie tie-in ever.Do NOT watch this. It doesn't even fall in the "so bad, it's good" category. And unbelievably, it's only 81 minutes. The songs, acting, fake smiles, dialogue and bad attempts at making a Spring Break look wholesome were crimes against humanity.* * * Final thoughts: I am mad at you, How Did This Get Made? podcast. You made me watch this and even with your fantastic recap, it has scarred me for life.
The coolest thing about seeing The Blair Witch Project back in 1999, probably two weeks following its release, was that people still believed one of the biggest movie hoaxes and most cleverest marketing ideas in cinema history. (This was marketed as a documentary on "true life" footage found when three young adults died from an apparent witch attack.) I even remember seeing the TV (later to be confirmed as a Mockumentary) special recapping what "actually" happened during the incidents of three film students that went into the witch'fested woods and never returned.Now, I don't believe in ghosts, "real" witches, spooks, etc, so I never bought it. And my disbelief runs so deep, that the movie never once frightened me, despite my appreciation for what the film was. (AT THE TIME, that isand I'll get into that later.)I do want to clarify, and I'm getting ahead of myself, something from that last paragraph: while I was not spooked, there was a moment, not 10 seconds from the end credits that was very creepy and thought was the most effective shot in the movie. Again  not scary, but absolutely eerie.Much like what Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope) was to that time period, was The Blair Witch Project to the late nineties. It was the found footage newborn. Sure, there were many, manyhorrifyingly too many rip-offs and more found footage films to come, and yeah, there were just a minute number before this, but this was the nice, original and refreshing in 1999. Again, I did not believe this was a true story, but they sure as hell made you at very least believe it was. And they did all that with almost absolutely nothing. I truly admire this movie.The story was jokingly simple and that's not a bad thing when it comes to horror; think about: the masterpiece Halloween's thin script. As an amateur documentary project, two film student friends and a third newly recruited film student venture off into the woods where supposedly (to them) a witch killed many, including a lot of children decades past. Beforehand, in a fairly brilliant scene, they interview the just-outside-the-woods townsfolk for their take on the legend of the infamous Blair Witch.Once inside the woods they're armed with their camping gear, expensive, yet "borrowed" cameras, a device known to us to be the pre-GPS: "a map," and tons of batteries to "run a small third world county." That last one, I loved for, they actually explain why they can continuous film miles from an electrical socket and yet, for the countless  and unnecessary found footage films to follow, they seemed to have forgotten that simple plot explanation and make us believe their devices will basically run for weeks without a recharge. My phone dies in probably 4 hours without a charge.But, I digress. Basically, the two males of the triangle of terrors are lead by the bitch (yeah, she was) Heather who claims to "know where they're going" deep inside the woods. As this does NOT turn out to be the case, tensions rise, and the typical motions of getting lost and feeling hopeless emerge. Oh, and lest we forget, there might be a witch out there hunting the witch hunters?While I had admitted I wasn't frightened in this movie, this type of movie or pretty much any ghost stories, such as the weak "found footage series of the next generation" Paranormal Activity franchise, I found the built up tension, comradery between the cast of three, the comedy, cinematography, music and dialogue real enough. They actually convinced me  and this is a rarity, for me  that if I had believed in ghosts, etc, I would absolutely have fallen for the ruse the marketing team came up with. And perhaps, it would've been even more fun to watch it. But, then again, I'm really too smart for that.Sadly, since, again, there has been countless, and mostly insipid found footage films since, if one were to watch this today, for the first time, they might be jaded and dislike it. I can dig that; but for those who pretty much started here, I'm sure there are more people that enjoyed this. For, I did love this movie and still today do.Side Note: It helps I had/have a major crush on the actor and character "Mike." Now, I wouldn't have rated the movie higher just because of my attraction, but it sure as hell helped while watching this. Further, and again not a star up or down in my rating, I would've preferred in a movie that basically only featured THREE actors, that Mike would have been shown more. It seems like the percentage of on screen time: (the bitch) Heather: 40%, Josh: 35% and Mike: 25%. Oh, well; that's why they made pause.
It's Unknown how many people actually saw this good movie. Ha  sorry.Let's officially begin with: I liked this movie. Sure, it's comparable to Taken, but beyond the lead star, Liam Neeson and that it's an American/international thriller, they couldn't be further apart. It's tight (under two hours,) the suspense builds all the way to the closing credits and it's beautifully shot.While attending a conference in Berlin, Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) and wifey Elizabeth (January Jones) an accident leaves Martin in a coma. When he does awake from the coma  oooh, that's not part of the suspense, but I'm glad you were on your toes  his wife doesn't recognize him. Worse, there's another Dr. Martin Harris!He may be wrong himself about who he is, due to the head injury he suffered when his cab went into the water. Only the (of course, beautiful female) cab driver, Gina, (Diane Kruger) can help him rediscover his roots and why people are trying to, wait for itkill him!The movie plays out on that premise and Martin has to put the pieces together, just as the audience until the finale revolutions.It's not perfect, in fact, for the most part, it seems soamateurish. I'm referring to the reasons behind everyone's motivations and the number of players involved. It felt like a sophomoric project, as if the writers had completed their initial independent film and they're on their way. Perhaps, they will besome day.It is very light entertainment with some good action scenes  but DO NOT let the advertisements fool you: (again) this is NOT Taken, this is NOT action-packed. In fact, despite what the movie is, I really did want his Bryan Mills (From Taken) to show his stuff and kick butt. Alas, it's not that movie.
I love great cinematography, but much like a great soundtrack, neither make a movie great. How can two great stars agree to such a bore as 'The Tourist' (1.5/5 Stars)? Besides the obvious "free Venice vacation"  in addition to being paid for it, mind you, I can't think of a logical reason. These two showed zero chemistry, had zero good lines and both led us to one of the most obvious conclusions in the "trick" of a finale. Sure, Angelina looked gorgeous (Johnny, not so much) and the scenery was crisp and absolutely breathtaking  much like Angelina, but both leads looked as tired and bored with the so-called script. In addition, it didn't seem to know what kind of movie it wanted to be: deep espionage? Beautiful romance? Kooky slapstick? Sadly, which ever the wheel of misfortunate landed on, the director/writer failed. Question: as much of a Johnny Depp fan I used to be, did the 'Pirate's movies go to his head so far that he feels he just needs to show up to sell tickets? I mean, unbelievably, this movie costs $100,000,000. WHERE DID THAT MONEY GO?!? Any independent film maker who is not fully vested in maintaining a long-term career could make this bore for under $25k. Tops. There are far better tourist destinations if you want a romantic spy thriller. Heck, even the weakest James Bond entry had far better entertainment value.
Typically, I would be very pleased with a movie with a run time of under 1½ hours, but unfortunately 9 seems so incredibly underdeveloped, it should be either longer, or end with "To Be Continued" Sure, I'm aware this was based on what many consider a superior short film, but given the fact, the makers could expand and develop and chose not to, is probably one of the biggest disappointments of this movie.Don't get me wrong; the graphics, scenery, adventure were extremely well crafted. Too bad I can't be like most of my friends and peers and just go to the movies for eye candy. I demand (for the money spent and time invested) some depth, character development, originality and fleshed out plot lines. To be honest, this movie held none of those. The whole movie felt like it could've been explained in 3-4 three-panel comic strips.And that's sad. There was opportunity here and I really wanted to like the movie more. I wanted to get invested with the characters and story and root for a solid conclusion. (Spoiler  there's barely an ending, much less a reasonable and hopeful finish.) I couldn't root for anyone here. Not one character was original or given enough time to distinguish themselves. You either had the main character "9" who is either incredibly stupid, a slow-learner or made out to be a "Luke Skywalker" but fails as he lacks a drop of charisma or enough background to care about him. Or you have the annoying and bossy "1" who's only two qualities are acting like Dr. Smith from Lost in Space or the ability to show why the human race isn't around. In addition, you have the "Smart" twins and the tough chick. And so on.Before you go further and state I didn't get the point to having nine different, uh "heroes" or dolls, or why they all had different personalities, I did watch the movie and know why they do. The explanation given doesn't lessen the fact that they were any less creative, original or cliché.Basically in this extremely short cartoon, it's the post apocalyptic future after, YOU GUESSED IT!, a war of Machines vs. Humans. The only survivors are now heading up a new battle: Machines Vs. Dolls. "9" awakes and after a half second of learning to walk and that he's alive, he means up with "2" who quickly shows friendship but speedily gets taken away. Next, he's thrust into the underworld of some of the remaining dolls and with light speed, he devises a plan to rescue "2" with "5." But, after a split-second decision, he inadvertently sets off a fast chain of events that swiftly builds a machine that threatens the other survivors.See where I am going with this? You get a jist of a plot-line and before you can digest, you're thrown into the next scene. 9 could've been a much better movie if they gave the characters or story time to breath. Even without this downfall, I still can't fully recommend since despite its yearning to have a "moral" or "message" it's not appropriate for all ages. Heck, they barely made it friendly enough to have the doll tie-ins at Wendy's.
Every time I sit down to revisit Ghostbusters, and that's not too often, sadly, I keep forgetting how incredible and richly funny this movie was. So much so, it should never be considered an adventure or supernatural action movie up front; it should, by and far, be under the comedy section. And I'm not just talking about the key and well-known shots as the funniest ones occur when there's barely anything on screen but Bill Murray's comic genius delivery.While I might have seen this in theatres  I was only ten when released, I don't recall. Unfortunately, my family viewed very few films back in the early eighties and I didn't start my movie obsession until the late eighties. I know I caught it somewhere, sometime following the release and did like it, but never, ever appreciated it until I got older. I don't think I was alone in that appreciation of this fantastic film.Yes, the movie made a ton. Sure, it was a bona fide summer blockbuster. But, I think people just expected such quality back then, they probably had no idea how influential, how deep the lines and comedy was or the impact. For, I see dozens of summer movies over the past and recent decade or so, that are strictly made for profit. Made to be released, one after the next, while not caring it will fizzle after a couple of weeks to a month and then featured in a Redbox a couple of months later. Movies with very little heart inserted, too much CGI and less care taken. Despite just "being a comedy," Ghostbusters was made correctly, down to the core.Three paranormal doctors/buddies at a university find themselves out on the street in New York just as their ghost theories become reality. Hilariously gathering the funds to make it big in the Big Apple, they open the Ghostbusters pest control business and take offeventually.One of their first clients is Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver,) a tough, but vulnerable broad who has an extra visitor in her refrigerator. While 1/3 'Buster at the time, Peter (Murray,) is more infatuated with her than her ghost fridge, they do follow up on her story while simultaneously capturing ghosts in the city and rise to fame.Her storyline might be more of final clue for the upside in business for the Ghostbusters and then things get real.Above all else in this movie was the flawless performance from Murray. While every single actor involved was also fantastic, namely Harold Ramis as Egon and Weaver's Dana, Murray's Peter was pitch-perfect. His deadpan humor was so great, that I almost feel guilty for not appreciating Dan Aykroyd's Raymond role more, or Rick Moranis and Annie Potts in their third-tier, but important characters.Don't get me wrong; on the whole, they all did great. I just couldn't keep my focus much further than Murray during this film.Beyond Murray and the wonderful supporting cast, was the infamous and beloved title song ('in' due to the countless times it was played,) a good score, special effects decent for the times and fairly good cinematography.This movie screamed what I love about Summer Blockbusters, but haven't seen in about two decades. Sure, there have been plenty of great films; fun and exciting and memorable films. But, rarely will I see one that's more heart than just trying for the Box Office dollar. I miss these types of movies.Well, I don't have to any more. For, I bought this one on BluRay and can revisit the "good ole days" any time I feel like it. Recommended!
I make some mistakes on some of the repeat viewings I have of movies. A few years back, I re-watched Jackie Brown and immediately named it my favorite Tarantino film. And this was after the release of Kill Bill Vol. 1-2 but before both Death Proof and Inglourious Basterds. Though, Jackie Brown remains an almost excellent film, I take back my statement. Besides, I get a lot of flack from my friends who always seem to name either Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction as their favorite.Okay, I'm getting off the subject. Jackie Brown is an excellent film in reference to acting, dialogue, suspense and character depth. My problem, and the reason it's no longer my favorite Tarantino effort, is the length and his simple desire to never edit anything out, or so it seems. Recently, I watched Inglourious Basterds in the theatres and that one, too, I had the problem with the drawn out scenes. (Side Note: I've been bashed pretty hard on that one, but I guess I do have little patience for very slow moving movies. Not all Tarantino movies are, but almost all (if not all) of M. Night Shyamalan and Michael Mann's movies are. I try to avoid those two directors at all costs.) This movie should have been cut down, and by a lot. Such as a minimum of 30 minutes to make a much more tight and suspenseful film.Regardless of that argument, it's the acting and dialogue that shines the most for me. I've never been privy to see any of Grier's work, but I absolutely loved her in this movie. Every motion she made, the nervousness, the human side to her lying/trickery was played out perfectly. But not just her, Forster (another, I haven't seen too much of to make an opinion outside of this film) had such depth, even with barely moving his face or body. You could tell he was just plain tired. Worn out.As for the rest of the performances, they were also top notch. We already know Robert De Niro will go down as one of the greatest actors of all time, but I think his turn in this movie shocked the heck out of me. Clarification: it was the most original performance I've seen of his career, something completely different and despite him not being 100% likable, it was the range De Niro had that enthralled me.Fonda and Keaton were also good, but there was yet another well done job by a personal favorite: Samuel L. Jackson. Sure, on the surface, it looks like he's playing every other role he's played, as he often does. But, here he certainly adds depth, and you can see how his demeanor changes as the stakes are raised. Also, the fantastic lines he spoke helps make this one of his best performances ever.(Spoilers follow) After a rather long opening, we learn of Ordell's (Jackson) gun-selling empire, his girl-keeping properties and his $500,000-hidden money in Cabo. Two of his minions get into trouble and Ordell gets to business to get them out of jail to eliminate them. One's easy: Beaumont (Tucker) but the other has a lot more to lose and gain, Jackie Brown (Grier.) She's a fast-thinking, smooth criminal who convinces three sets of people to help her better her situation, i.e. taking off with the half million.Group 1: the cops who are more interested in nabbing Ordell. Group 2: the bail bondsman responsible for setting both Beaumont and her free and is obviously smitten with her. And Group 3: Ordell, himself, and his gang of lowlifes. Watching her move/use her magic on the various people is part of her and the movie's charm. Will she, or even, could she get away with this without ending up like Beaumont on the slab? This is a must-see for Tarantino fans, but beyond that, anyone that loves character and plot driven stories, like myself. Throw in some awesome tunes and dialogue, and you have a near-perfect movie.Side Note: Yeah, I know I said the opening was rather long  but I'm referring to after the immediate opening credits with Jackie on her way to work. It may seem simplistic to some, but just her standing still, while moving, in conjunction with that amazing song, Across 110th Street, is absolutely one of my favorite opening credit scenes of all time.
It's my fault with this viewing of Rec that I can't remember if I originally saw the US remake, Quarantine only, or the original, Rec, before. I know I saw one (or both) of them a while back. And as I watched this incredibly short and tight movie, I became convinced that either I did see this Rec before, or I saw Quarantine, which would then be a shot-by-shot exact replica of the foreign film: Rec. (Side Note: I just now watched the trailer for Quarantine and it is, in fact, 100% lifted scenes from Rec.)Okay, I'm confused, or confusing, but either way, I will stick with what I'm (you're) here for: a review of Rec.As mentioned, it's short and tight, and thoroughly paced and entertaining, for this virus/zombie genre, that is. You have to be a fan of the 28 Days/Weeks Later and Cloverfield variety of films, i.e. flesh-eating virus/living dead or hand-held cameras, or at very least, have a strong stomach. You also must endure endless subtitles (if you don't understand Spanish) while the action/shaky camera is in constant motion.Pass all those tests, and you might enjoy this feature as I did.Late at night, a wannabe (more) video news reporter, Angela (Velasco) is assigned to the graveyard firemen shift to see "what happens when you sleep." After what appears to be a very long introduction, in such a quick movie, you'll find out, it's better not to know what happens when you doze.The firemen, and camera crew receive a call to a inner-city apartment complex stemming from a call of a woman screaming in her apartment. They break in, and get attacked  by the stereotypical vicious/rabid bite on the neck. Anyone's familiar with the above mentioned films, 28 Days/Weeks Later, knows what to expect. But, for those brand new, they'll show you the confusion, outbreak and laughable attempts at containment from those inside.What's new is the quick response (not found in nearly any Night of the Living Dead/virus films or those types) of the police/medical/disease crews outside that seal off the place weeks faster than FEMA could only dream of. This doesn't help those trapped inside with the quickly spreading germ that makes humans into Cujo fans.Little to no explanation is given to why this is happening, but Angela demands that the every scene is shot, no matter the battery can't possibly last in the camera used to document this tragedy. Skipping right over that flaw, chaos from the confused, frightened and cornered apartment complex dwellers doesn't end as they're picked off one by one.The finale gives some well needed background, but as in 97.8% of these movies, what's left unknown is the writer's desire to scare us more. Personally, (kind of a spoiler here) I would love for once, that they do not only explain it, but end on a happy note. Just once. Please. Okay, fine, they sorta did for Outbreak, and that's the weakest one. In my defense/desire, Outbreak was meant for more mainstream and a happier movie, whereas I'm referring to darker tales, like Rec, that end with some simmer of hope.Nevertheless, this is a great movie for what it is. Some of the scenes (and I won't ruin them) shocked me the second the happened as I didn't expect it. I liked the originality/turn of an already long-list of zombie/virus movies.What I didn't like was having to read the movie  and boy, they wouldn't shut up for a few seconds so we can enjoy the thrills and scares  when so much is happening. Additionally, in the closing, we're expected to read a lot of what's on a wall. They'll give you some translation, but not all. Sure, that's my bad for taking French in High School over Spanish  duh, I live in Arizona. I was a dumb kid.Rec wasn't groundbreaking, but is a definite must see even if you're only a drive-by fan of neck-biting, disease spreading horror.
Ah-hem. Pardon me, but how the f&ck did Skyline get a theatrical release?I thought we were past the days of releasing the Syfy crap movies onto the big screen? I thought we evolved enough to test screen films to avoid the next generation seeing a buck ninety-eight version of Independence Day or a freebee of Cloverfield? And I thought D-List stars belong on The Smoking Gun, as they, themselves, will tell you?Shot for $10 million, though I think that's exaggerated tenfold, Skyline tells the same ole alien invasion story with fighting and running amok rich, pretty kids you don't care about  again, see Cloverfield  but ohhh, they add a twist: now there's a blue light-special that causes the puny humans to "feel powerful" while being sucked into the alien's hand or whatever it is.That's pretty much it. For the storyline on Skyline, that is. Not that it mattered to them. They got a neat digital video camera  oh, goddamn that digital video camera  and some software to create, in their defense, some good special effect laced aliens.Throw in the grade-school acting, amateurish dialogue, zero-depth characters, null tension, cinematography from a film school drop-out and the predictable scale maxed out and there you go: you have the Saturday Night Syfy movie to stay in for those without dates. Minus the good special effects, of course.The standout performances have to be both Eric Balfour and Donald Faison, though the rest of the cast had me rolling with obviously unintentional laughter. Balfour (24, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)) is just awful in any project he partakes, so please, PLEASE, stop trying to get him to act or show range. And Faison (Scrubs) made me laugh because it didn't seem like he left the satirical world of comedy, even when he's trying to be serious in this scaaaary alien take-over film.I really don't know much else to report of this turd. Okay, I'm being too harsh, perhaps. Because, again, there was the good creature-feature effects and oneONEscene made me jump (SEE: first car out) but neither was a good enough excuse to make a direct-to-DVD hit the big screens. Or even be green-lit.
The Bourne Supremacy really wasn't the best of the three and screams "bridge movie." That being said, it was still an over-the-top exciting, thrilling, action-packed (boy, do I sound like someone who wants his quotes on the movie poster) film with above-par acting, suspense, intrigue and mind-blowing cinematography. Even though I call it, and it really is, a bridge movie between The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Ultimatum it's still highly recommended. While 'Identity' really is a standalone film, Supremacy sets the scene/mood: (no spoiler, as not only does it take place in the first 15 minutes, it's the basis for the last two sequels) Bourne is living in India with his love from the first film, Marie, who gets killed and Bourne is thrown out of semi-retirement to continue his amnesia-breaking quest, seek revenge and undercover the conspiracy of his beginning. Along the way, he's all over the globe, as is the CIA who believes he's part of an assassination and must be shut down, permanently. The best part is they introduce a new important character (of many) to the series: Pam Landy, played perfectly by the great Joan Allen, one of my all-time favorite actresses. She steals every scene she's in and enormously enhances the film and plot. Not to overshadow Damon, who continues to do wonders for his action-packed career builder role of Bourne. Sure, you'll have to suspend your disbelief, but what the (new) director brings to the table is a ton of action, feeling, heart and a true spy thriller not seen in years. True, Identity holds the honor of the best of the trilogy, and Ultimatum is oodles better, you still have to see Supremacy to get a better understanding of Bourne's mission.
Charlize Theron delivers yet another fascinating performance in Young Adult. Too bad the movie was as clichéd as her writer-character.Don't get me wrongI liked the movie. But, it wasn't all that original. Sure, it had its moments, but the whole "My Best Friend's Wedding" theme was way too evident and the outcome even more foretold.Once, I loved a performance by Nicole Kidman in To Die For. Come to think of it, I had the same impression: GREAT acting job (by Kidman), so-so film. Further, I felt Kidman needed to be nominated for best actress, but alas she wasn't. Neither was Theron for Young Adult. Shame.But, since we can't take a Delorean back in time and force the Academy to do the right thing, we should just get the word out that Theron was worth watching in this. Oh, and Patton Oswalt also did a good job  but I wouldn't go as far as to nominate him.Ghost writer and total mess Mavis (Theron) ventures back to her hometown she hates in order to reclaim her lost-love Buddy (Patrick Wilson.) She's well-hated there as much as she hates back, but befriends a disabled nerd (thanks to a mistaken hate-crime) Matt (Patton Oswalt) who gives her all the right moves we know she'll ignore. It's obvious Matt's fond of her, but will she choose the right path? Duh.Theron does her best to show us how bad (and absolutely beautiful) she is. It's a great performance because we truly believe how screwed up she is and how a "celebrity" isn't above sanity. But, unfortunately, it's like the already-established writer, Juno's Diablo Cody, thought of her first, and then wrote the story around her. That's not a good idea. Even The Dark Knight had better sense to write a great story that involved that great character of the Joker, but didn't rely solely on that nemesis.The movie has a good feel, shot well and, as mentioned, has the fantastic performance of Theron, but overall, it's been done before. Many times. It's worth a watch for her and Oswalt, but if you're looking for more depth, and hilarity, just stick with the original: My Best Friend's Wedding. At least, you'll get a good feeling following the endingand even more realistic.
Talk with most guys, at least ones around my age and they'll tell you they're Goodfellas fans. In addition, or subtraction, they'll also mention Scarface and, no doubt, The Godfather I, II or both. (Laughably, no one ever seems to bring up III without wincing.) Me? I'm gambling Casino will be my mobster movie for all my days.It's a safe bet. Revisiting Casino, for the first time in probably a decade, is like visiting an old friend. And for three hours, it's a ride I can't wait to take again. For, I've done it many times before.I'm not one to like very long movies, or movies that move slowly  and before I go further, this is NOT one that ever moves a bit slowly. But, ever since it came out on video (originally on VHS, back then) I couldn't help myself. I literally watched this three-hour movie over and over. And over. To the point sometimes, when it went to credits, I would insert tape one (yeah, again, VHS, humph!) and start from the beginning.I lovedand STILL DOthis movie so much, in so many ways, it was easy for me to continuously watch it. With this third purchase  VHS, DVD and now, BluRay, I can't wait to plug it to experience it another time.This movie is so near perfect on so many levels and depths, it's hard to sum it all up in one review. The movie's onion layers keep surprising me with each viewing. And it's bonus of two movies in one is fantastic.Movie One, or the first half, is made up of all-but fantastic, interesting and driven narration of how casinos work, the rise of the two best friends/street guys and the mobsters in 1970's Las Vegas. From all my research and first-hand experience, this mentality of the 1970's is fairly close to what it is today. In fact, it's almost dead-on. Naturally, some things do NOT happen today  the place is now like Disneyland: any bad press is VERY bad for the place. So, good luck in smashing a cheater's hands and not having a hundred reporters/bloggers tearing apart your casino the same hour.Movie Two involves every bit of the mistakes these guys made in order to eventually rid Las Vegas of the mob. (There's a lot more to it than from this movie, but for this story, it's centered on these wise guys.) Originally, when I watched this countless times, I narrowed it down to one main slip-up: the firing of a connected relative. But, examining it this time, there were so many nudges to their house of cards, it's hard to add them all up. Each and every bump to the base playing cards had an involvement to everyone's downfall.To top it all off, it's enormously interesting, fun, exciting and suspenseful to see how this well-laid based on true events played out. Oh, and I haven't even gotten to the acting.I never once saw Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods (amongst others) on the screen. Ever. These people were truly Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, Nicky Santoro, Ginger McKenna and Lester Diamond, respectively. How each of these excellent performances did NOT win Oscars is beyond me. Actually, while we're at it, how the movie didn't get nominated for, and win, for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Score, etc...baffles me.I digress. These performances were mesmerizing. Each in their own way. All the way down to James Woods, whom I felt did the best of his career and Sharon Stone showing incredible depth.Beyond the incredible feats by the actors was the brilliant direction, cinematography, story, score, soundtrack and pacing. Never did this movie feel slow, nor did I ever "check the time counter" because it's nearly three hours. The movie just kept going and on the right course. The plot unfolds as it needs to and the recounting of events and voice-overs were just as interesting as what was on screen.This movie was so powerful, as were the performances, that I almost rooted for De Niro's Ace. His gal, Ginger (Stone,) not so much. On a side note, she was fairly despicable and we wouldn't have hated her so much, if not for Stone's great take on her. (Or, again, the weasel, Woods as Lester.)Normally, I would absolutely and readily admit that I love this movie ten times more than the already very good Goodfellas or Godfather series because I am a gambler and have always (since early teens) been infatuated with Las Vegas and its history. It would be obvious that I'm naturally biased because of the reasons just mentioned. But, I am being honest: past my obsession with both gambling and Vegas, I loved this movie on all levels. Yes, it does help that this gives me a much more in-depth view of a certain segment of Vegas' past, I still love the journey Director Martin Scorsese gives me eachand...every time.
I skipped this movie in the theatres for several reasons: I'm not into sci-fi that much, I couldn't pronounce the name and damn, it did NOT look original in the slightest. I can say, Elysium did not disappoint...in those categories.Okay, admittedly, I had a slightly good time here. It's a completely leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature with barely acceptable acting and dialogue and good special effects. The action and story is absolutely nothing new, the character depth is minimal at best and stillit's a tad bit fun. Namely with side character/actor: Julio (Diego Luna.) Even he wasn't fresh, but still interesting (and cute) enough.Surprise! We've destroyed the world, once again and for the millionth time, in the future and the privileged rest comfortably in a space station above the Earth. In a shocking twist  not really, but for those who've seen maybe 2 movies in their life  there's a power struggle up there and the poor want in, regardless.One thing I definitely appreciate about Director/Writer Neill Blomkamp of District 9 fame, is his love of the antihero up front. In this case, it's Matt Daaaay-mon's Max. He does have an additional level of depth to his character and he's right there with Julio with some specs of characters to watch in an overly blah story.Sure, okay, the special effects are somewhat good, not great, nor spectacular. In fact, I expected more from what I was shown in District 9. But, they were good, nonetheless.I can see why this movie bombed. I cannot believe for a second that Blomkamp thought this was something new. None of it is. There's not a fresh aspect of this entire movie. It's a wasted effort from an obviously talented man. Sadly, for a no-name (so far,) he's gotta do a lot better than this to make him a real-name.* * * Final thoughts: Despite all I wrote above, still, it's worth a Saturday-in night at the movies. It's not a complete waste and fun when you do, in fact, leave your brain at the door and forget the countless other movies just like this.
Sorry, I know it's not real, but I'd rather watch the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie again than the "true" pirates movie, Captain Phillips.Now, this is nothing against the real people who went through this or any others that have gone through a similar experience, but frankly, I was all-but bored. And perplexed.A ship containing millions, or more, worth of merchandise and is "guarded" by men with barely a hand gun, a few hoses and a walkie-talkie is just plain bad management. Probably things have changed with more and more pirate attacks, but I'm either too lazy or too uninterested to research that. All I know is what they showed me in thisincredibly dull take over film.And why call the movie "Captain Phillips?" Is he supposed to be such an unbelievably deep and/or heroic person? Let's see what he did in this movie (this synopsis does contain some spoilers):Captain Rich puts his crew on a drill. They get attacked. Cap manages to get them out of trouble. They're attacked, more successfully this time. Cap hides his men, gets kidnapped and needs some rescuin'.Granted, some of that is pretty good. Amazing? No. I've seen more heroics from other "based on a true stories" and even some of those are just dramatic football films.But, the scenery is good, the acting isn't great, but acceptable and it was a well-shot film. It just barely held my interest and always puzzled me throughout on why the film was called his name.* * * Final thoughts: Sure, the lead pirate, Barkhad Abdi, received an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Role. Did he earn it? Hell no. He was so just mediocre in this, I think the Academy just didn't watch more than five movies this year so they had limited options. Oh, and incidentally, if he didn't shut that mouth, mine was going to open, but only to vomit. Damn, no one wants to see all your teeth and entire jaw!
Need for Speed is a great movie with a very enjoyable storyline and a very talented cast.The story is certainly nothing new or original,and the trailers don't make it seem like its going to be any different to the Fast and Furious movies but it is very enjoyable and dosen't feel like a carbon copy of previous car related films.What made this movie for me was its extremely confident cast,I am a huge fan of Aaron Paul,because of Breaking Bad of course,and I didn't think he would be able to deliver the same level of great acting as he does in Breaking Bad,but,while Tobey Marshall is certainly not Jesse Pinkman,he still delivers an outstanding performance,he clearly has a great movie career ahead of him and this is his first film since Breaking Bad finished,and there's no doubt he has more great performances ahead of him.I also really enjoyed Imogen Potts and Dominic Copper's performance,these are two actors I've heard of,but haven't seen in anything previously,but after seeing them in this I look forward to seeing them in more films.After he is let out of prison,Tobey Marshall sets out to seek revenge against the man who framed him for the death of his friend.
Wowand to think I almost gave up on the old Bond after finishing From Russia with Love. But, I somehow knew it would get better and long before the modern Bond that I prefer.Goldfinger, while silly at spots and anti-woman Bond was in full swing, was fun, adventurous, started with a bang, had decent action, the best theme song  so far, hilarious at spots, depth and shortened and tight, finally. In fact, even though this is only Part III, this is the closest to the newest Bond adventures of the original three. And that's a good thing for one that grew up on Dalton and Brosnan.I think they finally realized, while the first two might be closer to reality, that's not what we go to the movies for. So, in turn, Connery finally does more than just smirk to get through this chapter. He begins the movie with a raid, a dame, some fights, explosions and funny lines. He continues with a holiday turned small mission that turns into something moregolden.After his 5-minute love affair turns for the worst, he's set to spy on tycoon Goldfinger, played wonderfully by Gert Fröbe, and spends most of the movie side-by-side with him. That, I liked. It was nice seeing the visible villain and hero sharing the same space.Likewise, I adored the best Bond girl to date with the best Bond girl name to date: Pussy Galore (a delicious Honor Blackman.) They finally gave not one, but two (including Shirley Eaton as rifle-toting Jill Masterson) Bond girls spines.Oh, and last but not least we have the hilariously bad Oddjob (Harold Sakata) who immediately reminded me of the shoe-throwing villain in Austin Powers. And I said "not least" because I have to shout out for the machine-gun-granny-guard. She was great.Bond's not undercover, but captive while he tries to thwart and outsmart Goldfinger's evil plan. It's a fun and action packed (at least, for 1965) adventure that, if this would have been my first introduction to Bond, I would be a fan for life.Some of the lines were extremely memorable and fun, the gadgets present, the theme was nicely taken from the good title track and the cinematography very good  especially the Alps and the car chase, from the outside, that is. It's not perfect, and a little hokey for today's standards, but I still had a ball and I'd say see this one, definitely.(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the "odd one out": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)
While I was happy to finally see a male-oriented film series  and yeah, even before the last half hour of "To Be Continued!" scenes  in a female dominated marketplace (the Twilight "saga," The Hunger Games and Divergent) this movie all-but completely blew.Aside from The Maze Runner being a blatant rip-off of the superior Cube film, or its sequels, it was so incredibly bland, run-of-the- mill, predictable and A-B-C, I actually fell asleep during the movie. It didn't help that the movie was twenty minutes too long and that I knew what scene would take place four scenes ahead.During the movie I was absolutely giving it the benefit of the doubt. Without so much as telling us this was "Part One" of a trilogy (or four movies, depending on how well the first one does and they inevitably split the last movie into two so they can milk the series our longer than it needs, i.e. The Hunger Games, Harry Potter and Twilight,) the movie seemed to take its long time to explain everything out in extreme detail of their world. I was trying to be as patient as possible when I knew this was a necessity since this is a sci-fi, futuristic test for young boys.But, the rest of the movie played out this way. As if in narration form. They constantly had to tell us and remind us of the world they're referring to in the very movie they're showing us. I get it. I got it. And unfortunately, they we're showing me anything new.So, I waited and waited for something fresh. Some new take. Nope. And worse, as mentioned above, the last half-hour was NOTHING but setting up the inevitable sequels. I am getting ahead of myself since I haven't mentioned the synopsis. Very basically, once a month, a new young male recruit is transported into the middle of an obscenely large maze. He has memory loss and must have the entire plot be explained to him so he can integrate with the other males. They've been there between 3 years and present day and must make it through a hefty and unexplainably moving maze to get back to where they don't remember they've come from.Naturally, our "hero," Thomas, is THE ONE to help them get free. With little explanation and in one of the most pointless plots of recent movies, he joins forces with one of the most uncharismatic of all females  the first girl to join the group. Hilariously enough, she looks incredibly similar to Kristen Stewart of her Twilight series. Just like Bella, Stewart's bland heroine from Twilight, this one offers nothing to the table and is so hard to root for. In fact, it appears this endless rock-throwing female was only introduced to attract more female viewers.And that is a huge part of the problems here. While, again, I am glad to finally see a male-dominated teeny-bop series, not one single character had the charisma of any of the other series. Yeah, I'm not a huge Harry Potter or Hunger Games fan, but each of those had characters I rooted for and wanted to see succeed. This Maze Runner had one, and he was absolutely a second or third tier fella: Chuck. But, then again, if you've seen The Sandlot, he was the same guy who called that main character "Smalls."With virtually no one to root for, a story as old as time, decent special effects but barely used and predictable scenes from beginning to no-conclusion, this movie is highly UN-recommended. Granted, it's not the worst movie I've seen in a long while and definitely not the worst of 2014 so far, it will be so forgettable, they will be regretting they only made this movie to be part of a trilogy that should never be completed.* * *Final thoughts: If you're thinking of beginning this so-so franchise, either do one of two things: Wait for this to all come to home- viewing and have a boring, nothing weekend to get through them all or just rent/buy/stream the superior Cube series. Essentially, they're the same movie, but Cube had a tenth of the budget with ten times the heart, originality, imagination, suspense and characters than The Maze Runner had at any given moment.
Anyone who still subscribes to the flawed theory: Sequels are NEVER better than the originals, better leave the room now.Much like other retro movies like Freddy Vs. Jason, The Expendables 2 has to be refreshing to all those who grew up in the 1980s with these muscle men. This should've very well been the first movie in the series, but since that's neither here, nor there, allow me to exclaim: I fraking loved this movie, and I wasn't even the biggest fan of these guys back then.This is the Piranha 3D of 2012: the movie never lied about what it was all about and gave us all everything we wanted. Such as a straight-line plot, hilarious lines, great action and quick-to-the-point scenarios. This movie absolutely started with a bang, never let up and got progressively better until the outright 1980s/1990s fantastic climax. I cannot express how much I had a blast during this.And this is coming from someone who loves originality and unpredictable films, of which this was neither. Again, this movie provided everything to satisfy a decades old combo-pack of action stars. As stated, this reminded me a lot of Piranha 3D: Everything that was foreseen for people who grew up loving those types of movies was granted.I wanted to see the stars Jason Statham, Sylvester Stallone and Randy Couture show their awesome moves (namely, my favorite action star of the entire cast, Statham  he was awesome) and co-stars, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Jet Li all kick ass, and they did. Further, I've never been a Jean-Claude Van Damme fan, but was welcoming his signature kick. And this, I proclaim, is my very first Chuck Norris film I've seen. Despite him not front-running the show, it's still my first (and enjoyable) experience of his on screen presence.When the only thing that disappointed me was the extreme lack of Jet Li and no Jackie Chan invited to the party  I mean, c'mon guys!  then, I know the positives surely outweighed the measly negatives.The plot  ha, this is a purposely retread of all of those involved's past movies  is fairly simple: to settle a debt, the D-Team must retrieve an object, lose it and seek revenge and redemption and become heroes.I probably would've hated such a clichéd movietwenty-thirty years ago. And I usually did. But, when you make it such a tongue-in-cheek and fun ride such as this, you can't help but smile and enjoy the trip.Recap: The Expendables (2010): 2/5 Stars. The Expendables 2 (2012): 4/5 Stars. Hmm, not all sequels are inferior.And even with the inevitable The Expendables 3, and there's nothing I can do to stop that, I hope they take the lessons learned here: Continue to have fun making it, take nothing serious and remember Jackie Chan's still alive!
I also miss when found footage was lost. But, then again, of the 20, or so it seems, cheap found footage movies released each year, one usually is good. Only one.2012's was V/H/S. It finally took a spin  no pun  on the now overused genre and combined it with the classic anthology story. And very nicely, especially since they seemed to touch a lot of the horror genres as of late using an old format with creative ways.Basically, there are five completely separate stories and one wraparound. I will list my thoughts on these from best to worst. And by worst, I mean only one was meh; the rest were good to really rocks.1. "Amateur Night." Funny, when I watched, though didn't review, V/H/S a while back, I watched this one and thought it was just okayuntil the sh|t hit the fan. Pretty much, I sat up and paid attention when the secret and horror is revealed. It helped there was full frontal male nudity, but that was incidental to the horror in the hotel room. And those bug eyesdamn!2. "10/31/98" Not so clever title and I'm not one for exorcism/haunted house stories, but this one rocked and is a VERY close second to "Amateur Night." A plausible story, a great house, very creepy and excellent graphics. Especially  again  for someone who doesn't get spooked easily or constantly rolls eyes with these types of stories.3. "Tuesday the 17th." I grew up with Jason at Camp Crystal Lake. Okay, I didn't, personally, but his films, yes. So, this incredible twist on that genre, though not 100% of what I wanted, worked for me. It was also great as a short. Just enough to peak interest and move onto the next story in this overall movie. Again, helps that the cutest of the two guys gets nakedI have a one track mind.4. "Tape 56"  The Wraparound. While not great, it's interesting enough. To be honest, I wasn't sure how it completed endedand this is from two separate viewings. I have an idea, and it does help the overall multi-genre theme. You have despicable guys and inevitable deaths. So, no hard feelings.5. "The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger." Too long a title for an "okay" story. Reminded me a lot of what The Twilight Zone would've been with an R-Rating. Interesting to a fault, but way too confusing and easy, yet creepy conclusion.6. "Second Honeymoon." Good for being in AZ (don't see that often,) mentioning an unexpected Vegas stop, theGRAND CANYON! hello! and one extremely creepy, though unexpected twist half way through, but overall boring. I get the "other main twist" at the ending, but way too much build up for just that. Sure, he was cute, but this is the weakest of all entries. Mercifully, it's early in the show and perfectly placed because after the great first segment ("Amateur Night") you don't know what to expect following. And you have many more parts that get progressively better.Overall, I did like this whole movie and it was a nice break from the last time I saw it  I had forgotten some of the twists, so it was like seeing it for the first time. It's not one I would want to watch repeatedly, but every once in awhile, I would like to revisit. Especially without reading my own review and being surprised again. See it!
In the pre-Saw independent days of 1998 (actually, released outside of the USA in 1997) was a wildly original and inventive film called Cube. I saw this many years ago and loved it. However, after rewatching it, I feel it definitely deserves a solid eight out of ten stars.Why it lost the full 2 stars (I originally gave it) to drop it to four was just two factors: serious overacting at times and the most depressing finale. No, I won't spoil the climax, per se, but you're grasping throughout the movie for an ounce of hope and need something to pick you up. The rug's pulled, so in a sense, you fall instead of rise.That said, and despite the size of the set the actors are all-but exclusively in, I loved the camera work/cinematography. Unlike Saw with its flashbacks  I think total now 900,000 from the first movie to date (Part VI), this movie shot in the metal rooms had to be a challenge. They did a great job. Also, I love puzzles, and this movie is full of them. Finally, (despite the sequels) I loved not knowing the big picture  I.E. how the characters came here, who built the place. This placed you in more tension like the cast.Several men and women awake in a puzzle of identical "cubes" or perfect metallic, square rooms, each side (including floor and ceiling) contains a portal to the next, seemingly similar dungeon. But, beware! There are traps abroad and it's these somewhat unrelated and unwilling participants must decipher a way out, room by room. And they must work together to achieve freedom as they start dying off one by one, each in a new and inventively gruesome manner. (I.E. the Saw reference. Saw's writers Leigh Whannell and James Wan must have got a lot of ideas from watching Cube.) As much as the movie contains suspense in spades, I am super glad they decided not to continue the movie past 90 minutes. It's obviously a two set movie (two cubes built side by side) and though they added depth to the characters, they really could only take this so far.For lovers of suspense, claustrophobic horror, character study, numbers (you'll have to refresh on your math skills before or after) and small, indie films with quality, I would highly recommend this movie.
1. Unbelievably, it isn't a Writer's Guild violation to complete a screenplay on used toilet paper. 2. Bloody stripper poles simply cannot be a turn on, but, the show must go on.3. In this case, yes, you would have to be a rocket scientist to understand this movie.4. Even the Smurf movies didn't have this much blue in it.5. Fun medical fact #1: hand sawed off? Finger mysteriously detached? Wrap a towel around the stub and sometimes hold up above heart until the pain disappears and you're okay again. NOTE: sometimes two towels are needed.6. Fun medical fact #2: Being buried alive isn't all that bad. The average stigmata twin can survive hours with little to no air. Unfortunately, this really only applies to stigmata twins, so yeah, don't try this in your own backyard.7. When your daughter thinks she's a twin, prove her wrong with a ready-to-play video of just her in your womb before birth.8. One of the Lohans states "Hospitals are for rich people" when she refuses assistance for her severed finger. Yeah, rich people and idiots that don't know they help anyone regardless of wealth.9. Wish my phone battery lasted hours after its low-battery alarm alerts me like the more crucial battery did in this movie.10. It's doubtful the best way to announce a classmate has been recovered dead over the PA and repeatedly is: "Jennifer Toland's body was found."11. Also, don't ever, EVER, ask a teacher for details on your classmate's "found body." She honestly may not have too much more to say than "Jennifer Toland's body was found" after the 1½ seconds of information she was given.12. Maybe, in 2007, the world wasn't ready for the real Lindsay Lohan meltdown. No, not even with two Lohans.13. And speaking of which, this is the third time Lohan played two characters in the same film after The Parent Trap and Freaky Friday. This probably explains a lot of her real life problems.14. Flashback to The Room and Birdemic with the split-second finding of Jerrod in a busy crowd when one of the Lohans' been wished luck in tracking him down.15. If only this took place during summer vacation because you'd one helluva story/movie to tell the following year.16. They accomplished Movie Cliché #158, or "set up a murder-mystery with tons of oh-sooo suspicious characters," so well, you can't take your eyes off that devilish little hairless creature of a pet they have and yet, never see again.17. Mercifully, through the quicksand of a script, there were enough unintentionally hilarious scenes and facial expressions to at least keep the viewer awake.
"Groovy, Baby!" At least that's what people said when Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery came out on video. I know I did.Unfortunately, I didn't catch the original Austin Powers when it hit theatres and caught wind of it on video, much like the audience did for The Terminator. Thank God for video (or DVD, or HD, or Bluray) or treasures like those two movies may never had expanded to sequels. And even, to date, there's only two sequels for Austin Powers, I simply can't wait for a part four.We're introduced to the swingin' Austin Powers in the 1960's as he battles his nemesis Dr. Evil. The bad doctor escapes, well, somewhat, in a freezing chamber (the legendary Bob's Big Boy mascot) and Austin follows suit. Both are defrosted in 1997 where Austin has to adjust, hilariously, to "today's times" while, again, battling the sinister Dr. Evil. Mostly in Las Vegas.I didn't grow up on the James Bond movies, and I admit it wasn't until a few years ago someone I was dating encouraged me to rent one of the original Sean Connery Bond films. Honestly, I don't recall which one (It might have been You Only Live Twice) but I seriously began laughing out loud at Blofeld, having seen Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery so many times before. Needless to say, this upset my partner as Blofeld and his pet were supposed to be taken seriously. I just never saw the movie Austin Powers spoofed before.And that's how good this comedy is. You don't even need to see the source material, though it helps. Airplane! is another that cracks me up every time I watch it, even though I never saw any of the Airport movies.This movie grabs you from the opening street dance segment, to the cultural references, to Austin's adjustment to the last part of the century and it doesn't stop there. He's pulling double-duty also playing the infamous Dr. Evil (or Blofeld) who's actually probably funnier. Enter in a wonderful Hurley, Sterling and Green (which looked very green he was so young here) and you have the perfect casting.Years after this release (1997) and I am still rolling every time I see Austin's over-the-top slapstick and sight-gags. See the steamroller accident. It's still great to quote this movie and it should be viewed by all that love intelligent spoof movies. Granted, there aren't a lot of them (Airplane!, Scary Movie, Naked Gun, Top Secret and this one are the only ones that come to mind,) but still I highly recommend this and I refuse to give away a lot of the joys in this review they show you throughout. Just watch it, and seriously, don't take it too seriously.
The journey of Eli and his book was hard for me to follow. No, not intellectually, it was just plain boring for the most part. But, be the one person out there to take my advice: stay on Eli's journey through the end. It's worth the trip.The Book of Eli is one of those movies that grows on you, despite the depressing and redundant opening of "a man on a barren, Post-Apocalyptic road to nowhere." The one thing that made this stand out from all the Kevin Costner and Mel Gibsons of the world was how incredibly brutal the "new world" was.Firstly, I'm not big on the "Boy and his Dog" sci-fi/desert films. Heck, I've never seen one Mad Max film. And making it incredibly realistic, bloody, depressing and desolate didn't brighten my skies (in fact, they were dishearteningly orange here) though it did perk my interest in how incredibly real they made this film.Staying with the movie will do you justice as, despite the clichés and predictable characters and their stereotypical actions, the more revealed, the more refreshing the movie becomes. I even found myself questioning why Denzel would want to step into Eli's shoes for 2 minutes, let alone 2 hours..but, he had the pleasure of reading the whole script prior to signing on.Wanderer Eli, (Washington) carries with him an important message found in an important book for nearly 30 years. Things don't look good for him, all around, as people living in a post-apocalyptic world haven't bothered to rebuild for a few decades. This doesn't deter Eli from headingwest.He's a messenger and a warrior. If anyone knows me, or reads my reviews, they know I love super-human characters, and Eli's one of them; he's even better than Jason Voorhees with a machete. So, those scenes of him fighting impossible odds amongst Hills-having-Eye's survivors did perk my interest.Unfortunately, my attention went up and down with the few action sequences and the clichéd and normal hierocracy characters (enter Oldman in one of his least interesting characters to date and Kunis trying to break free of (or forget) both Sarah Marshall and Meg Griffin) until more and more of the screenplay revealed itself and Eli's true stance and motivation.I was brought up Christian. And believe it or not, this was a refreshing movie to watch  if you watch it through to the end and that's no spoiler  any person with an above 15 IQ can detect the religious context of the movie's title. My first reaction following the credits, however, was that this was far too violent for a "Christian" or any religious audience and that's too bad that it might not be viewed by more people. But, then again, if you think about itthe Bible's pretty  no, make that enormously  violent in some spots. I think I remember the old Psalm that spoke about "you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs." Ohmaybe that wasn't Psalms, but you get the drift.
Boy, there was a lot of trash talk around when 'Psycho II' was announced. Like 'Scarlett' (the sequel to 'Gone With the Wind') how can one simply attempt to copy, or top one of the greatest movies ever made? And you know what? It actually works. Of course, it's nowhere close to the masterpiece the first one was, but it's still interesting and intriguing enough for at least one viewing. Bates is released from captivity 22 years after his "mother" took control of his life and he brutally slayed multiple victims. Well, the main victim's (Marion) sister is obviously upset and petitions to have him locked away for good. Quite frankly, I don't know why he isn't, but then, no sequel's made. Meanwhile as Bates is actually "cured" he meets and takes in a recently homeless girl and Bates feeds off her to keep him straight. Not that it did any good because "Mother" is back and Bates begins to slip, or does he? The movie plays out as a mystery with enough twists for several 'Saw' movies. Unfortunately, that comparison isn't one-deep: the gore here (in the final act) is all but unnecessary. Perhaps they thought, "It's no longer 1960, we should show more than the 'stab-free' shower scene." A lot of what worked for #1 was what they didn't show (less is more.) They also showed more of inside the creepy house  this one, I agreed with (more is more.) I did like the extended tour of the home shown for all-but 2 minutes in #1. Side Note: Sorry, but I did have to laugh at the facial expressions on Perkins. Though, he did another good job here, a lot of his facial gestures reminded me of George W. Bush's exact same facial movements. Now, that's creepy.
Immediately, allow me to begin with: Mud, probably a long-shot, is my current (8/6/13) selection for the Best Picture Oscar of 2013.This movie was absolutely brilliant. Deep, all-around well acted, original and a true love story. In a world that features Channing Tatum and produces someone-always-has-to-die sappy Nicholas Sparks "love" stories, it's refreshing to see an adult love movie with real-life people and real-life problems.Not to mention, this was one of those excellent movie experiences of mine that I went into not knowing a dang thing about, except it starred Matthew McConaughey, was called Mud and a lot of people really liked it. I absolutely love going into a movie cold; no trailer viewing, no review reading and, ABSOLUTELY, no spoilers.I really liked the first half of this movie. The performances and characters stood out, the story engrossed me and the cinematography was very nice. But, admittedly, it wasn't until the second half begun that I took to this story, this love yarn and this brilliant piece of filmmaking. Typically, I don't care for slower-moving pictures and this may seem like one, but to me, it was never once slow. There was always something going on. Whether it was the plot twists or the snappy, wonderful, non-stop and brilliant deliveries from McConaughey, I enjoyed every bit of this movie.Basically, Mud was about, well, Mud (McConaughey,) a drifter and somewhat "islander" and his journey to reunite with "his soul-mate" with the aid of two boys  Ellis (played excellently by Tye Sheridan) and his best-bud, Neckbone (Jacob Lofland.) They, the boys, have their own issues to deal with, but Ellis probably sees a lot in Mud as he does himself. And I'm sure Mud feels the same way.There's a lot more story here and I encourage you, noI implore you, to discover the rest. I certainly do NOT want to give away any of the suspense, great performances (like Reese Witherspoon's) or what these characters need to learn and how they grow. Just enjoy the movie and how things play out.Sadly, with the film's release date in May and the ancient Academy Award voter's short-term memory, this might get overlooked. God help us if this doesn't even get a nomination for Best Actor (McConaughey AND Sheridan,) Best Cinematography, Screenplay and, of course, Best Picture.I told a movie-loving friend at work all about my feeling on this movie. I also told him how I cannot wait to see this movie again. This is true. This is an excellent example of mastery in movies.
Regardless that it's been nearly 30 years since I saw the original, a fantasy that awed, inspired and excited me as a child, I had to see the updated Clash of the Titans. And this is despite the fact this is NOT my type of movie. (In fact, I have virtually no plans in seeing the forthcoming Prince of Persia film, though I played the original video game, again, as a child.) Fine, the original used clay. To a child that was close to cartoons, and that was okay  especially since it was on a grand scale with giant monsters. Kewl! Obviously with the update, they would switch to the (newly) time-honored CGI (or Copout Graphics for the Indolent.) I was hardly impressed with the special effects. Sure, they were well made, but original? No. Exciting? Eh. In fact, I felt for the most part of the movie, I just wanted it to be over, even though the script promised a climatic (RELEASE THE KRAKEN!) demon of sort. By the time the sea monster appeared (another unoriginal creation) I was anxious to take off.Now, that doesn't make it a complete waste. It was worth a viewing (and I saw it in 2-D, I've heard to stay away from the 3-D for good reason.) But it was absolutely not worth a second viewing. Even on DVD.Demigod Perseus (Worthington) must go on a journey, get dozens killed and defeat the Kraken while proving to Uncle Hades and his father, Zeus, he's a man. (Get used to that last part, he'll protest, though cheat multiple times, that he has to complete his journey and fight like a man a few dozen times.) Meanwhile, the most downright wimpiest and ridiculous gods (played so softly by two very talented actors, Neeson and Fiennes) are plotting/working together(?) to stop Perseus.Though I am not 100% educated on the mythological gods, I thought they were supposed to somewhat or fully omnipotent. If so, they're doing a terrible job at stopping this half-mortal. This proves my lack of interest in this genre. Much like Lord of the Rings, if someone has great power, I want to see them use it! These "gods" actually seem content to just sit around and "hope for the best." Basically, it's a point A to point B adventure that rarely steps above anything, EVERYTHING that has come before it. Again, it's not horrible, but never reaches even "average" status. Recommended for die-hard fans only of the genre.
When I first popped in Happy Birthday to Me, I checked the timer to see how long the film was. I was amazed at the length. Both animated and horror films share a common ground: attention span of the selected audience and that should be at or right around 90 minutes. Anything more, and you'll lose the bulk of your audience.This 110 minutes, or 20 minutes past its prime was a huge problem for me. I'd like to say half of this movie could've been edited out, but I would be too generous to say that. Go ahead and watch it and tell me how many scenes could've been edited, even without being a film major.Regardless of the overstayed visit, the movie was below mediocre. It spent all of its time trying to be this huge mystery on which of the "elite 10" is killing off the remaining friends. For the most part, they not only over-do it, but they zoom in on a face and pretty much say "It's this guy! No! It's this gal!" You'll spend more time with the camera misleading you than actually enjoying the movie. And don't get me started on the acting.Okay, that got me started. I had to laugh in the beginning trying to remember if Melissa Sue Anderson played the character that went blind on Little House on the Prairie (later, research proved my suspicions correct) because all the way through this movie, she genuinely looked blind. Strange, as an established actress, she should've been the best of the group, but turned out the worst. The rest of the staff, aside from Ann (Bregman) was pretty damn bad, too, but she, uh, took the cake.The movie begins with a group of ten friends, and one's immediately killed off. Barely anyone thinks twice of this "dear" friend's disappearance, so they continue on their merry way. Slowly, then more rapidly, there are revelations about Virginia's (Anderson), the main character, past and her psychologist, who's a tad bit more personal (AND ON CALL 24/7, apparently) than most shrinks. All the while, more and more deaths occur.What's funny is, just as the first "disappearance," the more "best buds" vanish, the less the rest care. Sure, they give a few seconds of air time to say "Wow, (that person) just wouldn't run off" etc, but then they're back to their sexual ways. And speaking of which, it's probably due to the horrid script, or maybe it was I who was losing interest at minute 30, but it was really hard to keep up with who liked who of the group as they all seemed to be sexual partners of the next or someone would either be freaked out to the MAX by another and best friends the next scene. SEE: the creepy guy that kept a mouse/rat in his pocket  literally  and was the most obvious suspect. I'm giving the film too much credit (and time,) but how he became part of the "elite 10" I'll never know.But, I digress, there's a mystery here. Why are these kids targets? Why is Virginia thinking she's killed someone, when it was never proved ('till the end) that any of them actually has been slaughtered? And why would the trailer and poster claim these killings to be "Six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see"? Hell, even for 1981, most of these had been shown in any of the first two Friday the 13th films  coincidentally enough, Friday the 13th Part 2 was released 2 weeks to the day of Happy Birthday to Me. Perhaps, they're speaking of when they filmed it months prior, but were late to the, well, party.When the "secrets" are revealed, trust me, you'll have to rewind 3-4x to actually get the laughable and incoherent motives, and even then, put the subtitles on to get all the mumbling victim/killer's words. Even if you get the first time, it's an unbelievably outrageous and hilarious finale. It's almost worth watching the whole movie again, but as a drinking game.This birthday gathering should be avoided. It's a horrible and illogical first draft script  please, please know it takes multiple rewrites before the cameras role, it contains either way under acting or extreme over acting and it's 100% unrealistic on how people react in extraordinary circumstances.Side Note: When I was a kid, or say 10-11 years old, I loved horror films. (Still do, oddly. Definite guilty pleasures, but they are getting harder and harder to watch as years pass.) We got our first VCR, and I taped as many horror films off network (or, EDITED VERSIONS) TV. All I remember of Happy Birthday to Me is getting the last 10 minutes on tape, which scared me to death  and obviously gave away the big mystery on who the killer was. Even though I have seen other clips of this movie, I think this is the first full-length viewing I've had. Thankfully, this awful movie didn't wound me as a child. I am older now, and I can take this trash. But never again.Side Note 2: That said, that crazy "Happy Birthday to Me" song played in the end credits (and as a score throughout) still creeps me out tremendously. I guess, this movie (or last few minutes,) did have an influence on my childhood. Shame on you, Melissa Sue Anderson!
Have a Heart, Repo Men I'm not going to take blame for this for the following: I was so incredibly bored for the majority of Repo Men that when the pieces started to fall together, not only did I care less for the characters or their plight, I just tried to stay awake to get up to put another movie in.This boredom is the result of a sh|tty script, an almost completely unoriginal idea and two many styles/subjects explored that it felt like six directors had their hands on this.And what the f^ck is with Jude Law being an sci-fi/Matrix-ripoff action star? I thought I would never say this: as good as Law is, he's no Keanu Reevesin the above reference ONLY. The way he looked in this movie, Steve Buscemi could've been his stunt double and his muscles were only as big as Forest Whitaker's one good eye.Okay, that's not really what the movie's about and I can't wait to get to thatso I can reveal that I'm on the bad guy's side!In the FAR distant future  they say near, but that city in Repo Men looked suspiciously like the all-city planet, Coruscant, of the Star Wars universewait, Star Wars was set in the past. Anyways, a small part of our future is the artificial implants of credit cards, whereas people need new hearts, lungs, lips, whatever and this big-bad corporation called "The Union" will spare you the $600,000+ cost (wait, is that a lot in the future??) by extending credit.In a system that's practically set up to fail, everyone seems to be past due and it's up to the repo men to (extremely violently) reclaim The Union's property. Our "hero" Remy (Law) is conflicted in his repoing job and his nagging wife wants him to switch to sales, in which he has no chance.Whelp, as always in these movies, the wife gave an ultimatum, and kicked him out keeping their son. In some dumb twist, he's now the patient who needs a heart and gets one of these metal hearts.Shockingly, he falls past due and is on the run from his own boss, company and BFF and repo-partner, Jake (Whitaker). This is where things got fuzzy for me, perhaps because I seriously just stopped paying close attention. Apparently he meets this girl, he completely forgets about the love of his life  his wife, and he escapes with this half-woman, half-all machine from The Union. She must've had excellent credit to get all those parts!Anyhoo in comes them against the company, them banding with other "Matrix" victims and them trying to stop the big-bad Union.OK, here goes on why I agree with the big-bad Union, though they are as evil as them come: I worked for a credit card company for almost eight years and another almost eight years in the credit counseling side. So, I've seen both sides, I've worked both angles and know how these companies operate. And I have this to say to anyone accepting a credit card, or in this case a couple of tin cans in place of your lungs: DON'T MAKE DEALS WITH THE DEVIL IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE.I don't know how much LESS sympathy I can have for people who default and both blame the company for their problems and try and weasel their way out. Granted, these methods (gruesomely cutting open the people and grabbing out the artificial parts) are to the extreme, but I've been in (the monetary kind) their shoes. Not once did I blame anyone else but myself and did everything I could to keep up to my word to pay back my debts.In this movie and in these fool's defense, supposedly they didn't know what was going to happen if they didn't repay the debts. So that's basically how we're supposed to side with them. There's always consequences, you dopes, so again, I never felt a strong connection to anyone, especially the Repo Man, himself, Remy.Other than my soapbox, the movie's qualities lie in the cinematography and the scope of their version of the future  but pretty much just the city. Other than that, the movie's a mess and gets progressively worse as it nears a really dumb climax and finale. It's enormously gruesome  something I didn't expect and it contains our "hero" as a cold-blooded murderer. So, he's not only a dead-beat dad and a debt-runner, but he's a killer, too.And he's the good guy in all this?
Jaws 2 gets dumped on. All the time.Let's begin by never, ever comparing it to the masterpiece #1 was. With that being thrown out, it's not a terrible movie. It's exactly what a sequel (especially summer sequel) should be: more of everything.In this case: more blood, more attacks, more shark sightings, more sexuality (girls, duh,) more inventive kills/chomps, and more ways of ridding the world (uh, beach/water) of the title menace.They delivered in spades. Now, on its own, it's not great, but it's fun.When I was a kid, I loved sequels more than the originals. Why? For the very reasons already stated. I was an impatient kid (well, kinda still am) and I wanted to get right to the reason we came to the show. I was the same with Superman II vs. Superman: The MovieYou got to see Superman right away(!) in part II when you'll have to wait an hour plus in the original.As an adult, I can contest the originals are oodles better, but from a kid's POV, I liked  and rewatched  the sequels more.That all said, just watch this movie as a sequel. No real depth, no real message. Roy Scheider reprises his Chief Brody role from the first one, amongst most of the other reoccurring cast members and adds very little to his original starring character. Again, he plays a wild-eyed, water-hating chief who has since survived a shark attack and spews lines to anyone who would listen, such as: "But I'm telling you, and I'm telling everybody at this table that, that's a shark! And I know what a shark looks like, because I've seen one up close. And you'd better do something about this one, because I don't intend to go through that hell again!"(Thank God, he chose not to return to parts 3-D and The Revenge. Because, his rants, or reason he chooses to stay close to water, would be even more far-fetched as the later sequels will become)Anyways, suffice to say, everyone "thinks it's safe to go back into the water" and lo, there's another shark near Amity Island near New York, USA. (In a funny side note, Brody thinks it's after revenge for the destruction of the first movie's sharkalso named: Jaws? I hope that wasn't the inspiration for the horrid part IV)That's about it. Really. Let's see, I've already mentioned Brody trying to convince everyone lightning struck twice and there's another shark. Okay, fine, throw in a group of kids, including the two Brody boys, who drift out into the ocean while Jaws has its fun with them. Brody must come out and kill Jaws again in an unrealistic, but "fun" way.Did I mention Jaws eats a helicopter? Am I losing youif I haven't already?Again, forget remotely comparing it to part 1. Remember it's just a mindless, summer movie and have a little fun. And think 1970s, a lot. I mean all the boys are attracted to a girl sooo plain that she would've even make Devine look pretty.
I grew up on horror movies; love 'em. And usually I'll carry through to the end of the series, watching each to see how the "mysteries" created will be explained. Even when the Saw series nosedived, I stuck it through to the hopeful last one: Saw VII.It's strongly doubtful the same will happen with the drug-induced trip of this franchise. Phantasm II closed the deal for me. I just don't care how this pans out (in parts III and IV.)Originally, I remember seeing this as a double feature back in 1988 along side Poltergeist III. Ahhh, remember when they had double features at the theatre and you could enjoy an all-afternoon worth of horror, or genre of your choice? Despite the fact I had not seen either of the mentioned series' previous entries up to this point, of the two movies, I actually liked Phantasm II less.Finally, finally, I saw Phantasm (the original) a few days ago (2/16/11) and though I was greatly disappointed, nothing prepared me for the (actual) horror of the follow-up.Yeah, I get they realized the original was camp  or was that crap?  and they poked fun throughout this featureha ha ha on the "Mr. Sam Raimi." But it was so beyond corny  hear that EXPLOSION sound-effect?  it turned out more like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2 than Scream 2. And though I'll admit it was a heck of a lot more coherent than the original  the basic story did go from A to B  but that didn't raise it above any typical direct-to-video crud that should've been just that.Our Phantasmbuster heroes Mike (replaced actor, James LeGros) and Ice-Cream-Menace Reggie (Bannister) vow to rid the world of the Tall Man (Scrimm) and his balls, well, evil killin' & drillin' spheres. So, they go from destroyed town to ghost town with the consistent "feeling" they're near thanks to Mike's dreams. Oh, and they're equally wet dreams due to a girl, Liz (Irvine), he's seeing parallel to the Tall Man.Again, I get the campiness of the feature, and their desire to give the audience what they wanted to see: bad dudes with bad weapons taking on the devil (of sorts.) But, since it was revealed in part I that these are rejuvenating and teleporting aliens, using the guns and chainsaws against The Tall Man would be as effective as sending soldiers armed with sling-shots to battle Godzilla.But, that's the mentality of the low-budget fare. And speaking of which, it's sad they reported this to be biggest budget of the series: $3 million. Which is ten times the original's. It probably helped they used the same explosion sound-effect whenever any one of the fifty structures exploded.I guess I'm taking this mess too seriously. At least one positive came out of it: I no longer want to see any more of the Phantasm series. They could even promise to give the secrets of the killer balls, er, spheres. They did this time and we're left with an empty promise and more of the same delusional ideologies from the first feature.Unless you're a true phan of the phirst one, SKIP IT.
I wondered if I needed to see the first nine films before I started American History X to get what was going on. Turns out, this was stand alone.Hate, sadly, isn't going away any time soon in America. I could stand on a soap box and preach against it, knowing far well that I've lived in fear of people's hate against me, but it would do no good. I dream of a day that Star Trek becomes a reality and we all do "get along."Well over 14 years ago, a Neo-Nazi story of brotherhood, misdirection and black & white came out and I've never forgotten it.Recently, I bought the BluRay for cheap, and the movie ain't, in the slightest. It's realism, relevance and fright still holds up today. Aside from the far-too-many close-ups, this movie is beautiful, inside and out.In Edward Norton's absolute best performance to date, he plays Derek who was talked into leading a skinhead régime while his impressionable brother, Danny (Edward Norton,) is set to follow in his footsteps. Derek lands in prison for a heinous crime, one involving one of the most brutal scenes I have EVER seen in movies. There he receives life lessons that might helpand a little bit more. If only all gang-bangers could go through this.This movie is a music video of great performances and scary messages. It's scary because it's real. It may not help convert some, but I'm hoping it will even help a few. Especially with the last shot.
Every generation bestows a fun-filled and spirited Christmas movie. A timeless classic that reminds us of our childhood while teaching our yutes to celebrate peace, love, forgiveness and the wonder of giving to those in need. Santa, himself, would be proud of such joy a movie could bring to the whole family.Shockingly, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians isn't that movie. In fact, it's not only the opposite of the previous description, I'm sure it sparks all kids from 0-99 to question Santa's existence. Rightfully so.To hate this movie, to bash it, to say it's one of the worst movies of all time isn't really fair. Sure, I'm awarding it 1/5 stars, but come on. Its sole intention was to make a cross-genre kiddie/sci-fi movie for kids only. Well, for those under three, but still. Saying this is absolutely horrible for any age, is like saying those old Gamera films are lousy. They did serve a purpose  outside of Joel Robinson's Satellite of Love, that is.Of course, it has its many, manymany problems, such as buck fifty FX, even less spent on sets, bad acting and unintentionally hilarious dialogue. Surprisingly, the number one thing wrong here ispacing. For a movie under an hour and a half, it's a wonder this movie would ever end. Okay, that goes along with the incredibly bad "talent" the director had, but scenes just kept going on and on past their expiration date.The second worst attribute of Santa V. Martians was just how creepy it was. Again, I believe these doofuses had good intentions at aiming their childish experiment film very low, but at times the movie got a little, well, baked. Like the filmmakers were, probably. Just look at that Kooky! climatic fight.So, we have big-green people of Mars who have "adult-children" (but not like the ones from Ork) who are in need of Santa to help themuhsleep and eat more. I get the eating part: Santa's rather obese, but a large and disguised male running after kids and his hired job is to get them to bed? See? Creepy.Anyways, after an extremely long space trip to Earth, the barely-painted-green Martians kidnap two annoying kids and Santa while the evil second-in-command is against this becauseuhMartians used to be warriors? EhI'm looking way too deep into this. Best to watch this movie as a drinking game or with MST3k's help, or both.
I can imagine and even know where this idea smoked from, but it's still dumb, nonetheless. Kevin Smith is an intelligent filmmaker that finally made his modern Adam Sandler film: a fvck you to his fans. This Human Centipede rip-off was supposed to be part comedy, part horror, but when you add those together you are not only left with neither, you're stuck with an hour and a half of meaningless dribble. OK, that's not entirely true. The movie starts off interesting enough and follows with a real interesting character of Howard Howe. Beyond that, it dives deep into stupidity only a stoner might appreciate. I see where Smith was going with this, but his humor fell flat time and again and the overall experience, once finished, feels more like a waste of time than anything you can take from it. Too bad. Just hope Smith remembers what it was like to be human again.
Picture it: Super bowl 2014. I had to find the movies to watch during "the game" that would be such the opposite from what the core audience of that silly football game would want to see. Part I of my night was my first time seeing: Burlesque.Now, I absolutely love Cher. Mildly like Christina Aguilera and the rest of the cast, but I live by and salute Cher. Still, it took me until 2/2/2014 to see Burlesque. Maybe because I thought it was a musical, or because the trailers that spoiled everything, weren't that appealing.After seeing the film, I recognized all the clichés, the problems, the bad acting, bad dialogue and been-there-done-that moments. Still, I liked it. With reservations.Small-town girl with a big heart gets sucked into the glamour of showbiz and, SHOCKER, she makes it big. Glitter takes over and she has to remain grounded long enough for her and the All About Eve Mentor (i.e. Cher,) to both get along, but work together to defeat the thin plot of their adversary.This movie is a definite leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature. It's nothing huge, special or refreshing, but it is fun when you ignore all that's come before it. Perhaps, I'm biased, but c'monit's Cher. She's not getting any younger and it's great to see her spunk once more. And the music's great, the humor, though obvious, is still nice and the set/costumes, while unrealistic, are still entertaining.They didn't make a groundbreaking film and I'm sure all involved would admit that. But, they made something enjoyable for a laid back, mid-Saturday feature to watch.Take heed, however: You probably should really enjoy Cher to enjoy this. Or maybe think Christina's hot? I dunno.What I do know is: don't expect the world, and you'll want a ticket to Burlesque.* * * Final thoughts: Oddly enough, though I did chose this as my first film of my double feature during the 2014 Super Bowl, it would also serve me when I later discovered the podcast: How Did This Get Made? This was their very first podcasted subject, so I could safely listen to that spoiler-rich 'cast while they unabashedly and hilariously bashed the film. They also pointed out a ton I missed. But, then, again, I wasn't looking too deep. Like watching a Friday the 13th sequel  a later one, that is, one cannot expect 5/5 stars. Just leave that brainat the door.
Without spoiling the movie adaption of 21 Jump Street, as I am thankful no one ruined it for me, I am pleased with one revelation towards the end.Combine that to the hilarious Nick Offerman (from the fantastic Parks & Recreation TV program) scene as our "heroes" are reprehended by Deputy Chief Hardy and you'll have the roughly 7 minutes of 109 that I liked.OK, I don't want to be too harsh; it wasn't that bad. In fact, it felt slightly better the movie I felt it mostly mimicked, The Other Guys. That's not saying much, however.It also didn't help that they, or again, Nick Offerman as Deputy Chief Hardy, flat out tells you what to expect in the best line in the movie: "We're reviving a canceled undercover project from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. The people behind this lack creativity and they've run out of ideas, so what they do now is just recycle sh|t from the past and hope that nobody will notice."I'm guessing that quote tells us not to take this seriously at all. Correct. But, they still needed a lot more consistency in their direction as this movie was all over the place while never knowing what kind of movie they wanted to be. Was it drama? Comedy? Slap-stick? A love story? A teen romp?The only thing the movie and the original TV program it's based on have in common, with the exception of the title, is the little tiny bit of drama. Now, I was NOT a fan of the TV show back in the 80s, but since it was, in fact, the 1980s, we only had one TV and I watched this with my sister since she liked it. That said, I'd much rather watch a few seasons of that before I saw this again.Dumb nerd, Schmidt (Johan Hill) and dumb jock, Jenko (Channing Tatum) do not combine their talents to make one cool guy, but instead show us repeatedly on how not to be a police officer. So much so, even they would've been kicked out of the original Police Academy in the original Police Academy.They're forced to team up as undercover narcs to take down a drug ring at a high school. Along the way, they break every law in order to, uh, preserve the law. (This is the part they tell us to turn off our brains, like when they used to tell us to put on our 3-D glasses during the movie.)Sadly, my message is not getting to the right exec in Hollywood: we need shorter run times for movies like these. This 109 minute movie absolutely needed to be between 85-90 minutes, but directors don't know when enough's enough. And hence, for the majority of the second half the movie wanders around from subplot to the next with obvious conclusions.I'm not sure how this movie could've been better, aside from not being made in the first place or at least (again) better edited. Perhaps they could've stuck with the original theme and not follow the latest trend of remakes mocking the originals. I dunno, but in any case, I ain't moving down to Jump Street any time soon.
Well, this shouldn't be a big surprise: follow up an inventive and original idea with a lame, horrid sequel.A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge is an abomination, even in 1980s horror franchise sequels. It's incoherent, irresponsible, inconsistent and just plain horribly made.Five years after the event of Part 1, or just one in real life, a new family moves into the Elm street house where Nancy supposedly went crazy after watching her boyfriend get butchered across the street. I'm going to stop here and say here's one of the biggest problems of the movie. Did the writer or director even watch the first one? She did NOT see her boyfriend die, just heard and knew about it.Anyways, Jesse (Patton) is a very troubled, wacky and overheated teen who befriends a girl, Lisa (Myers) and a thug/jock Ron (Rusler) while having bad dreams. Apparently, he's inherited the "spirit" of Fred Krueger since he lives in the original movie's house and Fred wants Jesse to kill for him. Why? No real reason other than Fred likes to kill.See, the original made sense. It was a basic revenge type story whereas Fred Krueger murdered children, the parents took matters into their own hands and burned Fred to death. Only, Fred came back in the form of nightmares to seek vengeance against the children of the parents responsible. Here, he only wants to kill just about anyone.And here in lies one of the most troubling aspects: Fred(dy) Krueger wants to "use" Jesse as a portal to kill others, but he seem to be doing fine on his own. Such as, moving objects, windows, doors, gym equipment without the use of a host. Why, oh why, did he need Jesse? And where was the real aspect of the nightmare presented carefully in #1? "A Nightmare" part of the title really only suggests that sometimes Jesse dreams of Fred, but basically the majority of the movie takes place in the real world.Again, I ask, did they actually watch the first movie? No journal was mentioned in #1, but they conveniently brought one in here. The mother died (or did she?) in the first one in BED, UPSTAIRS and not in the living room as mentioned here. And Freddy has to be "pulled" out of a dream, he literally cannot cut himself out as this new "myth" states.I realize I am looking too deep into this movie, but as a true Freddy Krueger fan, I am ashamed this one is part of the series. Let's look at the idiocracies in this feature: I'm supposing it was "ghost" form, but Freddy locks all the doors at Lisa's house in order to attack. Why the heck would there be a lock on the outside of the parents' bedroom door? Sure this might sound petty, but to me, this was just lazy film-making. They didn't even try. Also, why go after the gym teacher? Was Freddy homophobic, or just the writers had something against gays? In one scene, Jesse wanders from his house into a bar, I'm assuming is a gay bar, but there's other things happening there as well. Next thing you know, Gym teacher is making Jesse do laps and take a shower in the middle of the night. Why? Well, I guess the writer equates homosexuals with pedophiles. That's always a huge misconception and just plain ignorance. Regardless, it just doesn't make sense, like the rest of the movie. Especially the "love conquers all" ending. Seriously? Wes Craven stated he wanted nothing to do with this mess. I don't doubt that and I am proud of him for that. The special effects were awful (including some off the wall baby/dogs???), the great score of the original was gone (always a mistake during a franchise,) the acting was horrible and way, WAY over the top, the homophobia was rampant and unnecessary and the climax and finale were just terrible.There are NO redeemable qualities of this picture (see the 1980s "Marty Mcfly" dance segment) and I am very glad to say that some people still had faith in Freddy, i.e. they went ahead and made #3 which was 30 times better. (On a side note: despite all previously stated, this is still not the worst one  SEE, well actually, Don't SEE #6: Freddy's Dead. Nevertheless, any true human should watch #1 and leapfrog over this to #3 and continue.)
One of the most amazing aspects of 'The Terminator,' was the story. Despite the extremely low budget, and the equally low-budget feel of the film, the movie had an extremely well thought out story. This is evident when they took this film into three additional sequels, made a mega-star out of Schwarzenegger and even produced a short-lived TV series. Unfortunately, despite the quality of story and the sci-fi aspect of the plot line, I viewed it more as a horror story than an action picture it was meant to be. I think it was the genre of films produced back on and around 1984. Only this one stood out, with solid performances by Hamilton, Biehn and, of course, Schwarzenegger. In the defining movie based on man vs. machines (tell me the makers of 'The Matrix' wasn't thinking about this movie throughout), comes a 'Judgment Day' apocalyptic war when machines take over in 1997 and man spends the rest of his days fighting the mistake we made. Back in time comes a "terminator" to kill the mother of the resistance leader in a valid tactical move, but thankfully, the leader also sends someone back to protect her  giving us valuable information in the process. While some of the graphics (and hair, oh, God, the hair) were extremely dated (also see: the closing, when Schwarzenegger finally loses his skin), the movie holds up very well, even 25 years later. And it's all thanks to the interesting and original story as well as the acting. Many imitated this movie; none came close to the heart of 'The Terminator.' I even loved the ending. Of course, it opened the doors to sequels, but if it ended with the storm coming, it would've been okay. They produced a quality product that honestly didn't need a continuation.
If, after listening to approximately 60 shows, the How Did This Get Made podcast taught me anything, it's to appreciate Nicolas Cage. As a matter of fact, I never truly knew about his outbursts until I listened to that internet show where they ridicule bad movies for about an hour. And they seem to favor Nick Cage a lot.A movie that was completely off my radar was the 2006 thriller/remake, The Wicker Man. It was so much off my spectrum, that I probably would've never seen it had the creative How Did This Get Made crew didn't spotlight it.To get me to hate it, they did not. Contrarily, I ended up liking it more for its "So Bad, It's Good" vibe. After all, I waited patiently the whole movie for the Real Nick Cage to bust a move. And he did. He did in spades.Don't get me wrong, it's not a great or even good movie, even when it started off decent. Sorta.Copper Cage gets all bent out of shape when he somewhat helps a single mother and child who inadvertently gets killed and disappears, literally, in front of his eyes.Spoiler Alert.Forget I even said that, as it never comes up again, or at least not to move the plot forward. Instead, focus on the note Cop Cage gets to help track down a missing girl on a mysterious island where the mother of said child resides.With some useless bargaining, he makes it to the isle of the damned actresses and he begins his search. More and more frustrated Constable Cage gets until hewait for itdoes what I went into see: a meltdown.Oh, this movie's bad, so bad, but it doesn't get that way until the second half and good news, it's worth watching the whole thing for. It's so outrageous, it's fun. I advise paying attention to all details. Not that they make sense, but it will help you laugh completely unintentionallywhich is all the fun of this.If the original The Wicker Man is like this, or even ends like this one, all the surprise is gone, it's spoiled. Maybe it's better and maybe, I'll see it someday. Until then, I will enjoy great Edward "Nicolas Cage" Malus lines like: "BITCHES! YOU BITCHES!" "Is this hers? How'd it get burned? How'd it get burned? HOW'D IT GET BURNED, HOW'D IT GET BURNED?" "This is murder! Murder! You'll all be guilty, and you're doing it for nothing! Killing me won't bring back your goddamn honey!""Step away from the bike!" "You little liars. Rowan Woodward IS your classmate, isn't she? ISN'T SHE? That is HER desk! And you're the biggest liar of them all. I am warning you, you tell me another and I'll arrest you myself. That is a promise, MISS... Of course, another plant! Rose!" "Ahhh, my legs!" "OH, NO! NOT THE BEES! NOT THE BEES! AAAAAHHHHH! OH, THEY'RE IN MY EYES! MY EYES! AAAAHHHHH! AAAAAGGHHH!" * * * Final thoughts: Typically I don't even recommend "So Bad, They're Good" movies, like The Room, Birdemic: Shock and Terror or Troll 2, but, I guess I have to here and that will open the floodgates to those other three mentioned movies. Go ahead and make it a fantastic weekend with all four movies. You. Will. Laugh. Your. Arse. Off.
There's been a lot of negative internet babble going on since the Oscar noms were announced this week, and after watching BeginnersI gotta put my two cents in. Sure, Christopher Plummer did a good job as the 70s Gay Man (no, not 1970s, you Milk-lovers) but I didn't think he was THAT great. In fact, Ewan McGregor wasn't Oscar-worthy, but I think he did a better job as a son trying to cope with both his father's (LATE-in-life) coming out and eventual cancer death. It was a nice twist on the whole closet-freeing theme of the 1990s, but the movie on a whole felt very Lifetime'ish. That said, it was a decent movie, well-made and had a nice courting of the young couple (McGregor's Oliver and Mélanie Laurent's Anna)..only it went a little overboard in the second & third acts. It's a Rent it, but I (bash me, now) hope Plummer doesn't take home the gold even though he probably will. (Give it to the deserved Johan Hill for Moneyball!)
Originally, I didn't like X-Men: The Last Stand. Today, I watched it again and it's still my third favorite of the original 3. (It goes: X2: X-Men United, then X-Men and finally X-Men: The Last Stand.) However, what I originally gave 2 or 2½ stars turned, tonight, to 4/5 stars.) Why? (Spoiler alerts following. It's so hard as the expert journalist I think I am to avoid giving away the major points in order to review. So, if spoilers aren't your bag (baby) then skip to lifesaboxofchocolates.com.) So many mutants and humans (or homosapiens) die. This is NOT your childhood, your Superman: The Movie. This is WAR. An adult comic book movie, as if this could "really" happen. So there will always be causalities. Does that mean, I have to like it? No. I don't want to see the majority die or get "cured." Oh, sorry, that's another spoiler.Humans have developed a "cure" for the common mutant in the form of awell, mutant. That little mutant boy, Leech (or Jimmy (Bright)) is capable of transforming any mutant into, well one of them, orus (humans.) Naturally, there are those against it, namely Magneto (so wonderfully played again by McKellen) and his "brotherhood" of mutants-against-change.Meanwhile, and this is another major plot-point, Jean Grey (Janssen) is back, but now as "Phoenix." Hey, that's where I live. That was bad. Sorry. Anyways, her split personality is weighing heavily on multiple sources: Wolverine (Jackman) who loves her, Cyclops (Marsden) who mourns her, Xavier (Stewart) who wants to help her and Magneto who wants to, uh, evolve her.Sure there are more subplots roaming. But, suffice to say, I loved the fact we left Wolverine's backdrop behind, Rogue (as annoying as she isin all three original features) is only minimal, and the action was intense, when it did happen. Hates? Well that a huge amount of mutants either got evaporated  and I won't spoil who, or "cured." Stick around for the before-and-after credits for some nice surprises.Also, the bridge moving scene went on for far too long and was a completely unnecessarily (CGI-excuse) scene as Magneto could've easily lifted everyone over via metal slab.Fine, (since I'm still p*ssed) I'll give away one transformation I didn't care for: Mystique (Romijn.) She was definitely one of my favorites in the first two chapters and could've been used here more.If you liked the first two, this is definitely worth a shot/viewing. It's not perfect, and suffers from a lot of the same old comic-book/sequel dilemmas: too much, too late. And it's very violent for a "comic-book/super-hero" movie. It's not for smaller kids. I admired that "stand" against the norm. Watch it. And, again, stay through the credits Side Note: and I wish they would stop that. It's definitely no fun to stay through a 2 hour movie, wait 4-9 minutes for the credits to finish so you can see an additional 20 seconds. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's marketing or attempts to get you to read/see all the people involved. But it's annoying. Seriously.
Steven Soderbergh, one of my all-time favorite directors, makes a Ripley-Reunion, of sorts. All three main players (Jude Law, Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow) in The Talented Mr. Ripley return for Contagion. But, it's not like they share much screen time together.Of course, that's not the point of this virus-movie. It's more of an adult, realistic update of Outbreak. And don't get me wrong, I did like Outbreak, but this seemed more real.Okay, here's the problem: I never felt like 2+ (or much more; I might have missed the final count) million people died. This is because the entire movie about a killer flu-like virus spreading like wildfire is in the doctors/CDC's POV and an idiot internet-blogger (Jude Law) that really p*ssed me off.I'm gonna go off on a tangent here. This blogger of "truth" reminded me a lot of the animal activists in the opening of 28 Days Later. Oh, they think they're doing the right thing and they're both giving into and spreading fear & conspiracy theories. But, in reality, they're so wrapped up with spreading their version of the "truth" they never stop to think about what they're doing. Or who they're harming.Yeah, you might be asking yourself: Isn't Steve Reeves blogging at this very minute. Ah, you would be correct. But I am not trying to spread "facts" around, teach people government is not only evil but trying to kill us and I'm certainly not a believer in other "popular" conspiracy theories. I am giving my opinion. Take it or leave it.I digressthis was a good movie, well acted, well shot. It's scary to think that this obviously could happen and in the few and small shots of looting and uncivilized behavior, it might be even worse.I don't normally say this, but this movie was far too short. It was 106 minutes and I would've invested another 40 or so minutes if they gave more grand scale examples of cities ravaged. Director Soderbergh seemed to have wanted to make a smaller movie, more toned down. Sadly, in doing so, he took a lot of the terror away. Think about a Godzilla movie where he's always in the background  and only for 10% of the movie  and the camera focuses on the military and ah-hem, animal activists discussing on how to solve the problem. Sure, you'd hear a lot of talk about the city being destroyed, but it wouldn't mean as much unless we saw it.That all saidit's still recommended. The opening letters on the screen (no spoiler) impressed me and put a smile on my face. Those two words made me remember how much I enjoy the craft that is Soderbergh. Further, the finale is nice to see, and though it was kind of irrelevant by that point, it was still a pleasant final shot.
No, I don't have much respect for the normally ineffective Ashton Kutcherbut wow. He was literally spot-on in The Butterfly Effect.If you liked Frailty, Stir of Echoes, Se7en or Mr. Brooks, chances are, you'll like this (sorta) Time-Traveling tale of love lost, gained, destroyed, rebuilt and retribution.I loved this movie. And it held one of the best secrets I've ever seen in a movie: an (Special Features) alternative ending that equally matches the theatrical finale. Both endings actually make perfect sense and are both a great conclusion/solution to the problem at hand. My recommendation is getting the DVD or Blu-Ray that contains both and watch both.Aside from the climax, the movie itself was a fantastic and original take on the age-old Grays Sports Almanac (SEE: Back to the Future Part II) catch-22. It also seems like an elaborate set-up of what we know what's coming: a man traveling back/forth in time to "correct" problems to set the future right. (Also SEE: "Year of Hell," the best Star Trek: Voyager episode.)It's not a "boring" and "long intro" after all. After multiple viewings, which you should, you'll pay closer attention to details to the younger kids as they grow and suffer until the story shifts to "the present" and Evan (Kutcher) attempts to wrong the gaps of his memory loss during traumatic times in his childhood.Evan has had some bad experiences as a child, and lucky or not, he's blacked out for most of these. Fortunately, he had one doctor that encouraged him to write a very detailed journal. Evan uses these later in life to somehow magically transport him back into the kid he was during the life-altering bad times.Unfortunately, as the movie's title indicates  for those who know the "legend" of the light-winged beast  every step he takes "back-in-time" causes further complications in the future.That's a really basic summary of the plot hereand I'm glad to report that. There's so much more here. Deep performances, namely by both Amy Smart and Elden Henson  in multiple-yet-similar roles (SEE: Groundhog Day.) Great cinematography and complex storytelling round out the film.I would highly recommend this feature. Though it's a bit on the long side, it's a real thinker, albeit a Hollywoodized film. And despite its dark subject, it's fun and really gets going about half-way through when our "hero" Evan realizes his power of time-manipulation.
are countless.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a powerful and wonderful film. The performances are top notch, the score great, the songs awesome and themes were heartbreakingly real and deep.John Hughes cornered the high school market in the 1980s. Were they necessarily real visions of pre-real world youths? Sometimes, but for the most part, they were comical views. Perks physically transported me back years to my days there. Hell, it enhanced my eyes of the surroundings back then.Introverted freshman Charlie is desperate for friendship in his new High School surroundings. Sure, he gets some from a remarkable teacher, but he's looking for someone his own age.He does get that, sorta: 3 years older in the form of a great duo of Patrick and Sam. Anyone, including myself, would yearn for such great friends. Patrick's way more outgoing than I was, and that would've attracted me to him tremendously and Sam's so cool without even knowing it.But, there are deeper messages here, clues to unravel on why Charlie's so quiet and distant. It's heartbreaking learning more about both his past and present.It took me all year and within 9 days of the next year to find my first five star 2012 film. I loved this movie, from the absolute first shot to the last. I cried, I laughed, I enjoyed life while not even participating in the events in the film. I felt there, I was Charlie.This movie is near perfection. The acting of all around was excellent with the notable performances of Logan Lerman who owned Charlie, Ezra Miller as flamboyant, funny and fantastic Patrick and Emma Watson who was so good as Sam, it made me completely forget she was ever in the Harry Potter films. (And that's a major positive to me.)When you can see yourself in these eyes, when you can clinch your fist and want to fight like these characters, you know you have the highest quality of acting. In one scene, one character needs to get out there and defend his friend against punk kids. I would be dead inside, if I didn't put myself in his shoes and want to pound such evil.Lerman's Charlie was so real, so incredible, it would be a crime not to just hand the Best Actor Oscar over to him.Aside from the acting, the cinematography, editing and direction were supreme. And the soundtrack was one of the best I've ever heard and I will be buying it shortly. As I will the BluRay of the film once available.I can't provide enough praise to give this film justice. Rarely will a movie impact me like this, and if no other 2012 films I have yet to see don't come close to this, I will sleep comfortably. This is a gem to appreciate and absorb.
Too bad I got an invitation.Probably 5 minutes into 'The Uninvited' I guessed one of the major plot "twists." It's so painfully obvious and has been done before. If I were to compare this to the #1 movie it solely mimics, it would be an absolute spoiler. Alas, we shouldn't harp on that, after all, there's like maybe one more plot twist to get "surprised" by.Anna (Browning) has been locked away since her mother's died in a guest house-fire and, believe it, she can't remember what happens. Regardless, oddly enough, the psychologist says she's free to go. Back at home, she's reunited with Dad, sister and her father's girlfriend (Banks.) Wow, she's so good to be true. Nothing could go wrong when she's around.Enter in a boring subplot of a "boyfriend" and the sister egging on mischievous behavior does not make a great movie. In fact, it's a rather boring "which dead child-ghost" will pop up next and how the over-actor Browning will react to sauce under the oven.Mercifully, the movie's under 1½ hours long, but unfortunately, since the "twists/turns" are seen from a MILE away, it's painful to get to the conclusion. I can say the movie was beautifully shot with great locations. There, that was the one positive. Banks made me laugh on how coy she played "suspicious." Even Strathairn, normally a very good actor, sleepwalked through his so-called "confused, angry and distant Dad." Rip up your invitation. There's dozens of movies that this movie's based on that are 10x better. Again, to even mention them, will ruin this movie. Of course, the movie, itself, did a fine job of digging its own grave.
One of my favorite movies-going experiences is to go into the theatre barely knowing ANYTHING of the film I'm about to see. It's a rare occasion, since I've studied film since I was probably 10ish. With Hugo, I CHOOSE not to read too much about it and the one trailer I saw was months ago, I believe. All I heard from critics I admire, was I needed to see it in the theatre and with Real 3D. So, I went with almost zero knowledge of what I was about to see. Heck, from the preview I slightly remembered, I thought it was another Polar Express-type animated film.Wrong. On the Polar Express part, of course. Though, the opening segment confirmed what I thought I remembered  it did sure as Hades look like a CGI'd/digital world. Then we see little Hugo, all real-life like and the movie continues in the real world.Oh, and what an opening it was! Exciting, fun, adventurous, thrilling and inventive. I knew the movie was over two hours  only because I was trying to coordinate a double feature of this and The Descendants, but alas this went on far too long  and I truly believed the rest of the movie would be an amazing spectacle of lights, sounds and wondrous adventure.And then the plots sank in. Yes, I meant to pluralize that.The movie started on Plot A and that was fine, but then Plot B overlapped with Plot C, followed by D-G. I'm aware this is based on a novel, but it felt like 3 novels rolled into this one.Please don't take this as a complaint, per se, but I thought the movie worked much smoother when you have the awe of the spectacular graphics and grand sets with a simple even-kids-can-follow peaceful and harmonizing story. And because there's too much going on, too many subplots, the movie's pacing slowed to an almost halt and I started to feel every bit of the over two-hour run time.Sad, I was really getting invested and would have been more alert if they saved some ideas for a potential sequel and kept it to a quaint 90 or so minutes.That all said, if you're interested, you really should see this on the big screen. It's a marvel of ingenuity and it's fully worthy of a Best Cinematography Award. The performances are outstanding at times and the touching transformations (in some of the plots I favored more) were nice and heartfelt. And finally, there was some pretty good comedy that made me laugh out loud, mostly from Sacha Baron Cohen.If you are ever interested in seeing this, see it now. In the theatres, in Real 3D. You wont regret the experience.
WowAll other dysfunctional family movies, including the serious ones, are put to shame. None are as crazy as 'The Royal Tenenbaums.' This movie is wildly original, wonderfully scripted, hilarious, well-performed, has a great soundtrack and score and is touching in an odd but satisfying way. Admittedly, I didn't like it the first time I saw it years ago, but thanks to a friend, I reinvested my time with the Tenenbaums. I'm glad I did. It's not a movie I want to watch over and over, but it's one I enjoyed tremendously this time around. Though, I will say, what we know today  concerning a suicide attempt, it's probably hard to see the OTHER brother going through with it fictionally. Thankfully, real or not, it all worked out. Check in with the Tenenbaums. 4½/5 Stars.
(WARNINGThis is the Adult Disney Review Series. I have 51 Original Disney Cartoons to tackle, plus multiple  and forgettable  direct-to-Disney-Video misses. My goal in 2012 is to brave the task of watching all, many for the first time and commenting on eachall with an adult POV. Now, as soon as I can find an adult to do just that)Ahhh Number one. Snow WHITE and the seven "little men." Like Walty Boy isn't trying to say something there. Don't count him out of adding subliminal messages throughout his works. And I'm not just talking about the Little Mermaid's Little Penis. I'm talking even smaller, as in using the phrase here "Jiminy Cricket" (repeatedly) or his hatred for things, well, not (snow) WHITE.Admittedly, I'm not the hugest fan of this animated film. Sure, it's groundbreaking, for 1937, and against all odds, they made the first (of thousands) of feature-length animated films. Keep in mind: just because a movie's a milestone doesn't mean it equates greatness.Example? Episode IV, A New Hope, formally just plain Star Wars. Sure it was ahead of its time, light-years, in fact, but wasn't it a fraction of the movie, Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, formally just plain Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back?Why was this, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, not the "Great" movie tons of critics attribute it to be? Oh, I don't knowbecause there's a lot of racism in here  from mocking the Chinese to the Native Americans? Because the lead singer (and voice) of Snow White sounds like she's sucking on chestnuts (not the dwarfs, I hope) whenever she opens her lips? Or is it the painful pacing?That last one got me. Sure, they wanted to make the first full feature length cartoon, but it still felt like a couple-of-minutes-long short stretched far too long in most scenes. It is said, in the truthful, and masterful sometimes Walt Disney-HIMSELF!, commentary on the DVD, that Walt wanted only scenes that enhanced the character development. Unfortunately, it still felt like scenes dragged longer than they should.I'll give it creativity. It's beautiful for what it was trying to be. It's also VERY adult. There's more than one scene of someone trying to kill someone else. Only, the Queen's evil plan was a little misconstrued. See, she sends her minion (apparently, she's just got one servant) to kill Snow White so the Queen can retain the "Fairest of them all" status. But then, she spends a good portion of screen time to transform into an ugly hag in order to trick Snow White into eating an apple and fall asleep. Luckily the writers caught the obvious flaw of a cure, but not the fact that there were plenty of opportunities for the witch/queen to simply stab the beauty instead of just putting her to sleep.More things that irate me: Grumpy, apparently one of the "main characters"  due to a higher amount of screen time than many of the other Smurfs in the movie, is a dick. Plain and simple. Sure, he evolves and Snow White spends a good portion of the movie attempting to get him to like her. But, he's still a nasty character in any lighting. Also, the extremely over-dramatic Snow White is no princessshe never, EVER, shows appreciation for any of the nice things anyone does for her. I.E. the animals bend over backwards to find her shelter. She never, ever offers or says: "thanks." The dwarfs care more about her than themselves in many occasions, such as places to sleep or when she "eternally" sleeps, and when she awakes, it's all about her wishes. Bitch.For die-hard Disney fans, it's a watch. It's not terrible; it's a good beginning and despite its flaws, I'm glad they (and the box office) had faith in Walty Boy to grant him further production deals, leading up to Disneyland, et al. Just don't be proclaiming it the "masterpiece" that people on the surface call it.Nowonto Pinocchio
Okay, here's the problem (and yes, I'll start with that) Colombiana wants to be so much more than it is. It wants so bad to be the next "female Bourne," and yet it ended up as a more ah-hem gritty Transformers.The movie's a revenge "thriller." It's a female mock-Bourne film. It's a music video slowed down and tinted brown. It wants to be so much, and yet it fails because it desires substance over script. Like the Transformers franchise.The movie plays like a straight-laced Jackie Chan film. Though they didn't bother to change the horrendous dialogue or even the terrible and clichéd "bad guys," even though they were trying for a more serious movie.For the synopsis, think Hannah minus the magic and humor/action of The Bride of the Kill Bill films without the excellent script. Young girl "almost" sees her father & mother die when the father was clearly involved with a ruthless bad guy. (I use "almost" because we never do see the deaths.) She escapes because she's super-human, apparently. And she grows to be a part-time assassin and part-time revenge killer. But then, the script writers want her to get motivation to take on her family, and extended family, murderers.Eh, this movie's so contrived, so preposterous at times (with a mostly bad score), so over-loaded and yet never loses sight on its biggest flaw: it's still a B-Movie, no matter the budget. Skip it!
(Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointCheers.)It took me until (several months ago) to finally see the "classic" Animal House. I never really wanted to; it looked enormously dated  and I'm not referring to the fact it was a product of the 70s set in the 60s  and John Belushi looked utterly disgusting in the clips and trailers I've watched. Egad, was I shocked when I did like the movie, but more so for John. I LOVED his character and him. (It helped, I had a slight crush on him, but beyond that, I thought this was a comic genius whose life was cut way too short. Yeah, I'm waaaaaaaaay late to the game, but still. I'm right, no?) It's an all-over the place frat-house mishaps movie, but still somewhat fun with a fantastic finale and even better "future" whereabouts for the characters that hopefully warded off unnecessary sequels. It's worth a watch if just for John.
If you were to add up all the bad things with 1993's Cliffhanger, you'd only have half of the number of positives.Sure, when the movie's bad  dialogue, clichés, laughable acting and too many slow-mo shots it's bad. Really bad. But I remember the only other time I've seen this movie was when it first came out 17 years ago and I would've called it a guilty pleasure, if I knew what one was at that time.I loved the cinematography  it was beautiful, I loved the suspense and despite the (most times) predictable script, the opening blew me away. Yep, it's a major plot point, but unfortunately I can't spoil it. It's a wonderful and grand scale beginning that most directors would actually use as their climax verses their prologue.And even though the film concerns mountain-men who climb up to get idiots down, there actually was a lot of action, explosions, hand-to-hand combat in addition to gun battles.Stallone plays Gabe, Rocky Mountain Rescuer Extraordinaire, who participated in an accident and leaves the high altitudes and wife behind for more than a half a year. As in most action films, the retired is always drawn back in for one final mission and low & behold he needs to assist when criminals plead for help recovering thousand dollar bills located in three remote areas.Actually, it's pretty exciting how that was really set up, or that the suitcases of cash were distributed. They really spent a lot of time making a whole lot of nothing into multiple action segments.Suspending your disbelief involves "every-day-man" Stallone who gets his ass kicked from Colorado to Castle Rock. But, if you can get past that, and the occasional obvious blue/green screen and scenes lifted out of Die Hard, you might enjoy the thrill ride. Despite the layman's obvious plot holes, I'm sure there are more for people who actually know a few things about rock climbing. I don't know the first thing, so it's just exciting and suspenseful for this amateur.Okay, it didn't prove a huge box-office sensation or that Stallone could act or write, but it's an enjoyable adventure that absolutely requires your brain to be checked in at the door before viewing.
I vowed never again to an M. Night Shyamalan movie after being sorely disappointed in Signs and then hating life after The Village, so I skipped all together Lady in the Water. However, I broke my promise one night: My roommate had this film and I thought, just for a good laugh, I will watch The Happening. And boy did I laugh. Hard. But that was just for the first half of the feature. Towards the middle, it got so incredibly bad, and then worse, I was still in tears, but not from laughing any more. I will keep my promise from here on, I swear. I heard M. Night once compared himself to Hitchcock. That should've been the biggest clue this guy hasn't got one. Hitchcock was never this bad, never were his features as drawn out to the max as M. Night's are, never this unimaginative. Does he seriously think close ups (and there are too many to count in this movie) are scary or suspenseful? Did he seriously tell his cast to cease from acting? Did he seriously write the dialogue? Did he seriously set out to make a serious B-Movie? SPOILER ALERT  Oh, and when you find out the "secret" in this one, it generates the biggest laughs  if you're still laughing by that point. The trees talk with the grass who pass the word to the flowers and so forth, to DESTROY ALL HUMANS! Really? Seriously? I'm glad I didn't see this in theatres; my laughing out loud probably would've bothered a few (if that many) other viewers.
Grifters, they're not, but they bring a pretty good American Hustle to the screen.There's a good surprise to expect towards the end, but the one that surprised me most was when Robert De Niro shows up. Yeah, it's a gangster-kinda film, so, naturally, he would. But, what threw me was that Christian Bale basically portrayed a young Robert De Niro this entire film. So much so, in fact, I could never see Bale. Just De Niro.So, it was odd seeing them both on screen at the same time.Beyond that, you do have some damn good performances from the female leads. Amy Adams, whom I always see as a Muppets lead, did great here, but she was outshined by the always fantastic Jennifer Lawrence.Those two, Amy and Jennifer, actually did so well, that you nearly forget about the male leads (and their terrible wigs) in this feature.I digress. This movie, about lowlifes who get caught and have to turn tricks now for the feds is decent enough. Not great, but watchable through to the end. Sadly, it's really nothing I haven't seen before and yet, the humor, music and performances did make it watchable and interesting. I wouldn't necessarily vote it into the Best Picture noms from 2013, but you could do a lot worse.* * * Final thoughts: Jeremy Renner's always been a favorite of mine, as is Jennifer Lawrence as of late. Sadly, neither portrayed their best performances here, but still did what they could. Though it would be nice for the nominated Lawrence to pull in another Actress Oscar win, my eyes are centered in on Julia Roberts in August: Osage County.
Terrible CGI. Awful Acting. Clichéd plot. Predictable storyline. Cardboard characters. Disgustingly bad dialogue. Doesn't do 2-player video game justice. And worst of all  it's a comedy but doesn't know it; I laughed so hard during this movie it was as if this was directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Furthermore, I have yet to see The Last Airbender, but I can imagine this 15-year-old movie mirrors M. Night's most recent failure.So sorry. I had to get most of my disgusted feelings out so I can move onwith more criticism on 1995's Mortal Kombat.I guess I can be so harsh because prior to this viewing, my first in probably ten plus years, this was not only my favorite video-game-adaptation, but ranked high on my action favorites. I watch it now andmanthismovieSUCKS.Really, there's no way around thinking this sick excuse of a franchise isn't bad. Listen to what they're saying without cracking up. Watch the Super-Nintendo graphics explode. Experience the lazily choreographed scenes that a Junior High production's worst rehearsal would top. Even in 1995they should be ASHAMED.So, then, why did I award this piece of trash 1½ star out of five possible? Well, I was fooled into liking this movie when I was young, and I absolutely loved the soundtrack. Okay, I STILL like the soundtrack. After a decade and a half, it holds up. There. I give it something it probably doesn't deserve.God, I don't even want to waste any more time in giving the so-called plot, but I'm obligated. Apparently, there's this, uh, tournament with the movie's title and if the bad guys win, the world ends. If the good guys win, well, there'll be a sequel (unfortunately, and spoiler, there was one.) The editing is shotty  scenes just begin and end without ease. The CGI's amateur  even for 1995. The action isquite literallyBORING. This movie makes Pokemon interesting. And good for me, but bad for the target audienceThe movie is as homoerotic as 300. Please, could you include a few more topless action-figure male-extras in the sequel? This used to be my number one video-game adapted movie. It might still bebut that's not saying much as every single video-game-turned-big-screen sucked. SKIP this movie.Side Note: I only re-watched this movie due to the recent fantastic short based on some kind of Mortal Kombat remake available online. (Can't rely on this link - traileraddict.com/trailer/mortal-kombat-rebirth/short-film, because by the time you read/click this, it might have vanished.) Can they possibly redeem themselves?
Warning: do not read too much into Donnie Darko. And by "read" I mean what the internet dissects from the film. Talk about spoilers for the experience!And what an experience this gem was: an all-star cast in which everyone was either great or excellent, a perfect soundtrack and above all else: it was one of the most original movies I've ever seen.Probably, about a decade ago, I first saw Donnie Darko, and that was the "Theatrical Cut." Unlike "edited for television," I don't mind theatrical versions because a lot of the time, the "Director's Cut" thoroughly ruins the experience. Best example, the near-excellent Payback's "Straight Up"  or Director's Cut  edition is positively awful. And same with the Richard Donner's Superman II version. Blah.That all said, after buying Donnie Darko on BluRay, I decided my second journey down this, ah-hem, rabbit hole would be with the Director's Cut. Not disappointed was I, but it did "clear up" a lot of "left open for interpretation" scenes the first go-around. Some people would rather figure it all out on their own, while some need some explaining on the menu. I could go either way, unless it's too widely out of left field and takes fifteen discussions to understand. Donnie Darko wasn't 100% straight forward, but I "got it" both times I've seen it.Sleepwalking Donnie inadvertently dodges a huge bullet, in the form of a jet's engine that falls from the sky and obliterates teen Donnie's bedroom while Donnie was wandering his small town at night. The kid's already having problems  he's on meds, sees a shrink, in fights with his parents, he's an outcast at school and has an imaginary 6 foot demonic man-rabbit friend. But, he knows something no one else does.It's easy to pass this off to his illness, but we know something else is going on here. Amongst all the going on's, that is. This movie is chock-full of intertwining and interesting story lines with some fantastic characters. But, getting back to this synopsis, this is a journey of Donnie Darko attempting to understand all the "signs" following his near-death experience.Did I mention he knows when the end of days is? And it's coming up fairly soon.The movie's extremely well shot, enormously interesting in how different it is and leads people to so many conclusions even though it's quite concluded at the end. The score and music are top notch, despite not being from this 1988-era set movie and there should be a drinking game to count how many actors flooded the screen without looking at the credit list online prior.Overall, this experimental film was a blast, and I loved how even a "weird" movie doesn't have to cross the line into "spaced out."(Yeah, I've seen those "spaced out" types of movies and wouldn't recommend going into one that has a great premise and just falls apart because the director/writer cannot control their drug habits.)
It was no wonder that the advertisements for After Earth took forever to include Director M. Night Shyamalan's name to the promos. He's the joke of Hollywood and they really, really wanted this movie to make money. Make that, Will Smith really, really wanted his son to have more unworthy exposure.Well, the movie rightfully bombed in America and ironically, the character Will Smith Jr, Jaden, plays is not yet ready for dutyUm, and neither is Jaden for movies.Granted, I've always had a thing against Jaden, putting aside Daddy's shameless push for him. Back when The Day the Earth Stood Still came out in 2008, I cringed more at Jaden than what I normally did for when I see Keanu Reeves on screen. It appears, five years later, Jaden isn't still fit for duty. If anything, he has gotten a lot worse.The reason I'm focusing in on him verses my normal rant about the terrible M. Night, because you see Jaden for 80% of this movie, and only him. If he had a spark of charisma, a minute depth of acting ability or had one decent line of dialogue, I might change my mind on him. But, nooooHe just continuously got worse as this movie staggered on.Most M. Night movies are unintentionally hilarious and that's why I love to watch them. His movies are so bad, so slow and so ridiculous at times, they're fun to watch because of their pure, unadulterated awfulness. Sadly, because of how bad Jaden was, I wasn't laughing. And I really wanted to, despite this being far from a comedy.The movie starts off actually pleasant enough. Not great, nothing original, but watchable. The film opens with a very long explanation on why humans live on another world now, and it's 1,000+ years into the future. Enter Will Smith: a distant, cold and emotionless (a Shyamalan staple!) father who attempts to break the mold by bringing his son with him on a training mission against aliens.With Flotsam & Jetsam flying the ship, they, of course, kill everyone on board with the exception of the Smith Family, by crashing on planet...gasp...Earth. No one's supposed to go there! All living creatures there have evolved to kill humans even though no human's been there for over a thousand years! And the environment never bothered to even itself out after the millennia!Well, co-writer M. Night must've loved the TV show Lost because half the ship lands in one area while the other some obscene distance away. Their mission, to get to the other half to signal for help, but poor daddy is hurt and must spend the bulk of the movie boring us by video-guiding his on/off-screen son, Kitai, to the beacon.All that I described for the plot was merely the first 20 minutes or so. We have a long way to go to the end, but sadly the story is halted there and basically, and literally, gets frozen in the unoriginal concept of USING THE FORCE, Luke, er, KITAI!Overall, the movie's sadly and completely unimaginative and predictable, but worst of all, I had the utmost displeasure of seeing Jaden run around for over an hour squealing bad dialogue without conviction and trying his best to show depth he could never find.While Daddy Will isn't the best actor and is rarely off his normal Men In Black character, he could spin circles around his adolescent. Too bad, Daddy Will couldn't leave his portion of the ship and go and show Jaden a thing  or ANYthing  about acting."My suit's turned black! I like it, but I think it's something bad!"  Kitai. Seriously?
Rule number one: If you have not watched any of the 'Scary Movie' or 'Scream' series, watch 'Scream' first. Rule number two: Watch 'Scream 2' and maybe even 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' then you may safely move onto 'Scary Movie.' I've seen 'Scream' multiple times, but 'Scary Movie' ('Scream's spoof) many more times. It's hard not to laugh throughout this viewing of 'Scream' remembering the hilarious scene-by-scene, line-by-line mock-ups in 'Scary Movie.' That being said, I do remember my first reaction to this movie 13 years ago at its premiere. What a fantastic movie and though it's an homage to previous slasher films (there has to be six dozen references, names, scenes, innuendos in 'Scream') it really reinvented the genre, leading itself into multiple and extremely poor quality rip-offs. In fact, as this brought back the slasher horror and gave it more intelligence, it also brought it back crashing down, harder than before with the horrid carbon copies following. The movie starts with a bang, and the horror references begin early. You think you're watching a Drew Barrymore film, but quickly it shifts to main character Sidney and her group of friends who get picked off one-by-one while everyone's a suspect. Director Craven (loved him as the janitor) has definitely hits/misses (even see part 3 of this series) but his two most influential films  of my generation, that is  is 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and 'Scream.' While this one's not perfect, it's a real gem, with great comedy, homage, great acting, horror; 'Scream' was an excellent balance of all the right elements to horror-comedy and a perfect teen-night-out. Sure, it's now dated, and teens now probably need a little more (thanks, 'Saw' and other torture porn) but anyone growing up in the genre should appreciate this.
It's nice to see a movie with their heart in the right place these days. Though, despite their many, MANY, attempts, it was barely funny at all  I smiled a bit, but only laughed once, Monsters University definitely improved on the original. And that was my least favorite Pixar film until Cars (and eventually, Cars 2) came out.Sadly, the criticisms don't stop there. The movie went on for far too long. This isn't an original story by any measurable means, even when it works. It did not need to go on for an additional approximately 15 minutes to tell the same ole story.But, that said, this probably unnecessary prequel  why not a sequel? Huh  was still a good ride and the messages were literally from the heart and not forced. I had fun and marveled at the incredible graphics on screen. Yet another visually stunning Pixar film.The story transports the main characters of the original Monster's Inc, Mike and Sully, back to college so they can prove themselves as "scarers." Along the turbulent way, they have to learn more about themselves and help fellow underdogs achieve potential as well.Again, I was NOT a fan of the original, but I didn't hate on it. I felt the exact same here. But, considering the recent mediocre to very bad Pixar films of late, this one was refreshing to get back to a G-Rated, heart-filled story.* * * Final thoughts: I haven't seen the original, since it premiered in 2001. Never planned on it. Maybe I will revisit to see if I truly felt this installment was actually better, but as it stands, I think it does.
Talk about false advertising!Take notice, Hollywood. The trailer makes or breaks your feature's box office. Sure, it's not common for audiences to flood to war movies, especially Iraq or current war films, but this movie, Green Zone, was surely marketed as Damon's next Bourne movie. SEE: the advertisement for Director of both Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum and it stars Matt Damon! Even I was fooled, until I saw it.Literally, if you're looking for a realistic view of the current (mid-2000s) war and a (practically) non-stop war-action film, this is your Netflix choice. It all-but never lets up with the violence and combat scenes. So, if that's your bag, baby, this is your flick.Personally, I'm not into war movies. They just depress me. It makes me remember how DUMB human beings really are. Not necessarily the soldiers, though they do volunteer for such madness. I'm referring to the man on top of one side and the man on the other who think human lives are expendable and that their viewpoint is worth more than the opposing side.Seriously. Beyond working it out, by simply talking it out, these fools prove that, once again, we're not worth saving. How can any sane person watch this and feel good about the deaths of human beings? Granted this tale is fictional, but it's wrapped around true events. I just shake my head to people (guys, mostly) who love to see the carnage, where I see this aswell a needless bloodbath due to incredibly horrible individuals playing a human chess game.I rate this movie a little higher than I would normally for the strong performance from Damon and the absolutely realistic view and feel of the background. Otherwise, it's a paper-thin plot of a Chief (Damon) in Bagdad, who quickly and outspokenly realizes that there really is no WMD, or weapons of mass destruction, despite what the ever-wise George Bush JR feeds the American audiences.On a personal note, as these real-life events took place between 2001-2005 and beyond, I never once gave into then-President Bush or the media filling my head with the idea we're (USA) in Iraq to search for the WMD. I didn't need to give into "conspiracy theories" or radical groups to know the crap they were feeding us was just that: crap. It didn't take a two-year-old to realize we were/are over there for oil. And Green Zone just drives that home.Green Zone's not a bad movie, when it comes to realism, other than Miller's outrageous character's outbursts that never leads to discipline, but it teaches those who have half a brain nothing new. My friend at work was literally in Iraq when this movie took place. He described scenes and things that happened (like the p|ss-bottles or the exploded airplane at Saddam's airport) BEFORE both he or I saw this movie. For that, I give the movie kudos for making this as realistic and true as it could be.But other than the extreme attention to detail, the non-stop war action and the acting, the movie falls prey to a rouge liberal who would solely get his ass handed to him if he did even a tenth of what he does in the second half of the movie. Heck, he's was more concerned with exposing the truth than his fellow American comrade's lives.See it, if you really want to see what goes on over there. Avoid if you cherish human life.
Just finished Scrooged4/5 Stars..Hilarious, definitely one of Bill Murray's best, though it does seem to fall apart in the final act and I really don't think enough examples of him changing were providedbut its still a great Christmas movie with a ton of humor.Wow, that was a quick review I wrote a while back. May I add: I loved Carol Kane in this  she was a highlight. She added a lot to The Princess Bride, and here as well. Also, I laughed out loud with the dialogue and Murray's dry wit.This is a must see for Christmas-movie fans. I will be watching it again this holiday season.
I don't have $100 million dollars. Much less, a mere million (YET  Lotto's on tonight) but what a disappointment Due Date turned out to be at barely breaking $100 million. I'm guessing marketing  labeling it as the next Hangover probably didn't help since they were polar opposites.This movie was hilarious! Well, okay, let me preface with you kinda have to be a Robert Downey Jr. fan. Like me. Oh, and you should be familiar with and find Zach Galifianakis funny. Agreed. Also, be aware, it's completely preposterous and is unlike most road trips whereas the lead character, Peter (Downey Jr.) is a real-almost-90%-unlovable-ass. Yeah, I can dig that.So, if you fit into those categories above and understand what you're getting yourself into, just leave your brain at the door and enjoy yourself here. And to clarify, he's not just unlovable, he really is justplainmean.Businessman Peter's first of a series of unfortunate events with Ethan (Galifianakis) is outside an airport and is continued onto their "coincidental" flight together. Both get booted off and 86'd from the friendly skies. Having to get across country quick, OK, well, within a few days, now wallet-less Peter reluctantly agrees to join Ethan on a road-trip-from-hell to get home for the birth of his first child.Whewthat didn't take long to give the basic synopsis, and shoot, it sounds clichéd as hell. In reality, that's not too far off a statement, especially when you roll in the inevitable "zany secondary characters" or predictable escapades the find themselves into or the foreseen "twists." If not for the great lines, mainly from Downey Jr. sparing a lot more for Galifianakis, the movie would be a complete dud. Seriously, it was their magic/chemistry that held the loose glue together.And to enjoy them, you'll have to suspend a great deal of disbelief, such as being allowed on a plane with a marijuana pipe because security believes that famous "Oh, that's not mine" line or a government vehicle stolen and yet no one seems to want to put a simple little APB out on it or someone is shot and the hospital asks no questions. Of course not.So, just know what you're getting yourself into, and enjoy these two great comics. It's not for everybody, but I happen to like both leads a lot and went along for the fun ride.
It was back in 1990, Beverly Hills, CA, that I first saw (now labeled as "The Original Movie") Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or TMNT. I was with my best bud and my parents had dropped him and I off at a mall on an off-amusement park day on our holiday in CA from AZ.I was skeptical at first. I have always loved movies, and watched pretty much anything, everything back then as a high school'er. But, this looked cheesy from the trailers, even though I was both a fan of the show and the one sarcastic, fun-times turtle character, Michelangelo. Still, we weren't visiting one of the three parks that day and had time to kill. So, why not?I had fun back then. I was thoroughly impressed with it. It had me rolling in laughter, I believed in the fantasy they created with the rubber-suited Turtles and, um, Rat and it had enough action to keep us both entertained. I gave it back then, 4/5 stars.Today, revisiting it after not seeing it for twenty years, I have changed my opinion down tojust 3½/5 stars. So, not much of a change.Probably my biggest problem, or reason for the half star decrease in 20 years, is because the movie was just too dark. I'm speculating that it was the lack of faith people would believe the rubber-suited turtles would look "real" in bright lights. I really don't know. But, what I do know, that combined with the darkness for the majority of the picture and the poor transfer on BluRay, it just wasn't as fun as when I originally viewed it, or the few times following my initial viewing.I won't downgrade a movie due to the lack of interest or funds to produce a high quality BluRay, but I did for the confidence the director had with the lighting.I digress: The movie revolves around a crime spree in the big city and a band of brothers, er, "mutant turtles" who team up with both a reporter and a fellow, and hilarious, vigilante to fight this injustice.That's the gist of it. Having to get past the fact no one would freak about a green 5'5" creature in a trench coat or how someone is amazed up front, but within seconds okay with a talking giant turtle or rat, is up to the viewer. You really have to suspend your disbelief. If you can and understand where this came from and know it's not just the 1990s, but 1990, then you might have as much fun as I have over the years.See it!
George A. Romero's Survival of the Dead, or Night of the Living Dead Part 6, is, well, blah. And this is coming off the heels of one of the best in the series, Diary of the Dead. (That's a whole other story/review. But I did like that movie a lot.)What happened to the commentary on society? I can't think of any of the original chapters (1-5) that didn't show one side of society with direct criticism. I'm guessing this round belongs to two fighting families. And even though it's somewhat comical, and that's another staple of the series, it's really just plainboring. In addition, if you're looking for a "real" zombie movie, seriously look elsewhere. You'll find more zombie clips on Robot Chicken than in Survival of the Dead.I did like, however, the connection between Diary and Survival in the form of Crocket (Sprang) who was part of renegades on their own, or them vs. the new world.Survival of the Dead starts a few days after the dead (zombies) rise and join the living, well, in order to convert the alive to dead. That part was pretty much fast-forwarded, as it's been done a million times, including this very series. It focuses on two sparring families on an island. One wants to rid the world of zombies, the other wants to wait on a cure.Meanwhile, Crocket's Coop needs a safe haven, a daughter's trying to stop the fighting, there's a lesbian and zombies treated like cattle.I've really just brushed the surface of Survival, but even a fan like myself, will say this movie was, again, so bland. Georgie just needs to stop. Unless he made the definite final chapter, i.e. real cure, he needs to lay off the undead. I guess if you're a die-hard fan, you can watch this, but it absolutely adds nothing to the story.Side Note: For those who know me, knows I would not have a problem with homosexuality or, in this case, lesbians. But, if you're stuck with the end of the world, or  duh  human SURVIVAL, then just give it up. Mate with men, continue the species, and then go back to what's natural. It's kind of, our, well, responsibility. (I know I'll probably get some heat on this one.)
Shame on anyone who even comes close to comparing this 2014 updated Godzilla movie to the horrid 1998 Matthew Broderick version. It would be like putting Batman & Robin in the same league as The Dark Knight.So, in other words, forget that tragedy of a mistake 16 years ago. But, do remember Godzilla from the better part of the last century.This is a movie to absorb and recount your feelings following. Definitely followingbecause all the way through it was I disappointed in this or that and that was probably because this was my movie event of 2014 and one I was looking forward to the second that 1998 movie ended. I wanted them to make a serious Godzilla movie. I knew they had the technology (Jurassic Park was half a decade before the 1998 flop) so I wanted to see a real, honest, big-ass Godzilla flick.Once this movie was over, I did realize that they actually did immortalize the series and original from sixty years ago. They captured every element (aside from one) and give Japan a very well-made, apology/make-up from the 1998 movie.What disappointed me during the screening was the lack of SHOW DON'T TELL  the technique I learned as a journalist in school. Consistently, we got the "Look at what the monster did!" destruction scene, but we hardly got to see it happening. Or, if we did, we saw it on a sad little TV screen. Um, I paid to see this on the BIG IMAX (Liemax, whatever) screen. This reminded me a bunch of the other huge green monster on screen: Ang Lee's Hulk when a ton of the action I wanted to see big was in tiny little boxes. How cuteNOT.Yes, I get this is from the director of Monsters, a movie I really liked. But, there, where he showed his giant creatures rarely, as well, I figured it was because they had no budget. Here, he proved it was for some TELL DON'T SHOW opposite effect.I don't care for this style of filmmaking. I understand there are a bunch of people out there that like their monsters in the shadows, or worse, off-screen, but I do want to see them. Almost always on screen. I could go home to a dark house and pretend there are monsters around every corner and have the same impact. Hell, I'd even save money and time doing so.So, unfortunately, most of the movie is putting together what everyone in the movie is seeing but we'll never. Mercifully, the end climatic battle  no spoiler there, you knew that was coming and expected, made up for 90% of the vacancies in the movie. Backtracking here a bit. Godzilla starts with multiple stories in the past which lead up to our cast of a few humans tracking the events in the story and why we would have a giant beast named Godzilla in the first place. It does twist the original story a bit, but for the most part stays faithful to the core of the legend.Present day arrives and government cover-ups from years/decades past unravel and the situation cannot be contained. Godzilla is on the loose and the world will see his wrath.Absolutely will I provide no spoilers here in regards to the plot, motivations and surprises. But, suffice to say, when all is said and done, i.e. you get to the climactic battle, it IS ALL WORTH IT. Especially, if you've grown up on the Godzilla lore, like I did.Actually, I am a HUGE Godzilla fan while growing up. Saturday morning's "From Beyond" segment followed the normal cartoon lineups. Heck, even the opening credits to that two-hour TV block was the water waves produced by Godzilla emerging from the depths of the ocean for the very first time.For the structure (and special effects, score and cinematography) they satisfied my need to get the Godzilla film series back on track in America. Unfortunately, there was one bad side-effect on them trying to be as faithful as possible to the source material: a poor line up of humans. The actors, God love them, especially Bryan Cranston, his on-screen hunk of a son, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and the obvious Asian voice of anti-human/pro-nature: Ken Watanabe. They all did what they needed to do on screen. Nothing more. Nothing that made me truly care of any of them lived or died. One can argue these movies don't need to elevate to Oscar performances and I would argue: it couldn't hurt. So, with my disappointment of far too many "Oh, look at what the monster did!five minutes ago" and lack of depth in the acting, caused just a couple of bumps down in my rating. That said, it's absolutely worth the viewing and I cannot wait to see it again. Now that I know what to expect and any previous expectations are extinguished, I think I might have an even better time with this production. * * *Final thoughts: I am a huge Las Vegas fan. I visit there 3-4x/year and because of this, my friend and I had to laugh when a Las Vegas scene appeared. Not only did they show a devastated Las Vegas Blvd (or "The Strip") but the scene begins at the very hotel I booked for a mere week away from me seeing this movie: Caesars Palace! Not only that, of its five-six buildings, the one with the most damage (the building was cut in half) as they pan back, is the very building I am staying in  the Augustus Tower.I don't care. Luck is on my side. I'm still going. And even if a giant monster did attack the Strip, then I might have most of the place to myself. Viva Las Vegas!
A lot of people (well, critics) were proclaiming Matthew McConaughey's "triumphant" return to the courtroom since 1996's A Time to Kill is The Lincoln Lawyer. Hardly; on many accounts.First: I really, REALLY loved A Time to Kill, but it was still a thoroughly fictional and Hollywoodized tale of the deep south, whereas The Lincoln Lawyer was a much more realistic tale of the legal system in modern L.A. Second: despite reading the very long John Grisham novel (twice) the movie wasn't all that predictable, whereas The Lincoln Lawyer was. Every step of the way. And third  BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST  the performances were hardly worthy of a mention in The Lincoln Lawyer whereas in A Time to Kill, they were brilliant.Okay, now that I debunked those nasty comparisons and hopefully helped you see this as two barely similar, but completely different courtroom tales, let's focus on this low-rent lawyer and how he defends the guilty to keep his car running in both this economy and with the rising gas prices.Mick Haller (McConaughey) works out of his car, a Lincoln to be precise  hence the film's (and from the adapted book) title, and he represents scum who are most likely and definitely guilty so he can continue his, uh, "practice" until one day he gets a tip that a high profile case might be seeking him out.Louis Roulet (Phillippe) is accused of sexually assaulting and almost killing a woman. He claims he's innocent and it's up to Mick who's juggling his ex-wife/fbuddy, a motorcycle gang and finances to defend the pretty boy.Seriouslyfrom the moment Louis enters the screen, you know how this will pan out or if he's guilty or not. The nice thing about this movie is: it doesn't matter. It's all about Mick both redeeming himself and how on Earth will he get out of this? I like movies that have characters backed into corners and whether right or wrong, they have to find a clever way out. Also, I LOVE courtroom dramas. Whether in film or book format.Unfortunately, this isn't a great movie, or perfect lawyer yarn, but it's entertaining and suspenseful enough for a viewing. Yeah, 'a' as in singular. This is mainly due to its length and its multiple endings  God, I hate more than 1-2-3 or FOUR sometimes finales.Quite frankly, I'd much rather watch the (surprisingly superior) comedy Liar, Liar where another lawyer has to get out of an impossible trial with a defendant who might be guilty. At least that entertained me, at a much quicker pace, less screen time and didn't take itself too seriously.Overall, it's not a bad viewingbut at home. On the Freezone on your DVR box from Cox Communications. Just don't expect this to be briefly mentioned at the next Oscars.
Despite #1 being a very good movie, 'Spider-Man 2' falls under the "Surprisingly Better" sequels. Now, that's not to say, #2 didn't have its problems. It did, including one lingering from #1 (pacing,) but overall, they moved forward with the series. And in high-speed.Already established web-slinger, do-gooder, Spider-Man continues his plight in saving kids and punishing criminals all the while getting beaten up (emotionally) as Peter Parker. In fact, they show more than enough of his beat-downs. We get it already  he's a nerd that everyone takes advantage of.At any rate, he's still pursuing both MJ (Dunst,) who's now engaged to a more "stable" astronaut and Dr. Otto Octavius all the while, he's avoiding best friend (of Pete)/mortal enemy (of Spidey) Harry (Franco.) To make matters worse, his mother's losing her home, Pete's losing his apartment, Doc Ock's becoming an eight-limbed crazed scientist and he's getting Spidey-blocked, or unable to use his powers as his mind's overloaded.There's actually a lot more, but that's for the viewer to see. Don't want to give away everything. Suffice to say, Pete's got a lot on his mind. Thankfully, they've up'd the villain-scale with Dr. Octopus played brilliantly by (unknown to me at the time) Alfred Molina. He ranks as one of the best on-screen villains of all time. His quiet tone, brilliant mind and attitude and mannerisms, especially being attached to 4 additional limbs, made him quite believable despite his appearance. Side Note: Doc Ock was always my favorite Spider-Man villain, and since they did a great job, this is my favorite Spider-Man movie, by a long shot.Hopefully most people picked up on the operation scene, when they tried to rid Dr. Octavius of his metal contraptions and how it was an absolute perfect homage to Raimi's previous work. That was so 'Evil Dead' that, though it was hard to watch, especially the nail scrape, I was so impressed that he came back to his roots vs. the main-stream 'Spider-Man' had become. If you don't believe me, split screen the chainsaw with 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Army of Darkness.' There are a lot of excellent action sequences, tension and fun to be had in 'Spider-Man 2.' (The train scene, itself, is worth admission.) Nevertheless, the movie should've been cut back some  pacing is such a problem for Raimi and enough already with on again/off again relationship with MJ & Parker.In addition, we get the multiple "Should I be a 'superhero' or not" long scenes. Superman did that, but only briefly in another superhero part 2: 'Superman II.' That's old and wears heavily. Thankfully, they move past it and you can enjoy the movie. Of course, if you can get past now multiple people knowing Spidey's true identity, that is.I cringe that the movie critic I respect the most (Roger Ebert,) called this the best superhero movie he's ever seen. I wouldn't go that far (I'll always be partial to 'Superman: The Movie.' Heck, a few years later 'The Dark Knight' blew this one away) but I would say it's absolutely recommended. Especially since we didn't have to wait too long to see Spider-Man swing, unlike part one.
I love the promotional poster that includes, in big caps: STELLAR, HILARIOUS, GENUINE, EMOTIONAL, EDGY and CONFIDENT. Hey, Don Jon! Did you and I see the same movie?Absolutely this movie was not bad and a tad original  I said "a tad!"  but it wasn't worth all the praise it put on its own poster. It's a very basic story of addiction but not groundbreaking, especially in its "recovery" phase.Jon, Don Jon, is addicted to online porn. While not alone  say, 5% of American adults haven't partook with said pleasures, he can't get enough, which, I guess, puts him squarely in the 80% truly addicted to it. This is not to say Jon doesn't have a (night) life as he does also partake in the females at the local discotheque.After years of banging both the human form and the hand-held kind, he does settle down with a "9" in the form of Scarlet Johansson. But, is she enough to rid him of his "problem at hand?" Or will the older, wiser and higher co-student of his get him to remember life after (on)line?The movie attempts to shock and splash multiples of porn images on the screen. For anyone over, say 14, none of this is new. Maybe not so much in a movie, but it's not shocking to most. But, it is funny and genuine at times. And I absolutely adored and loved Julianne Moore in this.Ever since Hannibal, she's continued to un-impress me, sadly. This is not a great thing to say about her, because I know she's so much more. But, up until this, she's been in a downward spiral. Mercifully, while not perfect, she's definitely rebounded here and is absolutely worth watching this movie for.Overall, it's a recommend, but only for those with open minds. For those who have any bit of a mind that's closed, or even ajar, stay away. Watch those G-rated Kirk Cameron films for "pleasure."* * * Final thoughts: Joseph, who's been plenty better in other films, didn't do a bad job here and while not amateurish in direction, it wasn't up to what he could do. I look forward to seeing more from him.
Probably the best book I have ever read was John Grisham's first (and absolute best) novel, A Time to Kill. This is not to say, it went soaring downhill after his debut book, but eventually I had to stop reading after probably a dozen or so.Despite this was his first effort, it was the fourth movie to hit the theaters. I'm sorry it took so long, because of all of Grisham's movie adaptations, this was by far the best.It doesn't hurt at all, it's contains an incredible cast, including two of my favorite actors of all time: Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson. Also, I love both Donald & Kiefer Sutherland, Sandra Bullock, Charles S. DuttonI could just reprint the entire cast. Much like A Few Good Men, one of my all time favorite movies and courtroom dramas, both contain a stellar list of credits.Also, it contains great drama, suspense, dialogue, humor and is a major tear-jerker. If you don't get choked up (or filled with anger) with what happened that little girl (see below) then I can't imagine what would stir emotions within you.Little (and normally I wouldn't point out her race out if not so relevant here) black Tanya (Kelly) is walking home to her family while her father, Carl Lee (Jackson) is hard at work, supporting his family. She's picked up (kidnapped) by the main definition of racist rednecks and raped, beaten, urinated on, tossed, hung and damaged beyond repair.Due to other cases that allowed these kinds of evils to either have reduced sentences or actually freed, Carl Lee takes it into his own hands to slaughter the two bad men in front of pretty much the whole town while they are about to enter their trial. Of course, now Carl Lee's imprisoned and it's up to Jake (McConaughey) to take the case of a lifetime for a mere $900.Add in the KKK causing havoc to those on Carl Lee's side and Jake's failing business, Jake has a lot going on. People get shot, terrorized and a lot of fires set. Jake also has to prove he was legally insane when everyone knows he wasn't and Carl Lee is happy to say otherwise, publicly. This would be the ideal case for Governor-to-be D.A. Rufus (Spacey) if not for the emotional side of the case, or"What would you do if this happened to your daughter?" This leads to my favorite quote of the movie: "If you win this case, justice will prevail, and if you lose, justice will also prevail." I love courtroom movies and books, and the ones I like best are fictional stories involving decisions just like this one. And this one dives you so deep into the Southern town they live in, and in the jury's mind, it's practically impossible for you not to put yourself in the jury's shoes.I have left out a lot of what happens during the movie, as there are a lot of interesting and suspenseful, not to mention comical scenes, but this is a MUST SEE. I have read the book twice (I'm a slow reader and it is quite large  or small print, many pages, so it's not likely, I'll read it again soon) and even though some things were changed, they pretty much nailed the book down. This has to rank as #2 best courtroom movie I've seen (behind A Few Good Men). Also, read the book for more extreme depth into the fantastic character of Jake Brigance.
In the exclusively clichéd Contraband, ex-bad guy Mark Wahlberg plays Chris Farraday who helps his idiot brother-in-law out of a jam but gets himself and wifey into plenty himself.Quite frankly, that's all I want to say about this mess of a movie. It was a gut wrenching experience to watch old burned out themes overlapping even older and tired themes repeatedly. Hell, they all-but start the movie in the standard crowded, obviously East-Coast bar where Chris professes the standard, retired "he ain't like that anymore" speech.It didn't help the movie was filmed in the dark, for the most part, and the script all over the place. Throw in bad performances, ho-hum action segments and actors who just didn't care to be there.This heist themed film is so far removed from entertainment that it should, in fact, be banned. It's light-years under Ocean's Eleven (pick one) and it's a chore to get to the inevitable, highly foreseen finale.Seriously, there is barely a redeeming quality here and it should be skipped.
God, I don't even know where to start with The Big Lebowski. Perhaps at the beginning?My (then) boyfriend practically forced me in 2002-3 to watch this against my will  holding me down, as he was bigger and stronger, while propping my eyes open, a la Clockwork Orange. Okay, fine, he suggested it, I hesitated and gave inis how it really went down. At any rate, I only mildly liked it then when he was rolling with his signature and usually contagious laughter.The movie grew on me, however, over the years  and that's not with extra viewings. In fact, until last night, 2/4/2011, I hadn't seen it since. I have thought about this feature, discussed with others and found myself laughing at scenes and dialogue that I hadn't seen or heard in years. Damn, I'm glad I decided to finally revisit it in order to finally review it.The movie was enormously well written and original. Hilarious, spot on and had some of the best deliveries. When I tried to find the ONE scene I loved the most or the ONE line I favored above the rest, it was incredibly difficult. I ended up picking the sex/bowling dream even though all scenes with the "Caucasian" (or White Russian) in his hand, especially when he should've spilled it, but didn't, had me cracking up. And the lines throughout were clever, ingenious and memorable/quotable, but to narrow it down, I simply picked the "Shut the f*ck up, Donny!" line that's repeated many times. Each time I heard that, even the 15th, made me laugh out loud.But, the movie's strength wasn't just in the comedy. It's incredibly creative and has a novel approach to the old mistaken identity plot. Throw in great cinematography, convincing twists and wonderful acting and you have a near-perfect film and probably my favorite Coen Brothers feature.Further, the characters really drove the film even above and beyond what was already mentioned. Most were excellent and original, but Jeff Bridges actually should have received his first (of many deserved) Oscar for his role as "The Dude." The uniqueness, depth and believability alongside Bridges' own spin and acting made The Dude one of my all time favorite characters in films.Caucasian drinking, robe-wearing, unemployed and lazy-ass The Dude struts through life while bowling with his wacked ex-'Nam buddy, Walter (Goodman) and Donny (Buscemi) untilone day he's mistaken for wealthy Jeffrey Lebowski (Huddleston) who shares the same name as The Dude's real name.There's been a kidnapping of the appropriately named "Bunny" (Reid), the wife of "The Big(ger) Lebowski," for a million bucks and The Dude, as sluggish as he is, pays as close attention to this as would a pet gerbil to its surroundings. But, one of the bad men pee on his rug that sets off a chain of unfortunate events that get The Dude and Walter into trouble as they investigate and try and disfuse the situation sothey can get back to their bowling league.More clues and kookier characters blend into the mix and the Coen Brothers don't even miss a beat in making this unbelievably realistic. Example: Jesus, (Turturro) and yes, you pronounce it as the same Man on the cross, wanders in and out of the movie setting up a hilarious but completely irrelevant character. That's how it is in the real world.Sure, the movie actually goes on for a little longer than it should  the movie's only real flaw, but it's worth the entire trip (yeah, literal trip.) Also, there's a hell of a lot of swearing. I kinda matched that in my review, which is something I normally don't do, but here, it's relevant.The Big Lebowski is a prime example of how to make a movie. And quite frankly, this movie can be broken down and studied. For, line by line, it's pure craftsmanship.
As a horror movie, The Devil Inside didn't work. It was not scary at all. Even if you liked Paranormal Activity, you've seen all the jumps coming in this equally shot Mockumentary.As a Mockumentary, The Devil Inside didn't work. It wasn't fresh, new, funny (intentionally, that is) or relevant. Even if you liked Paranormal Activity, you've already seen this type of "fake" (oh, but is it real?) documentary.As a documentary, The Devil Inside didn't work. It wasn't real, and the part where they say it's based on a true story only means, there really are priests out there, there really is a Vatican and Rome is a real place. Even if you liked Paranormal Activity, you've already been duped by what I believe is to be comedy.I guess the only thing The Devil Inside worked aswas a comedy. I laughed pretty hard at scenes I'm guessing were supposed to be frightening. And I wasn't the only one in the theatre laughing. Of the people who remained  yes, people did get up to leave permanently, a few of them laughed right there with me.Now, admittedly, I didn't laugh as hard as I did through Paranormal Activity or even the Twilight series, so it's not "so bad it's funny-good"it's just plain bad.That is too bad. I've heard a lot of negative buzz going in, but I still kept an open mind  as I always do when I watch a movie. And it didn't start off bad, though not good either. But thenit got progressively worse until the final laugh-out-loud finale.If this were a true documentary (like this would really happen), it would be, for the most part, the most boring and amateurish looking piece of work. It involves a woman concerned that she, too, will become possessed after her dear-ole-ma went devil-mad and killed three people of the cloth during her own exorcism.So, daughter and her (barely) trusty and film-school-drop out cameraman race off to Rome to visit said crazy mother and, dare I?, all hell breaks loose. There, they meet the Devilbusters: rouge priests who do exorcisms on their own without the consent of the Church. Oooohhh.Oh, and they don't wanna be caught, so naturally, they allow their Exo-cave of high-tech Devilbustin' equipment be filmed. Huh?Anyways, if that part doesn't start the slide into utter movie-madness, then just wait. There's more for you to laugh at. Like how close, for no reason whatsoever, the subjects like to be at the camera. I literally kept pushing my hands in the air to get them back. (Remember the speech given by Heather in The Blair Witch Project, spoofed in Scary Movie? Imagine it closer.)While it's not the worst movie I've seen, but since it's the first (and only) 2012 release I've seen, it does constitute as the #1 worst of 2012. I hope it doesn't stoop much lower, though I'm sure it will.
This is what I thought: I really like Paul Rudd, I'm finally accepting Jennifer "Forever Rachel" Aniston is in two-thirds of every year's comedies and the trailer of Wanderlust looked like a funny and original film.This is what I got: a migraine of mass destruction, a horribly put-together mess of absent laughs and long list of cameos that have to be ashamed to have had said yes in the first place.Wanderlust is an abomination of wasted space and talent. I hated every minute of this movie and kept waiting for it to redeem itself. Instead, I witnessed Paul Rudd unconvincingly channeling Jim Carrey later in the picture and in front of a mirror talking about his little Rudd below. I think Mr. Carrey should sue for defamation of character.After getting an apartment the size of the west wing of Karen Walker's closet, the zero-chemistry couple, George (Rudd) and Linda (Aniston) are jobless and homeless (overnight, no less.) Giving up within seconds of losing his job and solving their problem, they venture onto George's even less funny and dick of a brother, but along the route south, they happen along a hippie commune.This happens to brighten up their last night before they reach George's sad brother and his wacked wife's house. When living with family goes south, they head back to fake "become one with nature" home. From there, they plan on a two-week trial to see if they like living with a wheelchair-bound Hawkeye Pierce and a butt-naked wine-maker. While you'll know exactly where each scene is headed, you'll expect laughs along the way but only to be disappointed with each missed opportunity. I mean, Paul's a funny guyuntil now.Maybe it's not his fault. Actually, I don't blame him for the aimless direction, poor editing, script problems and list of uninterested actors. It's supposed to make you feel good about life and nature, but I'd just as well take advice from Eric Cartman on going green than what they're trying to teach me.Avoid this mess at all costs. Even if I was a vegan, I would rather sprint over to McDonald's for a Big Mac in protesteven though, I doubt that's real meat  but it's the effort that counts.
I am not sure who recommended Surveillance to me, but I think I have an idea: one of the "Fat Guys At the Movies." The person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriest/disturbing movies. (I'm paraphrasing and doing this only by memory, so forgive me if I misquoted.) At any rate, I made the decision to watch it. So I take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen. Strange, I doubt I've ever called a movie "stupid" but that was the first word that came to mind about one-third in and stayed in my mind until the end.Where to begin? Unbelievable premise and reactions, incredibly brain-dead characters (could blame the writing or the actors, or I'll just blame both) and enormously bad acting. I'd sooner believe Bill Pullman as President of the USA than a FBI agent here. (Of course, there's a reason for that, and I'll partially go into that.) And to top it off, if you can't figure the so-called shocking "twist" in the first 5 minutes, then you must have arrived late to the theatre or came into the room to watch it late. Don't worry, they'll tell you the "twist" every five minutes thereafter.There's been some serial killer(s) on the loose in the most depressing town in the county, or world. But there's more to the story! Some dumbass and corrupt cops like to blow out tires for their own amusement. Could there possibly be more? Oh, yeah, there's a family, well maybe not, but there are four humans, one boy, one girl and an adult couple. The girl says she sees things with much less conviction than Cole sees dead people in The Sixth Sense. There's gotta be more to this than what I mentioned! That's what makes a movie interesting! Adding as many subplots that may/may not be developed is the way to go! Okay, then I'll continue. We have goofy FBI agents that made me laugh. A pair of giggling druggies who's shocked at first their dealer OD's but then resorts to robbery. A gosh-tooting great-guy cop who must've been put in for comic relief who's always battling an angry/suspicious cop. And finally, (poor, poor) Michael Ironside who didn't just phone his performance in, he barely text it in.None of these work. They're all told in various forms of presence tense or flashbacks, and believe me, you'll lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots begin. In addition, the reaction some of these characters are the most shocking of all. I guess I'm referring mostly to the cops, but mainly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely blinks.This stupid, stupid movie stinks. It's barely gory as the person that recommended it said it was, unless his exposure has been limited to Goosebumps stories. And what's with the title? Surveillance? Oh, I get it; it's because it was used in 1/50 subplots just to film interviews. Since that's so random, it might as well been called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Just stay away from this horrid mess.
Even with the worse comedy, occasionally, I'll laugh  admittedly or not  at least once, such as the wretched Vampires Suck. Though, 2011's Paul almost held the record of the first ZERO-laugh comedy I've ever seen, it still took until about the one hour, fifteen-sixteen minute mark for me to finally laugh. (Wiig's character exclaims: "It's okay; he's alive" and runs.) And I'll even note two more "huh"s  as in chuckles, one immediately before the credits and one during the credits.The movie's 104 minutes long and waiting 75 minutes into a COMEDY for the only laugh, is pathetic.Marketing should take some of the blame  all the "funny" scenes were in the trailers. But even then, they looked only mildly amusing. In fact, the only reason I wanted to see this is because of the fantastic team of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost  both of whom are responsible to the hilarious and highly superior Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Perhaps they're just not welcome in the USA where this was shot and takes place.Speaking of the English duo, they were horribly miscast here. EVEN though they helped write it. You knowyou don't have to star in the same vehicle you helped write.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh on the "miscasting" comment. Allow me to rephrase: literally anyone could've played these roles, but if I had my pick, it would've been Michael Cera and his Superbad costar Johan Hill. At least thenI would've laughed more than a dozen times. Guaranteed.So, what was it that made an all-star/all-around cast that's usually hilarious become as much of a dud as the recent performance of "The Situation" on Comedy Central's Donald Trump Roast?Was it the references too overwhelming that made this film almost unbearable? I can only imagine that the Pegg/Frost team are probably not that familiar with the "American Sci-Fi" universe and inserted the top 20 (and yeah, 20 difference references, maybe more) searches on Google. They got so tedious and an actual distraction, all I could think of was a feature length film set in a bar called "CHEERful" and along with the numerous Sam/Diane look alikes, you'll have a bartender named Moe, prank calls from a punk kid asking for "Mr. I.P. Freely," a beagle named "Regal" and the only thing served on the menu are "blue oysters."And speaking of whichdon't get me started on the constant and mean-spirited "fag" jokes that certainly weren't funny at first and got progressively repugnant as the movie wore on. We get it: two best friends go on holiday together overseas and they simply must be gay, or "fags" as the secondary characters call them. They made it an obvious statement that they hate God, but they further pushed the line with their homophobia as well. You'd think someone that was against God would also be pro-gay. (Yes, I know they backtracked with stating Paul's planet is completely bisexual, but after that's revealed, they coast back into the gay bashing gagfor the tenth time.)Another horse they beat to death was the swearing. Ha ha ha ha, I follow the juvenile humor, and at times, in other movies that can be comical, but here, it was frankly not amusing. Kristen Wiig's character, Ruth, is released from the Holy Book and has a "rip roaring" time by saying "nasty" words at inappropriate times. Honestly, she looked almost embarrassed to say her cuss-laced lines after the fiftieth time.Two nerd BFFs, Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost) make it their dream to visit both a Sci-Fi convention and then scope out the most clichéd "alien" spots when all of a sudden, they find a real life alien! Named Paul! Are you laughing yet? Perhaps not, so they throw those darned Sci-Fi references that would be more appropriate in a 22-minute episode of Family Guy.At any rate, they need to transport Paul, the "anti-probing" crude cliché, from one spot to his departure spot, à la (many, but let's just say) E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial's finale. And putting in reference/side gag Steven Spielberg in this not only wasn't funny, but now I don't feel bad about bashing his wife in my recent Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom review.All the while, they're chased by more bumbling doofuses and let the slapstick begin!Not really. But it does make this seem like a perfect family movie and virtually harmless. Well, aside from the five hundred curse words, sexual references, nude shots  okay, just from CGI-Paul and death scenes. It's almost like they did have a "sweet-hearted" film, but thought: That doesn't sell!I will confess in the movie's defense: it wasn't the worst I've seen. I didn't get as annoyed or p/ssed as I usually get when a movie gets progressively worse or even less funny  if that was possible in this example. (Correction: I did get thoroughly frustrated with both the completely thoughtless gay-gags and one of the biggest references: the character "The Big Guy" who's only heard on a radio until the finale and we're supposed to be "surprised" when we find out who that was. If you don't know that is from minute one, then this is, in fact, your first "Sci-Fi" film. And that's sad.)For the most part I just stared blankly at the screen. Not necessarily with disgust  as I do often with humorless comedies  but with boredom and a dash of sadness. Pegg/Frost probably just had an off dayif it took even that long to write this.
Sure, Sylvester Stallone isn't the most bankable star. He's washed up and knows it. I appreciate that he knows, though writing and directing that theory into an incredibly shallow, talentless and pointless movie containing characters with zero depth or chemistry between each other and bringing other D-List stars down with himis just plain wrong.The Expendables didn't have much going for it, except for taking the Freddy Vs. Jason idea to a whole new level. Not a better level, but just expanding the cast of has-beens. So, I guess the only way for the film to go is up, upon viewing? NO. It started low and got worse.The action was so few and far between that when you finally got to one of the few scenes, though they were decent, you're left so bored, it's hard to remember at that time this is, in fact, an action flick. It's a no-brainer that the cast basically has no brains left, so the expectations of them suddenly performing Hamlet was null. Yet, I really wanted to see something, anything out of them. Not only was each one, bypassing Jason Statham as Lee Christmas who stood far above EVERY other individual, so dull, boring, one-note, incredibly UNFUNNY with jokes and one-liners seen from a neighboring county, but not one had an ounce of chemistry with each other. It's as if Mr. Stallone asked them, not that they need a reason to get their first paycheck in years, and they signed on without so much as seeing the script.And speaking of which, was there a script? We have the lesser of A-Team movies this summer where as an elite group of highly trained mercenaries who are hired for a job, but surprise! There's now more at stake as there's a completely thrown in (only for the sake of having the clichéd) love interest, one of their own that might be betraying them (oh, drat!) and the target might be harder than they anticipated: An Evil Drug Lord  oh, no!  who controls both his island's people and government.Sure, this is a throwback to the same types of movies this 100+ actor group is used to back in the 1980s, and as much as most of those are corny, stereotypical, low-rent and shallow, at least they had heart. At least they didn't lie to what they were. You knew what you were getting yourself into.Here, in The Expendables, Director Stallone yearns to make a serious movie about senior citizens kicking butt by adding male-bonding, a philosophical tattoo preacher and the importance of friendship and trust. Then he switches back to the Predator-days long gone with jungles, blood, guts, guns and not-so-snappy one-liners.Don't get me started  too late  on the cameos. I understand the big Arnold Schwarzenegger had some forest fire business in his own country of California, but his, Bruce Willis's and Sly's scenes went as well together as their ownership of Planet Hollywood restaurants. Each one was all but a head shot where you couldn't even tell they were in the same room, not to mention it lasted all but 5 minutes. I had the same problem with the movie Heat; FINALLY they got Pacino and De Niro on the same screen for, what?, 5 minutes!?! And furthermore, I hate the post-Terminating Smiling-Jack Schwarzenegger and his cornball dumbass lines. Even the ones thrown at him were so foreseen, they weren't funny.The rest of the walk-ons, including the washed-up-before-Wrestler-and-back-to-third-rate-following, Rourke, were just happy to be employed. I guess the recession runs deeper than they thought  back to the 80s! Despite my one star review, there were two good scenes, I'll admit: Christmas, wait  wow, really Stallone? That's the best you can come up with for an ACTION star's name? Hope you didn't take that from Dr. Christmas Jones from The World is Not Enough. Anyways, Tough Christmas takes on thugs on a basketball court due to one of the failed side plots involving his love interest. I always like seeing Statham fight, despite the poor quality of the film he's in. Also, the climax is quite unbelievable, of course, but you cant rate that down for the movie it is. I will say, though, before the 700 explosions in the finale, there was a little cave fight scene that ended with machine gun/human slicing excitement. Literally, I was dozing off until that happened  multiple and honestly well choreographed fighters took on the enemy.Those two scenes by FAR could not save the rest of this crap. I'd say maaaaybe rent it for the aforementioned scenes and the testosterone finale  at least you can select those chapters and not be hopelessly stuck in the theater. Even when Stallone was bad in his career, he never stooped this low. SKIP!
Oh, sure, there are a ton of sequels that both "take" down a series, but also "take" it too far. Taken 3 is the A Good Day to Die Hard of the series and by God, I hope both movies end the two franchises. I recently gave Taken 2 another chance after not liking it the first time it was released. Wow. If anyone thought that movie was bad, just watch the third chapter I initially was hoping would be the Last Crusade of the series. False. And I actually like Taken 2 the second time a whole lot more than the first viewing.This absolutely atrocious sequel that has nothing to do with the series, let alone anything to do with "TAKING," is basically a sometimes action script that was altered to piggyback on the successful series. Yes. Just like Troll 2 and just about as bad.After an incredibly stale opening that, again, feels nothing like a "Taken" movie, it continues with basically, the same dumb opening of Alien 3. What follows is an amazingly predictable movie where a wrongfully accused 62-year-old actor acts like someone as athletic as someone a third of his age and can escape explosions as easily as Batman dodging a nuclear explosion in under 5 seconds. It's no wonder Liam Neeson starred in The A-Team movie  he never has a scratch on him after unbelievably surviving multiple car wrecks that would easily kill 999 out of 1,000 people.What this movie should've done was to fire Liam, hire Jason Statham, rename this as Transporter 4 and acknowledge the silliness like that series did. The decision is clear: Watch 2008's Taken and repeatedly. No need to see #2 or #3. Dear God, please let there be no fourth Taken. I can't possibly "take" this anymore.* * *Final thoughts: Lesson learned  to clear your name from a crime you didn't commit, kill as many people in cold blood while leaving more than enough evidence behind  not to mention, admitting to the police that you murdered someone  and then you can live happily ever after. For shits and giggles, run a car into a plane taking off that's holding the very person you're trying to protect. Don't worry, it'll survive the explosion, as, um, most planes do.
Though not the worst horror sequel I've seen, as a movie itself, Saw V was definitely flat, especially for an originally groundbreaking series that keeps getting worse. The acting and dialogue was seriously laughable, the plot crawled at times and attempting to explain every single frame of the previous films is definitely getting tedious. Would it have made Friday the 13th series any better if it was eventually explained where Mother Voorhees bought the car that took them to Crystal Lake or just who attempted to give Jason failed swimming lessons? The most comical scenes in Saw V were the flashbacks within the flashbacks, reminding me of the great Simpsons episode that made fun of this very tactic. And here's the spoiler  another accomplice to the crimes? It's like the writers just keep making up & adding to scenes/details of the previous films, as if the thought never occurred them to go in a new direction. I probably won't see a Saw VI if I learn of yet another accomplice, a plumber who rigged the bathroom from #1. Well, now, that makes all the sense! I so wondered how he made sure the plumbing worked enough to get the tub filled! Recommendation: Watch I, II and finish with III. IV and V should've been straight to DVD. Hell, Hellraiser gave up after 4 and went home.
Wow. Where to begin? OK, The Social Network is a definite for the best picture nominees, and only due to the buzz and not just the "ten-nominees, let's get viewers" best pic award recent change.Do I agree with that? Well, yes and no. Yes, because we have to fill 10 slots and 2010 was a horrid year for movies. No, because, sadly, it might win.By all means, it wasn't a bad film; it was a very good film, indeed. But, it was not Best Picture caliber. And if they allow it to win, it can only mean: they're trying an outreach to the "younger" crowds. Quite frankly, despite the cast, premise and target audience, this is NOT geared to the college kids. In fact, anyone who lived in the era this is pertaining to is in my age group: mid 30s.Anyways, I digress The Social Network show the BIRTH and (almost) downfall of the latest (and in my opinion, better) version of MySpace. It's enormously face-pacedand generally, that's a good thing. Here, you just better keep upbecause, it rarely slows down.The main character is one Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) who's a nerd, a FAST talker and an arrogant asswipe who uses all around to amuse himself. In this case, he develops the now-popular Facebook, springing from judging women and his boredom. Lucky himit's proved quite profitable.And that's the other part of the movie: the disposition of 2 lawsuits involving the frontrunners to the social site and their greed for their "rightful" cut.Is the world ready for the background story of Facebook? Do we all need to know how the site we (well, 99.5% of the world) log in daily, if not hourly, came to be? Time will tell on those stories, but call me ignorantbut I could care less. I'm an American, just give it to me, make sure it works and I'm happy.As for the movie, it does have good acting (I can surely see Eisenberg nominate, and not upset if he wins), good dialogue and again, the pace is as fast as the internet connection to keep Facebook a fun and social activity.Is the movie great? No. It's moody enough to catch people's attention. Thanks (Director) Fincher, who rarely lets us down. I would recommend, but it's not something I would jump to see again. As I said, it's barely interesting enough to see the birth (and almost downfall) of Facebook.but not enough to rush to see how it came to be, again.Just make sure it works, you I.T. nerds (no offenseI used to date one of you) and I will be happy.
A friend called me 1 hour 40 minutes into the 2 hour 8 minute runtime of 'Body of Lies.' She asked me if she should let me go back to watching it and I debated, even after investing that much time and more than two-thirds done. I screamed 'I don't know what the hell is going on here!' Well, my statement, though it was true I said it, wasn't 100% accurate. I did have somewhat of an idea, but I was so incredibly bored, and the final 28 minutes didn't change anything. As for Crowe, an established, though hot-headed actor, literally "phoned" his performance in. I kept laughing at him throughout as a lot of critics hate it when an actor does that, and considering he spent 90% of his screen time on the phone (i.e. "Kill, Kill, Kill" and "Get ready for school" simultaneously,) I'm not too far off. Leo overacted as he usually does. And the 'Lies' that's in the title  what is this? Pre-Nixon, where the general public believes the government couldn't possibly lie, or commanding officers can't be deceitful? Are you serious? This probably would've been best served as a period piece war movie. Generally, I would write a synopsis in my reviews, but I saw this a few days back. I've already forgotten almost the entire "spy-war-suspense" plot and I doubt I could've done much better minutes after the viewing. Suffice to say, Crowe's pulling the cords in his lovely "American-Dream" home while Leo's pretending to be Middle Eastern to stop terrorist. Oh, and some people lie. Skip this mess, there was absolutely nothing new. And in a year that brought us the terrific 'The Hurt Locker,' I'm ashamed to call Scott a great director anymore.
What a wonderful little film The Way Way Back was and the best coming-of-age film since The Perks of Being a Wallflower last year.It was nice to see Steve Carell step out as an ass  a first for him from what I've seen, and for once, I finally liked Sam Rockwell.To elaborate, I'm not a Rockwell fan at all, and I've seen a great deal of his movies (Seven Psychopaths, Cowboys & Aliens, Iron Man 2, Gentlemen Broncos, Moon, Frost/Nixon, Choke, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Joshua, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Charlie's Angels, Galaxy Quest and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990.) Wow, that's a lot.) Not once during those did I like him. Seriously, he never impressed me and was always, with the exception of Galaxy Quest, was a distraction. That changed here.My eyes rolled the brief moment he came on screen briefly. I hadn't known he was in this. Butonce he had a speaking scene, I fell madly in love with his character and he had me rolling in laughter until the end. And he wasn't just funny, he played (very well) an awesome character, someone I'd like to know in real life.Beyond him, the rest of the cast was pitch-perfect in their roles. The movie felt real in every scene and despite being fiction, this film was genuine step-by-step. It was sad, heartbreaking even and yet, uplifting and funny.Basically, the movie revolves around a coming-of-age boy at a beach house with his wacky neighbors, sexy (to him) daughter of the neighbor, summer job and dysfunctional family.The movie should be seen by all. They don't make many of these kinds these days. I continuously marveled on how much I loved this movie and could put myself in multiple character's shoes. This is a gem I can't wait to revisit many times.* * * Final thoughts: Okay, fine. I'll give Rockwell another chance. It only takes one movie for me to realize I might be wrong on someone I dislike.
I happened to catch A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints on IFC on-demand one day and since it stars Robert Downey Jr, one of my favorites and Shia LaBeouf who can act, when he's far-far away from big-budgeted movies, I gave it a chance. Though, I can't say I was really disappointed, I can say I wasn't that impressed.I guess it's just not my type of movie. It's a flashback movie of a novelist who speaks not-so-fondly over his family living in Queens, NY in the mid-1980s who screams every line, incessantly talks over each other and the punk kids he either grew up with or wooed. Realistic, I suppose, but I'm certainly glad I never had to ever endure one minute of this guy's life.Older Dito (Downey Jr.) starts off in the present reciting his life story and then we get the typical 80% past and 20% present movie. In the past, Young Dito (LaBeouf) hangs out with the wrong crowd with aspirations of getting out and promising a girl he'll take her with him. He's also dealing with his loud father who, per his own words, is very abusive, though through sight, I honestly don't think he was that back. I've seen worse.The kids, or mini-gang, just wander around Queens always getting into a beef with a real gang. Yelling, swearing, baseball bats, murder and accidental suicide ensures. And though I've already admitted I haven't walked in these kid's shoes  or lived in NYC, or any large inner-city, for that matter, I doubted their reactions. Such as after the accidental suicide, and at the funeral, the brother of the deceased goes on to talk about the previous plot point as if nothing ever happened. Those parts I found unrealistic.Other than that, I'm sure these situations and families truly lived like this, and just like a lot of movies, a la Boyz n the Hood, I'm sure there's always at least one member wants to break out of the mold and venture to a cleaner life. But, we've been there, done that, with a lot more interesting characters. And with characters we actually care about. There wasn't a single likable or charismatic person in this movie, including Dito, that I rooted for.So if loud and overlapping conversations, yelling, swearing, ruthless and "abusing" low-life families and kids stuck in the 1980s is your bag, you might like this "real portrayal." Other than that, you're best just to go back to (or in this movie's case, forward to) the much better 1991's Boyz n the Hood.
Let me start off with: What makes Norman Bates so appealing? Really? It all started with #2 and was thoroughly defined in 'Psycho IV: The Beginning.' Sex symbol? Again, really? And the women, or girls, that find him attractiveat least, writers, casting directors, please make 'em a little more believable, such as a little nuts themselves. These females are relativity good looking. Perkins, who's a fine actor in all four original movies, gives very little evidence that he's one to cuddle with, and I'm talking about the "nice" side of Bates, not that shady Mother-figure.Anyways, though I don't believe for a second any human could fall for him (major flaw in my book) #4 isn't all that bad of a movie.Sure, it's nowhere in the ballpark of #1, its inferior to #2, yet it's oodles better than #3 (of course, that's not saying much.) Bates, now released for the second time, (yeah, I can see the state making that mistake once, but come on) calls a radio show hosted by Fran Ambrose, played wonderfully by CCH Pounder, and states that he intends to kill again. But stay tuned! He also intends to tell his life story in the meantime.Fran & crew take it upon themselves to locate Bates, never thinking of alerting the major authorities, (FBI, anyone?) before he kills next.It's an interesting concept and some of the back story's interesting as well, but it loses steam and the conclusion is poorly (and completely unbelievably) executed. Also, the plot holes: Wasn't Mom's boyfriend the one who convinces Mrs. Bates to build the hotel? It's worth a viewing; Thomas plays Perkins well enough, though I believe the incest innuendoes were an unnecessary turn. Yeah, it's previously hinted at, but carries the same irrelevancy as the masturbating scene is in the horrible 1998 remake.
No, I've never seen any of the "Santa Slasher" series, i.e. 'Silent Night, Deadly Night,' the original 'Black Christmas' or this one, 'Christmas Evil.' I've heard all about their reputation, or, MADS (Mothers Against Deranged Santas.) I thought I would rent this one as I've heard it pop up as a reference on a 'Fat Guys At the Movies' segment.Mothers should be against this, but not for the ooooohhhh "killer" Santa, but for the fact this movie was just plain crap. Boring, long  even at only 92 minutes, crap.Little boy sees Santa arrive down a chimney in 1947, deliver presents, eat some goodies and miraculously, float up the chimney. Boy goes to bed, but returns to living room to witness Mommy and Santa (sort of) getting it on. Apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life, though the scene was about as steamy as when Ralphie's dad got the "Leg Lamp" in 'A Christmas Story.' He was sooo disturbed, he went to the attic and, well cut his own hand.Fast forward to the future! Now, it's 1980 and messed up boy works in a toy factory. We get a whiff of him being a little off-kilter, and he stalks both kids and parents alike. Who's naughty, who's nice, blah blah. It takes a good two-thirds of the film to get him to finally snap  as if that's not foreshadowed from frame one. NO MOVIE should take that long.I will admit, this movie had its tension building, but only because I kept expecting him to do something, anything to anyone. When he finally does, well, punish "who's naughty," it's as graphic as a "Garbage Pail Kid" card. And I haven't mentioned the WTF ending. I'm thinking it was a metaphor, but in reality, it's just as weird as the rest of the movie. (Take the brother who's upset his sibling is killing, and his solution isuh, killing.) Don't open this mess, even on Christmas Eve, or Evil. Again, I didn't watch the other "Santa-Slashers" but this one sucked bad. It built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent present.
When even an average movie-goer  one that believes the Fast & Furious series is of the utmost quality, actually tells me in his very modest, shruggest, apologetic and nonverbal way to stay away from Parker, then perhaps I should've listened.What starts off as the average blah-blah action movie that, if it stayed the course, would be enjoyable because of the great Jason Statham and the fact the film never lied to what it was. But then, the creators of Parker thought: Why not add an extra 45 unnecessary minutes of an absolute terrible script, predictable twists and J.Ho and ultimately, completely waste everyone's time?One can accept a Jackie Chan movie or a Fast & Furious chapter the same way that this movie began. If you know it's just dumb action, so be it: do the obligatory 'leave your brain at the door' and just have fun. So why did they need to change it? Why throw in horrible side stories, make Statham's Parker a less charismatic and aimless Porter (Mel Gibson's 10x more enjoyable character from the 50x more fun Payback) and waste Statham's small window of time to be the great action star he could be?Even when Statham shows signs of not knowing how to fix this mess, at least he's still minutely enjoyable when his roughly 4 scenes of absolutely uninspired action appear in this overlong 2-hour film. And, admittedly, the movie is shot gorgeously at spots. Yes, these are postcard images of South Florida, but it's still very beautiful and this commercial certainly does take you away from the waste of all talents involved.Basically, the movie starts off with Parker getting his Transporter rules broken after a small(er) heist and then he turns into, again, Porter from Payback so that he can claim his "rightfully" stolen $200,000. First, it's about principal and he needs to track down the bad guys. But, then it's about revenge and safety of his loved ones. But, then it's about saving one barely intelligent and financially unstable female. But, then it's aboutYes, the movie continuously shifts gears in what it wants to be about and spends way too much time with mediocre scenes and ideas, boring characters, heists and worst of all: the dumbest robbery and "climax" in Statham film history. Make that: a five-year-old could construct the big-movie-heist and getaway far better than this writer.The movie lacks heart, charm, good action scenes and editing. Truthfully, it's not the absolute worst I've seen from any of the players involved, but it's an absolute skip.We should all listen to the average moviegoer from time to time. If they don't like something, it's even worse than someone that has seen and reviewed just shy of 100 movies by a year's fifth month's closing.
Understandably, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns was just lifted straight from the graphic novels I haven't read, but damn, this "movie" was random.Obviously, it was a stunt to make more money releasing this in two parts, but on the other hand, it was basically two movies  albeit, short ones at an hour apiece  with two completely different moods.Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 sort of resembles what we know about the Batman legend and felt, at first, like it took place following the events of the motion picture, The Dark Knight Rises. Once it's learned that it's not, you get a few random events that only conclude barely enough to leave open for Part 2.Part 2, although still random at spots, is much darker and more adult than most animated features I've seen. And when finished, a couple dozen questions appeared in my brain:(This next paragraph is chock-full of spoilers. Skip if you don't appreciate those.)How does everyone know who Clark is, or namely the President and FatWoman, er CatWoman? Why even mention the brief background of the Justice League and leave holes in that story? How can the Joker withstand a dagger in the eye #1, and #2 continue fighting and navigating, hell, thinking? Why was it set back in the 1980s? Why was Batman so evil at times, actually shoots guns and randomly beats up police? Since when did Batman murder people (he admits this to the Joker)? What happened to the old Robin  or, for the love of God, stop brining up something only insiders would know! Why were Superman and Batman such enemies? And why did Bruce hate Clark so much, other than the fact Superman fought for peace? Why was it was a bad idea for Superman to detonate a bomb in space  sort of?  verses in the city? Further, since when would a nuclear bomb  which he's survived before, make him turn into James Wood's Hades from Disney's Hercules? Where did the "Mutants" come from and why were they even called that since, all-but-one, were perfectly normal idiots with red Cylon-style glasses? Why did Batman go out of his way to make sure the new Commissioner hated him and later, why would she all-of-a-sudden refuse to attack him when given the (15th) chance? When did Batman begin using (the absent) Scarecrow's hallucinate gas? And finally, not really a question, but a nice observation: It's good to know that if a multistory apartment building's on fire, the quickest and most effective way to put it out is with just a few buckets of water. An entire room's fire seemed to get extinguished with one bucket of water!(End of Spoilers. You can resume now.)Perhaps, I am taking all this too seriously, but that was the idea I got from the filmmakers: a deeper, darker and most realistic animated Batman feature.And although this was definitely an alternative (DC) universe, much like TV's Smallville, this cartoon felt like 15 animated features were created before this, much like what Marvel did to lead up to The Avengers. But, at least in that great movie, I didn't have to question every aspect when a new plot line formed.As much as this review, so far, has looked like a bashing, I actually did have a little bit of fun  from time to time. If you can put away everything you know about these characters you might have grown up with, i.e. completely forget they've ever used to stand up for good and justice or even existed at all, then you might enjoy the whole experience.
1. Native Americans fear "Cold Ones" as if they're attending Alcoholics Anonymous. Oh, wait2. "Jake! Stay!" is probably considered an insult to someone that changes into a dog.3. Mormon writer, Stephenie Meyer, should be proud of acknowledging there are other races out there, though portraying Native Americans as savage beasts and Blacks as murderers should put her right back in the good light with the Latter-day Saints.4. Brokeback Mountain tent love can happen between any two males, even the hairy and undead ones.5. Terrible acting, hilariously bad dialogue, faux-pas Goths and unnecessary flashbacks can equate $300 million in revenues. Thanks, America.6. Quickly moving someone with a broken back is first on the list of any medical student drop-out.7. Pending Don Knotts was still with us, he surely would've been frontrunner for Bella's dad, Charlie.8. There are more shirtless boys in the forests of Washington than all ballparks of the U.S.9. Shift-changing Native Americans wear little clothing and have little regard to what happens when they change back. Do they store those shorts in the same place prisoners sneak contraband?10. There are more forest battles in Washington than all of Planet Endor.11. Bleak Bella is the most wanted girl in the world. Reasons of why are still unknown.12. Using six tons of blush doesn't make you a vampire. It makes you Cher.13. Turning into a six-ton wolf doesn't make you a werewolf. It makes you Beethoven.14. These are NOT real Vampires! These are NOT real Werewolves!15. These are NOT real Vampires! These are NOT real Werewolves!16. These are NOT real Vampires! These are NOT real Werewolves!17. Eclipse is as much a vampire and werewolf movie as The Exorcist is a feel-good and romantic comedy.18. Eclipse is as much a teen romance as Speed 2: Cruise Control is about speeding.19. Eclipse is as much of an epic adventure as Aliens is about Joe Arpaio's plight.20. Eclipse is as much as about good parenting as The Stepfather is.21. Bella is an incredible dead weight to anyone who is protecting her. Her best defense is to stay out of the way, cut herself like an emo and allow boys (and girls) fight over her. 22. "Waiting for marriage" is just as acceptable as taking your spouse's life on her wedding night.23. Surprisingly good cinematography and a decent score does not equate a quality movie. Unless you want to watch a PBS special on the rainforests. 24. Who needs a spoof like Vampires Suck when you can laugh your ass off during the real movie? 25. The title is truly misleading; it would be far more entertaining to watch 30-seconds of an eclipse that you don't see in the movie, as it would the entire two hour film, itself. 26. High School graduates actually want to "make mistakes" so they can be all they can be. These filmmakers followed suit. 27. Bella is the saddest, most pathetic, manipulative and selfish character created next tonext tono one. She is, in fact, the saddest, most pathetic, manipulative and selfish character created. 28. Eclipse has the least exciting climax next to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. 29. This movie should NOT be considered for Best Costume Design. I've heard Lady Gaga actually rejected these outfits for her own act.30. The un-dead fear "Newborns" just as much as Lindsey Lohan fears sobriety.
"Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch." - KitI could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre.Back in Summer 1990  yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved.Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still.Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word "flaw," I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: "What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!"  Kit Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance.Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts  in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by über-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his "beck and call" for the remainder of his business trip in L.A.Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance.I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this:Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall.This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless.Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time.Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!
It's no wonder still-very-much-alive, Terry O'Quinn both didn't reprise his original Stepfather role, nor make an appearance in this complete waste of space remake, much like the rancid 2006's When a Stranger Calls.All but a shot-by-shot remake, though not close enough to call a 1998's Psycho clone, 2009's The Stepfather begins with the title character, now played by the thoroughly uninteresting and dull Dylan Walsh, getting dressed and stepping over the bodies of his married-into-family he's recently murdered. He vanishes "without a trace" and starts all over with a new family.I'm going to stop there. This scenario might have been plausible in 1987, the year of the original, but hell no in 2009. OK, I'll continue, but be warned, you'll have to suspend your disbelief if you wish to, ha ha, enjoy this needless remake.OK, now the newly named David Harris (performed by Walsh and O'Quinn played him as "Jerry Blake" in the original. And why they changed the name  much like Nancy (was Thompson/now) Holbrook in the updated A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)  is beyond me) is with his new family, because, well, he wants the perfect family and he's willing to kill for it.We have the loving but (honestly, justifiably) naïve mother, Susan (Ward), with children (before it was just one child, I guess they got nervous about writing about just one potential victim child) and one bratty young male on his way home from military school.Dang it, I'm stopping again. Really? Seriously? Military school? Do they even still use that as a cliché in movies when they threaten to send a misbehaving boy away? That's lazy writing. Ugh.Anyways, Michael (Badgley) is suspicious of the new man of the household and (now) rightfully so as Susan's new beau is in over his head with all the cast and characters to "take care of." Any psycho has to keep it simple. Duh, that's why O'Quinn attached onto just a mother and daughter in the original. At very least, David is able to teleport anywhere he wants to, much like Jason Voorhees, as he just appears here/there in a blink of an eye with no rhyme or reason.Sothe story continues. Handsome Michael (believe me, you'll see him without a shirt as many times as Taylor Lautner in New Moon/Eclipse) and equally stunning girlfriend, Kelly (Amber Heard, who eerily looked a little too much like a young Scarlett Johansson) who also parades around in a bathing suit possibly thirds of her appearances, begin/stop/start again investigations into David's past.Oh, no. Do they know his secret? Does he know they know? Do they know he knows they know? Does he know they know he knows? Man, this is starting to sound like the old Friends episode  and even though that was comedy, this was horror, Friends took the cake on that "Who's on First" type-routine. Unfortunately, with all the back and forth and the occasional murder, it's fruitless to care. As does the viewer with the overlong, unbelievable and predictable finale.Little was updated here, but I must say I did like the scenes with the cells and texting, of course, unheard of in the original. That added a very, very small ½ star to my rating. Well, that and the final credits scene. Sure, we know what's coming, and that's not what impressed me. It was the freeze frame, old 80s horror homage that was both creepy and a great homage, especially to someone who loved the 80s horror movies/franchises.Wow. If their motives were: I bet you can't find a copy of the 1987 cult-classic, so watch ours. Don't be fooled. You can, in fact, find and appreciate the original. There is ZERO reason to watch this. O'Quinn played it right, he played it scary, he played it real. This movie hinges on the performance of a "new" Stepfather, Walsh and since that fell FLAT as the movie's suspense, and other than googly eying either Badgley or Heard or both, you should SKIP this stepturd.
Funny. On a recent episode of Family Guy, Brian gets a earful of truth serum from Quagmire and the last thing (of many) Quagmire said was: "You know what, I could forgive all of that, all of that, if you weren't such a bore."I forgave a lot of what was wrong in 2012 but the one thing I couldn't bypass is that it was such a bore. And that was the one thing that surprised me the most. Even knowing it was way too long at over 2½ hours, I didn't expect such Pearl Harbor moments that made me yawn and wonder what the heck were they thinking?What I did know, was how silly it was from the 5-minute internet-released trailer. I figured I would laugh, or at least snicker at some of the scenes. I found myself doing that at more than one occasion, and it wasn't the blatant and unrealistic destruction scenes. It was just how bad this movie was, when they tried to show "heart" or "feeling" or "warmth." Or at the consistent "near-misses" for our, uh, so-called, "heroes." Or the number of plane dipping.Despite the sometimes good special effects  I honestly can't justify giving it an extra half star for that due to the overwhelming negatives, I will say this in the movie's favor: I didn't snicker or laugh out loud as many times as I thought I would. (Side note: I watched both Twilight and The Happening because I was in the mood for a comedy and for the most part, I did laugh heartedly throughout those two films.) In this film, I was just simply bored. And also previously mentioned, this movie was so Pearl Harbor, where there were just a few scenes of mass-destruction, the reason people would want to see this mess or the reason they made it, and the rest was just plain awful. Awful, awful, awful and terribly bad.Shame on you, Cusack. Selling out. Again, that is. You could've been one of my all-time favorite actors. It all started going downhill since Con Air. Sure, he's had one or two good movies since, such as 1408. (Weird, perhaps he should choose more wisely for movie titles that contain only four digits.)Following Emmerich's very similar The Day After Tomorrow, a million things completely impossible happen within a matter of days. Here we have the very wrong theory of 12/21/12 where the Mayan calendar ends and the world as we know it shifts axis, thus destroying all mankind and man's kind of civilization. Enter in the very stereotypical divorced dad (Cusack here, Quaid in Tomorrow) and his ex, his kids, the new beauthe whole cast is recycled sitcom/disaster-movie characters.Butthat's not what you bought a ticket for, right? It was to see big explosions. Am I right? Well, unfortunately, they're so few and far between, it's hard to justify a recommendation  heck, it's like 40+ minutes before anything happens. And what's worse, is the fake "heart-filled" scenes and really, really, REALLY bad jokes and puns.Okay, this movie is fairly, make that enormously easy to ridicule. It wasn't made to earn Oscars  though I am sure it's going to be up for special effects, but come on. Try a little bit. Try to show real emotion, real dialogue, real people. Do something memorable.I expect this out of Michael Bay. He cares more about using gasoline to explode stuff than character development, genuine thrills, emotion and plot development. Though Emmerich is only a half a step higher, he will genuinely win the contests between the two buffoons. Here, he not only matches Bay's horrible movie-making qualities, he almost takes the prize away from Transformers 2 as the worst of 2009.To sum up, this movie is all disaster movies in one: Armageddon, The Day After Tomorrow, Poseidon, Pearl Harbor, Independence Day, Deep Impact, Dante's Peak and many more. Heck, it mimicked Wall-E, and I should be shot for stating that. It has horrible acting, clichés (oh, the clichés!), dialogue, comedy and thee most unrealistic scenes of flight ever on film. I mean, really, how many lives do these nobodies have? How many times do we have to see a plane dip? Seriously, how many coincidences and luck-outs do this boring broken family have?I think this was sincerely made for only two types of people: those who actually believe 12/21/12 is the end (ha ha ha ha ha  I've said this before, but I sincerely don't believe in this "end of time" conspiracy theory, but even if I am wrong, I'll be dead with everyone else, so who cares?) and for those who just blindly want to see millions die as buildings collide. To each their own, but I appreciate a movie-goer who appreciates film as an art and not as mindless special effects engine.And the joke's on you people. Both kinds. But, speaking specifically to the later group, you'll get like maybe 30 minutes out of 158 of what you paid your money for. I'm glad you'll have to suffer through the rest, for the low taste you have.(Okay, that last part was harsh. Again, to each their own. But each ticket sold  like the never-ending Saw series, justifies these crappy movies. I have made it a point to cease watching the Saw movies for this very reason: I have to stop being part of the problem. For the money I spend, I expect more. And with less tickets sold, Hollywood might actually take notice.)
I admit, I had just finished a relationship, got fired  sort of and had one helluva time with some emotional/financial moments back in late 2003, so it wasn't too hard to attach myself onto one of the most emotionally charged films of all time: Lost in Translation.Maybe that just opened my eyes and helped me both understand and appreciate the beauty of this masterpiece. It hit all the right moments: from loneliness, to isolation, to comedy, to heart. And all the stars were aligned with the only two actors who could pull off the emotion and the brilliant script as well as direction by Sofia Coppola. The movie's not just centered on washed up actor, Bob Harris (Murray,) but he had to hit every note perfectly. Mission accomplished.Unfortunately for Mr. Murray, he is the owner of the biggest upset in Oscar history. He lost out on his one Oscar chance for Best Actor, as not only was this the best performance of the year, one of the best ever, it was also his best acting in his long-standing career. (Brokeback Mountain losing Best Picture in 2005 was the second worst Oscar upset next to this, probably because due to the ignorant and homophobic voters, it was almost expected.)This is not to take away from Scarlett Johansson. This is where I first noticed here and absolutely fell in love. She was ideal and perfect in her role as well. You felt every bit of her anguish and her character, Charlotte's youth versus Bob's experience. She concluded the circle between them: if things don't change, you'll go from A (Charlotte) to B (Bob.)Bob's been summoned to Tokyo to film a whiskey commercial. He doesn't want to, but he probably doesn't know why he accepted the offer  it doesn't appear he likes to make too many choices. He's just tired. So tired. And we're not talking about insomnia, though, that's on the horizon. In fact, what starts as jet lag ends as a long week of sleeplessness.You know who also can't sleep? The somewhat equally lost Charlotte, who's staying in the same hotel with her new busy, busy husband. She doesn't know why she married him, but she knows she does love him. She is lost, and it's not so much that he's the problem, but he is the target.Eventually the two meet and form a bond that both need, to get through a week-long bit of despair. They are truly lost in translation, and are sincerely spiraling out of focus.During their encounters, or even alone, the script manages to throw in a bunch of comedic moments, mostly from Bill Murray. It's a perfect blend of humor and tragic drama.I know, if something doesn't change in my life soon, I will end up like Bob Harris. I can see that. He's wildly sarcastic, but I don't think he's trying to be mean. He's just tired, bored and he's finding both humor in his surroundings and he's trying to amuse himself, as if he truly is all alone. Some people don't necessarily find me funny, and that never bothers me when I spout out my own brand of humor. 90% of the time, I'm doing it, just like Bob Harris, to simply amuse myself and relieve the boredom of life around me.Some might be put off by the pacing of the film, but I loved it. It gave us every bit of a chance to walk in these people's troubled lives, not to mention the fun they were having  but probably wouldn't admit it. I loved the score, the music  "Just Like Honey" by The Jesus & Mary Chain is one of my all time favorites following this and Bill rejuvenated the song "More than This" by 10,000 Maniacs (I didn't grow up on the Roxy Music version) for me.Furthermore, the cinematography and landscaping, yes, even in the hotel rooms, was wonderful. I've never been to Japan, but this makes me feel like I have.The lines, like the messages, in the movie are vast and deep. I had to watch it a few times to absorb everything and then more on DVD just to really get into Bob's bantering. The two leads are just beautiful together and they are written so well, that Coppola broke all sorts of clichés and made the movie real.The part all viewers are expecting, including myself, didn't come. I truly believed it had to happen as all these types of movies have that (no I won't mention what that is, but it's not hard to figure out when you're watching it) and honestly, I was so enthralled in the story, so captivated and wrapped in the film, I wouldn't have minded a cliché or two.Instead we are left with a secret. A whisper. And though none of us will find out what was silently passed on, I loved it.This movie is a work of art, through and through. If you have not experienced it, you are hereby ordered to take place in how movies should be made.
Boy, I gotta praise these Paranormal Activity films. They sure know how to take scenes and sounds that might be considered scary and turn them into predictable, boring, funny and least of all, not terrifying strung together YouTube clips.Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, which is either Part 5, a spin-off, chapter, homage or whatever, is literally just the same as the rest of the franchise with the slight exception of location. No longer are we mercifully subjected to seeing the same living room, kitchen, dining room, bedrooms, hallways, staircases or chandeliers 50x with nothing going on. Instead, we're in the slums and a crummy apartment. I actually give the movie credit for that "change."The rest is the same old story: Someone who never knows how or when to put a video camera down watches as someone else gets very slowly possessed, does an extremely half-assed job of investigation and finally gets taken over.Jesse and his homoerotic (or I wished) best bud film every uneventful second of their equally boring life following High School graduation when the suspected witch downstairs is murdered. Oh, no, here comes yet another possession.There's a point to where screenplay writers want to give the audience what they desire when they pen a script, but to do it repeatedly for 4 additional films and leave zero shocks, surprises, intrigue or freshness, they should be blacklisted right out of Hollywood.I will say this for a positive: despite absolutely nothing going on for the first half of the movie, at least it wasn't as gut wrenching and unintentionally hilarious as the last half. I couldn't help but laugh in the theatre when characters are running for their lives from things not really scary or original and never instinctively dropped the camera. I literally was pointing at the screen in the right spots for the "big shocks" to come.If you've seen the first four movies  and for that, I applaud you made it this far; I hope you got a huge prize for that awful bet your friend made you  you've seen this movie. Skip it.* * * Final thoughts: Had Jesse and Hector, the two male leads in this mundane episode, not been so incredibly cute, I'd have absolutely nothing to look at in this movie. Sadly, one of them spent the bulk of his screen time behind the camera, but at least I could wake up once he got in front of the camera.
So, I finally, after what?, 28 years, saw the first (and last for me) sequel to my favorite werewolf movie of all-time, The Howling.Oddly, for me, at least, I've seen all Howling chapters, but not the very first sequel, or Howling II:Your Sister Is a Werewolf, until now. And wow, I wasn't missing much.Sure, ALL of the Howling installments have been crap. I don't think there's a series in the history of cinema that had an incredible beginning and every single follow-up have been absolute trash. But, this one, Part II, actually had potential and an interesting idea: a brother of the heroine of the original goes after those responsible for turning his sisterinto a werewolf.But, after the premise (and Part II's singular effective scene with the Original's heroine in the coffin) goes nowhere, the movie is one incoherent mess of a scene after the next. Nothing made sense or had any continuity and it appears drugs weren't just on the mind of the writer/director, but in their system.I wasn't able to say it before, since I hadn't seen this sequel, but now with full knowledge, I can honestly say: watch THE HOWLING and please never ever, EVER, venture to any of the seven follow-ups. It's too bad that not one of the seven could come close to the excellence of the original and it's even worse that they continuously made these movies when after Howling II:Your Sister Is a Werewolf was so incredibly horrible.* * * Final thoughts: Okay, okay, if you like hairy breasts, you might like this. You will see them repeatedly.
Okay, forget that enormous plot-hole of a 13-Year-High-School-Reunion; American Reunion is a fabulous and fraking hilarious romp.Picture it: 1999. I saw the original American Pie in the theatre and laughed so hard throughout with the packed audience. When I saw it again on video (yeah, it was called video back then when it was released on, more accurately, "home video,") I didn't laugh so much, but I did appreciate it. And then came the sequels.Part 2 was awful. Part 3, or Wedding, was painful. Skipping over the spin offs, à la this generation's National Lampoon's, I kinda felt they were going to do right with the Reunion. And I was so much pleased.From what I can recall, it's been a very long time since I've seen an "American" film that enormously captured the magic, humor, heart, depth and joy the original produced within me. In fact, I would match this completely in line with the original in quality and entertainment.Jim, Jim's Dad and virtually every other living cast member of the original American Pie romp reunite in their small town of East Great Falls, MI, for a bit of partying, learning, growing and sexing.There's no real deep meaning here; this is strictly comedy with a tiny touch of reality. It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's more meant for my generation to see where our lives are really going and to laugh along with people seeing what we see. I do see what they see and even though I am actually much older, I still can relate.Scream 4 came out in 2011 and while the original Scream was made a few years before American Pie's pilot, I kinda grew up with both. It was nice to see a "Part IV" for both series I've spent years with, although, this is the one I really think captured the original heart of what I felt more than a decade ago.Way to go guys. And thanks, finally, for the full-frontal male nudity. About time!
I really wanted to reward one of the best superhero movies with a higher rating than just 8/10 stars, but each time I've seen this (now on the 5th time,) I can't get past the two major flaws and one scene, though incredibly original, I didn't personally 100% care for.Let's get the negatives out of the way, because the positives thoroughly outweigh the minor downfalls of Iron Man. #1: The story is just too damned old, familiar and makes it not only predictable, but very A-B-C. #2: The so-called "villain" is so foreseen, even for the first viewing, that it's funny they should even put in the "surprise" scene. The scene that was original, but I'm on the fence with, was the last few seconds of the film. It's hard not to give away the spoiler, but since the trailer for Iron Man 2 specifically lays it out, it's Stark (Downey Jr.) revealing his secret identity.I grew up on superheroes, namely, Superman, and one of my favorite aspects, if not the #1, is the secret identity part. Of course it can be considered unrealistic  uh, glasses and the farm-boy stance hardly makes Superman invisible, especially to his "incredibly brilliant and reporter" partner. So, I'll give it to Iron Man as it would be hard not to put two-and-two together and they were doing just that in the finale's press conference. But, now the fun's gone and I strongly worry, though still curious, about the direction part two's going to take.Okay, glad that's over. The #1 best thing about Iron Man: Downey Jr. He made this movie. Literally without him, this would be just another run of the mill Superhero film. His wit, depth and incredibly funny one-liners shoot this film up to the top 10 (if not 5) best superhero movies. In addition, Paltrow did a great job (up to her nervous fumbling in the closing) of bouncing very nicely off him, as he did with the robots, as well. Bridges, as much as I like him, wasn't a great part of the film. I wouldn't go as far as to say he was miscast  on the contrary, for the character he played, he did fit the part. But, he was just, well, there. Nothing special. Howard's the same and I'm not sad to see him go for the second movie.Back to Downey Jr. If the opening hilarious "taxi" ride doesn't grab you with his humor, stance and instant charisma, you might as well turn the movie off. Sure, the action's good, in fact, most of its great, but I strongly believe he made the movie.Stark is an alcoholic, rich, spoiled, womanizing, sarcastic and incredibly smart engineer who heads up his deceased father's weapon company until he gets a change of "heart" while captured, tortured and forced to break free with the Iron Man 1.0 model. After the initial transformation of Stark (inside and out) the movie plays out like almost every other superhero/comic book origin story  again, with the exception of the phenomenal performance of Downey Jr.Not my favorite superhero  like I said, I like the change the superhero has to QUICKLY go through to save the day and here, like Batman, it's a long drawn out process. (I will say this though, they must've known people might have a problem with that because they made it sincerely interesting, despite time-consuming.) But, they definitively got a new fan here to the decades old hero.I do look forward to #2 as well as any kind of Avengers movie with Iron Man  as long as Downey Jr. plays Stark. I can't imagine anyone else stepping into those "not-really" Iron Shoes. (I could see them cutting costs on that Avengers movie with Iron Man now played by Freddie Prinze Jr. Save your role-stealing to Jack Bauer. Another character you'll never replace.)
1. The DVD extra, Recommendations, should just be one: "Any movie but this one."2. The audio commentary is strangely missing from the DVD extras. Some believe it was because the director said only two words ("I'm sorry") which were followed by what sounded like a muffled blast from a shotgun.3. You don't have to have blue hair to be a granny; any bad hair will do. Thanks, Lorraine.4. Sharks have great patience, especially in regards to revenge.5. Sharks are so smart; they can set up elaborate schemes, plots and ploys to get their intended targets out on the water with no witnesses or help.6. People are so used to shark attacks on Amity Island, when one attacks by the fourth movie, no one even bothers to investigate, look for the great white or even file a report.7. When the script calls for a main character to say they're going "Nowhere," the actor's actually talking about their careers.8. Playing the original music from the original masterpiece in the fourth movie's opening segment does not equate greatness.9. Anyone can have flashbacks even to places you were not at or even not involved in.10. Shaking the camera violently underwater isn't scary. This ain't the Bahamas Witch Project after all.11. The nice thing about Jamaican accents is that they can come and go whenever the actor forgets to imitate them.12. You know a project is bad when Roy Scheider and even Dennis Quaid say no, but Michael Caine and Mario Van Peebles actually say yes.13. Scientists that collect "big snails" can be a dangerous profession. Even if you "almost" have a PhD.14. Sharks are the termites of the seathey'll chomp on wood, even when they just want to taunt you.15. Mother's intuition is only relevant when four separate sharks attack your family.16. When you've actually survived three shark attacks, working in the ocean has to be a safe occupation. I mean, it couldn't possibly happenlook out!17. Michael Caine's character is a degenerate gambler (not that it's relevant to the script) but it appears Caine, himself, took more of a gamble here.18. Ellen's character never carried one of the Jaws pictures before. There's a reason for that.19. Lorraine Gary likes to smile and wince. Repeatedly. Karen Allen does the same for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. That should tell you where I'm going20. Sharks trump Homeland Security with their sonar. Some can obtain a flight itinerary of their "mark" when they want revenge on a family, even when they abruptly fly from New York to the Bahamas.21. Sono "direct to video" options in 1987?22. I don't understand how a Part Four of a movie series can be so bad. I mean was Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Batman & Robin, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Hellraiser: Bloodline, Fast & Furious, Alien: Resurrection, Rocky IV, Hannibal Rising, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, Ernest Scared Stupid, The Final Destination, Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, so bad?23. You know you have problems when Misterjaw is scarier this "live action" shark.24. It's one thing to have constant flashbacks/dreams of previous films  that the characters weren't even involved in, but even more from your own movie?...How was this not the Syfy movie of the week?25. You know there are script problems when there are more scenes of Ellen's insecurities than of the "terrifying" sharkin a shark movie.26. The outrageous last 1/3 is worth seeing the whole movie. If you can make it to the beach attack sceneyou MUST see the finale. Think Edward (from Twilight) running up the hill. For twenty minutes. Classic.27. Michael Caine appears so uninterested in this project, or perhaps that the terrible film took his opportunity to accept his Oscar® for Hannah and Her Sisters, that he "almost" becomes lunch for Jaws, swims to safety in the water and emerges completelyand stone colddry.28. Jaws eats a plane in this sequel. Makes sense; he ate a helicopter for lunch in part 2.29. You know you p!ssed off a shark when heroars like a dinosaur? Or is a lion? Do sharks even have vocal cords?30. Never have I seen a movie that fell so far apart in the finale that it's a must-see for all movie lovers. For, you have to know evil to know good, right?
When the best thing I can say about this horror sequel is that it starts IMMEDIATELY with a large penis shot and never gets better than that, we have problems.It seems this entire movie, V/H/S/2, contained the cutting room floor entries left over from the original. While not terrible stories, they weren't as powerful or interesting and neither was the wraparound story. Further, they reduced the film length by reducing the number of short films. Shame.Here are my takes on the stories in this anthology horror collection, ranked as best to weakest:1. "Phase | Clinical Trials." Okay, aside from the obvious fact an eye implant probably wouldn't be recording audio and that the lead worries all his activities will be filmed and never bothers to think about shutting his eye or wearing an eye patch, I rather enjoyed this one. It helped with his cohort had a lot more depth than a normal horror short would contain.2. "A Ride in the Park." This only ranks as #2 on my list because of the original aspect of a hat-camera on a zombie, the unique decision making at the end and that the lead was cute, even though we don't get to see much of him.3. "Safe Haven." This might have come in 2nd on my list had it not had such a long and sometimes sluggish first two-thirds to the story. While that first two-thirds was interesting, and we all knew something big was going to happen, it barely kept my attention. THENthe sh|t hits the fan and redeems itself in the last act. Well donelast part, that is.4. "Tape 49." As obscure as the original movie's wraparound story's ending, the setup and aimless final "revelation" wasn't just confusing, but it was dumb as well. The only thing keeping this out of the 5th ranked story out of 5 was the decent acting by the female lead.5. "Slumber Party Alien Abduction." The title suggests a tongue-in-cheek and fun/ny ride. Sadly, it's neither fun nor funny. It's an all-over-the place war of the young cats and younger mice when parents are away. (They're actually human kids, but it's a metaphor.) Aliens straight from both Signs and South Park invade and who will be left alive and on the ground? Who cares, really?I'm not opposed to a part III, but I'd rather they'd take their time and go and find some excellent talent for the next round, like they did with the first movie. Barely a recommended.
I am going to miss watching this series, yo!I just finished binge watching all five seasons of Breaking Bad over the past two or so weeks. I knew from the beginning that once I reached the finale the entirety would be superb. I was right. And it just had to be because when I started this "greatest show of all time," as some describe it, I only mildly liked it.Yet, I was intrigued and had a continual fascination with my/our obsession with anti-heroes, or in some cases, flat out villains. Why do I/we want so badly for them to get away with it? Especially when said "anti-hero/villain" is such an incredible asshole?I am uncertain as I know I would want this person stopped in real life.Other than the obsession I had with the lead baddie, I loved something even more about Breaking Bad: 92% pure unpredictability. Almost every single time, in 62 episodes, but *maybe* 2-3 times, I guessed wrong on how that scene or storyline would play out. It helped our asshole characters (yeah, there are definitely more than one) were incredibly human and therefore, continuously made horrible and big mistakes.I knew this was fiction, but almost each time a huge decision had to be made or something significant had to be said, I wanted them to go this direction and when they, far too often, went the opposite way, I was dumbfounded and frustrated. But, that made this extremely well written.These characters all became real in this fictional tale and they all did act like true human beings. If me, a non-user and my non-user drug friends were to become dealers and then worse, this is probably how it would play out. Or a lot worse. You see, these guys, or mainly the wonderful lead, Bryan Cranston's Walter White, were extremely lucky at times. Make that many times.Like I said, I took the better part of two weeks to make it through the six years of this series. I loved a ton of the shockers, most of which were toward the second half of both season four and five. Also, I loved how dark and realistic this got towards the inevitable ending. And I will now miss the characters I grew to truly like and admire, such as: Walt, Mike, (Better Call) Saul, (only because he was cute) Badger and Gus.No  not Jesse, yo! He was a little bitch! And for the most part, annoying as all Hades.Take my advice and do as I had. I hadn't announced on social media and only to 1-2 select friends in person, that I was watching this. I wanted to avoid every single possible spoiler and over the years, I saw nothing but spoilers all over Facebook, Twitter, etc. Now, back when the show was on, I had never actually planned on taking on the series in my already overloaded TV watch list, so I either ignored the spoiler posts, didn't understand them or didn't care to read them to put to memory. So, I went in and stayed completely clean throughout the entire series.And nowI am ready to share my viewing of the complete series of Breaking Bad with all my friends, watch the countless YouTube videos and open the door to the discussions and questions I need answers to.
There should have only been one.By the time the overlong 135 minute The Bourne Legacy realizes that it's an unwelcomed addition to the best trilogy in the history of cinema, it completes its minuscule 20 minutes of uninspired action roughly 2 minutes before the credits roll. If, in lieu of action, they wanted this as a "thinking person's" thriller, they also failed on that, as this was one of the most basic films, spy or not, I've seen in quite awhile.Sowhat are we left with? Great performances? No. Plot twists? Nada. Surprises? Nope. Decent cinematography? Okay, it gets that for its hour-long stroll through the snowy Alaskan territory. In addition, I will say, after several mediocre Edward Norton performances, he stepped it up this time.Sadly, I cannot say the same for one of my favorite actors and the person that was supposed to carry this feature: Jeremy Renner. I've been a fan of his for a decade now and he always seems to be getting better and improving himself and the roles he takes on. Well, no one's perfect and he took a giant leap back here. Mercifully, as the movie closed  and the end was welcomed, by the way, he did step up his game, but only so slightly. Overall, Renner's Aaron Cross wasn't just the faux pas Bourne-spy; his role was literally an idiot that appeared more lucky at times than actually trained.The 3-minute-plot boils down to the final days of the true Bourne legacy when the big bad government is permanently shutting down all the programs surrounding the super-spies. On the target screen is semi-spy Cross and he nearly escapes assassination only to be worried about his drug addiction. (Don't ask; I've already gone too far...) He does team up with another nearly assassinated doctor of the program and together they're somewhat tracked with ten times less the suspense and awesomeness found in the original Bourne trilogy.It thoroughly goes without typing that this chapter was as needed as Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was. But, that's the bottom line fact. While not the worst movie I've seen, it is 100% unnecessary and felt like one very, VERY long deleted scene from the original films. Hell, even the action and fighting were so amateurish that it's an insult to stamp Bourne's name on this and not just name it Cross.They should have; you will feel cross when you leave the cinema.
Stop. First, let me pay my respects to James Gandolfini, who just passed away a few days ago, unexpectedly, at the young age of 51. It was kinda troublesome to watch this movie for the first time with him as a major, albeit, costar and knowing he's gone. RIP to the great Gandolfini, who I'll always love fromCrimson Tide. (Back off, I've barely seen just the first couple of episodes of season one of The Sopranos and no more of them. Okay, maybe now, I'll go back and watch the rest)Okay, that's out of the wayThe Incredible Burt Wonderstone is a mess. Now, there are bits and pieces that were funny, namely some one-liners that were actually laugh-out-loud, but overall this movie was just plain bad.I can see some hope here, some ideas that could've worked with another couple (dozen) re-writes and definite talent. Unfortunately, it's all thrown in together like discarded food in a garbage disposal. Almost as if they had an extreme deadline to finish this movie to be released, sadly, on my birthday. Thanks for the gifthope you kept the receipt.Bullied Burt (Steve Carell) finds his calling as a magician and for a boy who started off nice, became a real ass as an adult. He's also in a rut with the same ole routine in Las Vegas. On a side note, many scenes were filmed outside and on the strip of Sin City, and for that, I was pleased. Any real scenes of Las Vegas, and accurate, to boot, gets a thumbs up from me. Too many filmmakers take the wrong routine in showing a fake Vegas  i.e. Con Air and 21  and absolutely assume hardly anyone's been there to know their either poorly edited shots or, blah, stock footage will pass for the real deal.I digress. Somehow, Burt's upstaged by the unfortunate Jim Carrey's atrocious character, Steve Gray, who believes self-multination is the new magic. And oddly  to the script, that is  Bally's Casino owner, Doug Munny (Gandolfini,) gets all giddy when Steve performs nothing but criminal acts against his body.(Oh, and Harrah's owns Bally's, by the way. Not one individual.)Burt must recapture the art of creating illusions and this movie falls apart in every DOA moment of his rebirth.Yes, I'm aware the movie isn't to be taken seriously  some of the "magic" performed, namely by Steve, is so incredibly impossible and a gorgeous gal like Jane (Olivia Wilde) would never go for Burt. But, at least the movie could've been more coherent and Olivia and Steve (Carell, that is) should've had more  ANY  chemistry.Someone should string together all the neat little and few lines that were worthy on YouTube. Then, of the overlong 100 minutes, you could save yourself roughly 95 minutes of 'meh.'
What a cute little movie Date Night was, and one of the most accurate titles I've heard. It's an extremely harmless comedy-adventure for any date night for any couple. And, though it's out of theatre by the time of this publication, it can still be viewed at home for a Date-Night-In.That all said, it's certainly not perfect: of course it has almost zero originality and its main leads have almost zero chemistry  the whole movie looked as if NBC's biggest two stars just met and were just rehearsing. But like most of these types of movies, it's best just to leave your brain at the door and just have fun.If you doit is, in fact, a lot of fun. We have a middle-aged couple, Phil (Carell) and Claire (Fey) Foster on out their "remember-we're-married-and-not-just-roommates" date night, but things go horribly wrong when Phil's trying to impress Claire by taking her to a very nice place. As always, it's booked and apparently as always, he didn't think ahead and he steals a MIA couple's table. This leads to a North by Northwest mistaken identity adventure when they try and prove to bad men they're not, in fact, the Tripplehorns they claimed to be.Incredibly, they decide the only way out of this, when the bad men, police and pretty much any other clichéd adversaries are after them, is to give into what the baddies want: a flash drive. So, let the NYC comedic adventure begin so this normal NJ couple, with the aid of a very-shirtless Mark Wahlberg, can solve this and get their kids from the over-timed babysitter.It's somewhat sweet, but then again, you have to believe these people have more in common than starring on the two biggest NBC shows, both on Thursday. And it's somewhat funny  mostly from Fey, who I'm not the biggest fan (Sorry, you hit your peak doing Palin) but then, like Palin, she plays a ditz who her on-screen husband has to spell out everything for her. I'm not knocking that  it was funny and they didn't go too far by beating that dead horse, like 90% of the jokes in The Other Guys  also starring Wahlberg.I can't necessary see myself rushing to the inevitable and original-crushing sequel, but I can recommend this for any couple, or any one, for a quick and fun ride.
The brilliance of 'Margin Call' was that I hardly understood half of what was going on, much like the experience I had with 'The Contender,' and still it was so wickedly realistic and wonderfully written/acted, I could still join them on their downward spiral of a journey.Oh, and it helps I love stories that take place in roughly 24 hours. I previously worked in the housing counseling industry and I know the downfalls of the housing industry/crisis and some of the evil people responsiblebut I didn't know to this extent. Spacey was EXCELLENT, as always and Quinto really just needs to manscape those eyebrows. Sheesh! 4/5 Stars.
Boy, The Blind Side tried. It really did attempt to be a tear jerker.If it weren't for an interview I heard/saw from the real-life Michael Oher (played here by Aaron) who said barely a scene actually happened  stating most were for, well, dramatic effect, it still would fail at being 100% interesting.Oher's homeless after his druggie mother (of, like 15 kids she may/may not remember giving birth to) doesn't want anything to do with him, as are the other caretakers, he runs into stuck-up rich wife gal Leigh Anne (Bullock) and she takes him in. Showing she's not perfect, even she admits the first night, she worries a person of color will steal from (or harm) her family. Guess what? Oher ends up being someone decent, albeit reclusive and attaches himself to the rich family's kindness.Eventually he opens up, feels more safe and proves that football's his thing. So much, that the coincidentally ex-cheerleader mom encourages him further and then into a college scholarship. Throw in some outrageously Lifetime drama of a conflict on which school he chooses and you'll get the "exciting" climax of him making it big on his own terms.These all sound like complaints. And they're really not. This movie wasn't bad, per se, but not great. It tried too hard, way too hard for tears of the audience. I'll admit: it nearly got me in a few scenes.Unfortunately, before I could fully get emotional, the movie shifts gears and I'm back to watching a movie that should have, in fact, ended on the Lifetime Channel verses the big screen.The more I heard about Bullock's performance  Oscar worthy, they say, I had to see this movie. She was really good, I will say. The best? No. Great, even? Again, no. But really good. I believed every scene she was in as mother-of-the-week Leigh Anne Touhy. Was this her best performance? Or the best she could be? By no means, that's a negative. Heck, not only was she better in Speed, her absolute best job was in 2005's Crash, in which, she wasn't even nominated. Like Pacino, who onlyONLY for the love of Petewon an Oscar for one role (Scent of a Woman), Bullock will probably be recognized for The Blind Side, despite her being so much better in Crash. It's those old Oscar cronies way of making up for past mistakes, as they generally do.Was the movie worth watching? Sure. For the (waaay over used) great (based on, inspired by, etc) true FOOTBALL movies? Not really. If you're looking for that, look elsewhere. And having literally hundreds of the "true" football films come out in the past two+ decades, it shouldn't be hard to find. This one has basically one real football game scene and a few practices. It's more about overcoming prejudices, charity, the 'hood and, of course, Bullock's Oscar chances. See it, if everything else is sold out.SIDE NOTE: Like many other "TRUE STORIES" that use a tremendous amount of unrealistic but dramatic scenes that, for the most part, are entered in to move the story along to fit in years of lives in mere hours, The Blind Side hit a nerve with me. In one of the key plot points, the young boy of the Touhy family (Head) films all of Oher's football practices and games. He eventually sends a copy to the recruiter's office and from there, every single, and I mean EVERYONE of the, recruiting colleges/universities want this rather large soon-to-be football player. Here's my petpeeve: Though I know, once again, these types of movies thrive on the heavy drama (to make us weep!) and have to get the job done in under 3 hours (short attention span, audience, eh?) they cut corners with extreme amateur videos (the boy was about 10) that are professionally made. For example, he's completely stationary yet, the film follows the action on the field, namely Oher. Not only did this type of filming never occur, it was extremely hard to buy the recruiters sitting back, laughing, high-fiving their way to dollar-signs in their eyes due to the "excellent footage" they're witnessing on their monitors. Give me a freaking break.
I told a friend I was going to re-watch 'Toy Story' in the theater due to it being a "classic" in which he immediately disputed. I disagree. Much like 1977's 'Star Wars' or 'Citizen Kane,' 'Toy Story' was far before it's time and revolutionized it's genre, in this case: animation. In addition, they took it to the next level with creativity, a perfect combination of humor for both kids and adults as well as an excellent homage to toys people around my age grew up with. I was at the tail-end to some of the toys shown or in the middle when I was a child. So, of course, a great deal of smiles were on my face throughout in remembrance. But, as a movie-lover/amateur critic, it has to go beyond that. I won't like a movie without a great and original script/dialogue, deep characters, good pacing and surprises. This movie has them all. I loved the lines, the voices were pitch perfect, the adventure made up from just from imagination was inventive from minute one and all characters intersected beautifully. Just as child Andy's birthday party is to start, every toy (alive when no one else is around) is worried they'll be replaced and current head-toy cowboy Woody attempts to convince them otherwise. Unfortunately, it is he that's replaced by Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (love the variances to his name, including "Light-beer") who seemingly doesn't know he is anything but an astronaut. Not too far deep into the story is a touching realization/awakening for both and great learning for the people watching, kids and adults alike. Excellent movie, perfect start for the apparently unbeatable Pixar studios and suitable for all ages. (Side note: 2009's 3-D version worth watching, but adds little to the already masterpiece it is.)
"Are we back?" Marty asks. "We're back." Doc Brown confirms.Harry Potter and the Fall from Grace. Now why couldn't the author, the appropriately named "J.K.", come up with that title?In what appears to be the Alien³ of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is probably the most wasted of all the series. It completely, utterly, regrettably and irresponsibly forgets all that made the previous and great installment, well, great. And it clearly makes the idea of a 7-year school, 3-years (or movies) too much.I would be completely dishonest if I didn't report that this CW-series episode is quite frankly chalk-full of 20 minutes of useful information out of a bloated 153 minutes. And as much as I admire them keeping the films shorter and tighter, I would've preferred those 20 minutes simply added to the previous film.Even outside the Harry Potter franchise, it has been a long, long time since I've wanted to fast forward through a movie I've never seen before. The pacing was awful, the dialogue mediocre, the teen-love-triangles awkward, boring and muddled and the suspense and mystery were completely gone.It might sound like I'm venting frustration, but let me say, it's more like: disappointment. After an exciting and uplifting complete story of good vs. evil in Harry Potter #5 whereas the teens band together, learn, exercise (inside and out) and fear the futurewe now have a school full of kids with amnesia. NO ONE SEEMS TO REMEMBER A DAMN THING from what they were taught, yearned for or prepared for.Instead, we have just another dull year at Hogwarts, yet another new teacher and the background of the baddie that could be written in its entirety on a fortune cookie's slip of paper.So, what the hell happened? Seriously, think about it. In #5, the threat of "V" is REAL and scary. The threat of the Ministry lives amongst the students. The Rebels unite and include Harry. The band of brothers and sisters is alive and the depth of Harry is revealed.Jump to #6 and I can barely describe what I just saw. Well, the students no longer seem to fear "V" or even remember he's lurking. The Ministry seems to have either dismantled or are on holiday for this year. The Rebels say "we're afraid" but only because the script tells them to say that. And the group previously fighting for their lives don't even acknowledge their training/skills, nor the secret room and would rather be taught the game of Quidditch without ever actually playing it. Oh, lest I forget, the depth of Harry, or any character has vanished.I hate to downgrade a movie with decent cinematography  one of my favorite qualities in film, but this movie, an obvious bridge movie from the exciting #5 to the finale, was a complete misuse of time. As I stated before, there are 20 minutes of helpful scenes, including a significant one in the finale.BUTto get there, you'll need a magic wand of awakening or a Red Bull, because the series sincerely backtracked from its suspenseful and exciting previous chapter to the jumbled chapter before: the futile Goblet of Fire.Well, here's to Parts 7a and 7blet's either get back on track or put the series to bed, because I am not sure how much more either Harry or *I* can endure.(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)
(DISCLAIMER: I do put spoilers in my reviews, I'll admit, but hardly none as revealing than the following. It was simply too hard (or I'm paid far too little) to work around the big "secret" of the virus of the original movie: Rec. It's stated almost immediately after this film, Rec 2, starts and is the central core of the movie. So, you've been advised: this review will contain a major spoiler.) It's getting more than clichéd to state: Be careful for what you wish foras I got what I wanted in Rec 2: the explanation of the previous films outbreak. And I was NOT pleased.Oh, is it a spoiler to say what it is since that's 98% of the plot? Fine, be warned, I'll continue. A faux-pas Armageddon of sorts. A demon possesses a girl; the Catholics are frightened and assign a priest to run experiments to get a cure before Satan's minion infects others. When does the phrase "Nothing could possibly go wrong" ever be accurate?Taking place not seconds, but the moment the first Rec ended, the disease control and military break into the apartment complex of a viral outbreak to gather evidence and contain the situation. Hell (literally, I suppose) is still breaking lose inside as they attempt to stop this from getting out.What's clever as this part, and the first third or so, is done in the same hand-held shaky camera fashion by the same types of people from the original, but then they mix it up a bit. Now, we get a new POV from more hand-held camera kids/punks who make their stupid/curiosity-killed-the-cat way into the building. In addition, we get the Aliens treatment of picture-in-picture military POVs. I'm guessing they're attempt is to up the ante for style and originality was noted and worked. What failed was The Exorcist decision.Granted, when you watch this, and I had to rewatch the final moments of the original again to see if I wasn't mistaken, it states this revelation was "clearly" foretold in the original's climax. Perhaps being a foreigner I am (to this movie's origin country, styles/techniques, language and genres) I didn't quite catch it. That, I will take responsibility for. But, in my defense, they didn't give you all that was written on the wall  it's in Spanish and so much is happening and they won't shut up (i.e. hundreds of subtitles) long enough for the average viewer/reader to comprehend anything but "this is a frightening finale; who cares what was revealed."Finally, I got past what the movie's about: demon possession and not an actual virus, as I can't change its intentions, and did somewhat enjoy the ride. It's longer than the first one and not as good. Is it worth going beyond Rec? No. But, if you truly must see the continuation, see it. But, you were warned.
BeginRantNow.I understand most people are beyond the SNUBBED-GAME by now as I'm usually late to any game, but DAMN. How in HELL did Gone Girl miss a Best Picture nomination? Or Best Screenplay? This movie wasn't just amazingly written, but one of the most original movies I've seen in 2014 and one of the best of the year overall.It helps that I absolutely loved the character of "Amazing Amy" (Rosamund Pike.) I will not spoil the reason why I loved her as much as I did for I discovered it myself while watching this movie pretty cold. Mercifully, they did nominate Pike for a Best Acting Oscar, though I am uncertain at this point (February 4, 2015) if she'll win, especially since I haven't seen all the Best Acting films nominated. But, I would certainly love to see her accept the award.Now, she wasn't the best this movie has to offer. In fact, I might consider a Best Director nod and definitely  as mentioned  a Best Screenplay nominee. Heck, I even liked Tyler Perry, and I usually cannot stand him or his movies.That all said, yeah, Ben Affleck is still a terrible actor and might have turned off some of the voters. Granted, this wasn't his worst performance, but it was definitely right on par with most of his career.This movie completely surpassed more than half of the Best Pictures nominated for 2014. In fact, only this, Birdman, The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything were granted the same 4/5 star rating from me with this and Birdman an imaginary tie for first place had this been nominated. EndRantNow, and begin my remaining review.I don't want to give away too much about the plot or what I favored the most, only because the experience of barely knowing the synopsis of husband Affleck being accused/investigated for murdering his vanished wife, Amy, was a good place to start with and then proceed with watching the complex and deep plot unravel. It's long, and yeah, some could be cut out, but it kept me going. Especially, the character of Amy.And keeping with my experience, I implore you to see this movie and let it draw you in with its many twists like a great novel you have in front of you. I love movies like this  ones that start off with a simple premise and evolve and surprise me. I even had to rewatch the finale just to understand and absorb the whole meaning.The Oscar voters are probably right with their picks and nominations 50% of the time. Like The Lego Movie being snubbed for both Best Pic and Best Animated film this year and nearly a decade back with the completely underserved shut out of Brokeback Mountain for the win, this movie deserves a helluva more attention.Sorry, I did think the rant was over. So, just see the movie and you'll begin ranting yourself.* * *Final thoughts: Though, personally, I thoroughly encourage more penis shots in movies, the Ben Affleck completely out of left-field, quick second or three, full frontal shot wasn't just unnecessary, but felt manufactured to cause buzz. It was clearly established he was without clothes due to the shower running, so, honestly, it didn't feel like it belonged in either the scene or the movie. Granted, I'm not an Affleck fan, but seeing "it" had me scratching my head more than enjoying the view.Did it ruin the movie? No, it's still a penis shot, after all. And even though I didn't think it fit, at least it wasn't the billionth woman to disrobe for cinema.
I actually liked From Paris with Love in the beginning. I liked seeing Meyers's character, James Reece, in his yearning to expand out of his low-brow "bubble-gum" spy techniques and reach the "big-time." Then James gets his break by escorting/babysitting fellow secret agent CRA-ZEE John "Charlie Wax" Travolta around his stationed city of Paris. Once over-the-top Charlie entered into the picture and the idea was two "Lethal Weapon" partners were obviously unwillingly thrown together, my immediate reaction was the same as any other sane person.Box-Office didn't actually lie this time. $24 Million should be the opening day, not the grand total of the film's (to date) release in America.Just as a side note: I don't consider box-office as a way to determine quality of a picture. Avatar made zillions and was below average while one of the greatest flicks of all time, Memento made pennies. People are just drawn to "advertisements" over quality for the most part, as moths to the flame.This, my loyal reader, is a perfect example.From Paris with Love was AWESOME! OK, I'll tone down the dudeness, even though this is a true dude movie. This incredibly short action flick had so much fun packed into it, and it truly began once nutzo Charlie showed up and became the "Super-Human" character I favor a lot of the time. (SEE: Officer John McClane and Jack Bauer, to name simply just two of the best.) Charlie explains to incredibly wet-behind-the-ears James why he's there in Paris, or why they have to go thereit's all clichéd action set-ups to get them from Point A to Point B to the inevitable "explosive" climax. Forget all that. Enjoy the explosions; enjoy the snappy comebacks from Travolta, including the tongue-in-cheek reference he had to another "famous" Travolta film.Truly, I love super-human characters, as long as I know the film is a fantasy and could never really happen. This wonderfully short  I have little patience for a movie that wants to be more than it is, silly action and then needlessly expand to over two hours  martial arts/spy/shoot-em-up throw-away is seriously attempting you to NOT take it seriously. I got the same feeling from Ninja Assassin and same reaction: Awesome, yet check-your-brain-at-the-door, fun.I told a friend about it at work, and being the clichéd hetero male he is, he rented it the day I told him about it. He came in the next day actually quoting it and agreeing exclusively with my enthusiasm of the film. There you go. One person agreed with me.Seriously, if you don't mind some, well, mind-less action with a character that can do no wrong, rarely gets hurt, is always right and down-right crazy with a touch of sarcasm (i.e. The Super-Human Character), watch From Paris With Love. It certainly won't win either an award, or a sequel, but it's so action packed and so short (a PLUS!) that despite its obvious "twists" it'll satisfy any action junkie.
Believe it or not, I was solely looking forward to the remake/reboot of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre back in 2003. The 1974 original is still an absolute classic, albeit low budget/outdated if one were to watch today. And the producers/director and writer(s) didn't let me down this time around.Who knows why they chose to set the movie in the early 1970s and it really didn't add to the story, other than no one having a cell phone to call for help. (Not that it mattered; chances are, they would've wrote in that they didn't have cell coverage in the areas they were at.) Five young adults are headed through the Texas back roads to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert in 1973 when they encounter a very scared woman alongside the road. While "doing the right thing," they pick her up, but when original five head back towards where the hitchhiker is scared to return to, she (literally) blows her own brains out with a concealed weapon.Of course, this freaks out the rest and they stop off at a fly/pig infested general store where they encounter one of the soon-to-be many stranger small-Texas townies. In order to report this, or get rid of the corpse in their van, they must meet the oohhh-scary sheriff in some isolated farm. From there, it's basically clear: you're in store for what the movie title suggests Yadda, Yadda, Yadda, it's girl VS. Leatherface, the chainsaw-wielding deformed son of the crazy town-folk. I won't give away the finale, but I liked it a lot. Not only does it seemingly end on one climax, it continues with an even more satisfyingly revenge-bent/rescue that alters all the copy-cats of the "Wrong-Turn" movies.Though some of the movie is slow and it's yet another remake/reboot/back-road story, it's held up by strong performances/dialogue by the cast and contains a lot of suspense, realism and terror with the isolation of the old structures. The creators had a lot of "scary" sets to work with, and they took full advantage of the surroundings. Highly recommended for horror fans.Side Note: Believe it or not, this movie introduced me to the song, Sweet Home Alabama by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Much like how Mr. Sandman in Halloween II (1981) or Chick Habit in Death Proof (Grindhouse) freaked me out, this did, too. Every time I hear Sweet Home Alabama, I think of the opening to this movie and gives me the urge to revisit this above-average horror film.
What lawyer wouldn't have a field day if Nine to Five happened today?Nine to Five is one of my all-time favorite comedies and as a comedy, with extreme deadpan delivery from Lily Tomlin (Violet) and excellent lines and acting from first-timer-at-the-time Dolly Parton (Doralee,) it still works. Sadly, this is the Stone Age when it comes to office politics and, of course, equipment. This is not to say sexist remarks or promoting males faster than females still doesn't occur, but I cannot imagine, as a whole, it's this blatant.While that's not a flaw, it was what it was 33 years ago, the movie's only flaw that I could concede is that it went on for far too long. It didn't know where to cut or when to end. And still, even with that minor fault, it's still amusing and fun through to the end.I truly loved this movie and it begins solid with one of my all-time favorite movie songs, the same name of the film and sung by the star, Parton. Following that, I loved the fact that the three central characters, Violet, Doralee and Judy (Jane Fonda) weren't exactly friends at first, but become allies when their over-the-top "sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot" of a boss wrongs them. While the movie was already fun at that point  mainly thanks to, again Tomlin and Parton, this is where the sh|t gets realfunny.From merely complaining, to pot smoking their way into incredible laughs (from both them and us) of their fantasies of getting retribution, to almost and inadvertently bringing one of their ideas to life, these ladies get in deep when trying to deal with the soulless boss.While I stated the movie, sadly, is dated for 1980 or that timeframe, it's also unfortunate that the same stereotypical coworkers exist today. Maybe that's reason #38 why I like this movie so much; I can relate as I've worked in offices since March 1996 and have seen all kinds of these characters portrayed here, in the almost equally hilarious Office Space and in pretty much any Dilbert strip.Now, that said, allow me to make sure I am revealing a positive. These secondary and third-tier characters make the movie even better. They're hilarious ("Atta, Girl" said three times almost back-to-back is one of my favorite lines and so true from the office drunk) and realistic (there's ALWAYS an untrustworthy office spy/boss, kiss-up "Roz" character to deal with.) On the front end, there's also always the sarcastic and down beaten "Violet" (which is usually me,) the optimistic "Doralee" and the newbie, "Judy," who ALWAYS will soon learn the hard way. Now, though I've encountered my share of horrible bosses  as well as awesome human managers, I've never worked under the reigns of the terrible "Mr. Hart" (played deliciously by Dabney Coleman,) although I know they exist as do his superiors as portrayed in this film.I didn't work in 1980  I was at the young age of ___ then, and my mom was still a stay-at-home mother when this was released, but I know these events in the movie happened in real life and I am glad these talented ladies could theatrically fight for women's rights. It might not have seemed like a political film, and perhaps it wasn't meant that way, but I bet this brought to light a lot of the disgusting things that occurred to the female workers of the late 1970s, early 1980s.Oh, and speaking of that era, I've read and been told countless times that "Jane Fonda was the DEVIL for her war-time actions" prior to the movie's creation. While she wasn't my favorite part or character of the movie, she was still enjoyable in her role. I do my very best to stay out of filmmakers/star's politics. If I didn't, I wouldn't have enjoyed so many Tom Cruise films  and believe me, I have more fun in his action/comedy/suspense films than most actors over the past few decades.On a personal note, it truly pains me to hear someone tell me not to watch Fonda's movies, or worse, wish her dead. Without getting into the details of what she did, or even the reasons why, I don't care one bit. "Did she entertain me when I watched this?" is the only question I should be asking myself and the answer was: yes.I digress. This movie is hilarious, real fun, adventurous and it's one I could watch countless times, like I did as a kid. Highly recommended.Side Note: That song, Parton's Nine to Five, isn't just one of my favorite movie tracks, it's one of my all-time favorite songs. And funny story: when I was a kid and I would, indeed, watch this movie over and over, or listen to that song from one of my mother's, ah-hem, record player, repeatedly, I always thought the first few lines read:Tumble out of bed and stumble to the kitchen; Pouring myself a cup of bitchin'I was shocked, growing up in a swear-free household, at that word! It truly intrigued me. Until, of course, I grew up, got, what we call now: digital music, clear-sounding movies and, obviously, internet, and learned the true word was: "ambition."Eh, I think both fits.
1. Maybe God should start with everyone involved in this film.2. Also, speaking of God, it had to be a miracle Director Nicolas Winding Refn made a measly 90 minutes feel like 210 more.3. And the only time 90 minutes feels this long and drawn out, is when it's an hour and a half before my work shift ends.4. When your mother compares your dick size to your brother's, you know something more than diaper changes happened in that family.5. Drive now seems like an action-packed movie.6. Reaching your hand into the stomach of your dead mother's corpse seems like an odd way to find out if you're still an only child after your only sibling just passed.7. Gangsta moms never seem to travel with protection.8. Characters throughout a movie that relentlessly stare off into space is a Twilight movie trait and should never, ever, be duplicated.9. During a fight scene, audiences would much rather see a statue  repeatedly  than the actual fight.10. Now, I know where those incredibly slow movie theatre concession stand employees get acting gigs.11. When a 90-minute movie's singular highlight is a split-second Go-Go Boys scene, it's time to start googling something else instead of watching all of this. And by "something," I mean12. Red is the new bland.13. Random is the new Indie Film.14. I'm bailing on a director if he tells me to walkasslowasIpossibly can into a scene. Ain't nobody got time for that.15. Bangkok isn't even that when all they feature are depressed strippers at their clubs.16. "Here, seek justice, but I will take your hand for doing as I say" is the logic here.17. It wouldn't surprise me if Ryan Gosling really did get beat up for real in this movie and that was just from his fans. Or, even, his mother. I would.18. Since Gosling barely spoke during this movie, did he adhere to the old phrase: "If you don't have anything nice to say"19. 5-mintues for an interrogation scene should only occur in real life, not in the movies.20. Karaoke never sounded sobad. And Bill Murray lost his Oscar?21. Kristen Wiig was in this? Oh, sorry, that's just Kristin Scott Thomas's terrible wig.22. When you say: "I'm checking out" to a hotel clerk in Thailand, it means you're checking in. Is it reversed from America, like the side of the road you drive on there?23. God had nothing to do with this movie and wishes His name be removed. In a completely unrelated story, The Book of Revelation has just been bumped up thanks to Only God Forgives.24. Impatient people should never see a Refn film. I've learned my lesson. Sadly, it took two times.
When the first thing that pops in my mind when thinking of a way to construct my review of Diamonds Are Forever is: Well, thank God, we've finally hit the 70'syou know there's trouble.My continuing voyage through the Bond Galaxy reaches Bond Part VII, and boy, did it start off with a bang: Bond kills Blofeld! Easily and clumsily, as usual, but still he did in 5 minutes what he couldn't for a few movies before this. Naturally, he's getting revenge as the previous chapter ended on a "sad" note with Blofeld killing Bond's one and only wife.Also as usual: Bond's out for revenge  no convincing me otherwise, and of course, Sean Conner's smirking demeanor never changes. He's neither satisfied, nor happy, nor angry, nor ecstatic. He's just smirking away, like he's done floating through now six of the seven Bond franchises. In fact, the only thing that has changed is that Connery looks like he's aged a bunch since two movies back: You Only Live Twice and that was only four years prior.I digress. This movie started off promising with action, the best desert chase scene since Eegah, a decent idea and song, a rare secret identity for Bond and hell, it was even long before it's time by including an obviously gay duo, albeit evil and bumbling, but still. And the cherry on top: we got a somewhat decent Las Vegas of the early 1970s chase scene, including driving up and down the currently closed Fremont Street. (I use "somewhat decent chase scene" because it's few and far between that Bond movies really imagine or show an inventive chase sequence.)And then.the movie literally went to sh|t. No joke. This movie fell off the same cliffs Bond skied off of in the previous movie, On Her Majesty's Secret Service.Oh, I forgot about the main plot. Undercover Bond (mercifully not with a kilt or puffy shirt this time) is involved in diamond smuggling into Clark County, NV. That's here nor there, because they end up on an oil station on the ocean and Godzilla-type special effects are the main focus and whoathey were bad.Thankfully, that was the finale, so it really couldn't get much worse. But, from starting off good, and continuing to some interesting scenes  such as a fairly good high up, outdoor elevator scene, it really went to hell in the second half and if you feel like finishing this, you'll have a cartoonishly bad time.Oh, when will this series get cool? Become fun and adventurous? Will it, relatively soon? Yeah, I'm a modern Bond fan  the first third or so films were before I was even conceived, but come on. On the flip side, I do believe what ain't broke, don't fixand that makes me feel pity on the lowest of expectations of audiences back in the 1960s-1970s.Hopefully, the next film will let the good live and let the cheese die. Hopefully.(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the "odd one out": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)
Admittedly, I am a COPS, that 25-year-old-TV-show, fan. For many years, like, at least, a decade, I've never missed an episode. Sadly, it looks like it's on its last leg this quarter-of-a-century season. So, it was very nice to see a feature-length, albeit fictional, version of that show in the form of End of Watch.The movie even starts off like an episode of COPS with an exciting chase scene. So, I knew I was watching a movie I would enjoy.Now, granted, the rest of the movie has almost as zero storyline as just the one original car chase scene, but it was still a fun ride watching two yapping, racially driven police partners.I would state the biggest problem with End of Watch was that, in the beginning they build up the film as a "Found Footage" genre flick, of which I normally despise. In fact, I only watched this for both Jake Gyllenhaal, who is an actor I very much like and has starred in a lot of my favorites, and Michael Peña, whom I've always had a crush on. (Yeah, he's still great, but damn, he's good to look at.)Within minutes, or even seconds, they kinda drop the "Found Footage" M.O. and it transcends into "Documentary Style" filmmaking. You'll know this is true with the incredibly undocumented shots that couldn't have come from the character's video cameras. It was almost as if the director/cinematographer simply gave up on that idea and went all music video shooting.At any rate, the paper-thin "plot" does have a reasonable, albeit really sad, conclusion  it did break me, as well as strong and believable performances and side stories aplenty.The movie felt real, it was gorgeously shot and I was very pleased to see it.And I will be seeing it again, no doubt, when COPS is finally cancelled.
Wow. Hollywood must not have any faith in Ricky Gervais. They keep, or he keeps accepting, "alternate reality" movies. His other three big American-Made features, Night at the Museum 1 & 2 and (the best of the lot) The Invention of Lying all had to do with either outrageously out-of-this-world realities. Ghost Town falls right into place.I mean, this guy's funny. Drop dead hilarious. If you're a die-hard fan, you probably even liked his appearance at the Globes this year (2010.) So, give him something more down to Earth; I know he can handle it.That all said, Ghost Town really wasn't terrible. It had its moments, but unfortunately the drama solely outweighed the comedy. I was looking for comedy. It's billed as a comedy. And it stars a comedian.I get the fact it's in the same genre of Groundhog Day. No, make that, it's exactly like Groundhog Day, substituting the groundhog with ghosts. Too bad for Ghost Town that it didn't blend the comedy, romance and drama as well as the Bill Murray vehicle.No spoiler to say Frank (Kinnear) dies all but instantly in the film and thankfully, they waste no time having him try to figure out what happened or what his magical ghost powers are. However, they fast forward 1 year and Frank latches onto extreme self-centered jerk Bertram (Gervais) who can see dead people after he, himself, died for just under 7 minutes.The plot becomes familiar here: Frank was a jerk himself in the living world, took his wife (Tea Leoni) for granted, cheated on her and now is trying to make amends by using Bertram to thwart his widowed wife's next marriage. Naturally, Bertram falls for her, but (like I said in the Groundhog Day reference) he must learn to be less selfish in order to get the girl. Will he do what's right? Will he get the girl? Actually, I'm not saying. But what I will say, the movie's worth a shot. Gervais is funny at moments, though his character's still a prick. Both Kinnear and Leoni looked like they were trying really hard at comedy. (For the record, both of them have been so much better in other features, but I wouldn't call their performance here bad. Just not, well, great.) I guess the other obvious choice of reference this movie copied from was 1990's Ghost. In fact, there's just scenes directly lifted from Ghost, perhaps as an homage or maybe just plagiarism. Either way, if you liked both Groundhog Day and Ghost  two completely different genres of films, but wanted to see them blended, see Ghost Town. And though I would still recommend Ghost Town, before I ever see this again, if at all, I'd rather watch the two it stole from 5x a piece.
Much like Speed 2: Cruise Control, the sequel Men in Black II went down near the top of the list of all-time drops in quality from the original. This movie sucked.I'll admit some of the humor and special effects were good. That part accounted for 3% of the entire movie. So, math buffs, that means 97% or an overwhelming majority of the so-called comedy lines and special effects were just plain awful. What a giant step backward from the creativity in the MIB universe and laugh-out-loud comedic lines from part 1.Everything, and I mean everything was overkill. Similar to the enormously overused Scrat in the sequel Ice Age: The Meltdown, Frank the Pug, one of the best characters created in MIB 1, is not only in 40% of the movie, they overstayed his welcome to the point of severe annoyance. (Who Let the Dogs Out? was old way before this movie came into existence and was too obvious anyways.) In addition, Kay (Jones) spewing off codes and Jay (Smith) going to mush every time Jay overshadows him was just getting stale.And the worst part (if you don't count Johnny Knoxville selling out, in addition to the worst and most unfunny CGI character since Jar Jar) was that one of the best aspects of MIB 1 was Jones's straight man character, Jay. Here, they have to cover up for MIB 1's mistake in that closing. He went into retirement and they spend exactly half the movie getting him to reverse this error in the plot. Thank God, they didn't give Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) amnesia in the Lethal Weapon 1 finale and then spend half of the wonderful Lethal Weapon 2 trying to not only get his character back on track but satisfy what they audience came to see.In this abomination sequel, aside from the aforementioned bringing Jay back into the line of duty, we have lonely and depressed Kay going through partners like Elizabeth Taylor. Once back with Jay, they battle another alien (in the form of the gorgeous, but practically useless in her role, Boyle) who, again, wants a small object that will again destroy the Earth in the matter of an hour. Again.You'll see characters from part one, like Torn's Zed flip in the air because, well, they think it would be funny for someone 108 years old kickboxing. You'll see Frank the Pug sing and whine and sing and whinerepeatedly. You'll see terrible and unfunny cameos from (the now late) Michael Jackson and Martha Stewart  which would've been funny, if the joke wasn't already used just about enough in the first movie. You see a grosser Knoxville than his persona from Jackass, but that's just because his 2-headed CGI character was horribly juvenile  more so than the MTV show. One of him is just enough. And you'll see everything you loved about the original being flushed away. (Literally.) And what's the deal with the original and wonderful Linda Fiorentino not returning? Obviously Jones and Smith were getting a boatload to sell out. It must have played out like this when she read the script: Fiorentino probably smiled and said, "You've got to be kidding me. At least I have standards." SKIP! Let's hope MIIIB is better; they've certainly had enough time to prepare. Jones is NOT getting any younger and he can't start using the Lethal Weapon line "I'm getting too old for this sh*t" as we already know that.
Somehow, I can't put my finger on what was wrong with 'Seed of Chucky.' Perhaps too complicated? Too many themes running around with barely an ounce of what the series was about, leading up to this? It had it very pleasant moments; not only did Jennifer Tilly return, which was a great presence for the series beginning in #4, but she also very comically played herself, always (I'm sure jokingly) mocking Julia Roberts. It also contained a lot of insider-Hollywood jokes, left-over from #4 and some very funny lines from Chucky and wife Tiffany (Tilly.) The best was, and I hesitate ruining his "Jack Nicholson" joke that had me rolling, near the end. In addition, were Jennifer's "Oscar" whine and the "names" given to the offspring. But it seemed flat for some reason. I've now only seen this movie twice and I've had the same empty feeling. Much like 'Superman Returns,' whenever a child's introduced to an established couple, it's time to call it quits. And so, it did. (A reboot/remake's in the works for both 'Superman' and 'Child's Play' and I think if they want to continue with both series, that's the only way to go. 'Lois & Clark,' coincidentally did the same thing: introducing a child is the kiss of series-death.) The cliffhanger for #4 was the offspring of Tiffany and Chucky and now they're making a movie-within-a-movie in #5. Tilly, taking a break from, whatever, is playing the lead while the offspring in England learns of this heads to the States to reunite with his parents. After resurrecting them (for the nth time) all hell breaks loose, as usual. I didn't hate the movie (as I did #2, and it's better than #3) but it's weak and makes me look forward to Child's Play 1.2.
Wait. Was Nicolas Cage not available for this? Was Tim Curry a last minute replacement?I remember seeing Congo in its initial run in summer 1995 and not liking it much. Fast forward almost 20 years, and yeah, it's still bad.Now, was it the worst movie? Hell, the worst Michal Crichton adaptation? Nope. But it was neither memorable, well plotted, fun, exciting or worth a second viewing.In fact, I would have never, ever, given this a second viewing after 19 years had the gang at the How Did This Get Made studios not added this to their list of movies I needed to see before I listened to their fantastic take on this movie.I see where this movie, plot, script and idea was headed. And it could've gotten there, to a great, mysterious and fun place. Nope. It decided to go into 50 different directions and never focus on one main objective for use to care.OK, allow me to spend 15 seconds on a movie's synopsis, I've only seen twice, the most recent of two decades within the last month: Someone wants to find gold, someone wants to find fortune, someone wants to find Bruce Campbell and something wants to find home.What made this 2nd and last viewing enjoyable was: I truly love the performers: Bruce Campbell, Laura Linney and Ernie Hudson. While this movie was terrible, they still made it fun.No, don't see this. Unless you want to watch it like I did in order to listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast. There's no real reason. It's so all-over-the-place, it's not worth it.* * * Final thoughts: Yeah, just watch and read Jurassic Park. That's all Michael Crichton is huge for. God rest his soul, but his other movies, with the exception of Disclosureeh.
Let me begin that I went into Inception with absolute zero expectations. Even though it's been out more than a month  I finally got around to seeing it and I've heard NOTHING but rave reviews, I still  ah hem  cleared my mind before entering the theatre.Let me continue with: I really, really wanted to like this movie more than I did during the viewing. But there were things I simply couldn't overlook and I always have to be honest.#1 As much as I love writer/director Christopher Nolan  to date, he hasn't made a single bad film, talk about a track record!  it almost seemed like he walked off the set of The Dark Knight (TDK) and brought along some buddies to make his follow-up. I spent way too much time saying: "Oh! He was in TDK. Oh. So was he. And him, and him, too." This is not necessarily a flaw, as some directors have long-term BFFs. Uh, Tarantino, anyone? But this does lead me to a tragic combo that I simply couldn't get past#2 It wouldn't be so bad if I noticed a half-dozen actors who went from one director's movie to the next, but the Hans Zimmer scoreoh, the SCOREwas sooo TDK that it was distracting. Even the great Danny Elfman, as extremely recognizable he is and similar he is from one project to the next, at least he varies it a tad bit. This was exactly like James Horner's score for both Titanic & Avatar that were so similar, I kept expecting the iceberg to make its way to Pandora. I say all this, as I am a score-enthusiastic; I love a great score and probably listen to those more than most artists. So, while the general public won't catch it, for those who love movie/instrumental music might be a tad bit disappointed.#3 I absolutely admire and desire original scripts and movies that treat creativity as a number one priority. Unfortunately, ten minutes into this movie, I was already tired of trying to put the, well, pieces of the puzzle together. Sadly, you'll have to continue to do that throughout the rest of the feature. Some of the "plot twists" were easy to pick up and the "layers" of the dream(s) were extremely easy to follow  the background of each dimension's enough to track. But, I think the extremely well laid out plot was also its undoing. Give it a rest sometimes and stop trying so hard to twist the plot/audience and show the movie.Okay, whew, that's out of the waynow, for the positives.Mark my words: after countless, and I mean more than two dozen Matrix-rip offs in the past decade, this is THEE MOVIE that took Matrix to the next level. In fact, this is the next Matrix, though I hope there's no sequels made here.It was thoroughly thought out, extremely inventive  it HAS to be one of the most imaginative movies I have EVER seen and the action, sound, cinematography and direction were all 100% top notch. This movie should only be viewed in either theatres or on Bluray. I can see it absolutely being nominated for Best Picture, Best Sound and Best Screenplay and quite possibly winning all of those awards.Much like how they describe dreams in the movie (and I do, too  all mine are like this) the movie begins somewhere after the real set up takes place. We have some device at sometime in the future that can tap into dreams. The objective of some is to either "steal" ideas and/or information orplant information.Cobb (DiCaprio) is one of the best dream masters, and he's being summoned for that stereotypical "last mission" in order to (HOMER'S ODYSSEY) get home to his wife & kids. Or so we thinkagain and again.So, he takes his normal gang to infiltrate a rich and dying man's son's mind to both satisfy the employer Saito's (Watanabe) wishes, but also so Cobb can see his children again. Their mission involves "inception" or planting ideas using layers and layers of dreams to make him paranoid enough to...well, see the movie for the motivations. In fact, I left out many of the movie's subplots, especially involving Cobb's own layers and what drives his own actions. Best to leave it up to a new viewer to experience his dilemmas.What a journey it was, from dream layer 1 to 2 to 3 and beyond. Even though one of my criticisms was "trying to keep up" with the storyline, it is, in fact, a fun roller-coaster ride between the levels, especially Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) who compensates for the variances caused by the upper decks. The best scene involves an extremely ingenious and "realistic" Cirque du Soleil fight & rescue scene in a The Shinning/Barton Fink hotel hallway.Though every actor did the job they set out to do; only Tom Hardy (as Eames) really stood out  so I wouldn't count on any Best Actor nods. The movie relies solely on story and graphics, and for that, it doesn't let down. A little too much at times, as if it was trying to be so convoluted that it was shooting for a higher playing field than it actually had.That all said, it was very enjoyable adventure with great action, a tremendous number of comedic lines and a fairly good set of dialogue amongst fantastic and exciting backdrops. Highly recommended; there's really no harm in dipping into Nolan's latest dream. And as a side note, I truly believe I will like it more the second trip down this rabbit hole. Until thenthis is what I think.
A Necessary EvilLooks like I agree with myself from 2 years ago. I reviewed Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace when it was released in 2012 in 3-D (see my original review following.) They were supposed to convert the original six in 3-D and re-release each 1-year apart in theatres, so I figured this would be the best way to finally tackle my reviews of them. That idea fizzled, as did this re-release. No wonder, the movie is mostly awful and even when there are bright spots, such as a great performance from Liam Neeson and some beyond-1999 great FX, Georgie Lucas loves to remind us this is HIS movie and he'll ruin any which way he can.This movie is, indeed, a necessary evil. My plan this time around was to watch all 6, on BluRay and from my roommate's projection equipment and on his 150" screen. I cringed all the way through this and all it did was make me yearn to get through the first three to get to the real movies.What I wrote below has not changed. What has changed is my vow to never see this movie again, even if I have a STAR WARS marathon in mind. I will just stick with originally worked: IV-VI.(From February 12, 2012)You know that anti-bullying ad: "It Gets Better"? Well, they should've hired that creator to run the advertisements for Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace. (3/10 Stars)Because after this installment, it does. Little by little. Inch by inch. Okay, make that a galaxy-wide time-frame, but if you can stick it through the first couple of episodes and wait for the additional cast that will send this franchise into hyper-drive, then you'll be content.I digress; we're talking here about Star Wars Episode I: The Pod Race. Will Lil Annie, soon to be Anakin, soon to be Darth Vader and finally the chosen one, bring balance to the Force with lines such as "Yippie!" and "I'm a person!" and "Are you an angel  they live on moons of lego?" and "Mom, you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other" and "Don't count on it, slimeball!"I don't blame him; I blame the horrid director/writer who should've applied to be Stan Winston's successor instead of thinking of dialogue worse than the source material he based this Space Soap Opera on. Yes, I'm bashing Georgie. I think with the money he has that makes Bill Gates jealous, he can take it.Oh, and I haven't even gotten to Georgie's other bad decision: Jar Jar Binks. And I assure you, I won't waste too much time on one of the worst characters in film history. That's already an established fact. So, in lieu of beating a dead Gungan, I'll tell a brief story:A Long Time Ago in a City Not Too Far Away, I originally saw Episode I and a couple of weeks later, my dad had time for his first viewing so I took him. Maybe twenty minutes in, Jar Jar makes his screen debut and my dad leans over to me, to ask: "Who is that annoying character? I don't like him!" To which, I spat back: "Get used to him. He's in practically every single scene until the end." My dad did not look pleased.At any rate, it doesn't get much better, within this film, that is. Beyond Lil Annie's annoyance  and believe me, he would be the number one Star Wuss if not for Jar Jar, there's further bad dialogue, acting and the pacing is atrocious. If the 45-minute Pod Race  that's ONE SCENE  isn't bad enough, the movie moves as slow as the famous words at the beginning. Its clear Georgie Boy had a 30 minute story to tell and stretched it past two hours. And you'll feel every Midi-Chlorian until the surprisingly decent finale.In fact, that's my highest praise of the movie, aside from some very good special effects. If you can wade through Naboo and Queen Amidala's cut lip and laughable voice, you'll be greeted with the fantastic, duel lightsabering Darth Maul  the one stand out character that you'll cheer for, even if he's on the Dark Side. His fighting two Jed-Is along with a mildly entertaining space battle is worth waiting for. That is, if you can ignore the other things happening at that time, such as Lil Annie's constant need to FORCE a headache on the movie-goer or the battle of the Gungans  because, YES, any time they're on screen, spitting or not, they're absolutely maddening.Lest I forget, it's in Barely 3-D now in theatres. Don't waste your time. The 3-D adds ZERO to this experience. But, don't worry. Episode II is a huge improvement as is III over II. And so onIt will get better.
Do not watch the extended edition. I'll start with that.We're the Millers is a hilarious (at times) comedy and this is mostly thanks to star: Jason Sudeikis. Now, I've always liked this dude, but here, as the drug dealer with a heart, he shined and almost every line he spoke was funny.But, as with my first warning, the extended cut was way too long. In my opinion, no animated, horror or comedy film should be longer than 90 minutes. Okay, around an hour and a half is okay, and the shorter the better, but none of these genres should be over two hours.That's not taking away from the pleasure I had spending time with these characters. Especially Sudeikis's David Clark who has to transport illegal drugs from Mexico into the United States. He's coaxed into it when he gets robbed and must develop a cover of a family holiday with more misfits in order to live.Naturally, with most comedies, there are the clichéd antics, live-and-learn drama and obvious traps the characters fall into, but these guys and chicks do keep it lively. While not perfect, the specific scenes, that should be cut away as great YouTube clips, make up for the formulaic plot.Recommended as it's harmlessfor those with an open mind. And besides, as a fan of Parks & Rec, you gotta love Nick Offerman in this.* * * Final thoughts: OK, fine. I watched it only for the advertised "Full Frontal Male Nudity" scene involving the boy. In my defense, I knew he was of age and kinda cute, in his nerdy way. Naturally, a two-hour film is not the most efficient way to see a guy's junk, but it certainly was a bonus to wait for it. Mercifully, it's a very funny and enjoyable film regardless of my initial intentions.Really final thoughts: The best scene, by FAR, was the "You know what I'm sayin'?" scene. I absolutely HATE that filler phrase: "You know what I'm sayin'?" and I even associate with a guy at work that says that a lot. I tried a few lines from what Sudeikis says in this movie, but it went right over his head. Recently, I tried: "No, I do not know what you are saying. Please state it again." Unfortunately, that, too, went over his head. I will, once again, continue hating that stupid phrase unintelligent people say.
Okay. If you're into torture porn. Or into sadistic horror. Or really, really want to see Leatherface birthed, his first "Leatherface," his first kill... This is the movie for you! The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning is a clever movie  or so the creators believed. Here's a major spoiler for the 2003 remake/reboot: Leatherface gets his right (and chainsaw-wielding) arm officially CHOPPED off in the finale of the 2003 reboot. So naturally, (realistically) they can't go further. What must they do? Oh, yeah, make the prequel. A good 4-5 years prior to the 2003 remake's setting  in 1969 to be exact  why? Oh, of course, if this movie fares well, they make more "sequels" to this prequel that will actually precede the 2003 remake. Nice move  if it worked (made money.) In my mind, right now  in 2010, the series is officially dead, again.Now, since they made the series a little more realistic, meaning when a baddie loses a limb, they stay that way, is actually the movie's worst enemy. Since it's a prequel and if you've seen the original (remake/reboot) then you know how this is going to play out  not good for the new pretty younglings who always inadvertently fall prey to the creepy white house in the middle of nowhere. I'm not trying to spoil anything; the movie does a pretty good job all by itself. So, again, if you really want to see how it all started, including the reasons of the cannibalism, then pop this movie in.The movie opens with the disgusting meat factory and the birth (and dump) of baby Leatherface. He's wrapped and placed nicely in a garbage bin only to be rescued by one of the crazy family's females. He's got a new mom and family! Things are looking up for the garbage bin baby. Yeah, right.Fast forward to grown Tommy/Leatherface working in the same area, if not spot, where he was birthed and the meat factory, rightfully so, is shut down. So, naturally, Tommy does what a lot of (postal) people would want to do, bludgeon his ex-boss with a hammer. (Mark his first kill.) Then, he notices a chainsaw and takes it. (Mark his first chainsaw.) Now, on a side note, the creators wanted to show the audience why he uses a chainsaw, and hence the film's title. Honestly, it's no big deal, because he doesn't use it for his first murder, in fact, it's just an afterthought. I didn't see a rhyme or reason why he picked it up, except it looked cool to him??That was Plot A. Plot B's story of the two boys/two girls doesn't really matter  and the director explains this in the making of  but just for filler, one is purposely going back to Vietnam in 1969 and is making his unwilling brother join him. Just as the younger brother burns his draft card to tell his older brother, the blank hits the fan.The new sheriff, Hoyt, (played deliciously by R. Lee Ermey, reprising his role) in town is the main Hewitt of the (crazy) family after he kills the last remaining law officer when the town dies following the meat plant closing. Sheriff kills the biker bothering our "heroes" in one of the many other sub-plots (I think that was Plot D) and holds the kids hostage. Well, all but one who's smart (no dumb) enough to go into that creepy white house to rescue her friends. (By the way, I've already made a pack with my friends  this ever happens, screw me, just run.) The rest of the story is pointless to explain, except there's a lot of guts, gore, chainsaws, running, screaming and dinnertime. It did have an extremely effective and original killing involving another biker who happened to fall on the (soon not to be) silent chainsaw.Back in 2006, I voted this as possibly the goriest movie I have ever seen. Funny, a couple of weeks later, Saw III was released and that certainly topped this one. Nevertheless, this is made for a very specific audience and as run of the mill as it is, it still contains a lot of nods to the 2003 remake (like how Sheriff Hoyt loses his teeth) and is considerably better than the original series parts 2-4. Recommended for only curious and deranged, er, interested parties.
After recently watching the enormously disappointing 'Obsessed,' a movie that truly mocked (notice: not copied) 'Disclosure,' I had to watch one of my favorites from years past again. It helps that I love Seattle, a place I've visited once and that was enough to plan to move there one day. I don't see too many movies based there, so that was more motivation to watch this again. Though 'Disclosure' wasn't perfect  there were too many scenes where the characters all but turned to the camera to explain a plot point or what a CD-Rom drive does, it was a highly entertaining suspense movie that didn't involve a murder or even attempted murder. I liked that, as most suspense thrillers, namely Douglas's own movies ('Basic Instinct' and 'Fatal Attraction,') do involve police, murders, killers or psychos. This was all corporate intrigue and a twist on the age-old sexual harassment. Douglas's family man, Sanders, is up for a promotion in his computer firm, but is passed over for his ex, Moore's Johnson. Not 24 hours into the job, she seduces him in quite a graphic scene and then accuses him of sexual harassment. I'm not giving anything away; that is the set-up. But why would she? What can he do to keep his job and family together with a lawsuit, or pink slip, hovering over him during a major merger of the company? There's a lot of suspense, mystery, good acting, dialogue and originality here. Sure, it's enormously dated  in reference to the "modern computer gadgets," but everything else is still fresh. I loved the main setting, his office, I loved the Sutherland tongue scene (hilarious) and the simple fact that the wife was supportive and real, unlike jealous and distracting Beyonce in 'Obsessed.' Highly recommended just for an easy-to-follow thriller/movie night.
The problem with these full monty-type films is that they never show just that. (Well, they do here, for a brief couple of seconds, off to the left, but then, it was probably fake.)And what is the deal with Steven Soderbergh? Whenever anyone ever asked me who my favorite director over the past couple of years, I would've had said Soderbergh because I really liked Sex, Lies and Videotape, Traffic, the Ocean's series, Erin Brockovich and Out of Sight. But, as of late, damn, he's made some stinking films: Contagion, The Informant!, Haywire and this one: Magic Mike.Okay, in all fairness, both The Informant! and Magic Mike weren't exactly terrible, but going from the excellent films mentioned to these turds is taking him off my top director list.What worked with Magic Mike was the music, the dance segments and Channing Tatum's performance and quick wit. Sadly, with such an incredible running time of 110 minutes for this maaaybe 83 minute story, you only get those positives for roughly 15% of the entire film. The remaining 85% is sometimes painful to get through.In one of the oldest story lines known to humans, an established group of performers encounter a newbie who's wet behind the ears, learns, gets catty and eventually leads, à la All About Eve. This is no spoiler for anyone that has seen a movie and watches the first 5 minutes of this. Of course, that and the obvious "romance" are both seen almost immediately.Granted, the "twist" is that they're focusing on male strippers, damn good ones, at that and I kinda liked that aspect  no, not just for the nudity and using males over females; I did like the minute update to that part of the old fable.What I didn't like is probably too long of a list to compile. Let's start with the obvious: Cody Horn's, who plays Brooke, the sister of said newbie, acting is so atrocious, so abysmal that if she took acting lessons from Kristen Stewart, it would be a step up. (Hey! I finally gave a compliment to Kristen, albeit inadvertently and backhanded.)Also the editing, off the dance stage, was all over the place. Scenes simply did not make sense, such as lead dancer Mike (Tatum) is getting unreturned phone calls and is looking all over for his rookie "BFF" in one scene, and the next, the newbie simply shows up to meet Mike at a bar.I guess people wanted to see this for the nudity and male dancers only, but let me assure you: YouTube has more scenes of that content than this entire mess of a movie. Of the 110 minutes, probably only 15% is of what people, ah-hem, came for.And why is this marketed towards women, only? Can't some men appreciate these fine looking men? Hell, even in the movie, the only single reference to homosexuals even existing is to make fun of them by having the newbie massage a male dancer's leg as an initiation.About 10½ years ago, I was the "Gentleman of Honor" at my best friend's wedding, which means not only did I stand on the Bride's side  in a tux, thank you  but I had the duty of the Bachelorette Party. I knew nothing of what goes on in one, but I assumed one stop was a male strip venue.I remember standing in line for a regular, no-name bar who was hosting one that night and the ladies in tow behind me. When it was my turn, the bouncer would not let me in. I explained my role and that I didn't even care to see the show, at any rate. (That was true; the guys that perform are generally not my type.) The door man still declined my entry and handed me a "GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS!" strip club advertisement card. I looked at him and said: "What the hell am I supposed to do with this?"He said I would have more fun there and that the guys on stage feel uncomfortable if other guys were in the audience. I ended up at an extremely dead gay bar down the street, being hit on by someone who looks like he ran the amusement park in the Scooby-Doo mysteries and just waited on the girls.That shitty explanation of "uncomfortableness" baffles me to this day, nearly 11 years later. #1: They usually don't get completely naked, and even if they did, they look like they work out in a gym, so walking around naked in front of other guys, like in the locker room, should be old school. And #2: If they are straight and are comfortable with their sexuality, it should be just the same as women performing in front of the countless ladies who go to female strip clubs. (Oh, and if they're gay, they it should be even less of a big deal.)I digress. Even without understanding why the men are so uptight in both real life and in this movie, overall, despite it being well shot (cinematography was decent), the few good dance segments and Tatum's unusually fine job, the movie is a waste. Perhaps Magic Mike 2 will be better. And maybe actually show some meat.
I haven't seen 'Re-Animator' (3/5 Stars) since I was a kid, but I remember loving it. Now? Not so much. Sure, it was still clever and funbut the BLATANT RIPOFF of Bernard Herrmann's 'Psycho' theme was so distracting, it was hard to enjoy the movie. I tried to get past that, and managed to, until the third-act that was so "out there," I was back to wondering what made this movie so great when I was a kid, aside from all the free-male-nudity that I couldn't see in a internet-free world back then. I understand this is about a green-goo that brings back the dead to life, so I suspended my disbelief as far as I coulduntil a dismembered head both breathed and spoke. And then, worse, he could control other zombie-likes with his mind. This was starting to sound like a plot from a 'Wonder Woman' Season Three episode. If not for the overall creepiness that was effective, the entertaining dark humor and the great performance from Jeffrey Combs as the mysterious Mr. West, it would be a waste.
Men in Black is one of those rare movies you don't want to end too soon, and 98 minutes is really too short.After all, they created (literally) a whole new universe, introduced some awesome alien and definitely great human characters and since it's an origin story, only about half of the movie do you get to see the dynamic duo in action.These sounds like complains, when in reality, I loved this movie.I saw Men in Black many years ago and I remembered liking it a lot. Perhaps, becoming relatively jaded in the quality of movies since made me forget on how excellent this movie was. All actors were dead on or near pitch-perfect in their roles, the comedy was huge, Tommy Lee Jones once again proved how wonderful he is as the straight man and Will Smith continued his leading man/comedy role greatly. Also, this movie introduced me to a wonderful actress, Fiorentino. (Too bad, she didn't return for the sequel.) But, as much as I like acting in movies, it didn't end there. The sets, cinematography, special effects (even at 13 years old now, it trumps a lot of movies today,) the comedy, score, screenplay, originality and action/adventure were all top notch. Barely a flaw I could see with this, possibly aside from the sad closing (SEE: Kay's decision) and Smith, though funny, was really just doing what he did best. Again.After a top secret agent of a top secret elite force retires, Kay (Jones) seeks out a new partner in rogue NYC cop Edwards (Smith,) who, of course, has to inevitably give up everything (which is nothing) to become Kay's partner Jay. It takes him a little while to learn the role of Alien Ambassador (with punked out guns and gadgets) and while he's getting adjusted, you'll fall in love with Jones's deadpan humor. Again, he plays the perfect straight man to wacky, on the edge and unorthodox Jay.Meanwhile, a "bug" or bad attitude giant cockroach inhabits a human body in order to steal the galaxy, which of course another space race wants back, even at the expense of Earth. Will supermen Jay & Kay (and with the help of many zany characters (LOVE Frank the Pug,) and a mortician (Fiorentino)) solve the case and save the PLANET?! Is it really a spoiler to say This is a must see. It's sad more movies can't be made like this today. Again, the special effects actually trump many since this, barely a moment did I not believe this universe they crafted didn't exist. (Well, Okay, I said barely: Smith delivering a child and being swung around wasn't 100% perfect, but still a good scene, again, thanks to Jones.) Though a bit gory at times, perhaps slimy and some bugaphobics might want to look away at times, everyone should see this fantastic adventure.
I've never actually seen an episode of ER. I actually took to the movies to appreciate George Clooney, and have since 1997's The Peacemaker.While this movie didn't get a lot of hype or admiration, I truly had a good time. Loved the wit and snappiness of Clooney's dialogue, the action, suspense and drive of the characters. While it's not perfect and has that annoying "An Improbable Jump Through Solid Glass to Escape" scene that I always doubt and some omitted scenes that would've been awesome to see  i.e. two trains colliding, it was an enormously fun ride that, surprisingly, still holds up today, 16 years later.The plot is the norm: with a extensive plan, terrorists seize a nuclear bomb and it's up to two unlikely government heroes to work together, on a global scale, to find out: where they're headed, what they're up to and why. What stands this above the rest, was a fresh and young Clooney doing his soon-to-be normal, but great, schtick.I happen to be a fan of his cocky, but smart, ambitious but laid back appeal. So, I always give him a pass. And this movie contains one of my ALL TIME favorite movie scenes: (mild spoiler) Clooney's dear friend just gets killed and after an exciting car chase leaving one terrorist barely alive, Clooney says nothing in the downpour of water, walks up to him and shoots him point blank. As much as I like snappy comeback and final last crass words, this scene completely shocked and pleased me, because this is how it should've been done in real life and in the movies.Other than that one scene, it's exciting, interesting, has a great pace and a fun puzzle to put together while watching. Highly recommended.
Wow. I didn't know what to expect from Surrogates. Literally, I watched it being a Bruce Willis fan, my desire to watch something new (to me) and my liking of Sci-Fi/Future Earth stories. Check, check and check. Unfortunately, as you should be careful for what you wish for, I forgot to ask for a great (or even really good) movie and/or something original.Obviously, these concepts portrayed aren't new; I, Robot, A.I., The Matrix, Minority Report, The Stepford Wives, The Terminator, anyone? That's just to name a few this 89-minute Twilight Zone episode mimicked, or borrowed from. I wouldn't have a problem with any of that if there were more substance or deeper levels to the characters. Literally everyone was reading the script verbatim. Including "where can I cash this paycheck?" Willis.I liked the intro: a recap of what happens in the near future  introduction to the A.I.'s or Surrogate technology, to the evolution of the evolved plastic human cyborg and then the "present." That was probably the cleverest thing about this film, but unfortunately, it follows that by just settling into the typical "mystery" of a murder when crime levels dipped to record lows. Tom (Willis) investigates a new weapon that can kill both the zombie cyborgs and the humans linked when this is UNHEARD OF "Our products are guaranteed to not harm the human host when damage comes to the walking mannequin! Surely nothing can go wrong!" (I honestly think its unnecessary to say somethingdoesgowrong!)If it's not clear yet, and not everything in this movie is, people now can truly be couch potatoes  my personal dream, if it weren't so hard to type lying down. They lay back, plug into this Matrix, or robots with skin, and they control the movements by the human host's brain. Without leaving the comfort of their bedroom, people now can run fast, lift tons, fight efficient wars andhere's the best partno longer will you be subjected to ugly people! You can now be a beautiful person on the outside, sorta.But now with this nasty and thoroughly expected (if you've seen just one Twilight Zone episode) weapon, the safety is off and Tom, who misses his dead son and the comfort of his vacant (into the machine) wife, has to journey into the reservations of actual humans to solve the murder of the surrogate's inventor's son.It tends to get really complicated, though thoroughly predictable, but it boils down to is this technology draining humans of being human? It's a no-brainer and even at a measly 89 minutes, it drags for what seems like hours.Yes, I'm aware humans due dumb things. But, it's really hard to buy this would take off. We all yearn to hear that whatever product or program has an ISO/BBB guarantee of working 100% and safe. This movie proves, far too many times, that this system has more than 1000 flaws.It's an interesting throw-back, but not groundbreaking. It does, however, contain some good shots and graphics, but overall it's a disappointment. You could watch any of the above mentioned movies for far better entertainment or heart. I'd say skip it, but it's so harmless, and short, it won't kill you to watch it from Netflix's "watch instantly" selections.Side Note: As noted, I'm a Bruce Willis fan and it was half 'n half fun/disappointing to see this movie ALSO copy Live Free or Die Hard. Replacing Kevin Smith is Devin Ratray and Willis must rely on/use technology to save the day. Only this time, he's a Rolex in the distant digital age.
1. All reviews of Night of the Comet should begin and end with "Totally 80s!!" 2. Rebuilding civilization "the right way" by waiting for the traffic signal so you can safely cross the street, but then immediately playing football in the entire street is probably the main definition of hypocrisy.3. Zombies weren't even hot in 1984, but, heck, why not throw them in a completely unrelated Comet Attack film? 4. Playing video games might just save your life! Not really and not even in this movie, but it looked cool.5. Rent just went down! Party on! 6. When scientists know something will hurt them, but still do a literal half-ass experimentbe somewhere else.7. It took me the entire movie to realize that was Chakotay! 8. Soit wasn't the comet that wiped out the Valley Girl Syndrome? 9. Stephen King probably watched this and said, "Well, that's a good startbut what happens after page 3?" 10. I love the 80s. Which screenplay writer ever HAS to put in dilemmas such as: What happens when the electricity goes out? The gas dries up? Or when drinking water is scarce? Let's just have a par-tee, people!
Godzilla (1954,) King Kong vs, Godzilla (1962,) Godzilla vs, Mechagodzilla (1974,) Aliens (1986,) Robocop (1987,) Robo(t )jox (1989,) Deepstar Six (1989,) Tremors (1990,) Independence Day (1996,) Starship Troopers (1997,) Godzilla (1998,) Reign of Fire (2002,) The Matrix Revolutions (2003,) Transformers (2007,) The Mist (2007,) Cloverfield (2008,) Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009,) Monsters vs, Aliens (2009,) Avatar (2009,) Monsters (2010,) Real Steel (2011,) Super 8 (2011,) Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011,) TV's Falling Skies (2011+) and Battleship (2012.)Did I miss any? I mean, I was previously informed Pacific Rim was original, and I was like: whaaat?Granted I don't believe this movie was made to be original. It was simply, and boy was it simple, made to dazzle with great visuals and giant robots vs. giant aliens. Literally, there is nothing else of substance to this movie. The acting was subpar, the dialogue atrocious and the comedic touches werewell, never funny. Hell, I even love Charlie Day from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, but he was so hard to watch here.Don't get me wrong, there were a few clever ideas here and the visuals and special effects were literally, huh, out of this world, but I don't see or appreciate movies that are based on one single attribute. And with such lush FX and CGI  which I normally don't like, but here was great thanks to one of the best and creative directors, Guillermo del Toro, the movie did carry me and was incredibly better than some of the movies it stole from, such as Battleship or any of the Transformers disasters.Here's where I usually give the synopsis, and believe me, I'll be as brief as they were, despite the over two hour runtime: Since aliens coming from outer space is sooo passé, these aliens decided to come up from the ocean and they're huge. Seeing that they're virtually indestructible with our current weapons, Earthlings decide to build Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots of equal size. While forced, emotionless drama and little to mostly meaningless background takes some of the screen time, the bulk of the film is fights between the good guy/bad guy giants.If I were a kid, damn I probably would've loved this; I craved Godzilla, and the like, big monster movies. Back then, I didn't care so much about drama, originality or depth, but as I got older and have seen thousands of different movies than I had as a child (see above for an incredibly short, albeit relevant taste,) I grew tired of the same ole stuff. It's not like I lost in touch with my younger self, but children need a lot less to impress them than educated adults.And after this, plus the major disappointments with Battleship, Avatar and even 1998's Godzilla, I still have faith 2014's Godzilla won't let me down. I believe it will fulfill my childhood desires, but also have some depth, real characters and more than a hint of a story. Is that too much to ask when a director is given nearly $200 million dollars that he spends more than $200 dollars on the script?* * * Final thoughts: In my first paragraph, I picked some of the most relevant movies that I've seen that I believe this mimicked or flat-out stole from. For even more big monster movies I might have missed, check out the Wikipedia page for Movie Monsters.
Okay, here goes. Despite being a fan of Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts, of the genre/style and already wanting to see this movie, I somehow missed it for many years until recently. Of course, the push for me was that scene. You know the shower fight.Actually, that's not what got me to finally watch Eastern Promises. A friend of mine was leaving our work for good and the last week there, she had received back her DVD copy of this from another coworker she had lent it out to. I showed a little bit of interest  especially telling her of my desire to see the shower scene and she made me, ah-hem, promise to bring it back before she quit. I borrowed it, watched it and returned it. Good boy, I am.I digress. This was a fairly good, interesting and fun (for fans of the suspenseful, sometimes slow, but always tight genre) film to watch. Never let me down and for about 100 minutes, it was a worthy watch.The Russian mob in London's not too pleased with midwife Watts after she becomes "involved" with their driver and she has a diary of someone who could implicate them in horrible crime(s.)Now, that's the gist and there are more layers. But, not too many, that is. While very good, it wasn't the greatest thriller I've seen. It is, however, worth another viewing sometime down the road. You see, sadly, I'm finally given a chance to sit down and write out my thoughts  it's been just about a month and a half since I've seen this.In that time frame, I've forgotten the majority of the movie and had to even watch the trailer online before beginning this review. Thisis not a bad thing. I know I liked it a lot and I know I will give it another shot later on. To me, it will be even more enjoyable the second time around because I probably will have forgotten everything by that point and it will be like my first time seeing it.Okay, almost everything. I still have that entire shower scene in my head. I am still a man, after all.* * * Final thoughts: (SPOILER, sorta) Sadly, while it's not a long movie, I did have to wait until the 100-minute movie nearly finished before getting to THAT scene. Which is a distraction because I was always anticipating it to come, but it will be better upon future viewingsAt least, I know when to expect it and then I can dive into the film up to that point even more.
Flick on, flick off, 2014's Robocop isn't an instant classic like the original, but on its own, it's about the middle of the road of some of the reimaginings out there. It's way better than 2012's dreadful Total Recall but is weaker than the same year's Dredd.Actually, this movie might be pretty good for anyone who has never, ever heard of the 1987 original. Comparing the two while you watch this one is fruitless because there is no comparison.The Paul Verhoeven vision of "Part Man, Part Machine, All Cop" was nearly spotless and holds up very nicely today. This film brings none of what made that movie special, unique, fun, funny, satirical or exciting and just mimics some of the plot points (and lines) and adds way more drama than needs be.Basically, this future shows another bleak outlook of Earth whereas machines have taken to the streets of all countries worldwide sans the U.S. of A. Congress is actually smart in this fictional tale and outlawed the same for our home front, but they revert back to what we really know them as: just creating bills based on polls and not what is right. Enter "Robocop," who will sway the public opinion that America needs machines to protect them. But, will he close the gap between freedom and technology?As stated, to enjoy this, forget everything you ever knew about that fantastic 80s action satire. While it grasped at minute details and dialogue from the original, its tone, amusement, depth, likable bad guys and necessary R-rating, were sorely missed. Hell, even under the heavy costume, the charismatic Peter Weller was completely missed. This replacement and probably forever unknown Joel "Alex Murphy" Kinnaman, was as cold and emotionless as the steal he wore.Now, while the original's technology was the vision of the late 1980s, I did like the updated database for the Robocop. I'm not much of a gamer, but I image that's the kind of view you'd get from a PS/Xbox game. And I did appreciate half the stars in Hollywood wanting to sign up for this. A bit unnecessary, but it's still great to see the likes of Keaton, Oldman and (ALWAYS) Jackson.Finally, it's painfully hard not to compare the two films, as I have done throughout my review. But, that said, I found myself not hating on this completely when I attempted to detach myself from one of my favorite movies growing up. It's not perfect, or action-packed and way to heavy at moment, but as a throw-away remake, it could've been a lot worse. * * *Final thoughts: And speaking of worse: What the fvck is with all the bleeping screens? I can see that might have been a thought of the director's in the beginning and then he'd explain later. Nope. It flickered all the way to the worst possible time, the end credits. Try reading those as you'll either have an epitaphic seizure or be p|ssed by seeing the same names flash several times while you're trying to read the next one. Those flickers, plus an outlandish, unnecessary and out-of-place Michael Keaton outburst, were the worst qualities of this film, if you, again, viewed this as a stand-along, the original never existed, film.
Here's another movie I'll add to my "I wanted to like more and, yet, continuously watch it" film list.By leaps and bounds, The Incredible Hulk (2008) is better than the Ang Lee's Hulk movie five years prior. But, it's still not great.The biggest problem I found was that the cast was in reverse. I loved the entire cast of the first movie, but thought the movie was so-so. Here, I disliked each choice for the well-known to the Hulk universe characters and wished they were swapped. At least, they got brave and smart enough to replace Bruce Banner, yet again, with Mark Ruffalo in The Avengers.I used to appreciate Edward Norton. I loved him in Fight Club, Rounders and American History X. But, the last two adaptations he took over, The Incredible Hulk and Red Dragon, he stunk. And bad.Oh, well. I try and get past him and Liv Tyler's lips, the ho-hum Tim Roth and misplaced (and normally great, himself) William Hurt. When I do move on from those bad choices, along with the wide-open plot holes, I can enjoy the movie.As I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series and not the comics, I enjoy the obvious and welcomed TV series tie-ins. Such as: the theme song used, the reporter (note: his name) filming the outdoor University fight, Bixby on the tele, the exciting opening credit scene, the signature lines  albeit humoritized and of course, Lou Ferrigno's (second movie-Hulk) cameo. I enjoyed the HULK-OUT scenes a lot and most importantly, I loved the video-game ending. This is coming from someone who plays very few video games, but did play to completion: The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction on Xbox. The finale to this movie was almost verbatim the game and that was so much fun to watch on the big screen.After a rebooted look on how Dr. Bruce David Banner became the Hulk  so, FORGET the original 2003 movie, Banner's on the run and eventually, though questionably and unrealistically, comes "home" to the USA in order to try and find a cure to his green alter-ego. Meanwhile, a military man wants to be the next super soldier and a great match to meet up with Hulk for theULTIMATE DESTRUCTION in NYC.This movie is NOT terrible by any means. It's pretty cool on how it ties in with the eventual Avengers mythos, years later and its special effects trump the previous movie. In addition, it's refreshing he doesn't grow to 6-stories in this installment.And even though they got the Hulk right even more in The Avengers, to date, 2013, they had very good special effects for the Hulk.Now, my gripes: I want to see less drama and more Hulk-outs. I want to see the Hulk change more. I want to see less dark scenes with the Hulk than trying to cover him up.Yes, I know they (probably mostly from Norton, from what I've read) wanted a more realistic and dramatic approach. Damnit, please just treat a superhero film like a superhero film and leave the art house crap for independent films.That all said, it's still enjoyable, when Hulk is on screen, especially the mid-daylight scene and the fantastic finale. (Though, what was with Betty stopping the killing? Finish him! Okay, okay, that was one of the plot holes)
OK, first time viewer here. I've been advised that Troll 2 is, in fact, the "Best Worst Movie." I'm here to tell you: I've seen worse.No, it wasn't about the "expectations being so low due to all the reviews." I just watched it with an open mind, though I cringed at almost every minute  especially at Creedence (Reed) who probably made her high school drama teacher drop dead if that person saw this.Maybe it was just so well known and publicized that it garners so much attention. It's (far too) easy to ridicule  the town of NILBOG is goblin spelled backwards in addition to blatantly reiterating the truth throughout the movie these are goblins (and not what the title suggests.) Hell, Halloween III: Season of the Witch wasn't about Mikey Myers, but then again, aside from the future subtitles, it wasn't called "Michael Myers."Perhaps it's just me that comes down harder on movies that are actually supposed to be of high quality that's more of a letdown. I have yet to see the documentary based on Troll 2 (though its #1 in my Netflix queue): Best Worst Movie, but I cannot simply imagine they set out to make a masterpiece.OK, sure, it was bad all around: laughable acting, dialogue, camera angles and shots and special effects that would make the Syfy channel directors droll. And those masks! One in particular was the worst, but since they don't wear name tags, I couldn't state which one I'm referring to.Is it sensible to give way the spoilers to the plot? Oh, why the hell not? Family + Dead Ghost Grandpappa head off to the town of GOBLIN (say it backwards!) where they're practically force fed green icing in order to decompose them enough so the vegetarian residents of Nilbog can eat them.Like all 1980s horror films (in fairness, this was released in 1990, but the three hours it took to film probably took place in 1989) it's up to the boy who cried green to save the day. Thankfully, he's got the most useless ghost since Ghost Dad to at least attempt to help him.I might write an addendum to this review following my viewing of Best Worst Movie because I'm curious to learn a little more about what they were thinking. For example, not five minutes in is the stereotypical homophobic remark but later on, the same guy, Elliott (Wright) had his arm wrapped around his "buddy" in bed with no clothes on. Also, why they thought they had to steal the "not-so" brand name of the original Troll in order to sell this.If you get a chance, like I did, watch this movie a second time using the Rifftrax commentary. I was rolling in laughter with what they came up with. That is, if you can tolerate one of the worst movies ever made a second time. (And yeah, you can. It's call alcohol, or the "drug" of your choice.)
(Spoiler Alert: a few key elements below.) Well, it could've been worse: ATM might have stood for Another Terrible Moviealthough that's not too far off.Firstly, you gotta like low-budget, TRAPPED movies in which characters who will inevitably fight amongst themselves find out they're up against a no-win situation when fill in the blank controls their exit. This "BLANK" could be a shark, hungry wolves, a killer, zombies or even dirt.Secondly, you'll have to suspend your disbelief quite a bit for this to work when you're watching it. With unknown motives, a hooded male kinda, sorta keeps our "heroes" at bay within a standalone ATM center. Oh, no, where's George Zimmerman to the rescue?Thirdly, try and get past a rather awkward "romantic" buildup as a fairly decent buildup gets us involved in the three young and extremely attractive youths find their way in a path of some out-of-nowhere and unexplained scheme.I think I've pretty much summed the "plot" up so far, but further: three younglings, for various reasons, find themselves in an ATM stand and an oh-so-mysterious man stalks them like a wolf outside.OK, here's the problem. (And I use "the" very lightly.) Supposedly he can't get in because you need an ATM card for access. Apparently he had this rouse set up with great detail, as they exhibit, but it never crossed his mind to have a backup card? It IS New York City  the city that never sleeps, right?  so, he had to account for wanderers, no?I might be looking too deep, such as when a man that appears and dies but then disappears or why the killer with "eyes everywhere" somehow missed that man, or why they didn't tap the alarm sooner or why NOT one had a cell phone with them or why the "man" is brutal with some but not allEh. It wasn't 100% a waste. It had its moments, including a nice ending and it was helped by the cute cast, even the girl, a young Ali Larter, which is sad I have to use the word "young" now in front of her name.
Oh, I'm sure it was cold; the main character of Winter's Bone kept putting on a knitted hat. But don't expect the snow from Fargo, The Shinning or even, my personal choice of the four mentioned: A Simple Plan.This is unusual, I have to immediately digress for getting off subject in paragraph one. Anyhoo, this movie was very, very good and one I yearn for throughout the year: a well-written yarn of suspense and character-driven heroes.And along side that, put on your own thinking cap, whether knitted or knot. You'll have sixteen dozen (okay, maybe just sixteen) characters to keep up with. That said, they certainly know how to keep a movie realistic for the town/lifestyle these people live.Young 17-year-old Ree (Jennifer Lawrence in an EXCELLENT performance) must take care of her two much younger siblings and her spaced mother with barely pennies to their name. They're making it work though, through school, the winter and helpful neighbors with meat and bread to spare.Unfortunately, what's holding them up is just that: a house that the children's idiot father put up for bail once he got caught  again  for making drugs. He's skipped out and it's up to the heroine and enormously tough (on the inside) Ree to locate him for court in order to save the one thing that's saving everyone: the house. See? Full-circle.Ree must go from point A-to-B-to-hillbilly to find him and no one either wants to help or wants her around.I'm guessing this is supposed to be some big mystery because no one's a'talking'. Chances are, that's what happens in the backwoods world they live in. And that's fine. I accept that. But the payoff's on the whereabouts of said dead-beat-daddy isn't an enormous shocker.Perhaps that's just what keeps the movie real, genuine and a well-written tale of courage and hope.Okay. Positives. The performances all around are great and thoroughly believable, but, again, Lawrence's is EXCELLENT. I hope to see more of her. The cinematography, despite the lack of snow, was wonderful. And the score very nicely done.The fault of the movie, for me, at least, was as real as they were trying to keep it, they overshot it by a mile. I had more trouble keeping up with who's who, where they were located, why they were mad, or who would be mad or who would want to help, that I felt strongly that I just watched an entire season of a TV drama, à la Twin Peaks.One movie this reminded me of, though not the content  just the feel and similar drive, and I felt had a higher impact on me, was Frozen River. Though I gave the same rating (4/5 stars), I'd much rather watch that again, than invest in the puzzle of characters in Winter's Bone.Nevertheless, it's worthy of a viewing. Best picture from the Oscars? No and neither will she win the best actress award  although, any other year that Portman or Bening aren't nominated, she might have. See it, at very least, for Lawrence. She will win you overthe next 100 minutes from the beginning.
It's a rarity that a sequel actually outshines its predecessor. Yes, James Cameron was allowed a budget for 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' due to his own success, as well as the cult following part one had. But, he didn't stop at simple special effects. He took his original, interesting and origin story and blasted it in fast forward, excellently. Hamilton apparently refused to return unless her character expanded, and it did, tenfold. Schwarzenegger was given more lines, most hilarious, and a lot more in depth was his cyborg. Also, was the addition of excellent acting of Morton, Patrick and soon-to-be notorious Furlong, a full-length story of his own origins. Not only was 'T2' a perfect summer movie, not only did it surpass the original, it is absolutely one of the best action movies of all time. And, like part 1, it's mostly about the story and acting. I cringe at most so-called "action" movies of today (SEE: 'Transformers' 1 & 2. Sure there's FX to spare, but where's the story? Where's the acting?) This movie, a continuation of part one with Sarah, now the mother of the future resistance leader John, protecting him (or is he protecting her?) while a new duo of terminators sent back in time to protect and/or destroy. They up'd the ante for action, dialogue, comedy, score, suspense, heart with special and original effects  this one set the "liquid metal" stage. I can go on and on, but seriously, this is what real big budgeted movies should model themselves after. First, get a great and original story. Then hire accomplished actors who can, yes, act. Next, employ real FX-experts. How hard of a code is that? I truly believe parts 1 and 2 are a complete story. It should've ended here.Side Note and Spoiler: Though I loved the deleted and reinserted closing with Grandma Conner and Senator Conner playing in a no-war zone decades later, it was the most unrealistic aspect. For, how could those two ever expect not only to make it out of the events of 'T2,' despite the humanitarian efforts, without being completely hunted or on the FBI's most wanted list? We must of missed the President's pardoning and the American's forgiveness for John to become a Senator. Only in Hollywood.
So, after 28 years, Barb "Don't Call Her Babe" Wire references the exceedingly better movie, Batman. I guess I can't complain; The Matrix references Superman after 100 years.Don't hate me  I didn't hate this movie. Oh, yeah it wasn't good or great, but it wasn't terrible. I actually liked seeing the sassy Pamela Lee Anderson (PLA) in leather and her kick butting ways.I acknowledged right away: this is a leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature, so I let loose. And if you do, PLA is kinda fun and sexy. (And that's coming from a gay male.)So, what we have here is Post-Civil War II and a mercenary-for-hire but only to keep her night club afloat. Her past(s) get in the way and she truly must decide what side she doesn't want to be on.Yeah. I watched this as part of my mission of movies to see from the How Did This Get Made podcast list. Otherwise, I wouldn't have ever seen it. Did I hate it? Again, no. It was fun 1990s garb never to be taken seriously.For some reason  again from a gay guy  I found her sexy and ridged enough to like and care about her making it alive to the end. While not the best 1990s action film, I would actually still, unbelievably, recommend it!* * * Final thoughts: I try to do no research before I see a movie  I love to go in fresh and cold. I knew of this movie years (almost decades) ago, but never gave it a second thought until it popped up on my How Did This Get Made podcast list. OK, I knew it existed, was on the HDTGM list and it starred the voluptuous PLA, but what I wouldn't learn until following my viewing was thatthis was a retelling of Casablanca??? Wow. I guess so. I already knew the story wasn't anything new, but to put this anywhere near Casablanca is just...crazy talk. Just leave your brain at the door and watch this fun little movie.Oh, and I almost forgot. This movie sparked my quote of the day at my employment: "How can you get Pamela Lee Anderson and Anna Nicole Smith confused?" asked a coworker after I did just that."How can you NOT get the two confused? Sorry, I meant four," I responded.
During the screening of John Carter, the guy to my right kept laughing when the movie was supposed to be intentionally funny. I only laughed when the movie was unintentionally funny. Needless to say, I laughed a lot more.That's not to say I had a good time. I certainly didn't. I was more concerned with which plot we were on to even attempt to keep up with the so-called "fun." This isn't even a "leave-your-brain-at-the-door" feature because you'll sure to need one to even attempt to keep up with the 150 ideas presented from beginning to end.You see, if a friend were to ask me what this film was about, it would be incredibly hard to pinpoint it. This would probably be my response, following the recommendation of seeing any other film: "Well, it's about a marriage, a warring traveling city, babies who are both hatched and killed, shift-changers, two deserts  one here and one out there, the old frontier, the new frontier, the old west with a bit of the old New York, an inheritance, an arena fight, a parentless race, a waterless place, a lost and found soul, one giant and continuous leap for one kind of man, immortals, redemption, love, hate, deceit, and so on and so onI guess to sum it up: take all six episodes of Star Wars, throw in both The Wizard of OZ and Gladiator with a splash of The Matrix and mix with Avatar, narrow them ALL down to one film and show each sub-film/genre simultaneously, and you'll have John Carter."As you can tell, the movie's all over the place, and if that weren't bad enough, 90% of the dialogue is the odd names chosen over a hundred years ago for Mars-Lingo. So, try and follow who's who, when every other name sounds un-coincidentally like "Jed-I" and the alien voices sound even less surprisingly like Jabba the Hut. Try your best to decipher who hates who, why they do and which race we're supposed to root for. And see if you can tell the difference between the desert planet of Mars and Arizona. (In AZ's defense, and I'm not normally on this 100-year-old state's side, I would live here over Mars  there is NO WAY I would ever visit the barron lands of Mars, if given the chance. In the great words of C-3PO  who all-but showed up here: "What a desolate place this is.")In addition to the over-confusion of plot and themes, there's not much more going for it: the score sucked back, the acting: eh, the costumes were god-awful and unimaginative, the cinematography was terrible, the clichés rampant, the dialogue boring and old, the themes stale and below all else, the $250 million spent to make this will turn Disney over in his grave. Instead of the obvious comparisons to "WaterWorld" it should've been called "DesertWorld."I've been told this was from a 100-year-old idea/book (well, duh) and others, namely George Lucas, borrowed from this for their stories previously referenced in this review. Fine, but that doesn't mean going back to the original material and making it into a feature length film is a good idea. Or fresh. Because it was neither. It was an over-long two-hour bloated and boring experience that I hope not to wish upon anyone. Heck, even when there's supposed to be a moral, the plot switches gears again and you can't even grasp onto the "good feeling" you knew was there in one of the original re-writes.This movie was pathetic and even the sometimes good special effects does not equate a recommendation. In fact, I cannot come up with ONE valid reason to see this. Even if you were a fan of Sci-Fi-Action-Out-of-World films, the "fight/battle" scenes were random and never pinpointed on who we were supposed to root for, if any. Stay away from Mars, and visit Arizona instead.Make that: Visit AZ between December and February, you know, when the weather's decent.
Without trying to give anything away and beyond the grand scale and excellent cinematography, Oblivion survives and thrives on greattwists.Admittedly, I did want to see this in theatres  yes: I am a die-hard Tom Cruise fan, but I missed it on the big screen. I did think the trailers gave away too much, but that didn't detour me from seeing it. I just got lazy. At any rate, I was wrong.The sneak previews for Oblivion only made me think of a live-action version of Pixar's Wall-E. While, it does begin that way  sorta  and the cinematography in both films is brilliant, fresh and gorgeous, the based-on-a-graphic-novel-idea Oblivion turns into a very nicely written story of "I didn't see that coming!" twists.Jack & Victoria are put on a mostly-destroyed Earth of the future to help harvest needed supplies after a tremendous alien war in which humans "won," but now have to reside on a far distant moon. Machines assist, but it's really up to the duo to ensure success. OnlyJack's developing "unnecessary emotions" that might disrupt his mission. This leads to that, that leads to discovery and mystery and finally totrue love?Trust me: I haven't given anything (of significance) away. The joy in this movie, again, besides the crisp scenery, is what you'll learn along the way.Now, with all this praise I've given this sci-fi, futuristic yarn, it's not without its problems.At times, it has M. Night Shyamalan (The Happening) and Nicholas Winding Refn's (Only God Forgives) sense of SLOWED DOWN for SUPPOSED SUSPENSE scenes. Yes, I do have a problem with characters slowly walking across the room that somehow translates into tension. I don't buy it and it just drags out scenes. Also, while I am a fan (as stated) of Cruise and the Mission: Impossible series, it was not refreshing to see Cruise reprise his yelling role from the first and weakest entry of that action series. Finally, the movie really produced no real characters I found that broke any mold. While all actors played their part the best they could, none stood out or made me take notice.Thoroughly, beyond my last criticisms, I did have a good time and I look forward to seeing it again. It did have a good portion of action and beautiful scenes. But, most of all, I love how the story played out in the last act.And that moon! What an awesome, albeit terrifying sight! Be kind to our moon, people: Walk on it all you want, but leave it be!
I have been told it's not proper and even below this industry to call a movie "stupid" in one's review. But, damn, I will unapologetically call most of the scenes in Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter just plain stupid.Granted, I am NOT a fan of CGI, or overused Matrix tricks without explanation. (I mean, reallywasn't the original Matrix almost 14 years ago?) In this mesh of realities, which I gave kudos to for being original in idea only, some of the axe-wielding scenes, especially involving horses, were so insanely comical and cartoonish, it was hard to even like this a little bit. It also didn't help having an incredibly bland Benjamin Walker play Mr. Lincoln. (Oh, and before you speak, I hadn't seen Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of the 16th President up to this point yet. So, I hadn't a recent version of Lincoln to compare this performance to.)Walker was so bad, so boring, that when scenes weren't dripping with terrible dime store fake blood, he made the rest of the movie almost completely unbearable. Mercifully, when on screen, which wasn't that much, Dominic Cooper's Henry Sturges character, friend and mentor of Dishonest Abe, made up for some of the life that was sucked out by Walker.(I'm going to love this one) When a vampire movie mimics the Twilight series, it's already headed towards trouble. Here, like that kiddie series that happily concluded last year, vampires can walk in sunshine. Apparently, they just taught themselves that talent. Abe's mommy is killed by one vamp and as in 100s of movie plots, he wanders with rage until directed to fight back by pal Henry. This includes, but isn't limited to, cutting down an entire tree with one stroke because one can imagine it as an enemy. Hmmm.Eventually, Abe's conflicted with hunting vampires, killing the one who destroyed his mom, true love and I guess incidentally, being the President of the United States.Obviously, the movie's not to be taken seriously, but c'mon. This movie was so poorly made, so bad, that even when a decent character or scene shows up, enough unforgivable stuff is still in your mind to dismiss the positive. Skip it and see the real-deal Lincoln movie of the year: Lincoln.
I wish I had written my thoughts down following my first (and only) viewing of this film, Demons, because, since it's been over a month since I saw it, I've forgotten nearly everything about it. And in my defense, and the movie's demise, that's not a good thing.Granted, I do remember the FX or gore have you, it had decent visuals, especially for low-budget and being from 1985. But, the same ole story, even for the mid-80s, brought it back to its B-movie fare.Trapped survivors in a movie house in West Berlin must battle contagious demons and themselves to make through the night. Meanwhile, 17 other subplots invade the screen, theatre and outside. While that's an exaggeration, I'm not too far off from all that was going on in this film.It is for extreme low-budget, B-movie, 1980s, bad acting, worse dubbing fans only. No one interested in ALL of those qualities should just skip.* * * Final thoughts: A friend of mine on the Facebook has been slowly getting me interested in seeing these low budget, horror indies from overseas, such as this, Suspiria and Phenomena (aka Creepers.) Unfortunately for me, three times is not a charm and I feel I've given these movies enough chances to win me over. I think I'll still to the good ole U.S. of A. and for better than B-Movie statuses.
If not for The Evil Dead (1981), The Cabin in the Woods wouldn't have a spot on the GPS. Or, dozens of other movies, for that matter.I understand this is a cult hit, for many, many years. While I never was a huge fan in fact, it took me a LONG while to finally see this (my first viewing was probably in the late 1990s,) I still appreciated its upbringing. Seeing it today, in 2013, I think I appreciate it even more.The movie is pure craziness. It contains no sense of realism, the characters act like they know they're in a B-Movie and the "joke's on them." And the special effects, while fantastic for the budget they had, didn't always hold up today. Lightning from Plan 9 from Outer Space-type movies, anyone?We have three girls and two boys headed towards a secluded cabin in deep woods when all hell breaks loose following a playing of a tape-recording of words from the Book of the Dead. From those words spoken, or replayed, craziness ensures, such as possession, Exorcistrees and, ah-hem, a wooden rape scene. Man, the dead play back.Despite the maximum level of insane carnage, there is so much to appreciate here, from both an independent film lover and all horror connoisseurs. The cinematography was actually very well done  you can tell this young film maker/unknown at the time: Sam Raimi, had a future. The special effects and gore, in spite of the low budget, was beyond what it could've been. Like Raimi, you can tell these people knew what they were doing, even with the dollars they had to spend. And the cast gave it their all, with what they were given and the direction from a newbie, albeit someone who knew what he was doing.That all said, in regards to the cast, unfortunately, as good as Bruce Campbell was, he will eventually, following this, of course, have even better charisma and show much more of his eventual talent. He just wasn't as developed here, as I would've liked to see of him.And, the movie isn't perfect, and some of the scenes, ideas don't add up, such as a small Doctor Who'ish cabin that seems to have more rooms than the White House. But, if you just let yourself go, and remind yourself of the timeframe and budget, you can have a good time. And best of all, (SPOILER  sorry, but it has been 32 years, for the love of the dead) it was refreshing to have a male hero at the end of a horror tale. As much as I loved Halloween, or the numerous horror franchise films to follow, such as A Nightmare on Elm Street, the heroine is always the take-down-the-villain character. For once, it's nice to have it be a male.At any rate, it is recommended for horror and low-budget 1980s fare fans out there.Side Note: I have listened to very few audio commentaries in my lifetime, to my dismay. But, one of the all-time favorites of mine, and most hilarious, was one of the 150 DVDs re-releases of The Evil Dead and it was a solo-Bruce Campbell commentary. I cannot state which DVD it is on, but I was laughing so hard with his words on it. It was one of those: Press play on the commentary, and if it picks up, continue. Well, it did "pick up" on minute 5 and Bruce never let up. He was absolutely uproarious. Not to miss his, if given the chance.
I was a kid myself (well not as young as 6-year-old Andy in the film) when I first saw 'Child's Play,' and I absolutely loved it then. Not too gory, a whole bunch of scenes that made me jump and enough action/explosions you wouldn't expect in a low-grade horror movie about a killer doll. Strangely, this is a movie that gets creepier the more times you watch it, or experience any of the sequels. Reason: the way the mother, friend or anyone handles what a demonic doll this "Chucky" will become. It's like not knowing who Jason Voorhees will be and smacking him around as a kid. The movie revolves around a dying, fleeing criminal who transports his soul into a "Good Guy" doll, seeks revenge while as a 2-foot demon-doll and terrorizes a family. The voice of Chucky (whether good or bad) was pitch-perfect, most scenes of shock were hilarious, either intentionally or not, and the suspense was tight, despite the grand number of plot holes, inconsistencies and normal horror clichés. I will tell you the scene that turned the movie around for me and made me jump as teenager, was the batteries. When they fell out, I jumped a mile. (Okay, I did back then.) Also, I was a huge TV 'Hulk' fan and it was great to see "McGee" (Colvin) again, albeit a few minutes. And finally, I always loved the "toys-coming-to-life" and terrorizing stories growing up. I think they did a splendid job with acting (the kid really wasn't that bad) and mother (Hicks) was believable and fun to watch. They also didn't spend barely an ounce on background or how this magic of soul-hopping happens. They didn't need to. They needed to get to another future horror-icon fast, and they did. Well-done.
In an agethe late 1990s and early 2000sof the horror revamp (thanks, Scream) comes one of the most clever and original horror/slashers to date: Final Destination. In fact, it was so smart, it was a slasher without a slasher and the main enemy/culprit that you won't see.Nowadays, the character of "Death" has been mocked pretty heavily, thanks mostly to Family Guy, but here, it's not so nice. Sly, but fair. Invisible, but present.A high school class is headed for 10 days to Paris, only "nobody" Alex (Sawa) has a pretty descript vision of their plane not making it a few hundred yards, let alone across the world. Awaking, and he really does, his outburst causes some of his peers and one teacher to deplane only to watch his premonition come true before their eyes. And, the FBI gets involved, thinking Alex has something to do with the explosion.Picture it: the year was 2000. The date of release: 3/17/00. Just think if this movie would've been delayed another year and a half. Or even then, if it would be released at all.Anyhoo, each of the survivors are naturally freaked, and when they "mysteriously" die one by one, Alex relies on his newly found intuition to solve the reasons of the deaths while heavily relying on Clear Rivers (Larter)  love that name, by the way  and Bludworth (Tony Todd of Candyman fame the perfect choice for the undertaker.)Apparently, there's a pattern, a new one, that is, since Alex stepped in Death's way. Is that a role you'd like to take? Or would you be able to double dip in saving the survivor's lives?The movie, though a little hokey at times, is nearly brilliant for what it is. I remember shouting out, when it first came out, "FINALLY," an intelligent horror movie. A thinker. And with a great cast. I would soon grow to love (yeah, I mean LOVE) Ali Larter, although the rest of the cast did what they needed to accomplish. Even Seann "Stifler" William Scott down played his typical over-the-top performance  but not by too much.The movie was equally shot well, had well-thought out "death-by-accident" scenes and a good soundtrack/score. It's not too deep, but its fun and quick and tight  what all horror movies should be. Also, it was refreshing to see that the absence of sex, nudity and excessive amount of gore can still drive/sell a "teen" horror movie.Highly recommended, if you haven't already partaken in Death's plan.
I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a "return to greatness" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: "Chucky Gets Lucky." So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky. And as much as I liked her in the feature, she can't get all the credit: the props (watch the first 1-2 minutes for horror-homages), the writing, the inside jokes (again, the opening + Pinhead) and Chucky lines were great ("In fact, if (this) were a movie, it would take 3-4 sequels just to do it justice," among others.) Mercifully, Chucky and the series has given up on Andy the "Hide the Soul" quest, and just settled for a new way out of his body. He teams up with his ex (Tilly) whom he transfers into a "Bride" doll and a couple of Bonnie & Clyde teens (Really, Heigl?) to regain this pendant buried with Chucky's human corpse. This is for any Chucky fan, 1980s slasher-horror fans or even to those who's never seen any of the previous 'Child's Play' films. It's funny, dark, harmless, gory  but not over the top and despite Tilly's literal 20 minutes of screen time, it's always great to see her. After all, you barely see her play poker anymore. (Side note: of course, I picked up on the Superman reference  Hackensack, NJ.)
In the far distant past and during the post-gasolypse where men, women and grunting children fight their right to fuel, comes a man with a sorta past, a band of unshowered rebels fighting even dirtier fuelites bent on causing confusion and a paradise just beyond the sandy horizonThe Road Warrior kinda, almost continues the story of an ex-cop in a crumbling future. Before, it was about control which falls apart once supercop and absolutely mild-mannered Max loses his family to unruly bikers. Now, he's just a wanderer attempting to fuel his vehicle so he can continue to roam and eat the dog food which should go to his, um, dog.The movie begins with the worst of all stock footage scenes outside the MST3k world and explains WAR has come to this planet overgas. At any rate, Maxie Boy adapted and gets caught up in a feud from more rebels attempting to infiltrate another group of survivors and their long-term goal of a coastal getaway.And speaking of their mission: in one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes, they state their goal is to leave the harsh, desolate and shade-less desert and go to paradise because there's plenty ofsunshine?Actually, I digress. This movie was oodles better than the first GRINDHOUSE mess of a Bmovie. It had direction, a far less domineering and better score, a minute amount of heart and character and one of the most ruthless, brutal and most importantly, honest climaxes I've seen. Meaning, people die when our heroes venture from their middle-of-nowhere sanctuary to get to the Northern-Most Paradise and you'll never guess who lives or dies. Okay, maybe one or two characters, but the rest were relentlessly slaughtered and it's a shocker. Sad, but refreshing from the goody-two-shoes normality of cinema in general.Question: When will Max ever get mad? In #1 he's fairly mild to the point of extremely calm. And yes, we know Mel can get mad, vicious, eventhough that's actually in the far distant future. Here, he might portray a semi-crazy individual for his road warrior'ing skills, but other than that use of the word "mad," I still have yet to see a "MAD" side of this character. Perhaps further in Thunderdome? I can see where they felt the first was an iconic, albeit so-bad-its-enjoyable feature whereas a lot of the same qualities carried over. Such as: CRAZY side characters, both good and bad, a lot of desert and lone road scenes and, of course, the gayness lives on, including a whole bunch of pink. The first movie had plenty of homoerotism, and part 2 carried on that tradition. Assless chaps on a guy who's in love with (and yes, they say that) another male and they ride very close on a motorcycle together with the assless chaps touching the other chap. Also, apparently, in the future, bondage including whips, chains, masks and male-on-male control is wildly accepted.Beyond the Valley of the Semi-Gays, lives a surprisingly, yet, partially enjoyable throwback to the early eighties. If you love those movies, where they put very little thought into the script  such as, Gas = Gold in this future, but everyone finds it satisfying to waste a bunch of it while doing donuts on motorcycles  you'll probably like this. But be warned: if you're a Gibson fan, such as I STILL AM, these first two films really don't define him as an actor or person. The mere nickname the character has, MAD MAX, should indicate a loony or angry individual, of which, he's neither  even when he's beaten down.
Just a quick note on Steven Spielberg's Masterpiece Jaws: Everything works. Yes, the whole background story on the movie came out years ago, their mechanical shark kept sinking, etc, but as for the final product: (let me repeat) everything worked. Score, acting, dialogue, suspense, realism, plot development, urgency, you name it. I have read the book, and of course there were changes  anyone yet comment on the missing love affair between Brody's wife and Hooper?  but, all novels change from page to screen. What Spielberg did was amazing. He didn't create a horror movie. Nor a shark movie. It was a movie concerning a small town 100% reliant on tourism and if anything goes against that, whether economy, weather, bad publicity or in this case, shark attacks, the town could go under. I never labeled this movie as a horror or monster movie. To me, it was an adventure and a suspense movie reliant on one man, an outsider, to battle something that will destroy both the local economy but also the islanders themselves. You get rich history and depth from the Mayor, Ellen Brody, Hooper, (especially) Quint and of course, Chief Brody. Heck, the whole town's inhabitants are rich in character. Honestly, skip the sequels. As a kid, I loved Jaws 2, but as an adult, watching all 4 (so far) films, only the original Jaws was worth watching.
1. Tornados are no match forhelicopters.2. Blaming the government for storms as a conspiracy theory sounds more FOX NEWS than SyFy.3. And, according to the news, the eye of the hurricane does the most damage. Oh, this really must be FOX NEWS.4. A day at the beach can be night, day, night, daydepending upon which shot you're in.5. When sharks are out of water, their first instinct isn't survival. It's eating.6. Welcome to L.A. It can be sunny, stormy, hurricany or tornadoy every othersecond.7. All regulars and actors at the end of fake bars are named "George."8. Superman once turned a tornado upside down to savecoffee. Why didn't he just make an amateur bomb to "equalize" the cold and warm air? Duh.9. Never fear sharks again: electric hedge trimmers are somehow effective.10. Cops on your tail? Don't worry; all you're seeing is stock footage from another street and time. You're good.11. Lines like "Don't you ever make fun of my stool again!" are only funny because someone actually had to have commented on his poop previously.12. Calling a movie named "Sharknado" bad is complimentary. Calling it "so-good-it's-bad," is just plain wrong.13. A lot of houses are underwater. Some are just in-water.14. News of a hurricane, multiple tornados and raining sharks never scares seniors out of a pool.15. Telling your whining daughter that you came to get her first over her brother, sounds nice, until you remember you thought your son was on the opposite coast during the rescue.16. Sharks sprinkled all over L.A.? Oh, how original.17. Tornados, which naturally follow hurricanes, cause zero damage in major cities. Smile wide, insurance companies.18. Movie sharks must hate helicopters; as in Jaws II, they're always pulling them down.19. Any newscaster that begins with: "This is Johnni Waves. That's Johnni with an 'I'" does deserve to be eaten.20. Movie prop cars really do come with turboand can be used twice!21. Twenty plus rescued kids should only be transported in one ambulance.22. Sharks aren't as concerned with getting back into water as they are to effortlessly clinging to the top of a moving vehicle while easily chomping through metal.23. Store clerks that work at establishments named 'Liquor' know everything.24. When considering using way too much energy to pull that clichéd "moved to L.A. to become an actor" fat guy up onto a bridge, remember he is, in fact, the clichéd next target. Drop him.25. Going head first into a shark's mouth with a running chainsaw, the same animal that swallowed your girlfriend alive, probably isn't the best method to rescue her26. but critiquing an obvious 'intentionally bad' flick is just as appalling as said action. Just too bad it wasn't fun-bad.
Probably one of the best qualities (not only, God no) I find in movies is honesty. It does not matter the genre or sub-genre: spoof, action, buddy-comedy, rom-com or in Ninja Assassin's case, ninja movies. If a movie is true to itself and its audience, I respect it. One should not make a movie called Ninja Assassin and expect either a wide range of movie-goers or Oscars. It's made specifically for those interested in, well ninja assassins.And boy, they weren't lying. This was an ultimate ninja movie. Hardly original (SEE: Below,) extremely bloody, gory, yet oh-so-much fun.Raizo (Rain) is the top ninja at some secluded ninja academy where kids are kidnapped young, called "son" and "daughter" of the master and turned into, you guessed it, ninja assassins. Only Raizo gets seduced by love (SEE: the Jed-I academy) and when his one human contact with a rebellious young "daughter" with a heart gets a sword through that same organ, things begin to change within Raizo.Given the opportunity to kill another "disobedient" young girl, he snaps and escapes nearly dead (SEE: The Bourne Ultimatum.) Present Day: On-the-run Raizo protects Mika (Harris) while she's targeted for assassin due her investigation on the "gangs" of ninjas. His previous feeling emerge once again stating she, too, has a good heart. The rest of the movie plays out like too many movies to list, but Raizo, Mika and the entire police/SWAT battle the Ninjas. (Ok, for the finale, SEE: X-Men: The Last Stand.) I've left out a lot, so that not to give away too much. But, I will say the movie starts off with a bang, rarely lets up  action and blood galore and despite the clichés and multiple movie reference, it was a joy to watch this strictly made for entertainment, action and ninja action film. This also stems, again, from the movie never swaying from what it was meant to be in the first place. I can't imagine this movie would get a wide variety of viewers or huge box-office. But it should impress those with an urge to see light-entertainment with zero depth. Don't think too much and you'll probably find yourself wrapped up in their world.In addition to the movie's sincerity to its genre and me getting enthralled into the world of the secret ninja assassins, I loved the blending to old-world Ninja lore and the modern world. Instead of watching a movie like Jet Li's Hero, there's more than a few scenes I loved watching with Ninja Vs. Gun-toting Cops, Ninja Vs. Car and full-on Ninjas Vs. SWAT team with modern warfare. (Also, I loved the traffic/street fight scene.) The bad: it mimics hundreds of movies in a mere 99 minutes, contains far too many flashbacks, the blood is mostly CGI  that was distracting, looked horribly fake and mostly humorous, and they never, ever proved to me that Raizo was the #1 assassin. I mean, I truly believed The Bride was the best of the martial art-trained assassins in Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2 (thanks to Tarantino) and that Bruce Wayne was the best of the martial art-warriors in Batman Begins (thanks to Nolan.) I'm guessing we're simply supposed to take their word for it, but it was never really shown until only he can take on 50 guys at one time and survive, albeit enormously cut up. Finally, I understand their culture (or at least the one portrayed in the movie) but the severe attacks and abuse of the children was disturbing, to say the least.Seriously, would anyone go to see Ninja Assassin in the theatre or rent on DVD without the slightest clue of what to expect? Anyone expects anything different than the title itself or the poster is probably the same person disappointed when they saw Titanic and was upset it took place on a boat.I say, see it, only if you're into this sort of thing. It's not for kids  for the love of Pete, it's extremely gory and bloody.Side Note: Happy, Mondo? (I usually don't name names in my reviews, but this guy has bugged from before the movie opened to weeks after to see this. Every day. EVERY day. Not because he would ever see it or enjoy it, but he knows I typically find these types of movies "silly" and thought it would be a riot to poke fun at me. I guess this time, I surprised even myself.)
"This film is inspired by a true story" doesn't work on me. I'm certain there's a group of movie-goers who yearn for it, live by it and demand it, but when those words appear in the opening bit of a supposedly "factual account" I cringe. Squirm, even.For I've seen far too many "from a/inspired by/based on" true stories, namely the always faithful underdog football team and/or player that hasabsolutelynochanceatwhoa!...they/hewon! I mean, come on. Every single time it pans out the same way with the same drama in between? The same overbearing father, the singled out but lovable heavy kid, the book-wormed girl who will end up with, yep, you guessed it.RARELY will these types of movies surprise me  heck, doesn't the team ever lose in the finale, but still learn the lesson?  and the latest entry, though off the field and under it, Sanctum held very few surprises.Sure, it was suspenseful at time, I'll admit. The scenery was gorgeous, including the underwater fare. But besides those qualities and the promising opening, the movie headed fast and furious downward, deep into the cave as the movie progressed.I can see the writers sitting around the table chatting up this idea of a film: "Okay, there was a time some people got trapped in a cave  I'm not sure when, but I think I read it somewhere. So, let's build on that.""Hey, boss! I have an idea: let's just track down those survivors, if any, and after interviewing them, we'll really make this a true story!" said the intern."You're fired. The audience wants twists, turns, clichéd characters, corny dialogue, predictable finales, imminent danger every few minutes, characters that never, ever listen to the hero, and most of all a nemesis that wants to kill our hero! They want it predictable, familiar, easy to follow and something they've seen a hundred times before!""But" pleaded the now unemployed intern, "what if none of that happened? I mean, what if they just got stuck, food low, batteries dying and they just worked as a team to get out or even focus on the rescuers/heroes. Would there really be a need for an enemy?""Get out. We don't care if it's true. We're simply trying to profit off of someone else's tragedy. Is that so wrong?"Sadly, I'm not off on that at all. But, what I'm most glad about, is the writers avoided throwing in the inevitable monster or alien in the mix to spruce it up a bit. It's only "INSPIRED" by a true story, so a lot of it can be (and was) fake.Thee number one explorer in the galaxy, Frank (Richard Roxburgh) is trying to journey to the final frontier, but is having nasty problems with his son, Josh (Rhys Wakefield) whom he chose third over caves and Josh's mother. Poor Josh doesn't like exploring but does it to bond with his dadEh, the real story here is people get trapped in an enormous cave that's filling rapidly by both rainwater and hotheaded and inexperienced climbers and divers. They need to get from point A to B and here's where the writers come in nicely: they add every tension and melodramatic scene that could possibly happen. Perhaps this is like the so-called true accounts of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, whereas three plus stories came together to make theirs more interesting.As always, I'm coming off too harsh. In reality, this is basically a harmless B-movie with a budget adventure and an absolute leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature. Once I learned this movie cannot possibly be taken seriously, I did relax a bit and had a little fun while allowing the suspense get to me and I even enjoyed all the beautiful cinematography. It was well shot, after all.And then the "made-for-TV" climax hitmy jaw dropped and I would have further welcomed an alien to pop up out of nowhere to eat the remaining survivors.It's recommended for those who have never seen a "Trapped-Survivors" movie or one based on somewhat-true events. And speaking of which, why can't they ever be honest? Even though it's quicker just to say: "Inspired by True Events" than"The movie you're about to see comes from an idea we got from some newspaper and thought it would work as a motion picture. We know you like entertainment, so please excuse the deletion of factual data, real life people and any sense of plausibility. The characters, setting and events portrayed in this movie have been fabricated to make back our money. Oh, and we did it in 3-D to turn a profit. Enjoy and don't try this at home, or we'll sue you. Thank you."
When I was growing up  more specifically: coming out, I saw a ton of films based on/around AIDS. It didn't help that I came out during the unfortunate AIDS boom of the early to late 1990s.I was indeed sad because I didn't have many films or media to attach onto during these troubling times. But, mercifully, I did not ever acquire AIDS. If I had, that is, I wish God would've granted me the pleasure of meeting the real leads in this fantastic film.Dallas Buyers Club showed me a completely different and (wow) thinner side of Matthew McConaughey. He lost so much weight for this role  that's obvious, but his change in character from within, his depth, his tone and stance stood above all else in this movie.Naturally, you meet this person in the beginning of his journey, this Ron played by McConaughey, and you would hate him as much as I did. But, his mercifully and absolutely joyous transformation  even when infected  is breathtaking. This man, McConaughey, will earn his first Best Actor Oscar just as much as Heath Ledger did for The Dark Knight.Now, this is not to take away from Jared Leto's fantastic performance as Ron's "pal," Rayon, or the other great actors in this film. Everyone did their part, as did the movie. Original, bright, fresh, engaging and thoughtful, Dallas Buyers Club surprised me and kept me going.Incredibly straight (as he will mention many, many times) electrician and part-time rodeo rider, Ron, acquires AIDS from one of his many, many female partners. After a (long) bit of acceptance and defying the odds, he becomes one of the less sought out drug-for-good dealers for the AIDS community.There are no heroes here. No one to cling to while you watch. But, there are humans. Humans that do eventually make you want to become friends with and side with. Some you want to learn more about and do better with your own life.Soon into this wonderful feature, you will forget the lead is Matthew McConaughey and know this person as Ron. Someone who was an ass, someone who is dying and someone who comes back to right his wrongs.McConaugheyyou have my vote for Best Actor for the 2013 Oscars. You better damn get it. And the rest of youyou better damn see this movie.* * * Final thoughts: I feel bad for Jared Leto. He did excellent here and in any other movie, he would shine and erase anyone else off the screen in the viewer's memories. But, McConaughey was just that good, Leto, in all his fabulousness, will just have to wait for another picture to show how good he/she is.
They probably only waited 30 years to make this movie since it would probably have been too close to the superior Witchboard. But, still Ouija definitely belongs in the 1980s.Or, it's an homage. Because this movie, step by step, is a 1980s ghost story. Every "fright," twist or solution stemmed from countless movies before it. I will admit to oneONEtiny jump scare that I unwillingly participated in, but that was just one tiny shot out of the dozen failed attempts from the movie.Don't get me wrong; I didn't hate this movie. Sure, I wasn't scared in this "horror" story, or even involved in any of the characters, stories, subplots or even who lived or died. What I kinda did like was bringing back good memories of when I loved horror  between the 1970s and 1990s. Ever since then, I cannot name more than maybe five horror movies I truly liked. Lately, it's been 90% or more ghost stories, and I really cannot stand haunted movies.Yes, this is one, too, and yeah, I didn't really like this one much either. Man, I miss slasher movies, or even ones that dealt with physics. But, I'll get to that later.The enormously simple synopsis includes two lifelong BFFs who used to play on a Ouija board as kids, but only one of them broke the rules and played on her own later in life. Suddenly, one-by-one of the small group of friends and relatives are picked off. Sound familiar?All of this should. I am sincerely hoping they were going for homage to the classics of decades past and not simply ripping them all off 30 years too late. Because, if it's the latter, then, again, all of this should be familiar and that can lead to a boring movie since we've seen all of this before.But, heck, it's under an hour and a half, so at least it has that going for it. My recommendation is: If you believe this (in the first 15 minutes of watching it) as homage, carry on. If not, and you think they literally had no shame in stealing, stop and return to Redbox, or stop streaming it, or for the love of all that is living, stop watching it through that little glass circle!* * *Final thoughts: I really, really don't like ghost/haunted house stories. For the most part, they make me crack up; they seriously make me laugh out loud at their silliness. I seem to be in the minority as a ton of my friends and people I've met over my years actually believe in possession, spirits, pictures floating around the room with no explanation. Andthat's just it for me. I believe in physics, in real matter. If, what I see on screen isn't what I think could really happen in life, I am not just unafraid, but I think it's humorous. Especially since these ghost stories seem to just make up rules as they go along. I mean, if writing was that simple, I would totally make my love story's main character 45 minutes in suddenly have the ability to fly. Wouldn't that be cool if I could just throw whatever BS at the screen and people will buy it, or at least the people who believe the ghost- nonsense. I digress. I do love horror, and probably my favorite subgenre is the slasher. To name one horror icon I loved growing up was Jason Voorhees. Basically, and for the majority of his movies, he scared me. All I had to do was remove the "Return from the grave" opening and play along with the psycho killer in the woods theme. I could turn it in my head as "this could really happen" and I would be scared. Turning it back to this movie, Ouija, since I 100% do not believe in ghosts, there is nothing that would ever scare me in these dominating ghost stories as of late.And don't even get me started on the countless, exactly the same and completely hilarious "Based on True Events" ghost storiesThose are the absolute funniest.
Hey now. I thought I was the first person clever enough to put a 'T' after the first word in Las Vegas. (This is especially relevant when I leave the city a loser.)Last Vegas stars some of my all-time favorite actors. Michael Douglas has been a staple of my view pleasures for several decades. Morgan Freeman, too. Kevin Kline and Robert De Niro, I do like, but not a complete draw for me. And yet, the one I didn't count on to be my favorite of the movie: Mary Steenburgen.She was fantastic as Vegas lounge singer, Diana. She had charisma, charm, humor and a sexiness to her, despite the age and look she was portraying. So, she was a nice surprise and welcome in this very old tale of old men.Billy, Paddy, Archie and Sam have grown up and, yet, somewhat apart over the decades, but when wealthy Billy wants to get hitched in Las Vegas, the gang gets back together for a party of fantasy proportions.Yes, indeed, this movie is a fantasy, from beginning to end. Nothing real, barely original and it could never happen the way they showed it on screen. And yet... it was fun enough to get through to the end.The actors, especially (again) Steenburgen, have enough drive, humor and chemistry, it's a joy to watch them have a great time when their bedtimes should be hours earlier than when they stay up.There's enough learning, conning, humor, partying and revenge to be had for these lifelong friends and for less than two hours, it's worth journeying with them.* * * Final thoughts: Not at all original or groundbreaking, the project as a whole was worth it. But, for me, seeing Jerry "Turtle" Ferrara and Vegas on screen, it was worth an entire 'nother star.
Well, it's time to move out of Southern California for, in SEVEN years, it's gonna be one hell of a hellhole and not a single owl in existence!The gorgeously shot Blade Runner shows a future just shy of 37 years (at the time of release) that "might" have happened considering the technology progressions back then. But, in reality, maybe these "advancements" in technology everyone's so worried about isn't moving as fast as everyone fears. Hell, our hero, Rick Deckard, lives on the 97th floor in his apartment building  which isn't the top floor, and I do not believe there to be a building that size yet erected in L.A., let alone in the process now, in 2012, that would take probably more than 7 years. Oh and there are more buildings just like that one. And half-as-tall, fire breathing pipes!I digressthis was a fantastic movie, filled with unique characters, grand sets/designs, a fairly decent score, wonderful cinematography and deep characters  especially, but not limited to, Sean Young, who is NOT a favorite of mine, but probably did the best job of all actors in this movie. Sadly, I avoided watching this movie my whole live  its 30th Anniversary is in less than a month  because after two attempts, I "felt it was too slow and dark" and turned it off 15-20 minutes in.Well, that was my right, but I'm glad I acknowledged the fact it is, as it is, a slow burner, and that I could move forward to an extraordinary looking and good story.Ricky boy, better known to most as Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a "kind of" ex-cop, or Blade Runner, brought back into the line of duty  isn't every retired cop in movies?  to trace and find five rogue replicants (of humans) because they're outlawed on Earth in the far-distant future of 2019. Lucky for him, these angry robots don't really have any super-powers, aside from being immune to both hot and cold and they're sorta stronger and they're just as bright as humans are.Of course, the story takes turns, gets complicated and we learn a bunch along the way. And as mentioned, it's a deliberately paced film, so sit back and enjoy both the film noir story unfold and the fantastic shots, both aerial and in new/old buildings.As beautiful as the cinematography and crisp and original as the designs, sets, locations and ideas, sadly the monitors took me back a bit. I had to laugh a bit, because for all they came up with: the flying cars, the space colonies  oh, I forgot to mention that, they're pulling an Aliens before The Company did  and of course, the replicated humans, themselves, no way they could've made any of that using the computers/monitors displayed in the movie that probably heated up too much when PONG was played.YES  I know, that's not a flaw, in fact, that was all they had back then, well, those "state of the 1982 art" monitors and little patience on imagining what the future computer screens might look like. Heck, if my argument was valid, Director Scott's own Alien ship, the Nostromo, 3-years prior, may never have left the dock considering their monitors were even less sophisticated. So, I wouldn't downgrade the movie for that, I just thought it was funny.At its core, it's the grand tradition of detective stories, it's a 1940's private dick plot set in the future. For 99% of the graphics and ideas, this movie was far ahead of its time 30-years ago and is highly recommended for anyone who hasn't seen it.(SPOILER ALERT  do NOT read on without having seeing the movie) On a side note, I was a tad bit confused with the ending  and I'm not referring to the odd cat & mouse chase scene where our "villain" strips to his skivvies following him kissing a man on the lips in the segment prior. No, I mean, some idiot person I knew many moons ago spoiled the "secret" of who Deckard really was. Since the movie, itself, was left wide open for interpretation, I chose NOT believe my person's take, especially after my research following the film. The original author, Phillip K. Dick, did not make Deckard a replicant and therefore, despite all other theorist's ideas and blatant clues left by Director Scott throughout, I chose to believe Dick. (No Pun.)
Actors do this all the time; they take a 180 degree role to prove their depth and so that they don't get typecast. In this case, mostly Elijah Wood's known for being a Hobbit, but I already knew he had range before he signed up for 2012's Maniac remake.Now, I've seen the original, and it's sick, twisted, gory and very 1980s slash & dash horror. I wasn't that impressed, but not that sad I saw it. It was a throwaway and certainly not a classic. The idea of remaking it sounds odd since it wasn't, as stated, completely rememberable or remarkable.That said, much like the original, this one felt the same exact way. I probably won't remember much in a month or couple of years and it's not a movie I will want to watch again. And yet, I didn't hate on it.It had an interesting take on the POV-of-the-killer and for that, it was at least interesting. I am not a fan of that style, but I believe it worked here fairly well. And the other notable positives were: the acting was decent and the gore  damn, it was unbearably gory at times  was mostly up front and thankfully we didn't have to sit through too many more scalpings after the first couple.Frank (Wood) travels about the L.A. streets at night stalking victims (women,) and though he's got a whole Buffalo Bill thing going on, it's not completely defined. It's almost like he's an amateur to the killer of The Silence of the Lambs. He's very sloppy, too.Well, they don't really get into this, but damn, this boy might as well have left his business card wherever he stalks these women because any first year cadet on the police force should be able to track him in minutes. DNA, prints, evidence, electronic footprintsyou name it, he's telling the world he's the killer.Nevertheless, we're just to assume the LA Police Force are morons and sit back as he slices and dices his way through countless women until he becomes involved with a artist woman. Let's see how that pans out.It's horror, currently it's horror-movie month (October,) and it's not a bad viewing for horror buffs. Will it win anyone over? Should it have won any awards? Does it deserve another remake? No, no and no. But, again, you could do a lot worse with horror remakes.* * * Final thoughts: I said it before: DAMN, I'm glad they stopped with the scalping. I'm no prude, but that was over-the-top gruesome. I had to look away the two or so times it took place and mercifully, they didn't continue on with that soon into the movie. And because of his actions, we already knew his psycho fetish and I completely felt playing Q. Lazzarus's Goodbye Horses was so dumband obvious. Bad decision there, director.
With all this viewing of the Hannibal TV series I've been doing since it premiered this year (2013,) I've been tempted, and finally gave in, to revisit the horribly miscast Red Dragon remake from 2002. I'm sorry I did.Aside from how fantastic the updated TV series is and how closely the perfectly cast show is to the original publication, this remake of Manhunter is anything but spot on. As mentioned, every single character is incredibly wrong from what Thomas Harris envisioned from his original Hannibal Lecter novel, Red Dragon. I used to be an Edward Norton fan until I saw this and then later, his Bruce Banner take in The Incredible Hulk sealed his fate for me. He was ABSOLUTELY nothing like the fantastic character Will Graham is.Also, "The Tooth Fairy" played by Ralph Fiennes could not have been further off the mark. Even in this movie alone, they mention how "disfigured" he considers himself when he's anything but.I haven't even gotten to how they overplayed Hannibal's presence in this movie vs. the original story. Of about 400 pages, Hannibal appears in roughly 4-5 pages. Yes, I understand their only concern was to milk Anthony Hopkins' iconic role, but to physically alter the original source just to make a few bucks is disgraceful. Hell, he got top billing and takes about half the poster. Shame.Now, the movie's not a complete waste. Perhaps one should NOT read the book to appreciate this film. For, it does have one of the best scores I've heard from a movie. It does have genuinely suspenseful scenes. And despite Hannibal's over presence, he was interesting when he was on screen.FBI Special Agent Graham is called back into duty after two families are butchered and he's needed to put the pieces together and catch the "tooth fairy/red dragon."Really, that's the basic plot, but it is interesting to watch Will's journey and who he calls on to get help. ButIt's not as interesting as the TV show. Or the original Manhunter movie. Or the actual sequel, The Silence of the Lambs. In fact, it's a throwaway movie that you should actually do just that. Stick with Silence, barely watch the sequel, Hannibal, and pay attention to the TV series. That's all you need to see.
Godzilla (1998) needs to be added to my list of movies I continuously revisit despite being terrible and that I want so bad to like more.I remember back in 1998 when I first saw this: It was one of my most anticipated movies for me in a long time. For, I grew up with Godzilla as a kid, though I couldn't tell you how many of the Japanese films I've seen. Just whatever was on Saturday Afternoons on TV. So, I thought: damn, here's Godzilla, with a budget and on American soil! And I love Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria and it also starred my soap-dish show's Doug Savant, from Melrose Place!I could NOT have been more let down than if Hank Azaria, himself, provided a voice for Godzilla.During my first viewing, I did all I could to get past the absolute trash of campiness they didn't need to hold onto. The horrid dialogue, bad acting and jokes that were as flat as anything under Godzilla's feet. I tried to forgive them to missing the mark and opportunity and said to myself: "Let's get to the goods!"When we finally did, and Godzilla revealed his new "look" I couldn't stop laughing. Sure the special effects were decent, and I knew where they were going by transforming his Rubber-Suit-Man into a more "realistic" lizard giant, but dang, he couldn't have looked more ridiculous. No wonder they never revealed his full body, or at least warped and hilarious head, to the media prior to the movie playing.Oh, and here's a spoiler, but don't worry; it's your fault if you haven't yet seen this 15-year-old movie. They rip off the very movie they're trying to top: Jurassic Park. The entire marketing campaign, namely "Size Does Matter," was trying to spit on the everlasting champ in this genre but, instead, steals the raptor scenes with the climax of this film. It was pathetic.The basic synopsis follows the previous synopsis of the established Godzilla series: radioactive (or nuclear) activity grows a lizard to, I don't know, 100,000 times of its original size, although Matthew Broderick's character says it's a "brand new species." And said monster believes New York City would be perfect for raising its youth. Um, it's not even good for humans, but maybe Godzilla first spoke with the rats and thought differently.The Gomer Pyle lead military decides it's best to blow up half the city in order to stop the beast after a convenient, albeit unrealistic, evacuation of 10 million people in a matter of minutes. When one doctor (Broderick) suggests feeding the beast is a good idea, the doofuses listen, comply and instead of killing Godzilla, they obliterate much of Manhattan while lacking any results.Meanwhile, a dizzy blonde, whom you'll grow to hate, wants her man, said doctor, back while stealing a story to advance at her news station.I just threw that in for the most inept and ridiculous subplots thrown in. There's many more, and sadly, the bulk of the movie revolves around live-action cartoon characters and their selfish lives while a monster threatens real estate.I digress. Godzilla lays some eggs and this causes more threats and the doctor's theories. Enter the Raptor Rip-off Chase scenes.Admittedly, if you get past the 80% of camp and cheese, some of the Godzilla chases were fun, but that's a lot to ask. In the beginning of my review, I said this is one I return to regularly, or say, every 3-4 years, and want to like it more, but blasted, I hate life when all I remembered was that 20% of good footage.In 2014, I've heard they plan on yet another reboot of this franchise. Oddly, I have high hopes again. I really do. I think they've learned from their mistakes here and despite the 16 year gap, or worse, 60 years since the original, they will take their time with a story that can be told, with actors that don't speak lines from a three-year-old's mind and with an even better threat to us than a military that couldn't stop an ant colony from gathering leaves.Skip this one, wait for 2014.
Surprisingly, an improvement over #2, and still, 'Child's Play 3' is too much of a waste of time. Sure, it's harmless, but it's just another excuse to beat a dead doll. Chucky's back, and again it's a preposterous reincarnation and introduction. We find him stalking little Andy (now a teen in a military reform school) again, despite part two's explanation that Chucky can't transfer his lost soul into the boy anymore. Some of the humor's there, my favorite was the Colonel's death mixed with Chucky's surprise and disappointment. Thankfully, now that Andy's grown a bit, he's played by a much better actor that has some (I said some) range. I also liked him in the 'Lois & Clark' Jimmy role (he was in 2-4, replacing the dud they hired for Jimmy in season 1.) And I admit some of the lines Chucky used was mildly funny as well as the conclusion in the seemingly never ending haunted house was appropriate for the series. Unfortunately, the whole movie was just another remake of #1-2 and the inconsistencies and plot holes were fairly large. Would they really put sharp knifes in the haunted house? Would someone seriously not report a death that just happened and go off to play a game? Yeah, I'm looking too deep. It's safe to skip #2 and #3 and return when Chucky returns in full force in 'Bride of Chucky.'
"Boyyou read my thoughts! You've got the Shinning," says Groundskeeper Willy."You mean: 'Shining,'" replies Bart Simpson."Shh! You want to get sued?" answers Groundskeeper Willy.That was 1994. The Simpsons came out with their fifth of twenty-third "Treehouse of Horror" specials. The year, now, is 2013. To this day. I've never forgotten that quote and I remember hearing it live as the fifth "Treehouse of Horror" special aired. Whenever The Shining is brought up in my presence, or whenever I start a conversation about it, I quote those lines. And yes, with the Scottish accent for Willy and never calling the movie by any other name other than "The Shinning."For those as nostalgic as me, it gathers a few laughs. Mostly from myself. ButI sincerely digress. I'm here to talk about The (real) Shining. And, sadly, I cannot accomplish this without spoilers. So, you are warned.** If You Have Not Seen The Shining, or even The Shinning, then just know this: I highly recommend this movie. Watch it now. Don't wait, call out sick and get a copy. Watch it and then continue with my review. Press stop now. **Whew. I truly believe I could write a novel on how fantastic, how awesome, how truly incredible this masterpiece is. Maybe, one day I will, but for now, I will give you my basic, run-of-the-Thesar review.First, let me start off (again?) with how pleased I am that I bought this on BluRay. I had originally planned on it by setting aside April 2013 as the month to re-watch and finally review a bunch of older movies from my past and I included The Shining. You see, this was one of my first horror movies I ever saw as a kid. And I distinctly remember that I was disappointed because, and yeah, these are my words: "Only two people died. And, one of them was the killer!"Moving right along, the last time I saw this, after several more viewings, was about 1994, I estimate. So we're talking 19 years since I last saw this and just about the same time that Simpsons episode aired. And back then, I was sadly, and unfortunately influenced by who I saw it with who said: "It's one of those movies (that's so boring) that if you fast-forwarded a bit, you'd be in the same place as you were when you initially hit 'fast-forward.'" Due to my typical disdain for "slow-moving" pictures, I (now, regrettably) believed him.Fast-forward, once again, to 2013 and I heard about a documentary called: Room 237. I wanted to watch that, but since it's been about 19 years since I've seen the original, why not purchase it on BluRay and revisit the classic. My eyes opened so wide during this viewing, I didn't know if they close.Any small infraction of my poor feelings about this movie was wiped clean. This isanear PERFECT MOVIE. Mood, cinematography, atmosphere, dialogue, suspense, score, acting, originality, fearit's all here. Generally, I am weary of very long movies, especially long ones that takeitslow. But, this movie never, ever, felt slow. Thanks to Director Kubrick, he moved the film along with rich dialogue, excellent scenes of the ever-so isolated Colorado hotel or score. He accomplished what Hitchcock set out to do and what M. Night Shyamalan could never touch.Now, there will be some, or possibly, many, who will compare it to the equally masterful book it's based on. I have read that incredible book, and loved every page of it and this movie, well, took themes, characters and settings, but overall, it was fairly far off target. The nice thing about judging a project on its own merit is that you can enjoy both and be honest about it. Not to mention, now you get two alternative universes to enjoy. Much like the original Star Trek legendary films and series and the updated J.J. Abrams vision. So, I like what direction Kubrick took with this story.I also love what Jack Nicolson did to the role of Jack Torrance. And both Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd were also very good, as was Scatman Crothers.Already "off" Jack takes a job as the caretaker of the gorgeous Colorado hotel for the off-season winter and brings his "special" son and wife in tow. Jack's excited because the job requires little maintenance and care, and he gets to finish the novel he quit his teaching job for. Onlythe isolation/cabin fever is starting to get Jackie boy a little, well, more tense.Little by little, Jack gets more stressed and agitated. More and more that "special" son of his has visions of past guests who met unfortunate ends there, to say the least. And Mom, well, she's growing further and further concerned.See? The overall tension builds as the minutes of the film passes for all parties involved. And as more is revealed around them, the very worse things get for the Torrance's.Hands down, one of the most memorable and scariest movie scenes of my whole life was when (now-GONE) Jack breaks into the bathroom to "teach" his wife a lesson, or final one, at least. I don't recall now, but I believe I couldn't get that image of the axe through the door, or Wendy Torrance striking back, out of my head and possibly dreams for many years. It's still enormously effective today.I literally could dissect almost every chapter on the disc and fill up volumes of my own chapters. This should be taught in film school. Each scene, each set, each line, each facial expression or, lack thereof, were all so masterfully crafted, it's good that it "appears slow" (even when it's not) so we can sit back, absorb and understand how a real film should be made.Would I recommend this? Well, you don't need the shinning to figure out if I did.
I used to have a huge grudge against Mrs. Doubtfire. Yes. I did. And all because of a Mrs. Tootsie.Granted they're not entirely the same movieOut of work straight actor, dresses as a woman to get a new career and to impress the girl he likes. Both are comedies, have heart, are both hilarious and touching and had to do with the lead actor working on television. Wait Damn. They pretty much are the same movie.The reason I had a thing against Mrs. D is that I was so in love with the movie Tootsie  and still am, and more people forgot all about that movie in lieu of this one.Butafter purchasing this on BluRay and rewatching for the (probably) 13th time, I really, REALLY enjoyed this feature. Perhaps one day we can all live in a world where we can appreciate both? Well, maybe just this one since  ah-HEM  Tootsie is yet to be available on BluRay. Great, now I am back to hating on this movie.Joke. And speaking of which, this movie, though extremely formulaic, is a riot. Thanks to the perfect timing and lines from Robin Williams. When he's wacky he's hilarious. When he had low humor, it's deep and still uproarious. And when he's serious, he shows a ton of heart. Secondary characters, Sally Fields, Pierce Brosnan, Polly Holliday and Harvey Fierstein also played their roles great and often funny. Even they kids played their roles fairly well.Man both loses his job and wife fairly quickly and must learn to deal with the time away from his kids, a new life including rent and job and the fact that the only way to see his kids is to dress as an English maid, a la the title character.Really, overall, the movie's extremely harmless and an enormous amount of fun and heart, but there was that nagging feeling I got about how, even in 1993, un-accepting everyone was, including the children, of a man dressing up as a woman in..SAN FRANCISCO?If you can suspend your disbelief for that, you'll have a great time. Well, at least, until Tootsie is finally available on BluRay. Tick-tock, tick-tock
When James Cameron staple, Bill Paxton, uttered the words: "Are you ready to go back to Titanic?" I hadn't actually been sure as of late. For, I've seen it three times in the theatres back in 97/98 and maybe once more on VHS a year or two later. I've had the score and "song" memorized since and, of course, I knew the outcome.Well, when the movie opened, I felt more than ready. Gone were the thoughts: "Be prepared, this is three plus hours" and I was once again mesmerized from minute one all the way until minute 194. This near-masterpiece made me miss how movies are supposed to made: with heart and talent. And that year, plenty were: some of other best picture nominations, L.A. Confidential, Good Will Hunting, and As Good as it Gets, were also utterly fantastic. Sadly, since 1997, we're lucky to have ONE made with such heart and incredible talent per year.By now, everyone knows the story and has since copied it multiple times. Let me make this clear: VERY few have made one with such a great script with believable dialogue, excellent actors and above all-else, chemistry. Kate and Leo had it in spades. From the second Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) looked up when new-friend, Tommy (Jason Barry) was talking to him, and saw Rose (Kate Winslet,) I KNEW they captured true love.Since this movie arrived 15 years ago, I've been a pretty good fan of Kate, but not so much Leo. He suffers from Denzelitis whereas almost every role he performs, he's not trying to act; he's JUST trying to win an Oscar. This annoying habit leads to way too much over-acting and an abundance of screaming. (SEE: practically any Leo or Denzel Washington role since 1997.)But...Leo pulled it off here. Truly, he showed such a deep affection, love and purity towards his costar that I believed every word, every action and that Rose's heart will go on. He did it so well, with each viewing, I always envisioned her life, the rest of it from the Titanic sinking until her death with him in her heart.These two, Rose and Jack amongst a few other decent characters, namely the fantastic Kathy Bates as The Unsinkable Molly Brown, were so good and deep that I never mind that it's about an hour and a half or more before the "special effects" kick in. I.E. The ship sinks. (Oops, sorry, spoiler.)That's the genius of James Cameron. His heart and soul was in this project. He nearly bankrupted the studio and himself and practically gave himself a bad name prior to opening  which was rescheduled more than once. He didn't just make an hour and half retelling of a sinking ship, even though he had the technology. And he didn't just put two romantic leads together; he made sure that the fictional love backdrop was as real as the amazing sinkage.To give an example of an "epic" retelling following Titanic that did not have the qualities needed to further an "opening buildup" of a romance is Peter Jackson's King Kong. It was flat, boring and unconvincing. He sure had the talent  Kong looked real, but sadly that CGI character held the most depth in the movie.Beyond the romance  that, yes, made me tear again after all these years/viewings and only because I believed the true love before me, was the ultimate score, one of the best songs, movie hit or not, excellent dialogue spoken  mostly by Leo and Molly Brown, great special effects and breathtaking cinematography. I had to see this on the big screen again, although I would've MOST preferred to have the option of 2-D.I would love to see a new movie of such deep quality and soul like this spend a deserved 15-weeks at number one at the box office that I would strongly stand behind. Recently, The Hunger Games did a decent four weeks at number one, and the highly inferior to both movies, Avatar, did seven. But both were just simple blockbusters. Not heart-felt movies. Not movies I would rate 5/5 stars  my highest honor of reviews.Sadly, James Cameron's follow-up, the Space Gully with Wolves film, Avatar, brought down Titanic's mind-blowing record box-office receipts. Oh, how I wished with the 2012 re-release with the "ho-hum" 3-D format would've have reclaimed the top spot. But it isn't to happen. And that's okay. It's still a great movie, still holds up today, still makes me laugh and cry and still makes me feel love all over again for movie making. If you are one of the six people in the world that hasn't seen it, SEE TITANIC.Side Note: Way back in the day, when internet was really just kick starting and we had things like "I.M.'ing" each other, I was involved in a long-distance relationship and I actually typed out Céline Dion's song, My Heart Will Go On to my partner that thoroughly made him blush.Side Note II: As stated, I watched this three times in the theatre following its initial release. On the last turn, I was on a first date with a guy  against all warnings from my friends to make Titanic a "first date" movie. Well, it did turn out to be the first and last date. This was his first viewing of Titanic and still, he fell asleep around hour one and awoke right before (spoiler!) Jack dies. I know my date was awoken because his snores stopped and he instantly began weeping. Frustrated, I said in a normal voice, despite being in the theatre, "What do you have to be crying about? You don't even know these characters!" Yep, that was the last I saw of him.
Literally, Michael Cera has never given a bad performance. From Arrested Development, to Superbad, to Juno. Even in the enormously disappointing, Year One, Cera outshined the (normally) hilarious headliner, Jack Black and made the movie slightly bearable with his enormous deadpan and dry wit humor. Here, in Youth in Revolt, he doubled the required role to advance two more powerful accomplishments. To hell with box office; this guy's a genius and ranks high on my favorite actors list.This movie is enormously silly, on the surface; there's floating Kama Sutra cartoons, duel invisible personalities and even a car in the living room, for Pete's sake. But that's part of the charm; it never takes itself serious and that made me admire the overall product all the more. It helps, beyond the craziness was the under-the-radar humor from Mr. Cera. Right now I'm awarding this 4½ stars, but who knows, after the inevitable second or more viewings, it might rise to the five star max. This movie is wonderful on many levels.Typical teenager (does Cera play anything different?) Nick Twisp (Cera) is unhappy in love and life. He latches onto his equally depressing buddy, Lefty (Knudsen)  misery does love company (I know this first hand.) But after a series of unfortunate events, he meets the soul-mate of his dreams, Sheeni (Doubleday) in a trailer park, no less, and his grand desire of running off with her outshines his passive existence. He must do anything to stay intellectual with his "future wife" including rebelling with one cause: lovely Sheeni. And anything means from being bad, very bad, to creating an alternate identity to aid his quest of lust.This brings us to one reason this movie made almost nothing at the box-office: poor advertising. They billed this as the (Spoiler!) "Fight the Breakfast Club." Sure it contains an "imaginary" split character who's a tougher, smarter and more romantic, though crude, guide for Nick, but that only takes up a fifth or less of the film, but about half of the preview. The only thing the ads got right was that this is a teen angst comedy, but the mustached Cera's "better half" is only a small tool in the large box of tricks you would be in store if you watched the film.Obviously, nothing will or should work for Nick in his plans for total love domination. Obstacles always plague comedies. This is no exception and all involved, Director Arteta, the actors, writers, and crew do everything to make this fantasy of real life as realistic as possible.I don't want to give away a lot that happened in the film so that if you do see this very light, but hilarious teen-romantic comedy/romance/drama, you'll be thoroughly surprised, amazed, touched and moved. Oh, and you'll laugh your ass off, even when my new hero, Cera, simply stares. He's good, believable and acting his heart out even when he says nothing at all.I'm not one to follow box-office to show true quality, but it is a relief when an independent movie, such as Youth in Revolt, at least makes its money back. Theater-wise, this movie BARELY made a dime and that's a shame. Hopefully with good word of mouth  SEE THIS WONDERFUL AND HILARIOUS MOVIE, DAMMIT!  this will make a deservedly bundle of cash on home video. All of the wonderful actors attached their hearts to this project. SEE THIS MOVIE!
I can't put my finger on why I was so bored during 'Underworld' (2½/5 Stars). Sure, there's a lot going on, a lot of pretty good FX  EXCEPT for the laughable werewolves (I refuse to call them the 'L' word; call them what they are!)  and mystery aplenty, but I've always been left unsatisfied with this movie. For one, I do like Vampire stories (again, EXCEPT the faux pas vampire story in 'Twilight') but I like the werewolf lore more. This one was supposed to be a blending of both, but get real; this is a 70/30 Vampire/Werewolf story. I guess that might be a good thing considering how horrid the CGI werewolves look. Anyways, the movie's real highlight is the extremely strong character, Selene, played with an excellent performance by Kate Beckinsale. Without her, I doubt I'd have much interest in continuing with the series. The movie obviously directly steals from 'The Matrix' and that's a huge deterrent, as is the constant bending-the-rules for plot development and weighs more heavily on the "mystery" of the war between the beasts than character development. It also screams sequel  literally. Unless you name your movie "Episode #" then it shouldn't be so blatant. Barely recommended.
I feel like a broken record, but I need to say it again: Ocean's Thirteen is the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade make-up film (to Temple of Doom.) Now, I am actually an unapologetic supporter of Ocean's Twelve, but I truly and really liked this chapter.Does it match the original's originality, even though that was a remake? No, but it comes pretty damn close. Andthey made it back to Vegas, where they belong.The gang gathers around a fallen and deceived member and comes up with a brilliant and often hilarious plot to thwart the great Al Pacino.Literally, that's the plot. Now, I don't mean to downplay itI had an absolute blast here, but also admired this movie tremendously.For example, the graphics and locations were amazing. I'm a stickler for "getting Vegas right." Con Air had the strip all over the place, including casinos/hotels that didn't even exist when the movie premiered. The movie 21 had "our heroes" stay in the Green Valley Ranch that had a convenient view of the strip, even though the strip is miles away. In Ocean's Thirteen, there was a fake casino erected, and the location they gave, it made sense. Even the views from the place and hotel rooms was accurate  had this place existed.The comedy was back, the tension and fun was relevant and the suspense was key. If you loved 2001's Ocean's Eleven and that does happen to be one of my all-time favorite movies, you should truly love this. (Yeah, it helps if you saw Part "Twelve," but not 100% necessary.)
Understandably, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns was just lifted straight from the graphic novels I haven't read, but damn, this "movie" was random.Obviously, it was a stunt to make more money releasing this in two parts, but on the other hand, it was basically two movies  albeit, short ones at an hour apiece  with two completely different moods.Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 sort of resembles what we know about the Batman legend and felt, at first, like it took place following the events of the motion picture, The Dark Knight Rises. Once it's learned that it's not, you get a few random events that only conclude barely enough to leave open for Part 2.Part 2, although still random at spots, is much darker and more adult than most animated features I've seen. And when finished, a couple dozen questions appeared in my brain:(This next paragraph is chock-full of spoilers. Skip if you don't appreciate those.)How does everyone know who Clark is, or namely the President and FatWoman, er CatWoman? Why even mention the brief background of the Justice League and leave holes in that story? How can the Joker withstand a dagger in the eye #1, and #2 continue fighting and navigating, hell, thinking? Why was it set back in the 1980s? Why was Batman so evil at times, actually shoots guns and randomly beats up police? Since when did Batman murder people (he admits this to the Joker)? What happened to the old Robin  or, for the love of God, stop brining up something only insiders would know! Why were Superman and Batman such enemies? And why did Bruce hate Clark so much, other than the fact Superman fought for peace? Why was it was a bad idea for Superman to detonate a bomb in space  sort of?  verses in the city? Further, since when would a nuclear bomb  which he's survived before, make him turn into James Wood's Hades from Disney's Hercules? Where did the "Mutants" come from and why were they even called that since, all-but-one, were perfectly normal idiots with red Cylon-style glasses? Why did Batman go out of his way to make sure the new Commissioner hated him and later, why would she all-of-a-sudden refuse to attack him when given the (15th) chance? When did Batman begin using (the absent) Scarecrow's hallucinate gas? And finally, not really a question, but a nice observation: It's good to know that if a multistory apartment building's on fire, the quickest and most effective way to put it out is with just a few buckets of water. An entire room's fire seemed to get extinguished with one bucket of water!(End of Spoilers. You can resume now.)Perhaps, I am taking all this too seriously, but that was the idea I got from the filmmakers: a deeper, darker and most realistic animated Batman feature.And although this was definitely an alternative (DC) universe, much like TV's Smallville, this cartoon felt like 15 animated features were created before this, much like what Marvel did to lead up to The Avengers. But, at least in that great movie, I didn't have to question every aspect when a new plot line formed.As much as this review, so far, has looked like a bashing, I actually did have a little bit of fun  from time to time. If you can put away everything you know about these characters you might have grown up with, i.e. completely forget they've ever used to stand up for good and justice or even existed at all, then you might enjoy the whole experience.
As great the original X-Men was, X2 topped it, much like Spider-Man 2 over Spider-Man. They certainly up'd the ante on action, story and character development. And none of that was easy with the increased character/mutant list. Director Singer should be incredibly proud on pulling off what 98% of Comic Book sequels fail at: adding more and yet keeping the perfect balance all the while improving on the original. (Perfect examples are the recent Iron Man 2 and the original sequels to the original Batman.) There are multiple story lines here, but the majority wrap around the increasing war between Humans (and Politicians) and the Mutants. Profession Xavier (Stewart) is juggling a lot on his wheelchair-bound lap: Wolverine's (Jackman) background, Grey's (Janssen) future, Magneto's (McKellen) present, all while running a school, bartering for equality and helping even the guilty/used mutants.Most times, I have problems with multistory lines in movies, especially comic book and definitely comic book sequels (SEE: Iron Man 2 and Spider-Man 3) but here, everything was used to both further the story along and to enhance it by once again using everyone's different personalities and powers efficiently. Every scene was extremely well crafted, there was enough plot and character development for you to root for both the good and the bad.The battles were well crafted, the characters flushed out perfectly and the action intense, even when nothing was happening. In a lot of movies, the actors simply rely on the director to command everything with full trust. Here, it paid off, in dividends, and they seemed to be having a good time while portraying a good story. As a sequel, it was a great pay-off. On its own, it's a great movie. No one should miss this great adventure.I haven't given too much away  one of my Kryptonite weaknesses, so just sit back, enjoy. If the actual premise or the fact you liked part one is your fancy, you will love this feature.
How was this NOT written and directed by M. Night? Oh, that's rightit didn't have pacing problems.Okay, let's get serious for a moment. If you like M. Night Shyamalan, Left Behind, Dawn of the Dead, Night of the CometheckThe Raft (Part of Creepshow 2)you'll like Vanishing on 7th Street. (Uh, that last one was a stretchI was trying to find a manipulative black goo that tricks its victims, and I could've done worse)The problem here, and as pointed out from the 5 references above, is that you will see nothing new here. Does that make the final product bad? Eh. It would've helped with fine  make that, (even) good performances. Can you expect that from Hayden "I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM!" Christensen (from Star Wars: Episode II)? Unlikely.Wait, I have seen this, and it's not just unlikely, it didn't happen from him, or the usually reliable John Leguizamo or Thandie Newton. So, we're left with an unoriginal idea with uninspired leads. Still, the movie could've been worse.Not by much. What we have here is an ordinary day that turns ugly after everybody (almost) vanishes  except their clothes, of course and left behind are a few stragglers. They're rightfully puzzled, as we are, and they quickly learn they must stay in the light to survive. Only, the days are getting as short as the battery supply.Apparently, there's these black shadow (men?) who stalk the survivors when darkness arrives. So our fear(ful) heroes band together in a pub (I'm guessing on 7th Street) where the generator keeps them at bay from the shadow people.Will they fight amongst each other? Check. Will they try and determine what's going on? Check. Will they look for a way out? Check. So originality's out the door and yet, it's not a complete waste. At least Newt (from Aliens, I'm guessing) made it down to Earth, assuming Alien³ never took place, and showed up the finale.At least explain somethinganythingnamely why these "sophisticated" shadow people are so good at their vanishing act, yet couldn't get these dufuses who managed to escape sudden death. Hell, they did explain that in the campy Night of the Comet.Much like the Dawn of the Dead reference, don't expect a complete resolution, but if you like the above mentioned films, it might interest you. I just expected more from an already tired genre.
or 600 minutes or less. That's false advertising #1 for '30: Minutes or Less'  the movie's target was given 10 hours, only his sub-plotted job had to do something with a half hour time frame. #2: It's marketed as a comedy. Well, Die Hard also had a lot of comedic linesbut nowhere is it listed as a comedy. I'm sure those two reasons + how much of a mess this movie was, was why it sank. I'll admit, some of the lines were funny, but that's before the movie got way too serious and when they wanted to continue down the "funny" tone, it was lost. And the writer(s) might think it's hilarious to bring a bomb into an elementary schoolI think we can agree that's a FAIL. 1½/5 Stars.
I remember seeing the original The Crazies (1973) way back in 1994-5ish with my current (and then) roommate and laughing all the way through it. Laughing at its extremely low budget, perhaps, or maybe because I was in too much of a good mood for the dark & dreary tale of killer virus and the big bad government's inevitable cover-up. He was none too happy about my mocking of the movie, to say the least. Especially when I chuckled at one of the lines: (something like) "Yeah, I need that like I need a hole in my head." My response: "Well, I hope you have at least one hole in your head! I have a minimum of 5 (pointing to nose, ears and mouth) not to mention millions more I cannot see!" Yeah, I realize that has little to do with the latest horror-remake, The Crazies (2010) but it did make me appreciate this update all the more. In fact, even though not seeing the original in approximately 15 years, I can safely say this movie was far superior. Beyond the obvious comparisons, since it is, of course, yet another horror remake, I will state it is actually a good movie.Great? No. Predictable? Yes, even down to who's going to die and when, including inanimate objects. But enjoyable all the same; it's vicious, violent and shows what true horror is based on.Barely wasting any screen time, and yet it still established the feel of a small-Iowa town, the movie practically dives right into the first of many "crazies" or ill individuals. In this case, a man walks out into baseball field during a high school game in progress with a shotgun. Sheriff Dutton (Olyphant) confronts the man, a friend of his (i.e. more proof of small-town America) and sees something in the man's eyes prior to having to shoot him when the man fails to comply with putting the pointed shot gun down.There begins the mystery (and occurrences of "crazy" acts) of Ogden Marsh, Iowa. But, not for long. After it's soon discovered the source of the quiet-town-folk-turned-homicidal  a fallen military plane transporting a deadly virus into the town's water supply, the movie turns into the ultimate government cover-up (as usual.) Now, Dutton, his wife, her employee and Dutton's deputy have to escape avoiding both their former friend's vengeance and cold-blooded attacks from the military.I found little wrong in this movie, and a lot more right. Such as acting. As usual, one of my all time favorite actors, Olyphant, does a superb job of toning down his usual, for lack of a better word, crazy and over-the-top acting to a degree, fitting the role perfectly. When he does speak out, you will see the true Olyphant. He adds so much to his character, the movie, humor to the necessary spots and true love of his wife, played by Mitchell. She also does a great job, stealing every scene she's in. Finally, Hollywood Horror gives us credible, believable and true characters to root for.No one pulled a Superman in this movie. They made mistakes and tried their best to deal with the unique situation they were thrust into. And even the military knew what they were doing was wrong, albeit a tough decision (as shown by a slightly captured soldier, played by Reegan.) The script was good and tight, and despite (previously mentioned) predictable, at least it transitioned you into the next scene with ease, leaving just the important parts completely impressing me. Also, the suspense was very good. Two of the best scenes were the Sheriff being thrown under a Semi to do battle and a wonderfully unique way of using a car wash for horror.Highly recommended for the crowds liking to be scared, but in a movie with a much higher level than not only most horror-remakes, but any horror thrillers of recent years. And if you're one not to watch these movies over and over (namely like me) you may not be able to predict it throughout, including the closing. So for those who like to be scared a little bit and save a horror movie on your list but once every couple of years, this is the one to pick.
Even though the movie The Help is a work of fiction, here's a true story: I offended someone today when I proclaimed at work: "I finally saw the first 5-star movie of 2011: 'The Help'!"Of course, with a touchy subject such as this, it's a 50/50 chance you'll offend with someone with this movie and subject-matter. Granted, I thought I would be in good graces since the person I upset was black and I only briefly mentioned it where she could overhear it.Apparently, her beef was mainly for the fact that the prejudice portrayed still runs true today  don't I know that! Anyways, like I always say about most work places: "Why even install carpet in the office, when the floor is covered with eggshells?"This movie was moving, brilliant, wonderfully written, emotional, well-acted and stirs up enough emotions to make us all think twice on how we treat each other. I know I stood back and was actually ashamed of being white during this viewing.Rebel Skeeter (the always wonderful Emma Stone) is wanting to write a book against her (ENORMOUSLY) racist bridge-playing peers and in the POV of "the help," i.e. black maids when "the deep south" still treated non-whites as inhumanly as possible. It's not easy for a VERY hard working servant to give their story, but with great courage it happens. And then it happensit hits the fan.Loved this movie. The performances all around, whether you love the individual or HATE HATE HATE the character, were pitch-perfect. The dialogue had be both rolling and angry (in a good way) at the same time. And the pacing, despite the more-than-2-hours running time was completely well used.I also love the fact that it wasfiction. Some people are claiming this as heavy-handed. Bah. This was a perfect summarization of the travesty that happened back in the 1950s/1960s and like my fellow peer realizes, still today. SEE THIS MOVIEand then look at ourselves.
I can say the most positive thing about The Toxic Avenger is that it knew what it was. Sure, it's a horrible, horrible, incredibly bad film, but at least unlike other top worst movies of all time, this one knew it was meant for B-Movie status. Or at least for some midnight views or drinking games.For someone who has not seen a singe "Troma" film ever, until last night, I was pretty shocked on the lengths these directors and writers went. From the extreme homophobia, to vehicular manslaughter while drinking and driving and actually shoving a shot gun into a toddler's face. I'm guessing this (1986) was far before the PC-movement or they simply wanted you to turn your brain off. Sure, you would have to turn off your senses while watching, but as much fun as some of the movie was, it was hard to ignore the blatant disregard for taste/humanity.Yeah, I mentioned some of the movie was fun. It was, only because it was so over-the-top in its bathroom humor and bad special effects/voice-overs. (Man, that Toxic voice-over was hilarious, though I never knew if it was one of the jokes.) I didn't, however, mention the deliberate misuse of transporting toxic waste because it was an obvious set-up and part of the overall camp of the movie.Nerdy, nerd, nerd Melvin's the janitor in charge of the mop at a gym and is getting picked on. Why? Because he's misunderstood? No, because he's such an exaggeratedly bad form of geek that makes Napoleon Dynamite look like the captain of the football team. And he should honestly never be let out of his house for his own safety.At any rate, he sort of works by mopping and goggling the bimbos until a plan is hatched to rid the gym of this eye sore by humiliation that turns into him leaping out of a window into, you guessed it, toxic waste. From there, this Frankenstein's Monster with a brand new voice and body seeks out justice for whatever reason you can think of. But, this is not a Batman vigilante. This one not only has no conscious of murder, he slaughters.I could say this is where the movie gets silly, but that was from frame one. No, this is where is where the movie gets sick and turns more horror. Sure, there are more comedic, intentional or not, moments, but they layered on the gore and violence and some of the oddest characters lifted right from Garbage Pail Kids cards, and no, I'm not talking about mutated characters. These were the humans.I honestly can't recommend this movie to anyone other than the midnight-movie, drinking (or other forms of controlled substance) or lovers of bad movie groups. I will say though this movie is obviously set up as a comedic fun-ride and not to be taken seriously for a second, the underling messages of homophobia and violence against kids still is very disturbing.
Recently, I re-watched The Collector in anticipation of the just recent sequel: The Collection. I was all excited to write both reviews and have some kind of double feature on my website. To my failed memory, I already wrote the review of The Collector back on June 28, 2010 and boyI wasn't kind.With this second viewing of the first one, I favored it more, but then I've seen my share of grotesque/torture porn films since, so maybe I've become quite immuned to horrific scenes. For, my review was very clear in its warning to stay away for its over-the-top gruesome and shameless scenes of gore.I will now begin my review of The Collection saying close to the same thing: STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE.Sure, the gore's still here, albeit it's actually a tad-bit milder than the first time around. But, my warning is because of how incredibly bad this copy-cat sequel is all around.Damn, where to begin? Terrible acting? Na, how about the incoherent plot, unrealistic actions of the characters, completely stolen ideas from ten-times-better screenplays? Or the zero background, and I mean: no explanation at all, to develop the main character that should've been included in this sequel? And let's talk about the dozens of deaths for the sake offor the reasoning ofsorry, maybe the multiple writers are just plain sick.The Saw series that this steals from heavily wasn't perfect, but at least it had direction. A goal and characters to latch onto, namely the central "villain." This low-rent fare is so all-over-the-place with way too many subplots and plot-holes that it's not even recommended to fans of the first one."The Collector," (now replaced from the original by Randall Archer  I guess, Juan Fernández was smart to turn this down) wants to shred, literally, more than a few dozen of party-goers in order to collect one survivor. I'm only assuming this, as, again, they give such a small insight to anything going on, the viewer can only speculate what the writer/director was trying to convey.Masked Man Collector does, in fact, get that one "special person," but, behold, he's being tracked (on his own turf) by that special unit that's off the grid by the angry father of said surviving victim. In this segment, think: Saw II meets Aliens, but only hell's depth worse.I would be happy the charismatic thief from the original, Arkin (Josh Stewart) returnedif he wasn't so dumbed down here and shares his unearthly ability to outwit someone completely prepared for victims with the new hero(ine) of the hopefully only-two-installment franchise, Elena (played very plainly by Emma Fitzpatrick.) Together, they quickly and absolutely absurdly come up with ingenious ways to survive the undocumented super-human Collector's every move.I've seen ten men's share of terrible horror sequels, and while this isn't the absolute worse, it does rank high of awful horror film franchise's #2's #2. There is no redeeming quality of this and if anyone, myself included, had any problems with #1, wait until you get a load of this mess. SKIP IT!
Once, when I was little boy, or 16, I ate up every movie I could in the theatres. Anything, everything. I studied films, read about them, watched as many trailers as I could and went to them all week long. And this was all pre-internet, so the research was limited to, well, real research.Oddly, one completely escaped my radar: 1990's Total Recall. In fact, three weeks prior to release, I had never heard of it. Just saw a mostly black, movie teaser poster with a triangle on it. Later, I would discover it was a pyramid. Two weeks prior to opening, they inserted the SCHWARZENEGGER name on the same poster. I was excited, and then realized this would be a perfect opportunity to go into a movie cold for once. Within the final week beforehand, they just added the name of the movie to the poster. But, at that point, I was already hooked.I remember this like it was yesterday. On opening day, Friday, June 1, 1990, I sat in AMC Metro Theatres for the very first screening, the 10AM showing, completely opened minded and gleefully ignorant to anything I was about to see, other than what appears might be a Sci-Fi Schwarzenegger flick. I was stoked and on the edge of my seat before the movie began.By film's end, I was so pumped up, so excited, and so happy. The movie was 100% everything I wanted out of both an action and Schwarzenegger film. And it made me, to this day, love the feeling of going in completely blind.Now, with today's world  i.e. the internet and, of course, Facebook  that's harder and harder to do. Nevertheless, if I get a tiny bit of interest in a big project, especially something I'm fond of already, i.e. Superman, I try my best to avoid all conversations, reviews, comments and absolutely spoilers.I digress. This FIRST and BEST version of Total Recall, based on the Philip K. Dick's too-long title, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, is an almost 100% action packed Sci-Fi adventure of a not-so-ordinarily-built construction worker, Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger,) who, after a trip to the mind-altering Rekall Inc. place of the future, sets in motion a series of spy antics and leads him to Mars. There, he needs to regain his memory, save that planet and get the girl. You know, the usual.I've been told, since I haven't read Dick's short story, that the updated 2012 version is more accurate to the book than this 1990 version. Who cares? This one was ten times more fun, so incredibly 90s  a plus for me and the ideal summer blockbuster. Also Schwarzenegger in his prime! (But, of course, we didn't know any different back then.) Not all movies based on (short or not) books are better if they're word-for-word the original source material.Stanley Kubrick's 1980 adaptation of The Shining was very loosely based on the Stephen King book I read. That was okay by me. The movie was a near-masterpiece in film making. I like to say: I enjoyed both versions, Kubrick's and King's. Later, the TV-miniseries, The Shining was almost identical to King's version and itsucked.And in 1993, I literally  dead serious here  finished the book, The Firm, while in line waiting for the sneak preview of the film based on the John Grisham novel. (I started the very long book 6 days prior, and even though I'm a slow reader, I did everything I could to get it done by the film's premiere. I barely accomplished that while in line!) Following the movie, I was very disappointed because they changed so much, including tone and how the incredibly smart the (book) character, Mitch McDeere, was now dumbed down in the film.My opinion all changed for The Firm when I saw the follow-up movie: The Pelican Brief, which I also read. It was almost verbatim the book. So, during that movie, I knew exactly what was going to happen and when and that was no fun. (The Client followed suit, as well.)Point is, even when a book is masterful, that doesn't mean a director/screenplay writer can't take it to a new level, while playing respectful homage to the original writer and characters. Total Recall took the simple idea, or synopsis printed above, and ran with it on another planet. It was fun, exciting, funny, thrilling, suspenseful, had a great score and great graphics. Sure some things are a bit out of date, but then, that's what they thought in 1990.Despite some minor "futuristic" funnies, Director Verhoeven (who's becoming one of my favorite directors, if not just for that time period) gave me a thrill of a popcorn movie that holds up strongly today. Skip the 2012 version; stick with the original. Well, sorta.Side Note and Spoiler  fair warned: It's not an implant. The movie's events were real. There's enough evidence throughout, from the looks that both his "wife" Lori (Stone) and friend/coworker, Harry (Robert Costanzo,) gave Quaid prior to his visit to Rekall to the Rekall people stating they keep up with "today's times" and that's why they would have a video picture of Quaid's girl, it's all real. I understand Verhoeven likes those open-ended, discussion-educing finales, but I believe this was all true.Side Note II: Since I've seen this, and it's been many years ago, I've become quite the Star Trek: Voyager lover. In this movie, the automated cab driver's voice instantly told me he was dubbed by Voyager's Doctor, played by Robert Picardo. I was right. Yata! Still, love that man.
Rosemary's Baby II: Bad Hair Day may not have been as catchy of a title as The Lords of Salem.Wow. I am trying to figure out if Rob Zombie just wants me to know how much he denounces Christ or if that's just a part of his storytelling. I get it already; these witches of the past worshiped Satan. Rarely have I've seen such a hammer to my head to understand that this movie is anything but a spit in the Son of God's face.Completely predictable and using the age-old ghosts/images in the background that our "heroes" don't see, The Lords of Salem's (or what-a-LOSS) goal is to tell the story of the poor, misunderstood witches of the 1600s who were sooo "wrongfully accused and executed." Ironically, this story, and pretty much every one like it, only fuels the idea that whoever burned these witches was actually right in doing so. Heck, I would have done so, myself, after seeing this "truth" or any other evidence that the witches were, in fact, BAAAD folk.Let's get the paper-thin synopsis out of the way: Salem witches were burned a long time ago, and beforehand, they put a curse out. This curse apparently is ignited bya random record of a bland music selection that randomly shows up hundreds of years later to the obviously connected woman with the worst hair since John Travolta in Battlefield Earth. Now, how those 1600s witches knew they could convey their message on an object not thought of at the time is one of the many plot holes, but anywaysCoworkers barely show an ounce of help to this Bad Hair Girl as she metamorphoses into Rosemary (from Rosemary's Baby) and out comes the most hilarious, albeit unintentionally funny creature to grace our horror movie screens.When the end credits, or in this case, the epilogue, is much more entertaining than the entire film, we got problems. For starters, as stated, the movie's thoroughly predictable. There's one character you know will die the second she/he is on the screen and man, it takes so long for that to happen. Then, when anything's creepy  besides Mrs. Writer/Director's hair, it's obviously going to lead to where we all know where.Also, not that I have a problem with the female nude body, but come on. I haven't seen this many nude women, mostly unattractive ones, that is, sincewell, I don't go looking for them. Again, we get it: Robbie likes to show nude women. Oh, and the several erect penises during one of the many abstract scenes, this one involving a trio of men masturbating simultaneously, à la a straight-line circle jerk, could not counter the dozens of nude female overkill shots.Look, the movie is a combination of the over-used witch story, specifically from Salem, MA, Rosemary's Baby and any ghost story of recent years with very little new shockers or inventive ideas. Granted, it was not horribly filmed; Zombie does know how to make a movie. But, he rarely knows how to make an original film, much like when he made House of 1000 Corpses.* * * Final thoughts: Now, if you're anti-antichrist movies, just stay away from this one. It's bad enough that the AGAINST Christ theme is shoved down our throats, but the rest of the movie isn't anything special that rises above normal horror movies. Heck, it's not even scary. Ever. Stay away from (the sometimes named "The Lords" and sometimes named "The Lords of") Salem.
You know, babies under the age of one are just getting used to being in the light or real world. Give them some slack. And toddlers over the age of two kinda know what they're into. SoI would recommend Furry Vengeance for all humans ages 1-2.They're the only ones who could stomach such crap and not (verbally) complain about it. Yeah, I know, that's child abuse, but this movie's gotta be made for some demographic.Honestly, I was ready to start cutting myself until I realizedthe movie was only half over. Then I watched the rest while simultaneously worked on my will. I didn't think I would make it to the end.In this green movie with a VERY constipated Brendan Fraser, we have "highly intelligent" animals that want to protect their precious land. Well, they succeeded in simply making me want me to litter. Seriously. I wanted to both denounce Al Gore and kill animals while running a bulldozer over rain forests after watching this movie. Too bad they achieved the opposite message they were looking for: leave the planet alone. I singlehandedly wanted to destroy it.Dan Sanders (Fraser) brings his wife (Shields) and son, Tyler (Prokop), to the deep forest to appease his boss, Lyman (Jeong) and their mission is to destroy the forest in order to build houses. In some dumb back story, for generations, the animals fight back, namely a comical/animated raccoon, in order to preserve their land.In the movie's defense, I can see where they were going: Family AND eco-friendly message with ohhh-so-cute CGI-Laced mouths/eyes on animals to target younglings. Unfortunately, the script, special effects and even its message wouldn't work on the lowest rated Disney animated movie of the 1960s. How this got green lit or how this got past audience screenings is beyond me.Each scene of the animal's attack on Dan to make his life miserable is more painful than the last. Each stunt is just as dumb as what a 0.250 BAC drunk would consider funny. Don't get me wrong: I'm not against either family friendly films nor am I opposed to green-movies, but when you combine the two with the mentality of the under two crowd, I'm uninterested. Just be prepared for a lot of poop shots (from birds) because they think: that's funny!It's not. Please avoid. This is, BY FAR, the worst film of 2010 and in one of the worst years for movies in decades, that's saying a lot. What other movie would seriously make you want to litter just out of spite?Side Note: Following the movie, I began listening to the audio commentary, hoping beyond hope that they would apologize for the crap they made (SEE: Superman IV: The Quest for Peace) but it was a no-go. They seemed like they were still trying to be "family-friendly" in their speech, when all they succeeded in was lying about producing the abomination they made. Shame on them for avoiding all honesty. At least admit when you've made a mistake.
Every once in a while, an obviously slammed movie by both critics and humans, will spark something in me and I will find a lot of joy in watching it.It would be funny to say: this is not one of those times, but I really had a great time during Bullet to the Head. Yes, it's yet another action-Grindhouse-throwback-expendable feature, much like 2013's earlier The Last Stand  that I also liked a lot, that didn't make anything at the box office. But, receipts do not equate quality of a film.Sylvester Stallone STILL looks great, even at 67! And he can still kick ass. It's fun to watch him pound these bad guys in this basically "fun" film noir movie about a bad guy (Stallone) who teams with straight-man cop (Sung Kang) to take down the top boss  each for their own reasonings.You really can't look too deep into this movie, and I won't go into much more detail other than: if you do leave your brain at the door, it's a fun action movie for those of us who loved these  and Stallone  from the 1980-1990s. See it!
I used to like Dances With Wolves so much as a child, that I wanted to change my rating scale and give this the first six stars out of five. Yeah, I was a kid.I watched it then, in the early nineties, maybe a half-dozen times. Then stopped and moved on. Even when the (nearly) four hour version came out, I avoided it to savor the experience I had for a special time.Sixteen years later, the Bluray was given to me for my birthday  my only request  and finally, I watched the 3 hour 58 minute version. Reaction?Well, I still love it. It's a beautiful, adventurous, wonderfully written and excellently acted epic. But, I'll hold off on the 6/5 star rating. Which would be hard to explain anyways.Some call this overrated, that it shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar and way too preachy. I disagree on all aspects. It's an epic yet small and intimate film  that's not something just about any filmmaker can do. It's very deserving of the Best Picture Oscar  sorry, Goodfellas  and besides, it fits with their love affair with epics. And watching this time, I paid close attention to see if I was too preached at. I didn't feel so. These are facts: Greed came over Americans  shocker  and we devastated these lands and more importantly, these people. (They got their revenge and my money when I gave up probably a year's salary at the Indian Casino over a period of a few years) Not once did I felt talked down to, or at school. If anything, I wanted to get educated on these wonderful people: the Sioux.Anyways, if you haven't seen this by now, John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) fears he'll lose his leg in the Civil War and when his suicide attempt fails, he requests to be stationed in what he thinks is Nowhere, USA. Only, he befriends and is adopted into the Sioux tribe and takes allegiance to them over his own "white people."Wowwhat is almost 4 hours I summed up in a few seconds. Believe me, there's so much more to the plot.The movie is gorgeous  it has both some of the best cinematography I've seen and one of the best scores I've heard. The love John does have for Stands with a Fist (Mary McDonnell) is genuine and fun to watch. And the camaraderie within the group, the peaceful and playfulness of the members and productive and loyal stands makes you feel as you're with them as well over the course of the movie.Highly recommendedalthough, just stick with the 3-hour theatre version. I found the changes (additions) in this one-time viewing, even after 16 years of Dances silence. And the deleted now inserted scenes didn't add much.
Further proving Robert Pattinson (PATTINSON!  said in best George Costanza, from Seinfeld, voice with fists shaking in the air) cannot either hire a good acting coach or hair stylist, we have Remember Me, the ironic title becausenoonewilleverremember such trash.Currently, it ranks 28% at Rotten Tomatoes and made an un-astonishing $19 million. Neither specifically state it's an awful movie, but trust me: this movie is unbearable and should be avoided. However, if curiosity killed your cat and if you can make it all the way to the enormously predictable and thee most offensive ending of all time, you'll deserve your punishment for ignoring my warning: Do NOT watch this movie.I should just throw in the spoiler for the finale. Hopefully that'll sway you from seeing such melodramatic trash. But, it's so foreseen, it's a pain just to wait for it to happen.Okay, I won't ruin the end, but I'll give you the clues that makes the climax blatantly obvious: The movie begins in 1991 with a tragedy  get used to that; this movie preys on throwing one over-dramatic subject over the next, practically begging you to cry  and then fast-forwards 10 years for the grand finale of human tradegy. EVEN THOUGH IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE MOVIE.#1: I don't think I gave anything away since they spell it out to you, literally dozens of times of what's to come and what's the time frame. And #2: I felt they all-but mimicked "that despicable day" for purposes of manipulating the audience's emotions.For that reason alone, this movie deserves no more than one star. If I gave less, I would. But, it doesn't start with the ending. There's so much more wrong with this feature.It's almost a given Pattinson (PATTINSON!) can't act, (SEE: Twilight and New Moon) but here he shines in what NOT to do. If the absolutely hilarious boardroom scene doesn't banish him from even attending an Oscar party, the down-right awkward pick-up scene should put him in front of a firing squad. Speaking of awkward scenesthis movie's full of them. One after another. Each more nauseating than the last; the movie even makes you want to vomit, just like the character Ally (de Ravin) did not oncebut twice! When the movie actually starts off promising, with the first of, say, 57 disasters, as in, to explain a character's motivation/mood later, it quickly begins to sink, almost immediately. We are introduced to numerous names, characters and mood swings, it's tough to keep up. They literally crammed a full dramatic television series on CW in about 45 minutes and just when you think there's absolutely no point to this movie, they dive into, what I think they meant as the plot.Rebellious young male Tyler (played by Pattinson, PATTINSON!) whowait, did they really name him Tyler? Fight Club he ain'tfights strangers and then a cop  for absolutely ZERO reason, and gets thrown, RIGHTFULLY SO, in jail. Regardless of his absent motivation, he assaulted a police officer  just as he was released to go home after an altercation on the streets.His ultimate plan? Well, it wasn't his, but he ate the apple (given from his dimwitted and incredibly stupid roommate) to, get this, it's hilarious!, date the daughter of the cop who justifiably arrested him in order to, well, uh, I guess get back at him? Normally this would have the 1,000-year-old predictable result: boy meets girl under false pretenses, boy lies to girl, boy gets girl, boy falls for girl, boy's lie comes out and loses girl, girl forgives boy because, hey, it's truuuue looove (go ahead, say that in your best Miracle Max (Billy Crystal from The Princess Bride) voice as that's the only way to humor yourself) and everything is alright again for boy and girl. Guess whatyep, that's what happens here.Honestly, I wouldn't have a problem with all of that, if both A: They added some originality and depth to the characters and B: if it weren't based on the most laugh-out-loud foundation, as previously explained, that I've ever heard. EVER.So there's two firsts, so I have to hand it to this movie. It now sits close to, if not on top of the worst movie list of all time for containing the most pointless reasons behind the Boy-Lies-to-Get-Girl age-old plot and the worst ending I've seen. Seriously. SHAME ON YOU for using this ending to add dramatic effect. Wait, I've already said that. Allow me to finish up the plot synopsis Actually there's a lot morebut that's not a good thing here. Above the already stupid ideas I've already mentioned, there's an emotionally detached and rich father (Bronson) with reason, a Little Miss Sunshine daughter who yearns for both love and paintbrushes and the now-grown up daughter, Ally, who survived the movie's original catastrophe and barely shows a second of coping. I'm leaving out, literally a dozen more dramatic turns and outbursts, but suffice to say, none of it's worth repeating. You should not remember this movie.I say "SHOULD" because if it weren't for that endingyou may never forget, unfortunately. Obviously: SKIP THIS MOVIE.
Real. Raw. Revenge. Reynolds.Those four R's were my first impressions of my first viewing of this almost 41-year-old cult hit, Deliverance.Backing up, I had actually tried to watch this movie many years ago, and was put off on such disgusting actions from the backwoods hillbillies. I knowI should've finished the movie because, even though the movie was decent up to that point, it gets a lot more real and interesting following the rape.Whoa, I think I need to back up a bit more. The "rape" isn't really a spoiler  and even if it was, again, this is over 40-year-old, so shame on you!  but it is the entire basis of this movie. Four men set out on a rafting adventure weekend by following one of the men's need for excitement/risk.Now, these aren't the greatest guys in the world. This is made very clear in the first act of Deliverance. So much so, I didn't know if I would make it through this viewing as well. I mean, who could I cling to when I hate these dudes? But, I did carry on and during their rafting fun, two of the men get attacked, bound and ultimately raped.In comes to the rescue is another of the men and a decades-before-its-time, male-Thelma & Louise scenario ensues. Now, in these types of movies and adventures, we  me, included  think we'd know how to handle the challenges and cat & mouse situations or even feel how the movies should fictionalize the heroics of the film's protagonists. With that said, I thought it would be more exciting for our "heroes" to do this or that and yet, the end result, or the film at hand, is much more fulfillingand real.Surprisingly, the movie doesn't feel all that dated, and is interesting and suspenseful to the end. I really had a great time here, despite the subject matter and highly recommend it.Also, I simply couldn't get that banjo music out of my head for a very long time Creeeeepy!
I need to start off with: I absolutely HATED the first half of Identity Thief. And thanks to its trailers, I did NOT see it in theatres due to my initial and correct take on it.Yes, the movie's trailers did not fool me. This is a movie about an absolute and incredibly horrible human being who thinks identity thief is a "victimless crime." You have to hand it to Melissa McCarthyShe truly and utterly made me LOATHE her. (Note: not 'hate,' but 'LOATHE.') She delivered, in spades, what I thought the movie would be when I saw the previews or read the reviews.Now, spoiler: She DOES feel remorse at one point, or I would absolutely give this movie ONE STAR. She is such a horrible individual and I am puzzled (in the first half of this feature) if we're supposed to side with her even a little bit.This is one of those RARE films for me that would generate a solid (said) ONE STAR film rating, if not for the second half. Yes, it's morbidly predictable, but, at very least, it made up for such a terrible human being we see in the first half with the second "redeeming" half.Bad girl "Diana" (McCarthy) steals Sandy's, a newly big-business-venture straight up guy, ID so she can continue her quest for nothing. He might lose his take-a-chance job unless he proves both to his boss and the police that he didn't wildly spend seven states over on frivolous things.So, his mission  and the movie's goal, is to get him to fly from Colorado to Florida and drive her back, via road-mishap-trip to Colorado so she can help him keep his new job.Meanwhile, and just to fill the WAY over-long 111 minutes, other characters appear to complicate things and develop more of Sandy and Diana's characters.It's real hard watching this criminal (Diana) attempt to steal our hearts when the movie really misses its true meaning. Take Pretty Woman. Another criminal woman who is so hard to dislike, despite her profession. This film just focuses on the evil in the woman and leaving very little room to care for her.Despite the better second half, the movie is not recommended in the least. It's way too long, way too predictable and way too much relies on how much more repulsiveness they can show from this bad person.I want to see Jason Bateman succeed. I don't want to see his identity stolen from movies such as this.
It's safe to say, I did not get a CHUDDY watching this movie.C.H.U.D. definitively had a pair of effective moments. Too bad there were just two of those and the rest, sadly was either discounted "from around the corner" effects or just plain boring. I have always been curious to see this movie since I was a lad, but never got around to it until about a week ago.Sadly, since that's time has passed (9 days,) I've forgotten most of this movie. Well, it wasn't a great movie anyways. It's boring for long stretches, incredibly cheap horror, humor that falls flat and couldn't live past its creepy opening kill.Basically, it's 1980's Alligator, but with humans, sorta. Creatures from below are snatching people, animals, whatever while inept police decide what to do with it. You can tell this is extreme low budget with the lack of full-on attacks and most are done around the corner, behind a door or in the dark.Today, in 2013, it's not even worth visiting, or revisiting if you've seen this before. It doesn't necessitate a remake nor a recommendation from me, despite two minute creepy moments. (And they don't last long enough to promote a viewing.)* * * Final thoughts: They made a sequel to this? Really? I'll have to check that (off my list and toss the idea of watching it) out.
As a fan of James Bond, but acknowledging its campiness, clichés and formulas, it was extremely refreshing to see a true spy/action movie with a movie star I already respected, but never thought could pull it off: Matt Damon. Damon did a superb job as Jason Bourne in The Bourne Identity as did the rest of the cast. You rooted for him, sympathized with him and despite the past you soon learn to question, you still wanted him to succeed. Bourne is found without a memory in the ocean by fishermen who attempt to help the young man by dropping him off, with a little bit of cash, near a place, Switzerland, where he might regain his identity. There he learns of extraordinary fighting skills he was unaware of and meets the soon-to-be (and obvious) love of his life, Marie. Both try and piece his past together, while formulating a future together, albeit on the run from a mysterious "Treadstone" organization. The action, when shown, is intense, the intrigue storyline is not only plausible, but on-the-edge of your seat exciting, and the cinematography is stunning  I must visit Paris, France soon. The only flaws I can find (though I didn't look for them) was the obvious pairing of Marie and Bourne, their inevitable sex scene, and Marie's accent (and languages) that jumped from one culture to the next. Other than those minor defects, this was a wonderful, suspenseful and crafty movie. I absolutely loved them reverting (as they did with the as-good sequels) from CGI and made me believe in action again and not the green screen. Also, despite knowing there was more than one book this was based upon and knowing sequels were in the works, I loved this was a completely stand alone feature and is absolutely recommended.
Only Stephen King can turn a basically one-room play into a full length novel of horror, originality and suspense. I've read the Misery book at least once and it ranks as my second favorite of his, behind The Stand, and though some things were changed in the movie adaptation and though some things angered King (Caan), Director Reiner did the same job on the film as King did on the novel. He definitively created a full length movie of horror, originality and suspense.After pulp-novelist Paul Sheldon (Caan) finished his latest story in Colorado, he heads home in a huge blizzard only to crash in the snow and be "rescued" by Annie Wilkes (Bates). She proceeds to nurse him back to health in her isolated cabin in the woods since he's severely banged up. Slowly, but surely, Sheldon begins to see the crazier side of his "number one fan" as she calls herself.See, she's upset Sheldon "killed" off her precious Misery Chastain character from eight novels. She died in child birth, not really murdered. Nevertheless, the character that actually never really lived is gone and no more Misery Chastain novels. Telling this to Wilkes is like taking Jason Voorhees's machete and saying "no more killing, okay, Jason?" How do you think Jason would react? Well, aside from a few brutal tortures she bestows on him during his stay at the Wilkes's farm, she namely reacts by making him write/type Misery's Return to bring back the character to life. Not that he had much choice, but he does write it and all the while concocts up feeble escape attempts until the inevitable conclusion.Despite the mainly one-room set, Misery is tight, interesting, beautifully shot and acted by the leads. I remember the Oscars attached to 1990 vividly. Though I was rooting for Dances With Wolves the whole way, it was absent from the Best Actress category. It was tough deciding between The Grifters's Anjelica Huston and Pretty Woman's Julia Roberts. But it was a no-brainer on who actually won: Kathy Bates in the best performance of her career before and since.I sure did love the book (and the book within the book  Misery's Return, that I objected to at first, but then grew accustomed to and interested in that story as well) and as almost always, the book's better than the movie with a lot more going on, including, again, the book-with-a-book. Still, Misery was an excellent example of film-making, and even holds up today after 19 years.Side Note: Though all I said about the novel, Misery, it appears Stephen King went back to the same general idea with Gerald's Game. Unfortunately, after I read that, lightening really only struck once. It wasn't terrible, but nowhere close to Misery and I sincerely hope they don't attempt to adapt Gerald's Game.
Gravity will take your breath away. Literally.This could've been just me, but I was extremely out of breath when I left the theatre. Perhaps, I was holding my breath many times in one of the most exciting and tension-built movie I've seen in a long time. I just thank God Stanley Kubrick wasn't around to direct/write this or we would've been in the theatre twice the merciful 90 minutes and I might have passed out.Now, I'm no astronaut, never studied or worked at NASA or plan a trip out into space, so I cannot comment on if any of the events in Gravity could ever happen, especially since the many, MANY, obstacles that do happen, happen so simultaneously, all that occurred might as well overlapped each other. Now, that does lead me to believe that most of what happened wouldn't or couldn't happen, but then again, I'm no expert. What I can say, as a layman, dumbed down or written in for the excitement, it was one helluva ride.In one enormously thin plot, a doctor had previously trained for 6-months at NASA and heads to space to repair a gadget, when the Russians decide then would be a good time to inadvertently, or on purpose, blow up a satellite causing debris to head toward them. Unlike Star Trek, et al, there aren't invisible shields and this causes all-but two astronauts to be stranded in space without the rest of their crew or a ship to get home in.Luckily  though, it may not seem that way when you watch it!  there are other options in space to get you home and the rest of the movie is just that: The Voyage Home (to swing back to the Star Trek analogy.Visually, the movie is breathtaking  as covered above, the score is decent, the mood nice, I loved the calmness and caring of Clooney's character and Sandra's acting was pretty good. But, the most you'll take from this was the non-stop, science fiction or not, action. Those with heart conditions should literally talk with their doctor before seeing this.On the downside and on the surface, huh, the movie lacks or was just mediocre in every other category. The dialogue, while not bad, wasn't memorable, but for a couple of lines. The story, again, is really nothing but a tiny bit of background and then just a survival story. And some of the very placed debris, i.e. toys and obvious space references, were more REALLY? moments for me in such a serious picture.That all said, overall the movie's genre is probably a 50/50 split between suspense and action, and the movie, once the Russian debris hit, never ceases to provide what the core of the movie is: a suspenseful action film.For moviegoers who like over-the-top tension and fun  and I had both, this is a total recommendation. Especially in LIEMAX. The 3D is just for those gimmicky and REALLY? objects to float towards you with minute exceptions to when something does add to the tension, but those were rare.* * * Final thoughts: Yeah, of course, I was thinking of the film, Open Water, throughout this movie. While that "against all odds, 2-survivors (one male, one female) stranded and adrift in water" movie felt 10x more realistic, this "against all odds, 2-survivors (one male, one female) stranded and adrift in space" film will was certainly a lot more funand heart pounding!
There is one thing you should know up front: I would've never seen this movie if not for the fantastic podcast, How Did This Get Made? Gigli, like its most terrible name, is one of the most forgettable and "nothing" movies I've ever seen. I mean, there is absolutely nothing here you can take with you or grow with or even remember. It contained an almost nonexistent plot, acting forced, cameos that must've made the actors embarrassed and promoted a clear bashing of the mentally handicapped and homosexual communities.I would love someone to challenge me. Please someone write to me and give me reasons this movie exists, for this is what I see from the actors:- Justin Bartha supposedly plays a mentally handicapped person, but it's painfully clear he is just as handicapped as Gary Oldman's a dwarf in Tiptoes. - Benny Affleck couldn't act in 2003, or in the 1990s or today. But, damn, he somehow tries to convince us otherwise. - J-Hoso tough. I guess. But, here, she spits on the homosexual community and tries to convince us the "lifestyle" might be a choice. I spit backto her and the character known as Benny's mother in the movie. - Christopher Walkens onto the set, mumbles his lines, tries to get us to know who he was and leaves before anyone recognizes him. Does anyone know who or what he was supposed to be all about? - Al Pacino? Stop. It's bad enough that you are the King of Mocking Yourself with cameos. (SEE: Jack & Jill later in his "career.") I understand you owe a lot to Director Martin Brest  Scent of a Woman is one of my all-time favorites, after all  but, know when no means no.Funny. I had never even seen a trailer or a clip of Gigli and I knew instantly when it opened in 2003 that I never wanted to see it. Again, one of my favorite podcasts covered this, recently, so I had my homework  to watch it and then listen to the 'cast. But, if you do not listen to that internet program, How Did This Get Made?, then DO NOT SEE THIS.Is it the worst movie ever made? No. It was just so blah and, again, NOTHING. There is nothing to this movie. My guess on why they made this was to get J-Ho and Benny together, much like what they did to Al Pacino and Robert De Niro later in Righteous Kill. Neither movie is good or rememberable and was still backed by ignorant folk.Oh, I forgot (like they did) the plot: Benny's trying to prove himself as a gangsta by kidnapping Bartha's "highly important mentally handicapped" character. J-Ho's sent in to monitor via yoga and sexuality-changing and much less happens until the end. Oh, and Baywatch is to this movie as Judge Wapner is to Rain Man. Am I sad I saw it, finally? Well, it wasn't what I expected. I anticipated a terrible movie with awful dialogue and overacting. Okay, while all that's true, it's so incredibly blah and forgettable, it's not worth even recommending it as a "so bad-it's good" feature.Just Gee-lee your way away.* * *Final thoughts: I recommend the How Did This Get Made? podcast to accompany this if you do waste these two hours on this "film." At least all that effort of staying awake will result in some laughter.
Okay, let's start with: I just don't want to spend too much time on this movie. It was okay for what it was and though it had an interesting concept  past, present and future, with each storyline (or is that Bloodline?) having its own beginning, middle and end  it just really didn't fit the Hellraiser lore, so far.Besides, who could get past the "PINHEADINSPACE!" (said in best "PIGSINSPACE!" voice-over) main selling point? Sure, this preceded the soon to be, laugh out loud trend of putting slashers in outer space: Jason Voorhees in Jason X and Leprechaun in Space. (Did I miss any? No, Critters already came from there.)There's more, though not much, to it. Apparently, there's this Toymaker in France, L'Merchant (Ramsay in three Merchant ancestor roles) who made this box  what's that box's name anyways? Oh! I just now looked it up after having revisited the first four Hellraiser movies: "The Lament Configuration," if Wikipedia's telling the truth  in the 1700s that inadvertently was used to summon a demon. L'Merchant's concerned because, well, that's not the purpose of the puzzle box, but nonetheless, the story begins.Fast forward to present day 1996 (also) France and the demon, Angelique (Vargas  who has screen presence, so probably just did this for the paycheck) breaks free from her "master" Jacques (Scott) and goes after the "bloodline" within (now) John Merchant in the USA. John's trying to decipher the antibody, or cure, or drawling of grandpappy L'Merchant in order to contain light to the demon's (Cenobites) darkness.Here's the one thing I believe I liked most in this ho-hum movie. This "second story" or present day, represents where Part III left off: a high-rise tower in the shape(s) of The Lament Configuration. In addition, it was interesting that this mid-section was as if it were a movie all its own, much like if Creepshow's multi-segments were connected, other than the comic-book narrator.Well, the heroes, or John and his family, are able to thwart Pinhead, who shows up to meet both an heir of The Lament Configuration's Toymaker and the demon Angelique for the first time. Pinhead brings his dog, awww and makes new friends out of twins. Let me stop there; in a movie that's only 86 minutes, not only did most of the movie feel like it dragged on, but when they introduced twin guards into the fray, it seemed not only irrelevant, but just a space-filler.But, I digress, fast forward to the future, on a space station where the last of the Merchants is telling the story to his arresting officer  apparently he went rogue!  in order for him to complete the giant light box to kill Pinheadonceandforall! As expected, it gets cheesy in the closing and falls under the typical bad FX with typical one-two-three killings until, you guessed it. Our (well, new, sorta) heroes confront the (by-this-point overly) preachy Pinhead. Rules bygone, reality and fantasy mix unevenly and we may have the end to the downward spiral of a series Hellraiser has become.This is a SKIP. For any fan of Hellraiser, this is an abomination, irrelevant and almost completely suspenseless  even III had some level of frights. It's not the absolute worst I've seen in any horror part IV, or even one that takes a horror icon into space, but again, it's a back-story of the box that's really not that interesting or relevant.
1. I've seen scarier and even bloodier tampons than Paranormal Activity 4.2. "I think it was really creepy that he came in my bed" might actually sound even creepier when it's in reference to a six-year-old.3. Mercifully, the twenty computers this family owns are each equipped with 160 terabyte drives.4. Having a cute guy's crotch shot in the first few minutes of a movie sounds promisinguntil you see any second of the rest of the movie.5. The "Best Sister in the World" allows her brother to twirl rapidly around immediately following lunch. For her next award, she'll teach him to swim right after dinner.6. Also, in the same family, the Mother of the Year award goes to the mom who neglects their child around water and doesn't even know he's being filmed in the nude.7. At least that mother doesn't have to worry when her kid is pulled underwater for the couple of minutes she's gone. Once he resurfaces, he doesn't instinctively gasp for air and is completely indifferent about the near-death experience. Strong kid!8. There must be job openings at the NSA for people who truly believe computers automatically record their partners.9. Oh, and faulting the computer for recording your girlfriend's every moment, claiming you don't know to stop that and then offering to help set up other computers to do the same thing, doesn't just make you caught, it makes you even more disturbing.10. Sorry you can't kinetic with others? Have a "Space Dance Party"of one.11. Maybe it's just me, but whenever I hear someone say "I have some hot blood and I need to catch some air," I just have this urge to help him out by poking him with a syringe of air.12. Stephen King should be less angry about the screen adaptation of his The Shining and more about the blatant rip off of this film's kid riding around on a Big Wheel.13. Apparently, beds that jerk violently on their own are the very ones scared children jump right into.14. Somehow, by this fourth chapter, the cliché of loud bumps everythreeminutes of screen time is supposed to frighten us. Of course, the clichés don't end there15. "I got an 'A' on my chemistry test" cliché. "I'm going to the mall to return something" cliché. "I can't even work this cell phone" dad cliché. "Don't let the bed bugs bite" to almost asleep kids cliché. "Sorry! Wrong house!" cliché when caught trespassing.16. I'm guessing most teens these days that almost get run over have the inbred reaction to curse the car's model rather than the driver.17. There's irony in the fact they chose boring Henderson, NV as a location verses its more exciting neighbor.18. This family is so lucky. Thanks to shitty editing, they can teleport all over their rooms.19. It only takes nine days for the dad to figure out that every laptop in the house is open, running 24 hours a day and recording. Man, I would've gotten away with murder as a kid in this house.20. The Kinetic never DisKinetics in this house.21. If kids leaving out toys or cats darting across you cause you to breathe heavily for several minutes, please don't ever have children or pets.22. When you're angry at your spouse and still plead with him to come back upstairs at 1:31AM, it's probably not best to ignore his incomprehensible rants and the fact he's holding onto a large butcher knife.23. Rumor has it, it's perfectly normal to be dragged across the street by an invisible being, while being able and stable enough to be filming for whatever reason and screaming for your mother and father in a neighbor's house they've never entered before.24. Once again, I have to thank America for caring so little about intelligible scripts, professional acting, meaningful depth, original ideas and spending money on this crap. How the Jersey Shore movie hasn't been made yet is still a mystery.25. All I learned here is: young boys are extreme perverts and ghosts never know they're being filmed.
Although the two movies have almost zero in common other than the word in the title, Nicolas Cage's Drive Angry made me a lot less angry than Ryan Gosling's Drive. But, then, I have very little patience for extremely slow moving "disguised action" movies, such as the latter.Drive Angry absolutely wasn't anywhere near as bad as it should've been. Sure, I would've liked to see one or more Cage Outbursts he's known for and he had little to none here, and the obvious 3D effects stood out like a sore thumb in the 2D version I saw, but for the most part, I had fun.Mostly thanks to William Fichtner's The Account character. What was funny about him was that when he first showed up on screen, I rolled my eyes at the overexposure I've seen of him lately. Thankfully, my attitude changed 100% in two seconds of him on screen. He became as likable and funny as Tom Hiddleston's Loki from the Marvel Avenger films.From that moment  when he arrived very early in the movie, I waited each scene for The Accountant to pop up again. Not that the rest of the movie was just okay, he just lit up the screen and if you see his character, or Fichtner's portrayal, you will most likely agree.So we have an escaped con from down under and he's being chased down by The Accountant while he's chasing down his infant grandchild being held captive by a cult. Meanwhile, Piper, a blonde, is along for the ride. No real motivation for her being the film or the sidekick to the con played by Cage, but, maybe because, uh, she's a blonde.The action was fun, the lines okay and the direction straight, which I prefer in these types of sly action R-rated fair. Many times they try to overcomplicate films likes these and lose a lot of the target audience that would be attracted to it. Mercifully, they knew it was just a little higher-budget B-movie and never strayed.Not perfect, but a fun Saturday Night, stay-in flick.* * * Final thoughts: Every once in a while, the gang over at the hilarious How Did This Get Made podcast will throw me a curveball. Typically, actually, more accurately, 90% of the movies they cover for their show that they spend an hour or so ridiculing, are badREALLY bad. And while they do love to include Cage in all his outbursts, this movie, again, had little of those Cage moments that I've come to love. "OH, NO! NOT THE BEES! NOT THE BEES! AAAAAHHHHH! OH, THEY'RE IN MY EYES! MY EYES! AAAAHHHHH! AAAAAGGHHH!" anyone? Finally, the podcast did point out some funny moments and proved that, yeah, it is a B-movie, but I still had a blast here. If not just overall, Fichtner would be enough to sell me on this.
Last year I had a hard time coming up with #1 on my Top Ten of 2011 list and even though I ordered the top four, it was pretty much a 4-way tieuntilI finally saw 'The Artist' (5/5 Stars) or a better title: 'The Masterpiece.' I'm not going back to change my list, but this is by far the best of 2011 and one of the best movies I have EVER SEEN. I can't even count the number of attributes to the beauty of this film, but I'll try: Originality, gorgeous cinematography (yes, even for a B&W film), great dialogue (yes, even for a silent film), perfect acting all around, depth, chemistry, hope and just a sincere pleasure to watch. One of my favorites, not listed, was the ability to move the story along without an intertitle card. The acting, gestures, story and fantastic score moved us along so brilliantly, we could just rely on the actors vs. the obvious spoken words. All players, er, artists, were having so much fun recreating a great era of cinema you can see it ooze out of them with each facial expression and body language. This is, indeed, a masterpiece to be enjoyed, studied and watched by all who enjoy true cinematic works. Actually, just make that everyone should see this. My bet, before seeing this, was that it would win the Oscar for best Picture. After seeing it, I feel it should also win best cinematography, actor, actress, screenplay, score, and sound. It would be a crime if it didn't.
Tammy excels in giving us the same: a bad, bad woman surrounded by characters that actually see something in her. What they see is what most of wouldn't: anything resembling a person we'd wanna be around.I miss the other road trip movie starring Susan Sarandon: Thelma & Louise. In a lot of ways, this movie ripped off that masterpiece of filmmaking, but without the humor and depth. Sure, there were a few funny moments here, heck, even a couple of touching ones, but it was so hard to get in tune with those since the title character was such a horrible human being.This movie reminded me a lot of Identity Thief where we has an enormously, uh, bad person, Melissa McCarthy, who somewhat, but barely, redeems herself in the last second of the movie. Both movies had me favor the second half while hating on the first half.Basically, complainer Tammy loses her job and decides on a road trip with the woman she loves/hates, her grandma, in order to, I dunno, do really nothing with her grandma's money. Watch as she shows her redneck, uneducated self while falling for an average joe (Mark Duplass, whom, I've always had a thing for) who's way out of her league and then care when big-feet might be in need of real care.Oh, and it's about getting to Niagara Falls, which I've been to, and was born just a half hour away. Since I have that and my love for Sarandon in common, I should love this movie.But, I don't. though I didn't hate it and again, I liked the second half way more than the first. Unfortunately it was not enough to save it from Tammy, such a horrible and stupid person. I'm guessing Melissa was like: Well, people want the same, why not keep shitting these out?The box office disagreed, and you should, too.* * *Final thoughts: While more harmless than her other features, Tammy is just the same: bad people getting away with bad actions. If you like that, more power to you. I'm just happy it wasn't a 2-hour comedy like most overlong comedies are these days.
(WARNINGThis is the Adult Disney Review Series. I have 51 Original Disney Cartoons to tackle, plus multiple  and forgettable  direct-to-Disney-Video misses. My goal in 2012 is to brave the task of watching all, many for the first time and commenting on eachall with an adult POV. Now, as soon as I can find an adult to do just that)As a kid, I loved the tail of Pinocchio. Some of the more exciting scenes, such as the climax, or the Paradise Park Place, were frightening enough to make me want more. And it was a cartoon  I was allowed to watch those!Fast forward many years, say under a hundred, but more than 30, I'm revisiting for the first time. It's a sweeping improvement over Disney's first outing  Snow White, as in how most creative teams usually fair. It's also more kiddish, which I believe to be the key in making a Disney animated film.And even though it's aiming low, i.e. children, it literally contains enough stories and adventures for several movies. I loved how it just kept going  the many misadventures of a growing boy and his mistakes.It was also rather bold. For 1940the word "Jackass" is used. Kids are smoking and drinking. Kids are turned into slaves and caged. And Disney flooded the movie with his signature subliminal messages, once again. Hell, the movie opens with the books in the background screaming at you: Look at what I'm gonna make?! Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland! (Also see John Carpenter doing this in Halloweenname the movie!)More so, two characters are singing "An Actor's Life for Me"  replace actor's with pirate's. And I wonder if there's a connection between bad kids becoming donkeys, i.e. a political statement. Hmmm.I digress, it was a rather fun movie, gone are the pacing problems from the first Disney feature length and it's responsible for a gag I'll always remember in Airplane!  Leslie Nielsen's nose growing. And finally, it's rather funnyA dozen or so coo-coo clocks are honking and Geppetto (the toymaker/father) asks "I wonder what time it is?" Also, he's so oblivious to anything, everything, anyone, he's comedic classic.Overall, it's not perfect, and is waaay too preachy, but it's still a lot of fun and for being Disney's Round Two, it packs a punch.Best Quote: Concerning a Wishing Star "Very lovely thought, but not at all practical"says the talking cricket.Nowonto Fantasia
I've been told that Troll parts 1 and 2 are two of the worst movies ever made. Though Troll 2 almost fits that mold to the tee, Troll (the original) isn't quite as bad as one might think.Oh, yeah, it's terrible  the Harry Potter Sr. dance segment that was, incredibly, put in the film's trailer, proves that. But worst? Nah. It's just a throw-back eighties tongue-in-cheek little goblin/type that's probably best watched while using a little of the "natural" drugs much like what's shown in the film.And before we move forward, I know I'm late in the game in seeing Troll, my first time on Thanksgiving 2010  my way of recreating that Turkey Day feel from the old MST3k days, so I'll barely knowledge the "Harry Potter" reference. It does seem rather odd that he's in the literary world. Hmmm...But, I digress. We have this kooky to begin with family of four moving into an apartment of kooky tenants and immediately the little girl, Wendy (Beck, who strangely resembles Heather "Carol Anne" O'Rourke from Poltergeist) gets abducted and then impersonated by the little fella who's main goal, aside from mischief, is turning the apartment green. Wowhe was way ahead of his time.Harry Potter, Jr. (Noah Hathaway) investigates with the aid of a new and strange friend, Eunice St. Clair, but, as most of these movies go, time's running out! Troll/Wendy's going from apartment to apartment and turning both the residents and their pads into Fantasyland. Will the original Harry Potter (Jr.) step it up and stop the madness in time? Or will he fail, igniting a sequel that contains neither any continuity nor trolls, even?Aside from some gruesome scenes that are basically harmless in 2010's children's mind-frame, it's basically safe fantasy fare. Not a recommendation, but that's hardly saying anything when it's doubtful kids to young-adults would spend five of their minute attention span on this dated (and mostly laugh-out-loud puppetry) troll tale.
Man, I love incredibly smart, prepared and omnipotent characters, such as Hannibal Lecter (The Silence of the Lambs) and Catherine Tramell (Basic Instinct) to name a couple. Also, I like both Gerard Butler, despite his string of too many bad to mediocre films and Jamie Foxx (ditto.) So, why was Law Abiding Citizen justokay? Let's skip to the end and state, it's the ending that did it in. But, we'll get to that later.Basically, this cat'n'mouse movie is like an "adult" Saw flick. At least, it starts off that way. And speaking on how it starts off, what's with all these recent movies concerning vengeful fathers out for justice when their daughters get kidnapped or killed? (SEE: Taken, Edge of Darkness and now this, Law Abiding Citizen.) Again, I'm getting ahead of myselfSo here's the basic synopsis: Engineer Clyde (Butler) is having a nice evening at his home with wife and daughter. In (and out of the blue) arrive two men who stab, rape and kill both mother & daughter. Despite the bad guy's efforts, they're arrested and after one makes a deal, the other gets the death penalty.Fast forward 10 years, and as the deal maker, State Attorney Nick (Foxx) watches, the accused dies an unusual and cruel death. Immediately, the previously freed man on his plea bargain is suspected and before he could be apprehended by the police, he's caught and (literally) cut up by said-vengeful father, Clyde.But, Clyde's a clever one though. It's established fairly quickly that Clyde's in control. He's out to out-smart Nick, the police, city and most importantly, the system. One by one, Clyde makes Nick strike deals while Clyde controls things on the outside and people die. Make that, they die outside and inside of prison, all so that Clyde can make a point. Will he outsmart everyone, namely Nick? Let me state, I liked the movie, namely because, again, I like omnipotent characters, even when they're considered unrealistic. On the flipside, I think it's more fun when you don't know too much (i.e. Michael Myers in the original Halloween or Tramell in Instinct.) And that leads me to the closing. I can't spoil the finale, but I will say I didn't care for it and I doubt anyone else, who made it that far, will, either.On the technical side: though not 100% original, the plot's really not that bad, the acting's okay and the dialogue's average. Let's make that, thanks to the closing and revelations, the entire movie becomes average. Still, I will recommend if you believe in vigilante justice/revenge.
I've said this before, and I'll type it again: only see this Austin Powers sequel once.While Austin Powers in Goldmember has its moments, such as the terrific opening credit scene (the best so far,) they are so few and far between making some of this movie's unbearable.I didn't heed to my own warning, and this is the second time I've seen it. But, then, I don't like to write reviews on movies I haven't seen in awhile. This one being almost 7½ years.This time out, I got tricked. After being somewhat disappointed in Austin Powers: The Spy That Shagged Me  comparatively speaking to the brilliant Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, I was pumped up after the now-established opening dance scene. And I thought this would bring the series back on track. Unfortunately, it only goes straight downhill after that.Austin captures Dr. Evil immediately in this chapter, but learns through a Hannibal Lecter/Magneto meeting that another Mike Myers's creation, Goldmember, is on the loose to cause havoc. Austin must race, literally, back in time, this time in the 1970's, to thwart Goldmember's plans. Back to the year 2002 he goes and everyone's where they're supposed to be situated to make an Austin Powers movie.A few things have changed: Austin's dad (Caine) plays an important role, Scott becomes more evil while the always-scene-stealer Mini-Me loses some and more history of Austin and Dr. Evil's past is revealed.Sure, the movie has its moments. Some parts I did laugh out loud. But for the most part, it was definitely getting stale, the jokes recycled and the newest, uh, member, Goldmember ,was unbearable to watch. Yeah, I know a lot of humor is gross-out jokes, but when he eats his skin (sorry, I never caught that spoof/reference) it's beyond nasty.Again, it's worth maybe one viewing, but I have to almost say skip this one and pray, if they make a part IV, they'll attempt to reboot the series back to its hilarious roots. At least come up with some new jokes.
I'd say 'Jingle all the Way' would be ONLY watchable for children under 4, but even then its incredibly bad messages sent and shameless product placements means it shouldn't be viewed by anyone.And to boot, the actions portrayed mirrors life a little too closely, unfortunately, such as someone macing someone for a Christmas item. Sound familiar?What started off as a family-friendly and touching turned nasty to the core. Or bore. This fits in about when Arnold Schwarzenegger went south and fast. Much like what happened to his state, and eventual life, I suspect.Nevertheless, this should be avoided as is its messages.
Man, I didn't care for the first Mission: Impossible movie, but that's another review. Where part one dealt strictly with the spy business and forgetting action almost all together, part II was the exact opposite. (SEE: Mission: Impossible III where they finally got it right.)Be prepared to be bombarded with SLO-MOOOOO scenes and roughly 50 fake-face/gotcha scenes. Okay, 50 is steep, but after the 8-9th time, it'll feel as much. Get past that and you have a decent action flick with a wonderful (so-called  at the time  retired) Anthony Hopkins cameo, the gorgeous Thandie Newton and sly Dougray Scott. Also the score was good and soundtrack was awesome with one of my favorites: Take a Look Around by Limp Bizkit.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is on holiday (love that non-American way of stating: vacation) when he's called back to duty to get a virus which was produced so there can be a cure. SeriouslyI've seen this several times and never really followed why they needed to create a virus in order for them to have a need for a cure.Yeah, money, duh. But, the initial scientists were working on the right side. Anyways, Hunt has to recruit people for his mission: Nyah (Newton) and his signature buddy, Luther (the always fun Ving Rhames) and someone else that I don't even remember so it doesn't matter. There's double crossing, global hopping and again, slow-motion scenes withdoves (or was it pigeons) flapping around for "style" I'm guessing.It's a no-brainer film with some big budgeted scenes. It's fun if you let yourself go and leave your brain at the door. The series won't be complete or worthwhile until the next installment.
1. And God said: "Since AIDS didn't teach you, I bestow 'Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1' upon you." 2. The cast's acting ability is equivalent to a possum under attack. 3. Shouting out "You did THIS!" to a man who recently impregnated his wife isn't just insultingit's obvious. 4. While playing chess, it is appropriate to gleefully proclaim: "I win!" like a five-year-old verses the oh-so-ancient "checkmate." 5. According to the morals of somewhat-writer Stephanie Meyer, it is acceptable to kill humans as long as you're in the healthy position of playing both judge and executioner. Long-live mormons. 6. If it was previously okay for someone over 100 to woo someone under 18-years-old, then I guess the same could be done for a teen to an 18-minute-old infant. 7. 'Twilight' contains as many vampires as the Republican Party contains Christians. 8. Within 3-seconds of the start time, Jacob rips off his shirt. Release the horny and lonely 50-year-old moms! 9. Werewolves tend to get sick at the sight of blood, apparently. 10. You know you have script problems when George Lucas, himself, has dialogue suggestions. 11. The original subtitle of 'Breaking Wind' was questionably rejected. 12. Soap Operas, left and right, are being cancelled and yet this has a theatrical release? My apologies, World. 13. Mercifully, to cut some costs on lighting, the moon is full in every night shot, despite the continuity of scenes. 14. If this is the Anti-Abortion-Advertisement it screams, I will pull the hanger myself. 15. More got accomplished in the 16 Republican debates than in two draining hours here. 16. I've heard the same bed that breaks in the movie during Edward and Bella's sex scene happens in the book. Big deal; I used to call that: Tuesday Night. 17. Worried your unborn child might become a demonic offspring? Turn to Yahoo on an Apple laptop for all your answers. 18. Who knew a pack of talking dogs could be this funny, outside of Pixar's 'Up'? 19. The Mayans calendar has been recalculated to narrow the end of days to 2/11/12. In a completely unrelated story, 'Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1' is being released on video that same day. 20. Wincing as hard as you can and uttering the line: "Why can't you see how perfectly happy I am?" isn't the most believable pose to convince someone they're good in bed. 21. Finally, a movie I can agree actors deserved a $30 million paycheck. Isn't that the going rate for a soul? 22. I believe in Guilty Pleasures. Although, to call 'Twilight' that, would only be half-right.23. Some women are undeniably psychic when it comes to pregnancy. For example, Bella acts constipated for roughly 2 weeks prior to her actual conception. 24. I admit: I've never been to war. But, I can imagine watching this is what it's like seeing someone's arm getting blown off.25. Howcananyonekeep a straight face with dialogue such as "'Kind' is my middle name"? 26. Pitching a movie in Hollywood should always take longer than the writing of the screenplay. Right? 27. Breakfast of champions: Chicken, Peanut Butter and Vomit. I wonder if she's pregnant. 28. Failed attempt at positivity: It's not as bad I thought it would be. It's worse.
Chop, chop, how was this not directed by Tony Scott?And even though Safe House starred Scott's long-time male interest, Denzel Washington, I'm more referring to the consistent and nauseating zoom-in's and epileptic shaky camera shots. Mercifully, Scott doesn't make the whole experience into a seizure, but this director, Daniel Espinosa nearly shook the film right out of the camera.He's pretty wet behind the ears, so hopefully with this somewhat unsuccessful box office zturn; he'll step back with more ease in the future.At any rate, this Bourne-Rip-Off follows smarter-than-thou Washington as Ex-CIA Tobin Frost selling secrets for many years and his own planned capture pits him with newbie, Matt "promote me, damnit!" Weston (Ryan Reynolds) and off they go fighting killers who want a damaging file. Oh, and the duo dead would be nice for the assassins, as well.Sadly, the CIA's tracking room  the suits who rarely get dirty, that is, mirrored the Bourne films, but completely without energy or a solid performance. In fact, in place of the fantastic Joan Allen from The Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum was Vera Farmiga's underwhelming and, frankly boring role. This was sad, because of the two recent hits I've noticed her in, Source Code and Up in the Air, I thought she was excellent and I even wanted to go further into her catalog. This setback won't completely deter me, but damn, she was bad.I only point her out, because of her past great performances. Everyone else, including the lead, Washington, were pretty, well, plain. Heck, even Robert Patrick underperformed and appears to have aged not so well. The one stand out, and this surprised me, was Reynolds. Despite his clichéd character, he did show depth and we could carry on with his plightagain, in spite of his recycled role.Overall, the movie wasn't as terrible as I'm making it out to be; it did have its moments. It's certainly a no-thinker and the bouncy action was incredibly hard to follow at times and an absolute annoyance, but for staying in on a Thursday when you have no money until the next day's direct deposit, it's worth a viewing. A, as in one, viewing.
I ended up seeing Office Space three times in the theatre with three different groups of people. Absolutely not to discourage anyone from seeing this, but no one thought it was funny. Make that, they specifically stated they "didn't get it." Of course not. Not one of the three groups actually worked in an office. At that time (1999,) I had only worked in a cubicle work environment for 3 years (sadly, to date, it's been now 13 years) and I already knew how true this movie was. And still is.Office Space is divided into three separate movies: 1. a live-action Dilbert film, 2. A fantasy, one that most of us office drones dream of, and 3. real life, for the most part.Personally, I loved the whole movie, but it does lose steam after awhile. The fantasy part, or mid-section, is a little over the top. Yeah, I get the main character, Peter, doesn't care due to an unfortunate blessing in the first part, but what he does (i.e. pulling down a banner in front of everyone) to show his distaste for the place would be pretty much an immediate termination in the real office world. Then, again, that's why that's the "fantasy" part.The movie begins with Peter on his way to work, stuck in traffic and you immediately know he's unhappy in life. Peter arrives at work, a software company, and things continue to go downhill. In fact, things never pick up until his possible-cheating girlfriend convinces him to go to a hypnotherapist who promptly gets Peter to forget his worries, enjoy life all the while having a heart attack. Peter is so relaxed, it doesn't faze him that a man dies right in front of him.Peter's attitude positively changes as downsizing begins in his firm and due to his (finally) real honesty, he gets promoted (this, of course, falls under the fantasy segments) and his closest hard-working buddies get canned. To get back at the company, Peter organizes a (literal) Superman III plot of stealing half-cents, which of course turns for the worse. (As a life-long Superman fan, and Part III ranks as an absolute guilty pleasure of mine, I always enjoy that segment.) Oh, and all the while we have Milton (the character, like Dilbert, was reason the movie was made) who always threatens to burn down the building and waitress Joanna (Aniston  who, again, can never rid herself of "Rachel" from Friends) who is the object of Peter's obsession.There is a lot more, but let me tell you this: this movie is so incredibly true with its characters from an office, the real-life situations (man, did they have a camera in my offices I've worked for?) and the politics that follow. Currently, I now have seen this movie probably two dozen times and laugh out loud while shaking head each time.Sadly, not only do I know many of the workers in this movie in real life, I resemble a lot of them myself. Peter, mainly, but I do, unfortunately, share qualities of a few others. One I don't, however, is the love for rap music. That, and the movie wandering a bit in the mid-section, is my only distaste for the movie. There's more music that could have been entered into this movie, but they chose rap for the entire movie.That said, everyone (but, of course, "Rachel" once again) did a great job, especially Cole (as the boss) and Livingston (as Peter.) I already thought Cole did an excellent job as "Mr. Brady" in the Brady Bunch movies, but here he does even better as 90% of bosses I've worked for. As for Livingston, he did such an incredible job at the character he was portraying, it was almost depressing on how much I see myself in him and his speeches. Unfortunately, I can't live in the fantasy world he visits (in the middle to end of the movie) because, this is, of course, real life and I do need my job.As for the quotes! Every job I've worked for, every department I've been "moved" to, every employee/friend I've encountered knows these quotes, any quotes, by heart. I could say "Hello, **enter in any name**, what's happening?" "TPS reports," "PC load letter?" "O-face," "Case of the Mondays," "Did you get the memo?" "Is This Good for the Company?" or "I have a meeting with the 'Bobs'" and every single person I encounter will know exactly what I am talking about and laugh. Even my bosses. The only other movie, comedy or not, that I can say that about is Airplane! and even then, not everyone know those quotes, Shirley, but they know Office Space's.This movie ranks very high on my favorite comedies of all time. I honestly don't think you need to work in a cube, but I guess it helps. Tell me how many times a boss hasn't come up to you and said what they said to either Peter or Joanna? It's funny in the movie, but so incredibly sad that it happens in real life. I mean, is there a book managers/supervisors read or forced to read that tell them to say some of this crap? (Side Note: I understand this is fiction and a spoof, but if you were to rob your business on the day you're scheduled to be fired by planting a virus to shift fractions of a cent into a credit union account, would you seriously check the bank balance at an ATM? Sorry, I just thought that was funny. Nice job on the sunglasses, though, Peter.)
The Sound of Music was my choice this year to replace the boring super bowl game.Every year I pick one movie (or sometimes a couple) to watch while everyone else on planet Earth watches the super bowl. I thought, after previously buying this on BluRay and having it for some time without having watched it on BluRay, I thought it just perfect for that Sunday, February 2nd. (Oh, and in case you were wondering, my other yearly tradition was fulfilled earlier in the day when I watched Groundhog Day on BluRay.)Despite my intentions, i.e. replacing the "manly man" sports programme with a musical, this movie was an absolute JOY to watch. Every second, every frame, every scene, every songfrom beginning to end had be on the edge of my seat. (And yeah, I did sing out loud the songs.) Now, this is only my second time ever seeing this and I'll get into my first time many, many years ago later. So, it was almost like me seeing it for the first time, again.It did help that the BluRay transfer was nothing short of a miracle. It made it look pristine, brand new and possibly even better than its initial release nearly 50 years ago. (I say possibly since I wasn't around for its first run.) Every inch of the screen (and mind you, I don't even have a TV that can give me the best BluRay offers  720dpi) was immaculate.But, then again, so was the movie. I am not one to look for flaws in this movie, but an hour in, I had to pause myself and think: this movie has no flaws. Everything worked. To put it in 2014 terms: Everything *was* awesome.That said, I will say this, despite me granting this 5/5 stars (or 10/10 on IMDb's scale) and calling it nothing short of a masterpiece, I guess there was one tiny bit where it slowed down, towards the end, when it got serious. It had to, so it's not necessarily a flaw, per se, but it also didn't necessarily mesh with the previous nearly 3 hours.Honestly, it pains me to say one word against this fine piece of art. It was so magical, so wonderful, even the thoughts going through my head as I write this are filled with joy. I loved this movie. The music, the acting, the surprises and the humor  and amazingly, there was a lot more than you would expect, especially jokes that hold up today.If you haven't heard the story by now, it was a story of a nun that didn't belong until she was assigned the status of governess of seven children of a widowed father pre-WWII in Austria. There, she warms their hearts, unfreezes the father's and discovers herself. We're just blessed to go along with her journey.I hope you've seen this movie before. If you have, see it again. If you haven't, you must see it. Above all else, to either group of individuals, go out and buy a BluRay player (assuming you haven't already) and then buy this movie. Even cold. Buy it on BluRay and relish in the beauty and wonder of The Sound of Music.* * * Final thoughts: I was born 9 years after this movie's release. Hard for me to believe that as I now think about it. I grew up, or at least into mid-teens, listening or hearing the songs from the soundtrack which I loved. I didn't necessarily associate the songs from the movie, untilI cannot remember when, but our local movie theatre chain here in Phoenix, AZ, Harkins, played this movie for twenty-five cents as some kind of anniversary of the movie theatre chain. (Prices from when both the movie and chain opened.) I thought: well, I've never seen it, it's considered a masterpiece and why not view it on the big screen for the first time?Almost immediately in the movie, during the opening credits, they play an instrumental medley of multiple of the movie's songs. I sat up instantly thinking "Oh! I know that song! I didn't know it was in this!" and repeated that thought a couple more times. It was then I was thoroughly excited to see the rest of the movie.While the movie, songs, etc, didn't disappoint, the print did. It was an original print filled with scratches, a pink tint  many discolored scenes and cuts. There was an unintentionally laugh out loud scene for me when Julie Andrews was on one side of the room and suddenly the movie jumped to her on the other side. I remember thinking: "I didn't know they could teleport way back then!"I gave the movie the strong benefit of the doubt (of the original print in the projection booth.) I really did like it a lot.Fast-forward maaaybeee two decades to two months ago today. I watched it for the second time. I don't want to say it was the perfect quality of the BluRay disc, but I fell in deep love with this movie more than I can express in these words above.The gorgeous disc did help, that is. And not every BluRay comes out half as good as this one did.So, please, if you're even remotely interested in this, or want to reclaim that initial feeling you got from your childhood seeing this, BUY THIS ON BLURAY. You will not regret it.
You know that plan the cornered innocents always seem to come up with, after an hour of either relentless bickering or being picked off in horror movies? You know there's still about twenty minutes left, but you always find that THIS PLAN WILL WORK, no matter what, right?I do. I fall for it everysingletime. I think that's the fun of it. And, by the time that inevitable scene appears, I'm so overwhelmed with countless failures, blood, gore, craziness, anarchy, treachery and unreal conditions, that I guess I WANT more than anything that one in a million chance will work. Because, things have to even out, right? The good guys have to win in the end and we have to get back to normal!No spoilers, but Feast's premise is like countless other TRAPPED SURVIVORS movies.** - A group of assorted stereotypes find themselves hunted, disbelieving, alone, confused, argumentative, disconnected from any communication, outgunned and cornered in some kind of shelter, i.e. From Dusk Till Dawn or Night of the Living Dead.But, that's just the premise. While the movie centers around a desert middle-of-nowhere saloon and vulture creatures circle and attempt to get in for a, ah hem, feast, there's plenty of originality and fun to be had inside. (Fun, if you're into extreme gore, pain, suffering and never knowing who gets picked off next.)And speaking of freshness, one of the brightest spots of the creativity in Feast, was the comic-book introductions of the characters as they appeared on screen with spoilers of their fate. Or were they spoilers?I would have never even remembered this 2005 (limited in 2006 in the USA) horror "comedy" existed if not for co-hosting a podcast with a friend that recommended this injunction with the same director's (John Gulager) Piranha 3DD we were discussing. So, kudos to him since I found this movie fairly enjoyable and probably one of the most grossest and vicious TRAPPED SURVIVORS films.There's not much more to this movie except the aforementioned location and a group of diverse individuals attempting to survive when the universe's most brutal and sharp creatures attempt to get in. The entertainment is how they cope or their lack of managing unity.Early in the film, one of the baddies gets in and goes berserk beyond most horror films I've seen, it sets the scene for how much carnage and peril these victims are in store for. And for some of their sakes, being dead from an attack, or feeding, is far better than surviving.Feast is for die-hard TRAPPED SURVIVORS and horror fans. I honestly can't see this movie branching outside that group, but it's still one helluva ride.
(Spoilers  in fact, this movie should be watched by all before any reviews read. Experience it first and then learn so much more.) It pained me when I heard that M. Night Shyamalan compared himself to Alfred Hitchcock. Where Shyamalan's movies are simply dreadful, half-assed, slow and contain hilariously bad scripts, Hitchcock remains the master no matter what year you watch his films. 'Psycho' is my all-time favorite Hitchcock film, and one of the best suspenseful movies of all time. It has such depth, both the intriguing (even today) story and characters, never a dull moment was experienced here. And talk about before his time; this movie was ingenuous: The main character is not only enormously flawed (a Hitchcock staple, and one I love so much about his films  see: 'The Birds') but she dies half-way through the feature, leading the way to another, more iconic main character: Norman Bates. I personally wasn't around in 1960, but I'm sure this caused quite a stir with its graphic scenes (by today's standard, this is PG) but I'm glad they didn't just go for the gore. The story, acting, cinematography, and especially the incredible score, were all brilliant. Everything about this movie is excellence, and I am glad that this and that famous shower scene is studied in film classes. This is what movie-making is all about. Marion is attempting to "escape" with the man she loves by stealing $40,000 to pay off his debts. Though her "inner-voice" gnaws away at her since the theft, just as her conscious gets to her, Bates and his mental illness (shown superbly and believably by Perkins) puts an end to that. Everything works in this masterpiece. In fact, books could be written about all the angles this took, and I'm sure they have been.Side Note: I live in Phoenix, AZ, and despite it being hot for a good 6-7 months out of the year, it's rarely, make that, I've never experienced a hot day in mid-December like they supposedly said it was in this film. Perhaps they made it in the summer, or they've never visited Phoenix before and assumed it's always hot. That is the only "flaw" I detected in this excellent film, and even that's really no big deal.
Within 24 hours, I watched both Sharknado 2: The Second One and Into the Storm. I am seriously debating on which one was worse.The most suspense I got out of Into the Storm was my constant worry that Nathan "Trey" Kress was underage. I kept telling my movie buddy, "Oh, at least 18! He just has to be!" For the record, mercifully, he's 22. I am safe and no longer a perv. But, the rest of the movie was perverted in a different sense  to the soul.I cannot simply recall a time in a very long while that I literally had convulsions in my seat from the wretched dialogue. It was truly like nails on a chalkboard and I know my movie buddy can vouch for me: this script made me literally squirm in my seat on how terrible it was.Take the dialogue, Principal Obama, the poor man's Batmobile, the 20- years-too-late redneck humor, the Twilight-level acting, the enormously foreshadowed and predictable scenes/actions of the characters and the absolutely, albeit unintentionally, hilarious dramatic scenes  trust me when I say: I had to contain my loud roar of laughter during the "sad" and "heartfelt" scenes and you might have the contender of worst movie of the year. But, wait, there's more.Granted, I am not a fan of the cheap (in more than one way) filmmaking gimmick: Found Footage. This movie is SUPPOSED to be found footage, but as the movie progressed and I started to laugh harder at the film, I couldn't help but continuously speak up every scene or two: "Who's filming this shot?!? Now, who's filming this scene?!? Wait, this is a great shotwho's filming this?!? They are about to DIE by drowning and the camera is still runningand working?!?" It was like rapid fire for awhile as I "enjoyed" myself while laughing at the movie.The film follows the same inept documentarians as seen in Spice World, a storm "studier" played by the fantastic Sarah Wayne Callies (of The Walking Dead fame) who should know NOT to be in this crap, the clichéd distant father and two kids who skip graduation to "film privately" in an abandoned building. Don't get any ideas  all characters in this movie were written by a time-traveler from the 1800s. How this didn't get a G-rating is beyond me.Oh, and occasionally, or maybe rarely, a twister will pop up. In a movie that's supposed to be all about great CGI, a new, ah-hem, twist to Twister and at a running time of only 89 minutes, you'd think you'd see more active tornadoes. Nope. Twister came out 18 years ago and contained more inventive and realistic tornadoes than this flick. I had heard this movie may not be good, but I still go into each film with an open mind. I thought, at very least, I would be impressed with the monsters from the sky. Again: NOPE. With a split second rip off of the drive-in scene from Twister in the opening, you might as well show up to this movie 40 minutes late to see anything of substance in the FX department.Practically every turn of this movie either made me cringe  almost violently shake or just burst out into laughter  and not at the supposed humor the writer was trying to convey. I honestly think I was sore at the end of this movie with how badly my body reacted to the way the characters acted, spoke, showed up on screen when I knew they would, acted like adolescents and spoke like no one would ever, EVER, speak, high schooler or adult.This movie is considered a "Disaster Film." Finally, something the Director and I can agree on.* * *Final thoughts: Going back to the beginning, at least it was nice to see Nathan Kress on screen and I do love watching Sarah Wayne Callies as she has left The Walking Dead, but this movie is absolutely unwatchable. Hardly a "So Bad, It's Good." But, maybe, I say that now since I just saw this today. Perhaps, I should give this a year or two and revisit for some awesome drinking game.
I have one request that I know will fall upon deaf Hollywood ears: Stop at The Bourne Ultimatum. Please. Stop screwing up wonderful trilogies, movies series with an overkill part IV. This series doesn't need it. The Bourne series has a wonderful, realistic, suspenseful and near-perfect storyline that began with Bourne floating in the ocean and ending with this movie. Though part 2, or Supremacy, wasn't bad, hardly at all, it was nothing compared to the thrilling conclusion of the trilogy. Bourne's still railing over the loss of Marie (in Supremacy) while getting closer to unraveling his sordid past. We take up his journey across the globe and learn new secrets and clues along with him. All the while, the film's action packed, but with a brain, or, a well-scripted plot. Again, we have Joan Allen, one of my all time favorite actresses outshining the rest of the cast. I loved the cinematography, I loved the dialogue and the fight scenes were top notch, and as I mentioned previously with part 1, or Identity, it's awesome to see a true action movie without obvious CGI-scenes. I loved how they took the time to make a true spy thriller with real scenes in which I believed the characters to be in real danger. Okay, now the bad: you'll sure have to shut off the suspension of disbelief momentarily in certain scenes. Such as when Bourne is being chased on the roofs while chasing someone on the ground he's trying to protect and happens to keep up marvelously with her and when he exits a multistory car crash drop and gets out very little shaken and barely stirred. Overall, extremely recommended as the end-credit song that appears in all three movies: Moby's Extreme Ways. A fitting song and one of my favorites.a
How is it that Daniel Day-Lewis isn't one of my favorite actors?He was brilliant in There Will Be Blood. He elevated that movie from a very good movie to a great one. He did the same for Lincoln.If you don't believe him as the 16th President or as someone who cared more about everyone being equal or as someone who wanted the bloodshed over during the Civil War, then, I'm sorry, you're blind.The movie, Lincoln, is not only Director Steven Spielberg's return to greatness, it's a very sad statement that after over 150 years, very little has changed. Of course, aside from the Republican/Democrat political change-over, it's the same back then as it is today. Heated debates, strong views and uncompromising votes still plague us today as it did back then. Mercifully, we had pure-at-heart Lincoln to do all he can for the better of all mankind.Yes, the movie is slow. Sure, it's riddled with heavy dialogue most of us, including myself, couldn't understand. And it contains just as many characters I could possibly keep up with (or learn about) as about three times the number of Dwarfs in The Hobbit. It didn't matter, to me. The movie was so elegantly made, so beautifully shot, I was enthralled so much I trusted everything they presented to me as truth of what really happened back then.As long as Lincoln was alive, all that he did, learned and accomplished was not highlighted here in this film. The movie focuses on Abe's plight to ensure the 13th amendment gets passed so that both the Civil War ceases and that all slaves are set free.I absolutely loved his intelligence, his compassion and his drive to ensure his vision of where we should be gets accomplished. He knew the game, the political one. He knew how to play everyone like chess pieces, but that didn't mean it would come out right. He took chances, sweated long and hard and without showing it, I know he prayed as hard as he could to make sure the just way prevails.You cannot help but look up to this man. It's sad to say, but he was so ahead of his time, his views still aren't completely felt today. Maybemake that, hopefullysomeday soon, all humans will be treated equally. I pray to God that happens in my lifetime.If I can get all this out of a movie, I know it was done right. It was acted and presented to me in the best possible manner. Though it's not my favorite movie of all time, or even, in 2012, it's still a great movie and if it does end up winning the Best Picture Oscar, I can certainly understand and not be disappointed.Now, if Mr. Day-Lewis loses the Best Actor Oscarthen there will be blood, indeed.
Funny. Not to begin with such spoilers, but Total Recall (2012) seemed to accomplish in two hours what George Lucas spread too thin over three over-long Star Wars prequels. (Yeah, that's a plot point giveaway.)In a movie that's basically just one long chase scene with oodles of CGI backdrops, Total Recall (2012) seems to completely wipe out all the heart, fun and excitement of the 1990 original. Sure, the Arnold one wasn't exactly what the book's author had in mind  Mars, anyone?  it still was one of the most enjoyable action/sci-fi flicks I've ever seen and one of the best Schwarzenegger films. This onethis visionwas so realistic it made the adventure way too drab.I was about to write the synopsis of this reimagining tale, and even though it's only been done one time before, who really doesn't know the story of bored future worker, Doug Quaid and his journey to "Rekall" to implant fake spy memories? All hell breaks loose and he's being chased by two women, a corrupt leader and a rebellious underground guy. Same ole, same old? Well, sorta.This is probably just me, but it was hard for me to tell the two women apart, they looked so similar. Yeah, yeah, it was just me, but I believe and will stand behind, that was a poor choice to cast both Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel in these roles. The movie, as good as it looks, is so overrun by special effects and futuristic designs, that I had to constantly remind myself which girl was the good one or bad one.I miss the 1990 version. Absolutely it was pure 90s and a Schwarzenegger vehicle, but I "rekall" a better ride with more depth, characters I cared for, surprises I didn't anticipate and funnier lines. The writer here must've known that and, though I appreciated the two minute scenes of homage, I think with more time on the story and less on I-Robot droids, we would've had a better project to want to see again.For, I didn't hate this, but I never, ever want to see again. Much unlike the 1990 original I've seen dozens of times.
They've got to come up with better subtitles. The same word showing up in the main and subtitle should never be done once (Hellbound: Hellraiser II,) but twice? (Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth) What's next? Hellraiser: Hell in a Handbasket? All Hell Breaks Loose: Hellraiser? Or just: Ah, Hell, Another Hellraiser? (Actually, there'll be more in the future of the series: Hellseeker and Hellworld. I don't think those were as clever as mine.) While they're at it, they should pick up a better screenplay writer. Or reboot the series, despite a lot of people's distaste for reboots/remakes. Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth, though not a horrible movie, would've been best served shelved and then rebooted two decades later.In the same lines of other 1980s and early 1990s horror franchise sequels, comes Pinhead's third outing in which now the box is bestowed upon a TV reporter, Joey (Farrell,) in the Big Apple who must trick Pinhead  for some demon, sorry, Cenobite, he's pretty naïve  in the ghost world of Pinhead's alter-ego Captain Spencer so Pinhead can be defeatedONCE AND FOR ALL! Seriously, they were making this up as they went along. But there's a little more to the thin story. Joey's trying to make it big in the news, so she's trying to crack a story after witnessing a exploding victim of the puzzle box everyone in the Horror Movie world should avoid, much like saying Candyman 5x in the mirror or going into the waterwhen they tell you there's a shark or piranha in there.Meanwhile, Pinhead's pinned to a post and copying from the movie's two predecessors, he needs someone to bring him blood so he can escape. No problem  these Hellraiser movies are chalk full of fools. Needless to say, he escapes, and there really is Hell on Earth with the biggest blood bath totaling more deaths than the first two movies combined times six.I admired that about this movie. Not only was the subtitle (lazy, though) accurate, but with the very limited budget  what producer really thought his/her return on investment would be high, anyways, so aim low  they did an effective job at mimicking Superman II's NYC Street Fight. (Yes, I'm aware it was Metropolis in the Superman flick, but NYC was always the inspiration for NYC.) In addition to the street scene where Joey must flee Discman (I actually liked that one) and other foes, the club attack was pretty impressive, for what it was. If you're into Slicing'N'Dicing types of horror movies.The lines were weak (SEE: Hellbound: Hellraiser II's much better display of Pinhead quotes,) the special effects  though slightly improved (SLIGHTLY)  weren't quite there yet and the sound quality was awful, as was the acting. The sequel's definitely inferior, and they literally just made up new rules or new scenarios to fit the screenplay that had to take all but 15 minutes, which included a 10 minute break, to write, but it's recommended for ONLY die-hard Pinhead fans. You could do worse.
I heard tears in the crowd, if that's possible, during 'Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close' (3/10 Stars) and believe it, I was "extremely close" to weeping myselfif only. IF ONLY, they didn't stage the climax 25 minutes before the end of the film  one of my pet peeves. Granted, this gave me enough time to compose myself before I exited the theatre into the lit movie theatre hallway. But, that's the thing with this movie; it almost felt like they were intentionally trying to get you to cry or care. Eh, I don't go for that. Neither did I go for that kid, Oskar (Thomas Horn.) Before I offend anyone, he may or MAY NOT have Asperger's Syndrome  it's only briefly hinted at in the movie. Since it wasn't a clear case  or at least what the film told me, so I will say, for the most part, this kid was a little prick. Supposedly, we're to see that he touched more lives in NYC following 9/11 than the actual firemen who risked (or gave) their lives and his response to that is: that he doesn't care about the people he inspired, he doesn't want friends and he wants just to find a locked box his (9/11 Victim) father MAY have left for him following his tragic end. I definitely felt more for (the other movie) Oskar in 'Schindler's List' than this little tike who cared way more about himself and his adventure than anyone else, namely his mom he condemned to death. That said, I know he was hurting, I get that, and that's part of the reason I choked up (but not enough for tears), but the things he said and did to people were pretty heartbreaking  and not in a good way. Finally, while the movie was well shot and the performances were good (note: not great), it's far too long, horribly paced and not a movie I would ever want to see again. Just like the newscasts from 9/11. I remember the past, and all those who died, but it's just too hard to see that again.
When the mean-spirited, horrible characters, including the "innocents," in The Sitter turned all lovey-dovey and "lesson learned!" it was too-little, too-late, I'm afraid.Take one of the best gay-acceptance scenes/speeches I've seen in a movie and it almost grabbed me. Almost made me start warming up to the movie. Almost.You see, you just have to remember the first half of disgusting chaos. "The Sitter," Noah (Johan Hill,) puts three kids into extreme harm's way to the point of locking him away from society until he's 99 and it's all for the most obviously bad "girlfriend" in film history.Sadly, it's not funny, it's not adventurous and it's not original. The loser Noah is coaxed into babysitting a menace bomb-dropper, a pill-popping Macaulay Culkin clone and a sex-crazed little girl. None of them have personality, none you want to root for and none are a bit realistic to think these three would ever share the same roof. Further, after you already begin to despise the sitter, you will not want these punks to succeed either.I mentioned he did this for a bad girl. Well, it goes beyond that in a rush. He has to go buy cocaine and, of course, takes the kids with him into the "gay underground" of drug dealers. He "has to" buy the cocaine to impress his witch and maaaaybe, she'll have sex with him. If the kids live through the experience(s), that's totally incidental to him.As for the gay acceptance  thanks, Jonah, for portraying that pretty well, but what happened with all the other scenes of extreme stereotypes and sad gay characters, including one of the most annoying queens on wheels since the birth of cinema?When the movie kicks into "moral" territory, i.e. when the sitter realizes he needs to lighten up  I think that's the message?  he continues into obscurity and outrageously irresponsible behavior, such as "justifiably" stealing a car, and never once are consequences brought up.Movies and their characters are just getting meaner and meaner. Darker and darker. It shouldn't be a coincidence this was released to video mere weeks after the other decadent Project X, where morals are tossed, consequences be damned and kids are feeling more frisky by taking irresponsibility to the Devil's level.People might comment that I'm taking these movies too literally. Well, I do believe there should be a level of accountability that's hardly shown. Beyond the whole Natural Born Killers film, there's a certain small scene I will never forget in 2001's Bully. The bad, BAD, kids at the end are being questioned in court and they're bickering back and forth like a Seinfeld finale as if nothing they did was wrong, or their fault and onlookers starred at them in tremendously sad disbelief. If this were to appear in one of these mean movies, especially Project X, it would've changed my whole perspective. Both that movie and this one end with our "changed HERO(es)" and how they all-but ride off into the sunset without the slightest bit of remorse or any punishable consequence. I look at films like these with the same sad disbelief.Poor Johan Hill. He was just nominated this year for an Oscar. Perhaps this is his Norbit.
You think writer/director Tim Burton and Every(which way)Man Johnny Depp were soul mates over the years and seven movies. Here, in Edward Scissorhands, their first collaboration together, it's as if they were beyond soul matesthey are like one.Even when you get past the absolutely original and wonderful character "Edward Scissorhands," Burton and Depp created one of the most touching, funny, original, colorful and adventurous bedtime stories this side of The Princess Bride. But within that, there is a regret they added adult scenes  meaning a tad bit of gore and humans in peril, but also language. Other than those, this would be one-hundred-percent for all ages for all the ages. (Yeah, I'm calling it timeless, even 21 years later, it holds up today.)Oddly enough, in the "Dr. Suess" type/50's Technicolor neighborhood created here, sits a mysterious castle that no one seems to ever visit or act curious about. Even when it's not a mile away from the other residents, but practically on top of them. Nevertheless, Peg (Wiest) does her darnedest to sell her Avon products and when all else fails, she enters the château and finds the loner  Edward, a man with scissors for hands.Kindness overcomes her and she takes him back to her home sparking the obvious curiosity of the neighborhood hens  a type of person I seriously cannot stand (more later.) Edward's mystified, curious, nervous and grateful for the attention from his newly adopted family made up of the norm: Mom, Dad, Son, Daughter, only the daughter's away.Her absence doesn't escape Edward who's definitely smitten with her from the photos. And besides, he's got the entire town of hens to woo him as he's the newest "gossip" piece for them.It's not a stretch to see where their attention is heading, and yep, it goes southfast. Too bad for Edward  he didn't ask for this and he's obviously innocent throughout the ordeals. Meanwhile, daughter, Kim (Ryder) returns and is both suspicious and curious at the same time. Also too bad for Edward  she's got the Biff Tanner-Type Boyfriend, Jim (Hall) and he's not the sharing kind.Even mentioning the word: Frankenstein is just too obvious for both this movie and for any Burton fan. To be honest, this glorious, fun and moving picture takes Frankie to a whole new and creative level.Almost everything in this movie works: beautiful and perfect score by also long time collaborator Danny Elfman, gorgeous colors/cinematography and wonderful acting by the leads, but also the supporting cast  SEE: the always masterful Vincent Price, in his last live action role. In addition, the script is wonderful, the moods are pitch-perfect (the first snow dance and the "Hold Me"  "I can't" scenes get me every time) and the atmosphere is just flawless. Even when the "starting point" idea behind the movie isn't the most original, the execution from then on was one of the most original concepts before its 1990 release year and to date.I state all these praises even when the movie wasn't 100% perfect. Burton sure loves to use those washed up old 1980s actors, such as Paul Rubens, but in this case Anthony Michael Hall. Here, he does what he needed too, but I felt he did it with a little too much push. In addition, though it was crucial to the plot, the movie contained two of my biggest pet peeves: Hens & the Media. I CANNOT stand women (or some men) who have nothing better to do but gossip, talk & create drama and attempt to drag others down to their pitiful level. Unfortunately, I deal with them in my life on a daily basis  enough I need to consistently separate myself physically from their claws. Also, the media who's only purpose is to feed both fear and additional drama into these no-life desperate housewives, while destroying anything or anyone in their path  in this case, Edward.Now, that all said  with the necessity of the evil Hens & the Media and the low point of Hall's performance, the movie still receives my highest honor of 5/5 stars. I could go on much further on how enjoyable this little tale, this brilliant bedtime story can last generationsbut just take my word for it: if you have yet to see it, go and buy it now. Don't rent, don't Netflix. Just buy. Even before you watch it; you will not be disappointed.
Look, listen. I defend a lot of remakes, redo's and reimaging films. Most are actually bad, some are priceless. The best thing I could say about 2011's Fright Night is: At least it's better than the pointless and horrid 1989 sequel. Butnot by much.PLEASE don't watch this movie if you're a fan of the 1985 original. Or, softer: for those Fright Night virgins, watch the first movie even if this might still work on a miniscule level. The only thing this movie had in common with the first movie was: A> the title. B> The Character's Names and C> There's a vampire living next door.Those three qualities take about 1/1000th of the script. Fill in the blank with new, too serious material. I mean, the original was CAMP, pure and simple. A lot of comedy, some horror and fun. This one takes it too deadly serious, plus they added too much of the annoying "CW" atmosphere. That kiddie, 90210, trend is really starting to get on my nerves. It's not working for people my age, and according to the box office receipts, it's not working for the teen crowd either. So, Hollywood, please dump this idea of bringing back classic horror to the "CW" absent movie-goers.I haven't even got to the worse part of this movie: The reimagining of the great character, Peter Vincent, now played by a third-rate Russell Brand-Rip-off, David Tennant. He was absolutely awful. It would be in the same category as hiring Pauley Shore as James Bond. Of course, this is coming from some who loved the original Roddy McDowall version. But, besides that, for those who haven't even heard of the original, he was still incredibly lame.This also goes for the quickly-turned "Evil Ed" character. I do like Christopher Mintz-Plasse, but he's certainly no Stephen Geoffreys from the 1985 film.This movie's a mess. It had a great scene of the family being evicted by the neighbor vampire and their journey to the Las Vegas strip, but other than that, it's a complete waste of film. It took the original movie's idea (new neighbor is a vampire and kid-Charley Brewster must defend his girl and kill the monster with aid of vampire killer, Peter Vincent) to a new depth of boredom. There's only one Night that's Frightful. Watch that one and skip this atrocity.
In this bridge movie, Feast II: Sloppy Seconds, is so over the top, so crazy and inhumane, it's a wonder the movie actually kept it's pace and direction.Happening immediately after the events in the highly superior original, Feast, comes a (has to be a lesbian) biker chick who's bent on avenging the death of her "sister" in the first installment. This leads her and the surviving bartender to a desolate Texan town who's about to share the same fate as the little cowpoke saloon that's barely standing after a brutal creature attack.More survivors, unbelievably even less desirable, less likable and less moralistic, sorta band together in any/all hiding places to this instant ghost town. All the while more creatures lurk about, supposedly hungry and yet rarely takes more than one bite out of a human, waiting to prey on the human ants that sprout in multiples of directions.Will this group work cooperatively? The Feast franchise would be starved if they did.Okay, they certainly up'd the ante on the gore, blood, comedy and craziness and further they all-but bought their one-way ticket to hell with one scene. (Kinda Spoiler; skip to the next paragraph to avoid, if you wish) Think: the opening to The World According to Garp.But they also altered the original "Intro Comic Book" dialogue to include funny and fantastic backdrops. That was raising the bar and hilarious.Much like the first TRAPPED SURVIVORS film, the movie doesn't officially pick up until about the half-way mark and honestly, I wasn't fully invested until then. Once all was established, this film, this unbelievable combination of being both rational and chaotic simultaneously, actually draws you in with stupidity, fun, gore and of course, the more than occasional naked breasts.And as mentioned, damnDAMNthese characters, all of them, are all despicable. Heck, we even felt for a character or two in the SAW films, even when they were bad, bad folk.At any rate, the movie was a satisfying continuation to the superior original and as OUT THERE as the last ten minutes were, it was one of the best rides I've had to a horror finale. If this series ended with this one, I wouldn't have minded.
Since it's been a few weeks since I've seen this and I finally have a chance to sit down and write my thoughts out, I figured I would go to the movie's trailer online to refresh my memory. BecauseI had completely forgotten everything about this lame comedy.When the trailer, itself, has zero humor, originality or any minute display of chemistry between the two romantic leadsit all comes back to someone that had to endure the morning sickness known as: The Back-up Plan.Yes, it all came back to me. I remember watching this overlong, been there/done that and clichéd romp and thinking: IS THIS A COMEDY? I recall not laughing one single time one hour in and then clocking zero laughs until the finale.I will be honest, I didn't absolutely hate this movie, but I recall having zero emotion during it. Every single scene in this movie has been done one million times before and with far greater results. I remember these leads looking so disinterested in each other they might as well hated each other off screen. I sure as hell did.In the almost nonexistent plot, gorgeous gal somehow can't find "the one," meaning she wants, above love and a relationship, someone to impregnate her. So, she gets artificially impregnated. Insert hilarious meeting the man of her dreams in which she will hit all the clichés: hate him up front, lose him, find him, argue with him, fall for him, the lie will be revealed, the break up, the make up, the end.Besides bringing zero to the table, these filmmakers/actors sins run deep with adding no comedy or romance to a romantic comedy.If you've ever learned how to turn a TV on or buy a movie ticket, you've seen this before. Avoid this at all costs.* * * Final thoughts: Nope. Not on my radar. Ever. But, thanks to the great guys (and gal) at the How Did This Get Made studios, I added this to my playlist so I can listen to them ridicule it for about an hour or so. It was worth it, if just for the ridiculing.
Much like Batman Forever should've reversed titles with the following Dark Knight sequel: Batman & Robin, Final Destination 5 should've switched with its previous installment called: The Final Destination.Forwe hope this is the last one.Now, that's not saying I didn't have a good time with this film. The first time I saw this, I had a blast. Perhaps, I was in a really good mood that day, or the 3-D was finally satisfying. With this (only) second viewing, I was more: meh.Perhaps it was the very poor CGI, especially on the opening bridge scene. Or the all-over-the-place and mostly ridiculous plot. Yeah, I know; we're talking a 'part 5' here.And speaking of a fifth horror sequel, very little new was brought to the table. A young male, Sam (Nicholas D'Agosto) has a horrible vision while riding a bus on a company sponsored outing that everyone was going to die while on top of an about-to-collapse bridge. So he attempts to take as many of his peers and sort-of-ex-girlfriend with him off the bus and to safety. Completely and unexpectedly, and yeah, I'm being facetious; they die one-by-one since they were supposed perish anyways on the bridge accident.Sure, there is a little humor here, namely by sex-crazed, kiss-ass Isaac (P.J. Byrne) and boss Dennis (David Koechner) and there's a few gross deaths, but up until the end, the surprises and creativity are gone. Like I said: up until the endingWhat made me give this a solid 5/10 stars wasn't just that Nicholas D'Agosto is so damn cute  oh, wait, I didn't even mention that yetI loved the ending. I don't remember if I 100% saw it coming and I honestly don't think I did, but the clues are out there to what the ending (no spoiler!) will bring. Especially when you see this a second time. And hilariously, one of the clues I DID catch first time around, but thought it was a major movie flaw.If you're a fan of the Final Destination series, you might like this one. Even if you're getting tired of it, you might want to just watch this quick episode if only just for the twist ending and, of course, Nicholas D'Agosto.
I think I wanted to like The Place Beyond the Pines more. Following the days after my viewing, I did view it more favorably, but, ultimately, stuck with my initial dead-end rating of the film. (5/10 stars.)Of several concerns I had with the movie, the main one was the length. The movie went on and on and on and I get the need to tell an original and in-depth story, but there was so much that could've been cut here to make it tighter and more engaging. Not to mention  and this is just my own point of view, I was thoroughly invested in the first story (of three intertwining fables) with Ryan Gosling and when that abruptly ended 50 or so minutes in, I was disappointed.I'm getting ahead of myself here. The movie's three chapters involve a nowhere-headed circus act who finds out he's a father and then becomes a criminal to somewhat support said child, a "decent" policeman who's trying to get promoted and finally, two kids who are byproducts of the first two chapters.Really, in 140 minutes, I just summed up the entire experience there.Okay, now I can move on. Where was I? Oh, yeah, I got emotionally involved in the sad sack in story one and when that chapter ended, I was  also  sad. So, with no choice, if I wanted to finish this movie, I had to re-engage with story #2, even though it was less interesting. True, it was a bridge, like most part twos of trilogies, but at that time, I didn't know there would be a third section.I am being completely biased here and, perhaps a bit horny  ha  but the son of one of these men, "AJ" (Emory Cohen) was so cute, at least I had something after two hours to keep me interested.Normally, I wouldn't review a movie or mention someone I find attractive, but damn, after what seemed like four hours, I needed something to keep me awake. It was painfully obvious where this film was headed so the incredibly slow and deliberate pacing made finishing this a chore. Giving me an "AJ" was at least a gift to finish the film.Overall, stepping back, this movie was, in fact, original and was interesting enough to watch with fairly good performances and cinematography, but it's pacing and length would never necessitate a second viewing. So, I would recommend only one viewing and then move Beyond the Pines.
Call it an instant guilty-pleasure, but I really enjoyed 2010's movie TV-update: The A-Team. And, probably not coincidentally, I had the same immediate feel for 2009's other TV-update, G.I.Joe: The Rise of Cobra, as they're both completely unrealistic, both contained over-the-top and impossible action segments and both incredibly silly.Both were incredibly entertaining, as well.I had fun with The A-Team even though I couldn't possibly believe a single "plan" Hannibal constructed. You just have to know both what you're getting yourself into and the source material. Granted in the original TV show's lore, no one ever died  trucks or tanks could be rolling down one hill and off another, yet the victims/bad guys inside would suffer a majorheadache  and here, plenty perish. But, besides that, the language and the theme changing, it's along the same tracks.Theme, I mean, the whole concept. The show dealt with the elite renegades who helped the innocent, for a price, of course. Here, SPOILER!, they introduce the characters (Oh, we're back to G.I.Joe: The Rise of Cobra, where they told the origin of, well, Cobra) and finish with them moving into their signature vigilante mode.Okay, if you can forget the change of concept, people actually die, the language, you'll also have to get past B.A. being a little too E.Z. and a new Hannibal. No one could replace the late George Peppard, and Liam Neeson, the movie's Hannibal Smith, is a fantastic actor, but aside from maybe one crack of the voice and Peppard's signature cigar and lines, Neeson does not channel Peppard. Not one bit.Fine! Get past all thatoh and suspending your belief beyond beliefand you'll enjoy yourself. I hate to call this the male-Charlie's Angels film, because it almost is (SEE: Tank-Landing.) The big difference between Team A: The Boys and Team C: The Girls, is this movie contains leads you care about and had depth. Charlie did NOT produce someone that couldn't double as a Hooter's waitress, where as I would put my life in these guy's hands.After a fun opening, immediately establishing the well-known characters, the boys of company A get "talked in/out" of invading Bagdad for stolen money plates. They're set up, oh no! and they spend the rest of the film trying to stay one step ahead of multiple adversaries and prove their innocence.There, I just gave you the VERY basic breakdown of the entire film. There are a lot of holes to fill in, such as The Great (Prison) Escape, love interests and plans, plans, plans. Needless to say, it's a Brain-at-the-Door film and a lot of fun. Personally, I love super-human characters, and these are those guys. I am also a traditionalist that loves to see the good guys win  really, that's not a spoiler  and especially win due to a well laid-out plan. (SEE: the marvelous Ocean's Eleven (2001,) though, not quite the "good guys" but ones you're rooting for, nonetheless.) See this movie. Don't expect too much, and you love their plans that always seem to come together.
I will admit I had a string of emotions for Paranormal Activity.First, and foremost, it was a deep laughter. I couldn't stop laughing. I kept thinking they got the title wrong because you wait sooo long for any activity to happen in Paranormal Activity. Then, I was simply bored and began to fall asleep; so I guess that was a mixture of boredom and exhaustion. Finally, I was upset that, even at its extremely minimal length (and action) that I even bothered to waste about an hour and a half of my life watching a poorly made 5-minute YouTube video stretched way too long. We'll call that one frustration. (Another emotion I simply made up, and thoroughly annoyed my roommate, was whenever something bumped or ohhhh moved on its own (like those scary keys or that door!) I shouted out a fake scream, or the old "OHHHH" like the ghosts in cartoon past.) I guess if one is scaaared of what bumps in the night is a demon that follows you around, then maybe, MAYBE you might be frightened. But really, watch The Exorcist for more depth, horror and suspense.I'd like to go back to my initial reaction. I seriously laughed my ass off. I am so glad I didn't see this at one of those midnight showings. I'm sure they would have kicked me out.In addition to the numerous "MICAH!" shouted out every few minutes  finally someone topped the number of times "JACK!" and "ROSE!" was screamed in Titanic, there were an abundant of funny lines spoken. My personal favorite was: "Maybe we shouldn't have the camera." I shouted "YES! I agree! I'd rather watch the old snow on TV like in the much better Poltergeist!" We have this enormously dysfunctional couple who, just as partners, decide to move in with each other. I've been told prior to the viewing that he's mean to her, and she carries some demon with her from place to place. I agree with the second part, though I wish the demon would've got to her before the movie began. I don't agree with the first part of the synopsis. He is not mean to her; he reacted like any rational human would (as I would have.) In addition, she held back a huge part of her  this ooooh floor stomping demon, and he called her on it. Her defense was: she didn't want to tell him on their first date, so he asked why not up to the 30th date or when they decided to live together. That's right. She was wrong.I'm giving this movie too much air (screen) time. It's a very boring, very slow and very funny movie for someone with $50 and a camera. Virtually nothing happens, but this male-half decides to film anyways. For 86 agonizing minutes we hear and see something that could be part of any Junior High Haunted House kiddie fundraiser. If this was just that and my fifty cents went to help the kids go to college, I would still ask for my money back.The only thing I can say that's nice about this is that I applaud yet another fantastic ad-campaign, like Blair Witch's, I am happy they avoided trickery in making the audience believe this was real. Fool me once Don't see this movie. Don't see the inevitable sequel. As in the movie where a lot of the video shown was fast-forwarded, that's what you'll want to do as well.
Well, I enjoyed the two action sequences in the two plus hours of Iron Man 2.That's an exaggeration, but not by much. It wouldn't be so bad if the plot could sustain the rest and for the most part, it didn't.And that was the biggest problem with Iron Man 2. Along with the poor editing and the excessive character additions, like the original Batman series, the rushed and over bloated storyline really weighed down the movie. Sure, Downey Jr. did his best, and was a real saving grace, but even he had to realize this movie was not up to par.(Spoiler Alert, but needs to be told as it's the majority of the film) Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is dying due to his heart device, acquired in the first Iron Man, that's poisoning his blood. Oh, sorry. That's plot A. Plot B is about the Government wanting the "Ironman" weapon. C involves a secret spy and her not-a-secret boss from another comic book. As for D and E: two revenge-seeking/Stark hating males for alternate reasons. And F is for the conflicted (and replaced actor) friend of Stark. Did I leave any out? Oh, G is for a Walt Disney-like Daddy along with the normal Daddy-Issues. And H is for Giveaways, Charity, Crossovers and a suicidal daredevil.On a personal note, and I'm generally criticized for this  who cares, it's an opinion, I cannot stand Sam Rockwell. Sure Moon was a somewhat good movie, but it wasn't Rockwell that drove that feature. Here, again, he looked out of place and was just plain boring. Like Downey, Jr., he did try, but had an enormously unsuccessful presence. Despite my personal feelings, still, I got what character he was trying to portray, but we've all seen these evil, revenge-minded and jealous corporate guys at least a dozen times before, but with a tremendous amount of believability, pizazz and villainy that Rockwell didn't come close to possessing. Heck, even the unoriginal and obvious villainous character, Obadiah Stane (played by Bridges from the original Iron Man) had the right qualities Rockwell lacked.Though I have a neutral opinion on Rourke, I sincerely felt him miscast in this role and like Rockwell, overshot his "bad guy role." It is written that he spent time (visiting, I suppose) a Russian prison and even more time attempting to learn his Russian lines. He even went as far as wanting to do the whole movie in Russian! (Director Favreau thankfully disagreed  he was hard enough to understand when he did speak English.) In probably the worst scene in the movie was their attempt to recreate the Batman/Joker interrogation scene from The Dark Knight. It didn't work as a rip off, nor as a scene on its own. I forgot to mention the not-at-all-funny bird fetish Rourke's character had was his idea. Perhaps he should come back down to earth after his one-time-only great performance in The Wrestler.The rest of the cast was so-so to great. Favreau was funny but his one-man fight seemed so Lethal Weapon 3'ish while Rushman (Johansson) fought off half a dozen or more men. Speaking of Johansson, or her character Rushman, she was great when she kicked butt. Unfortunately those scenes were even fewer than the overall action of the film. Paltrow was so-so and mirrored Vicky Vale (Basinger from Batman) with the number of screams and over-acting/reacting. As previously mentioned Downey Jr. was excellent and kept his scenes going. In fact, for die-hard Downey Jr. fans, this would be a definite recommendation.Overall, the movie felt rushed (and was,) but thankfully due to the always great Downey Jr., the always impressive technology (loved the suitcase,) crossovers (think shield in addition to S.H.I.E.L.D.) and the (good) few and far between action scenes, the movie's worth a viewing. Not on IMAX as I did  I wouldn't go that far. It's more expensive, it's not in 3-D and you get a letterboxed version of it. In fact, it would not be the end of the world to wait for this enormously inferior sequel to his DVD/Bluray.
One would almost forgive 'Shark Night 3D' for just being a Bmovie w/ a budget creature featureand it would've been just that pending they didn't add what they thought to be a "smart plot" half-way through. And I'm a sucker for Bmovie creature features, i.e. 'Piranha 3D,' but this one attempted to one-up and instead sunk depths. It's laugh-out-loud devilish plan to get skinny college idiots on holiday back into the waters once it's discovered a lake contains multiples of sharks is just plain stupid. At least, 'Piranha 3D' took the victims by surprise and that made it at least remotely realistic. Mercifully, it's incredibly short, but still should be avoided by all. 1½/5 Stars.
I hate to say this, but watch Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me once and only once. I wish I had.The reason I say "I hate to say this" is because there are a lot of positives about this comedy-sequel. Such as the introduction to the now-iconic Mini-Me, Madonna's wonderful single: "Beautiful Stranger" and there are a lot of absolutely hilarious scenes in this movie. But, unfortunately, they are somewhat few and far between.In fact, speaking of which, like Myers's other series Wayne's World, part one is drop-dead hilarious while number two, is well, as a whole, number two.Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me takes place immediately after part one, showing where Austin left off with Vanessa and Dr. Evil frozen. Of course, the doctor's coming back, now in tow with Myers's other creation: Fat Bastard and his smaller-clone Mini-Me and the same gang from part one. Dr. Evil's new plan is to steal his "mojo" in order to cause harm. He must travel back in time, with Austin at his heels, to do so. It's not easy to describe the entire plot, but that's the gist. The fun in the movie is just to go along for the ride, but, again, just once.Unfortunately, the movie seems like a bunch of skits just spliced together (such as a "rap video") with no real direct plot and a lot of real stepped up crude/vulgar humor. It's a fun event movie, released in 1999 at the heels of Star Wars Episode I, a movie it sincerely mocks. At least Austin one had a direct plot. This one was just made for fans.It's worth watching, if only for Mini-Me, a young Ferrell, Lowe as a pitch-perfect young-Number Two, a scene involving definitions of male anatomy and a lot of time-travel-paradoxes that mock other time-travel movies. But for originality and solid humor, it's best just to stick with number one.
Suck it, MacGruber. No, really MacGruber is one of those extremely rare films that starts off terrible and slowly, but surely, gets progressively better. In fact, I almost turned it off once our "hero" comes out as a blatant homophobe. Well, it wasn't just that, the movie sucked up to that point and a little further in the first 20 minutes or so.Then, something changedit actually got funnier  I literally found myself laughing and enjoying myself more as the movie advanced. And the addition of the Kristen Wiig character, Vicki, helped a lot and once Val Kilmer's Dieter Von Cunth was fleshed out, it got better. Further, even MacGruber's own homophobia was explainedas it is in real life. (No soap box here, but suffice to say, whatever you hate the most is mostly likely something you are struggling within yourself. I'm not saying he's gay, but)At any rate, as this is a spoof (and based on the short Saturday Night Live skit), we have the typical super-human/super-dufus ex-militant who's called back into duty to stop his arch nemesis, Von Cunth and his acquisition of a nuclear bomb on US soil.Unfortunately for MacGruber, in one of the most hilarious scenes, his band of heavy armed with heavy arms are killed and MacGruber must rely on Vicki and a "young" military guy, Piper (Phillippe). The rest of the movie with them attempting to stop the bomb plays out like an extremely raunchy and male-nude-fest version The Naked Gun series.My advice: make it through the first third. Forte as MacGruber makes it fun, but Wiig and Kilmer (whom I normally don't like) steal the show. It's almost harmless fun and very hard Ror perhaps that was just the Unrated version I saw.
Damn. I hope this doesn't happen to Man of Steel. I hope they don't frontload it with comedy and dedicate only 20% of the movie to action/adventureespecially in a SUPERHERO movie.Some movies, particularly comic book adaptations, don't put the title in the beginning of the movie, and when you finish with Iron Man 3, you'll know why. Okay, I'll just tell you: the original title had to be TONY STARK, because the film's trailer showed you Iron Man more than the film itself.That's kind of unfair, albeit only slightly exaggerated. But, for the love of Marvel, it would have been nice to see an action-packed Iron Man movie. Hell, I would've settled for an adventure with Iron Man flying around.To the movie's credit, it was pretty dang funny. I laughed out loud and enjoyed Robert Downey Jr. once again as Tony Stark  when he wasn't a baby, that is. And when the few moments of action did appear, it was pretty exciting, though nothing spectacular.Further, to the film's recognition, were the excellent special effects. It's always fun to see Tony's virtual reality toys.Sleep deprived and sometimes stupid Tony challenges a terrorist to a fight when his best bud gets hurt in an "attack." For the majority of the rest of the movie, Tony plays detective to track the most obvious of villains and connections since his first movie in 2008.The screenplay lacked an additional couple of necessary re-writes as the plot holes were everywhere. In addition, and as mentioned, the film holds no surprises whatsoever; whenever a scene appears  and you know exactly when that will happen  and we're supposed to be shocked, it comes out as more of an eye roll. And furthermore, the motivations were questionable, the doors opened by the script were barely closed and if they were, the answers were too easy and the cast, with the exception of Downey Jr (of course) and an incidental child, had almost zero chemistry or charisma.And while the humor was incredible at points, and had some good old fashioned references for people my age, it got a little overzealous with the slapstick. Namely from one character, whom I cannot reveal as that's way too much a spoiler. But, then again, you will see almost every twist coming, so you'll know soon enough who was just funny enough for a 5-year-old.Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the movie, but I came to see an IRON MAN movie and got something that spent far too much time with one-liners, a mostly suitless Stark and was just barely elevated from the disappointing Iron Man 2. And the first installment was fairly cliché and predictable as well, but it was Robert Downey Jr. fresh and the best he's been in any of the films, including The Avengers.Overall, it's a funny, sometimes downright hilarious, film, but sometimes I would actually rather watch a superhero movie with, I don't know, the title character spending more time on the screen than his alter ego wisecracking and acting weak. If I wanted to watch a video with a whiny character with flawed traits, I'll just go to YouTube. It's cheaper, anyways.IRON MAN 3 (3/5 Stars)
"This is the 'Sh|t Gets Real' episode" - Kevin Carr, from The Idiot Boxers. "Welcome to primetime, Bitch,"  Freddy Krueger.I knew this was coming. We all knew this was coming.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Uno, or HP7a, was a given since the start. We knew, even without spoilers from viewers, the series was bound to get darker, more deadly  or is that, deathly?  and seriously serious. Harry had to grow up finally and begin his final stages to get to his nemesis, No-Nose.Well, it was welcome, after the terrible, over-kill bridge movie Part VI was. That one, Half-Blood Prince, connected the exciting, thrilling and best of the series, Part V, or Order of the Phoenix, and this first chapter of the finale.Yes, my opinions are not well-received, but allow me to honestly say just that: I was honest in my feelings towards Part VI  it contained 20 special, interesting and important minutes, but the rest was garbage. If only those were tacked onto this one, or the previous, it would've flowed better.I digress, we're here for HP7a. School's out forever, it appears as Harry and the good witches of all directions are on the lam after No-Nose and his army is preparing to devastate everything. Now, since I'm not caught up on the books, after only having read the first one, I'm puzzled why more Muggles don't see these attacks from No-Nose, or it's not more widely spread. But, anywaysThe mystery of the series, the adventure and most of the heart is back as Harry's pals get beaten down, and the overall threat is more real. It's actually a fairly simple plot of gathering objects and clues, but the route to both was rather fun, albeit slow at times.In Part VI, a significant character passes onto the Magical Kingdom of the Sky, but the one character who dies here (obviously, no spoilin') in the finale actually affected me the most. And yes, I'm even jumping ahead to HP7b of all 8 movies, the one that dies here almost made me tear up and I'm sorry to see her/him go.At any rateeven with a rather slower mid-section, the movie starts off with a punch, it's fun, dark, mature and finishes at a perfect time to get you psyched for the grand finale to come(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)
First, they went cross-country to Magic Mountain, er Walley World. Next, Europe. What's to top that for the Griswold's? Why, they stay home, of course.I don't wish to sound negative upfront, but National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation really didn't hold up for me today. I LOVED this movie as a kid  I did watch it repeatedly back then, but after a nearly 15 year hiatus of not seeing it, it felt really dated to me.That said, I still laughed, admired the cartoonish feel they gave to these live-action characters and the scenes of genuine heart. I would still recommend it, especially for fans of Clark Griswold and his crazy antics and it still remains as my favorite Vacation movie.I'm not 100% sure there really is a plot here, but the premise is Clark and Co. are determined to have a true family Christmas, but are consistently sidetracked with annoying relatives, angry neighbors, mischievous animals and a stereotypical Hollywood "Christmas boss."Despite the lack of any real script, the movie does have focus and a lot of fun. It's slapstick and silly and actually tugs at your heart at times. It's not a movie to take seriously and if you just sit back and enjoy, you'll really have a good time.Side Note and Spoiler  skip this paragraph if you have not seen it: Maybe I noticed this before, but I really don't recall: how they ended the movie without even making it to Christmas Day was thoroughly disappointing. It was as if they knew the movie was running too long, and it was, and cut it short of the actual day the movie's based on. And titled as such. Sad.Side Note II: I also might not have noticed this before, but the boy who replaced the boy who replaced the original Griswold son, Rusty, was played by long time crush of mine: (just one-year-younger than me) Johnny Galecki. It was truly weird seeing someone that I've grown to like a lot since I've last see this film, as a freaking boy. Thankfully, that's not how I remember him these days.Side Note III: Speaking of the children, since this movie was released, I have been all-but 100% against seeing Juliette Lewis. I cannot stand her. Even though she plays an integral part, mercifully, she's hardly in this. In fact, Rusty, or Galecki, has more screen time. Perhaps because both his character and lines were a lot funnier.
Coming off the highest grossing entry in the Nightmare series, part 4, it was going to be tough to follow-up. In director Hopkins's defense, I applaud him for going in a different direction, despite not making a, well, killing at the box office.A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child brings Freddy back mostly to the dark and "scary" path he once took. Sure there were some funny moments and lines from Freddy (you could probably cut the humor/quotes from #4 down to a 1/3), but for the most part, they made a darker less comedic nightmare than #4.Alice returns from #4, actually her, her father and her boyfriend Dan, all the surviving members of #4. Surprise, Freddy's back, but Alice doesn't know how (yet) that he's all around her when she's awake. And she's out of control from her dreams.Of course, she has a new slate of friends, or victims, and Freddy's getting them one by one in a tad bit creative ways. (Only one really stands out  Superfreddy, and the rest ho-hum, comparatively speaking to the first entries in the series.) He's using Alice's (and Dan's) unborn child, somehow and Alice and gang must both believe in the man of their dreams before they're all bumped off.Though this wasn't the worst in the series, by far, it was still a throwaway. Not a must-see in the long franchise. Take the bland friends, or make that boring with barely a pulse for Freddy to stop. Or the copied plot from #3. Or the retreaded Alice from #4.But the score is good, I liked the atmosphere  dark and strange, especially the tongue-in-cheek finale, and I liked some of Freddy's moments. It's worth a viewing, for fans only. But not repeat viewings.Side Note: When I was about 14-15, a friend of mine from Illinois, who used to live with me here in Phoenix, AZ, sent me a gift once. He wouldn't tell me what it was, but I was stoked when I saw a huge, flat cardboard box. It already gave away the contents inside  something about Freddy. Inside was a stand-up, cardboard clip out  6' tall of Freddy, the baby carriage  it was an ad for the video release of Nightmare 5. I loved that and still have that, roughly 20 years later, even the box it came in. Funniest thing is, and I've heard Robert Englund comment on this, the photo they used was transposed, whereas Freddy's glove appears to be on his left hand when it's always on his right. Oh, well, that just makes it all the more valuable to me.
Please don't tell me 'The Grey' (5/10 Stars) was a (based-on or inspired-by-a) true story. Because I was tricked once into believing that and trust meif I told you what movie I'm referring to, it would spoil this movie beyond me just telling you the film's decent finale.What I liked here was the lack of CGI. I am one of the few people I know who DESPISES CGI. I want to see someone's heart in a project and from what I've seen and read, these men, including Liam Neeson, spent time in a VERY small and touristy snowbound village in freezing temps and they used real wolves during the shots. I both admire and appreciate that devotion.Since I knew that, I was even more shocked to see these HUGE (and absolutely vicious) beasts on the screen. These weren't as big as the (ah-hem, again CGI) fake-looking wolves in the 'Twilight' films, but damn, they were menacing and dangerous looking. I'd be more frightened of them than freezing to death.Mercifully, even though there were the clichéd characters, including Neeson's Dr. Wolfenstein and the tough "I'm not afffrrrraaaiddd!" dude, they quickly moved past those tired formulaic scenes. Sadly, quick wasn't in the movie's pacing. A lot of the scenes went on and on, but none as long as the non-death-death scene of one of the men down-by-the-river.The movie follows seven men through the rough winter wilderness when their plane inadvertently drops into the Wolves Den. Luckily, they have Wolf-Expert Ottway to guide them to civilization before any of them get picked off by either the wolf's bites or simply, frost-bites.Don't get me wrong; I did like the feature. The score was adequate, the cinematography at times was gorgeous and I loved the graininess to the screen  reminded me of a real film and not a digitally made film. Also, if you like that tough-guy Neeson we've grown to love in his signature January releases, you'd like him here. Though, he was a toned down from both 'Taken' and 'Unknown.'It's a See-It, but you'd be better off nice and warm at home when it arrives on BluRay. Probably in a month or two.Side-Note: Wasn't this supposed to be present day? Why did everyoneand I do mean EVERY ONE, had those stereotypical "Wallet-size" pictures in their wallets? I haven't done that since I was sixteen (i.e. 1990) and even if I wanted to revisit that tradition, I'd much rather look at HD/Digital ones on my phone. Just saying
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee."  Jules from Pulp Fiction. (Oh, and I guess, also The Bible.)Mercifully, that blatant line was not used in Frailty, but it does sum it up, nicely.It's hard to believe one of my favorite movies that I just re-purchased, this time on BluRay, is now 10 years old. It's also one of my favorite suspense films  though, it borderlines horror.And speaking of "horror," I loved this movie when I first saw it many years ago and I recall one of my first thoughts: Damn, a brutal "slashing/horror" film where they hardly show any intense bloodbaths..and that's a good thing. With the exception of one axe-wielding scene, all hacks are off-screen. Not only was that original back then, it's still refreshingly unique today.Oh, and so was Matthew McConaughey and Bill Paxton's best performances. To date, I have yet to see either of them do as good as they did here.The only minor flaw  and I mean extremely minute  was the fact upon repeat viewings, and this is probably my third to fourth time, once you know "the secret," the movie changes for the viewer. Not necessarily in a bad way, because it was brilliantly made, so there is a lot more to attach onto. Same could go for Fight Club. I saw it only twice  once in theatres and once on DVD, and only that second time to "catch everything I missed" but overall it was still a fantastic film with great performances, like Frailty.Frailty shows us a widowed, hard working and (definitely) religious father of two boys who takes up "God's Plan" to rid the planet of "demons." He's ain't no Ghostbuster; these "demons" he's targeting are human beings. While one son follows his daddy and his killing spree with the blind innocence of young children, the other and older son is thinking more rationally and objects to his Dad's killing these strangers.That story was all told in flashbacks from one of the (now) adult children's point of view (McConaughey) to FBI agent Doyle (a very nice Powers Boothe) when he's attempting to provide proof of both the "God's Hand" killer (Bill Paxton) and where the bodies are buried.Even though I only tipped the iceberg of the overall plot, I feel like I've said just enough before spoiling anything.Look  the movie is literally fantastic in many ways: mood, score, acting, dialogue, cinematography, shocks and frights  including fear of mis-directed religion activists. It's hard to believe that this was Paxton's feature-length directorial debut and to-date, only has completed one more movie. I say that, because this was not just professionally made, but aside from one minuscule psychedelic scene, it looked like it was made from one of the masters of film.If you have not seen this, I highly encourage you to see this disturbing look into what someone's capable of when "God's Angels" direct him to kill fellow humans.
I guess I'm thankful for not being exposed to the previous movie installments of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, as most critics are opposed to how this relates to them. I was able to enter with a clear and open-mind. Unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed.There was a lot to like, however, in 2009's Sherlock Holmes. I've always loved, and probably always will love Robert Downey, Jr. He did a fantastic job in his stab at the brilliant, but troubled sleuth. He did have a lot of low-brow humor, which I favor in films. (You see this mostly in real British humor.) In addition, I am always about the "Super-Man" characters who know all and barely ever defeated. You'll see a "super-human" Holmes who can not only do no wrong, but can barely take a beating even when punched.As for the previews, which did NOT in any way persuade me to see this movie, I didn't like how he, in slow motion, hit other men in "combat." I loved on how they explained that and what was going on in his mind at the time  the planning and execution. Too bad they only did that 2-3x in the film. And finally, I loved the cinematography, the sets and the feel/look of the late 1800s England.Okay, that's where my warm feelings end. As for the rest, at very least I can safely say: I won't see any more sequels to this. Furthermore, I never want to see this movie again.It was far too long, it was far too forced and though some scenes were well crafted, they were far too spaced out. The movie's set in England and yet maybe one person actually has an English accent. The movie boasts as a "fun, action-adventure" when I found very little fun, a few minor action scenes and the adventure was just so-so. And the ending? Not to give anything away, the climax has been done so many fracking times, I can't count. Actually, make that, I can. There probably have been as many movies made with this same "surprise/twist/revelation" ending as there has been years since this movie was set.Holmes (Downey, Jr.) and heterosexual life-partner Watson (Law) are not only crime fighters, but roommates. Well, Watson wants out and in with his soon-to-be wife. Holmes finds he will be lonely without him, but continues on with a mission against a "Dark Lord" Blackwood (Strong) who kills for sacrifice and apparently can rise from the dead. Holmes is suspicious and works with Watson to solve the political mystery behind Blackwood's ambitions.There, I described the entire 2+ hour film in a few short words. Throw in a mysterious woman (McAdams) who's in the movie as much as Angelina Jolie is in Gone in Sixty Seconds. In other words, less than 10% of the film and there: you have the whole film. Unfortunately, you will also have to throw in a bunch of smelling (literally), wise-cracks, ancient explosions and "National Treasure" sleuthing.I have to give it to them; it was a unique film, whereas, it wasn't your typical action-adventure that, if made in the 1990s, Mel Gibson would star. But it wasn't anything really to write "holmes" about. Okay, that was bad, yet, so was the movie.
The Man in Men in Black 3 should've gone back in time to erase Part II, instead.For this third MIB film, this absolute make-up movie, à la Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, was the sequel the second one should've been. Mercifully, it did make-believe the second chapter didn't exist and only spoke of events in the original.Was this movie really necessary? Actually, I'm not the one asking that  I've heard that question multiple of times leading up to the release, but I will be the one answering. 90% yes and 10% probably. No is not the answer.While not perfect as it certainly had script and direction problems and though most of the jokes worked, there were a half of dozen scenes of un-fun silliness and overkill that made it tad cloudy. That said, it was a lot more fun than not and again, if this is the final one, it was a nice closureway more than that joke of a movie the middle segment was.And besides all that, I had a good time. The finale was enjoyable  although it really channeled (2006) Casino Royale's opening and the action was present and from the one cast member I wanted it the most from: Tommy Lee Jones. Obviously, it's not really him and that's apparent in most the movie considering it was Young K (Josh Brolin.) Oh, and by the way, he was not just spot-on, I never, ever thought that was anyone but a young Jones.The movie's opening 10 or so minutes were apparently more successful than all of previously released Lockout, and this leads a bad alien to go back in time to kill Men in Black agent K and in turn, agent/partner J back, as well, to save him. And, the world, of course.That's the best and easiest synopsis I can give, and of course, there's more to the story, but its best you just sit back and let the men entertain you.I don't want to give this my highest praise  it's doubtful this will land anywhere near my 2012 top ten list, but it's fun companion the first one. Nowhere as close to freshness or quality, but, again, like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, it's a fun ride that should be seen following part one.(Notice how I didn't include part two in that statement. Neither should anyone else.)
(WARNINGThis is the Adult Disney Review Series. I have 51 Original Disney Cartoons to tackle, plus multiple  and forgettable  direct-to-Disney-Video misses. My goal in 2012 is to brave the task of watching all, many for the first time and commenting on eachall with an adult POV. Now, as soon as I can find an adult to do just that)Damn. I finally saw it. All the way through. Awake, albeit damaged.Unsuccessfully, I've fallen asleep in THREE attempts to watch Fantasia. All three times, I've made it to either Mickey's story or just into the Dino scene following.Let me set the record straight: This has more potency than 6 sleeping pills. I'm fully aware Disney simply loved his subliminal messagesbut this one was the easiest to catch: sleep, sleep, SLEEP!I gotta be honest here: this movie appeared to me as an amateurish attempt and was definitely boring as sh*t. I'll give it kudos for being the visualization of Winamp of its time and I'm sure it was "amazing" during its long release schedule between 1940-1, but it was far too early (Disney Feature Length Movie Number Three) for Walt to be experimental with this adult cartoon. And here goesHe went from somewhat adult with Snow White, to the rightfully kiddie Pinocchio and now MOSTLY adult Fantasia. This even featured animated nudity and sexuality!Oh, and I like the fact that my car runs smoothly, or my home A/C or heater works fine. I don't need to actually see them in motion, like what they tried here  an orchestra coming to life.When I was a kid and was slowly, but surely being exposed to the "Disney (so-called) Masterpieces" all I was interested in were the Mickey and dino scenes. I was duped into believing the rest of the movie had the same interest for a kid. I was wrong. Oh, and speaking of the word "Masterpiece"I'm beginning to realize, and only after re-watching (or for the first time all the way through) the first three Disney cartoons, that they throw around the word "masterpiece" very loosely.On a positive note, the Mickey scene was masterful  making sure not a word of dialogue explained his plight, rise and fall. But that's the only segment that held my attention. The rest of it was a chore to get through and no movie should ever be that way. It didn't help that most, if not all the characters yawned a lot and/or were asleep at a certain point. Oh, how I wanted to join them in such graceful slumber!I am thankful I finally did make it from beginning to end  albeit, I did pop some caffeine pillsNO JOKE. Now, I will never, ever have to see this again.Nowonto Dumbo
Today's color, kids, is Brown. Boring, tan-tinted BROWN. Hope you like that color, because in today's video presentation of the old Depression-Age, you'll see a lot of it.Unfortunately, I don't like that color. Nor the color of the blues.Coffee's an acquired taste and so is the ever strange O Brother, Where Art Thou? Both I get, I'm not blind or lack taste buds. So, I understand the need for such substance from either source. But, since this is a matter of opinion and not a fact-based article..PHOOEY!Not everyone likes Adam Sandler, but if you do, chances are you don't like Jim Carrey and the reverse is also true. Comedy is very subjective. Here, I understood the slapstick and the screwballness of it all, but it wasn't my cup of brown, brown tea. I did not laugh once, but I admired the actor's balls for following the Coens wherever they wanted to lead. Including Clooney.Though he only started the movie on a different track from his normal performances, unfortunately, about half-way through, if you can get past the dirt on his face, you'll see the Clooney you've always seen. In addition, neither John Turturro (or Goodman) or the Coens change either. It was business as usual for them. They even had to throw in some classic Coens: Animal Cruelty.Three prisoners escape a real chain gang in the Depression Era  no not the late 2000's  and they're on a mission for gold. Along the way they meet goofball characters, do goofball things and sing aokay, good song.Sure, there's search for them there Goldor an ulterior motive. That's not that much of a spoiler  anyone who knows what this is based on should see where this is headed.And with that: They say this movie's based on Homer's Odyssey. I doubt the original text/poem, for which I have, in fact read, was meant to be this ridiculed. Heck, where was that Jim Carrey to step in and start singing? To watch this, you'll have to like the Blues. You'll have to like George Clooney. Wackiness. Barely a character to root for. And the color brown.Sorry, I just can't get over that brownish, tanish tint over 98% of the movie. Nor could I get over this incredibly array of wacky characters, so out of left field, it's distracting.Again, I get what they were trying to say and covey, but it just wasn't my bag. So, since I know it has a select audience, and you might be part of that  if you agree with what I wrote about what the film's about, I can't completely down-rate the movie to 1 star. At least I am able to acknowledge it does, in fact, have a following. More power to those who like it, I'm just not part of that group.
Ever since Juno and Little Miss Sunshine splashed onto the screen and spotlighted big-word-of-mouth indie hits, every small group wants a piece of the pie. Win Win had that feel. Only, as good as it was, it wasn't great.I missed seeing this in 2011, and though it wouldn't have cracked my top ten list, it was still a watchable release.The ever-somewhat lovable, everyday man Paul Giamatti plays a down on his luck/clients attorney Mike who, in order to get some cash, pushes for the care of wealthy Leo (Burt "anything but" Young) only it comes with a price: a teen wrestler Kyle and his asinine mother, Cindy (Melanie Lynskey.)It's one of those "lying" stories where you can pretty much guess when the "lies" start revealing themselves. Mike has to lie about his intentions to his wife and to Kyle, a runaway who has potential in pro-wrestling. And Mike has to grow, as predicted.The movie, while good and contains some decent dialogue, humor and realism, is really justthere. Not bad, by most means, but not powerful. Overall, I liked watching the realistic journey of this man and his kooky counterparts. It's a watch-watch, but not watch-right-now kinda film.3½/5 Stars.
Having the rebooted James Bond series, 'Casino Royale,' become my favorite of all Bond movies, it was going to be tough to follow it up with the first direct sequel: 'Quantum of Solace.' At first, I didn't like it, hardly at all. The plot was all over the place  OK, I admit, I really couldn't follow it, the first go-around, there were a lot of dry scenes, and the rejuvenated Bond took leaps backwards with his sexual encounter with a "Strawberry Fields." My second and now third viewings, I enjoyed it a lot more. I suppose its one that grows on you. Sure, nowhere near as good as 'Royale,' heck, not in the top Bond films, but still enjoyable.It's 10x more gritty and dark than 'Royale,' yet I loved the feel and style of the film. Thankfully, they did fix one of 'Royale's biggest problems by shortening this down 37 minutes. Also, the cinematography, landscapes, locales, fight scenes were all well done.The yellow-toothed villain left a lot to be desired, and even though they needed to give the audience the typical Bond Bimbo, I still cringe at reducing this mature Bond to a 15-year-old.Taking place within the hour of the 'Royale' finale, Bond is bent on revenge (despite his consistent attempts to state otherwise) and in turn taking down the big-evil corporation known as 'Quantum.' You don't get the whole story on them, so I suspect this isn't the first sequel to be made in the Bond movies, though I wish it were. Move on. Get Bond back where he needs, fresh missions. (I think they did state that's where it's going in the final shot.) I liked the song, though, listening to it outside the movie, it seemed very edited in the title sequence. I still think the story has a lot to be desired, but still recommended for action/suspense buffs.
Since I grew up and was thoroughly loyal to both Lethal Weapon 2 and 3, I pounced on the fourth installment to see them all back in action. And the result? I didn't like it.What didn't help was many things, but the majority stemmed from three bad areas: #1: I loved Rene Russo's Lorna character who kicked butt in part 3, but  playing pregnant here  she was extremely limited. #2: The painfully obvious Mel Gibson stand-ins during the action sequences  oh, I bet he wish that guy was driving his car when he was pulled over for failure to yield to other religions. And #3: the long-winded MULTIPLE endings. Dang, the movie just went on and on and onUpon seeing this again in order to review and finish off my four Lethal Weapon reviews, I have three additional complaints: #4 It spent far too long at the precinct. #5 Chris Rock seemed like he was sooo thrilled to be in the dying, now-defunct series that he smiled throughout every screen shot  even when it was an either serious scene or didn't call for a grinning performance. And (#6) the never-ending subliminal messages about peace/love/harmony. But that's any of the Lethal Weapons.That all saidI actually enjoyed myself this time. I let it all go and enjoyed the sometimes few/far-between action segments. The comedy was still fun. The chase and fight scenes were well crafted (aside, again, from the stand-in fake-Mel) and entertaining.Sure, I got all the same feelings (I mentioned above) but, leaving my brain at the door, I could find fun in the group's final adventure. Absolutely, it's not the best one - #2 still holds that crown  but it's, surprisingly, slightly more entertaining than the third installment that I loved growing up.To sum up the weak plot (no one, including myself, watched these movies for that): the "old" gang investigates an illegal human-smuggling trade while they deal with getting "outdated" alongside two secondary characters are pregnant and two separate Asian families are trying to escape in America.Wow.. that took about 8 seconds to sum up the movie. Again, we watch these for the improvising dialogue, the humor and the non-stop action  when it finds its way on screen, that is.It was a good closing to the series  though you might want to literally turn off the film when Riggs (Mel Gibson) fights off Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li.) Quite frankly, you will have another 20+ minutes of fluff and additional and unnecessary endings following. Not to mention a horrid closing credits song written specifically for Rodney King.
OK, I am done (and only after two films) with Dario Argento movies. First Suspiria was just okay, and this Phenomena (aka Creepers) was just all-over the place.I was intrigued by the poster, i.e. a girl who could control bugs, and more posters/advertisements that promoted her getting revenge with the use of her buggy friends that ate her enemies.Sadly, the movie barley touched on the subject of said girl who had a connection with bugs. In fact, for the most part, it was an afterthought and absolutely incidental.And look, it's been over a week since I saw this for the first time and I've all-but completely forgotten this movie. What I do recall is an effective opening and everything downhill from there. This includes terrible dialogue, bad acting, experimental filmmaking and a terrible main character that was neither interesting nor someone we wanted to root for.Honestly, I can't even give the synopsis since the whole experience of the film has left my mind. I don't think I'd have given this a higher rating had I written my review immediately following my viewing. I might have even spewed some more hatred.Justthere's no reason to visit this horrible and confused movie. Skip it!* * * Final thoughts: I love Donald Pleasance and I can't wait to see him againin the Halloween series vs. this.
In the summer of 2011, when it had already been announced that the following summer would be kicked off with The Avengers, I got so severely burned out on poor to mediocre superhero films, beginning with Thor and followed by X-Men: First Class, Green Lantern and finally, Captain America - The First Avenger.In all fairness, I got burned out after the X-Men prequel which I only barely liked then and would later appreciate more. On video, I would finally see Green Lantern and absolutely hate almost every minute of that. Due to that, I put off Cap't America as long as I could. As Julia Roberts' Vivian once said in Pretty Woman: "Big mistake. Big. Huge."ForI actually really enjoyed this movie a tonand he's completely down my list of favorite superheroes.Chris Evans brought a special heart and selfless spirit to the contagiously patriotic Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America. I understand and have seen overly Gooo-America films  most recently, Act of Valor, but this one, thanks for Evans, really roped me in and I both loved and rooted for him the whole way.While I'm not a big fan of CGI, the computer generated, miniscule and original weakling Steve Rogers, before he becomes Captain America, was, in fact, weak. I understand there had to be a transition from small to super soldier, but they all-but made him look like a mouse that would later turn into a tiger. A bit too under-the-top.Nevertheless, we have a small boy who's desperately trying to fight for truth, justice and the American way in World War II and continuously gets knocked down, literally and figuratively. Untilhe gets spotted due to that deep heart I spoke about. Not just overnight, but within minutes, he's now fast, strong and regenerative. What hadn't changed was that perfect attitude.He's got the (ho-hum, and sometimes boring) Red Skull to deal with, as, I guess, Hilter's so passé. But, along the way, he's accompanied with a beautiful broad and the always awesome Tommy Lee Jones as his Colonel.Admittedly, the first half is a lot more entertaining, contains welcomed great performances and special effects/cinematography for a superhero film. Even the second half is still a fun ride with wonderful tie-ins to the other Marvel/Avenger films and an extremely touching and admirable finale.While it's not perfect, and not the genre I'm fond of  period piece films, but it's a lot of fun, and comparatively speaking, they saved the best for last in Summer 2011.
Disclaimer  Stop now, if you haven't seen this picture. Don't read this, any synopsis or any review. WATCH THIS MOVIE. Dammit, you won't be disappointed. That is, if you love cinema and fine pieces of art some movies are. Then come back to my take. See if my views match yoursHow happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!I'm no poet, nor do I normally favor it over other mediums. But this snippet of Alexander Pope's poem is as mesmerizing as the excellently written movie it takes its name from. If only I could write a story with such great intentions, romance, suspense, comedy and heart.I truly loved this movie. I love the fact that it starts in normal Jim Carrey fare  Goofy with a touch of romance, but sooner than you think, you're drawn into a science fiction story of a mind-erasing clinic for love-lost humans. And by the time you think you've discovered all the movie is about, it splashes the whole picture across your face and it tricks you. You've been watching an incredibly deep and romantic picture all along.Talk about one of the all-time best written screenplays. It even dupes me each time, though since I enjoy it so much, I allow it to twist and turn me until I've been eternally satisfied all over again. So much so, after each viewing, I just sit back with wide-eyed amazement and in complete awe of the creators of this movie.The scenery is beautiful, the soundtrack and score wonderful and the performances by the leads  Carrey, Ruffalo and Wilkinson are great while Winslet is perfect. Again, along with the story, you think she's some kook  I would, if I met her in real life, but the depths of both her character, Clementine and the performer, herself, gives me shivers. Thinking small, you will call her a great actress. As a whole, she will surely go down as one of the greatest actresses of all time. Heck, I even liked her in Titanic, but following that movie, she's blown me away each and every time making her "Rose" character in the big boat movie look like a High School play.Despite not giving away a synopsis of the movie, I feel like I've given away far too much. Suffice to say, if you like a great movie with depth deeper than the abyss all wrapped up in a movie that screams independent, watch this movie. It's one of the few movies that not only makes you want to press stop at the end and re-play from beginning. In fact, you will. I did.
One character hilariously says "Slow. Slower." And that's in subtitles and during, if you haven't figured out yet, one of the half-dozen sex scenes.Yes, I had to laugh becausethismovieCOULD NOThave beenanyslower. The movie's own fade in and fade out at the end literally took a minute. Thankfully, by the movie's end, my eyes had already closed from extreme fatigue by the minute the movie faded to black.Three of my least favorite directors share this annoying trait of making the movie inch along at a pace that a snail would speed by: M. Night Shyamalan, Michael Mann and Stanley Kubrick. And throw in the movies, The Brown Bunny & The English Patient, for good measure, and none of these movies & directors have anything on The American.Now, some movies can pull off an effective slow-paced movie, such as Lost in Translation or Brokeback Mountain, but you will need something, anything to fill the gaps. And soft-core porn does not equate an anticipation strong enough to get past an hour ofw.a.i..ting. Heck, dial-up net is faster for porn, if that's what you're looking for.The "porn" I keep mentioning, is the oodles of extremely pretty ladies baring all. For a long period of times. If that's your bagmore power to you. But have a buddy with you to slam you with that Pulp Fiction adrenaline IV so you can make it to one of the full-frontal female shots.It sure sounds like I'm dogging this movie, for it certainly wasn't the worst slow-motion movie I've witnessed and it contained a few suspenseful shots  only one actually played out to true suspense.Also, the movie's a balancing act: while the acting's sub-par  Georgie really phoned this one in, the cinematography was pretty darn good. While some of the "shocking" scenes, one in the beginning and the only other in the climax, were worth watching, the dialogue lacked in droves. I only got excited to hear the lines when George woke up and played his normal "George Clooney" role and spoke about the gun he made.The American, a 15-minute short stretched for an additional 90 minutes, has bad guy, I'm guessing assassin, Jack (Clooney) escaping his own assassination attempt, along with a mess he made in the snow  no, not the yellow kind. While justifiably paranoid, he takes on another impossib(ly slow) mission of making the perfect gun for a woman who just walked off the set of the Avengers 1960's TV series.Incredibly, he asks his boss, an eerie foreign version of Scott Glenn, for more time to deliver the already finished weapon. Oh, come on. Despite the movie's 105 minute running time, it was like asking for another year-break in between Soprano seasons. Of course, there's a reason for it, and if you're planning on watching this exercise in patience, I won't ruin the rest of the synopsis.That all said, there were a few enjoyable scenes  obviously too few and far between and the score adequate, when heard. I just don't think there was enough substance or heart to make this a feature length film. Now, a short would have been awesome, but I digress  they took an ill-fated chance and failed.
The original has been remade, reimagined, rewritten, sequelized, prequelized, spoofed, referenced and play'gerized (Broadway) more times that I can recall, seen or read. In fact, of the dozens of incarnations, I've only seen the 1939 work of art, the Muppet's hilarious take and now: Oz the Great and Powerful.Luckily, this AM, before I set out to see the latest take, or prequel, I had the wonderful opportunity to see the Judy Garland film; my first time since I was a very young child. That might have been a bad choice considering how much of a difference between that masterpiece and this movie.Yes. That is the biggest difference between what a fantastic, magical, wonderful and, ah-hem, great experience the original was and this, just a movie. Sure, Director Sam Raimi, whom I've always been a huge fan of, did create a gorgeous  stunning, even  cinematic film, but it never felt above "movie status," much like the original which felt alive.I didn't quite catch Oz's (James Franco) full name, but that's his coincidental nickname to the land he will be thrust to following an escape from people he's wronged in a traveling circus. Once he arrives  and believe me, that entry scene was well worth the IMAX 3D experience, he's immediately deemed "the one" that will save all of Oz and become King.The rest of the movie plays out with Oz meeting several interesting characters  the top of the bunch is Finley or "Monkey," his accepting/denying his prophesied role and the rise of wickedness.Unlike most movies I see, this movie got progressively better as it past its center point and through to the climax. The opening black & white square formatted introduction, however, while an obvious homage to the original, went on for far too long and felt like I wasted extra money to see this in the higher ticket priced IMAX format. Luckily, and inevitably, it switched to (mostly) full-IMAX screen and color. Again, the scene following the black & white bit was one of the best in the movie with our "hero" Oz travelling down the river bank.I'm not a huge James Franco fan, and this certainly did not change my mind, but, thankfully there were a couple of other good performances and characters, namely Zach Braff as mentioned as Finley, the CGI monkey with wings and Michelle Williams as Glinda, the Good Witch. On the flipside, one of the "key players," the world-famous Wicked Witch of the West, was hilariously bad. Her green face make-up/CGI/whatever looked absolutely atrocious and unintentionally humorous. Sad. She was the Darth Vader-type iconic villain staple decades before Anakin donned the mask and now, in appearance only, she looks more like Jackie Earle Haley's Freddy Krueger compared to Robert Englund's.The real star, and this shouldn't have been the case, was the rich and crisp scenery. Definitely breathtaking at moments. The score was a decent, though forgettable, Danny Elfman run-through. The 3D was just okay and had just a few obvious "throw-things-at-the-screen" shots which I don't care for. And despite the absence of the musical numbers, the humor was enormously welcomed and often hilarious. Thanks to Braff's Finley and Tony Cox's Knuck.Overall, I would recommend it, for maybe curiosity's sake and to see such great cinematography and graphics on the big screen. Repeated viewings? Not so much.
In one of the best openings, or scenes I've watched, Final Destination 2 takes the lead immediately. Typically, this is where I generally say: "And then it went south from there" or "It got progressively worse."Thankfully, noit didn't. For horror franchise fans, this was comparably to how Scream 1 and 2 panned out, in regards to quality, intelligence, surprises, keeping it fresh and making a film as equal, if not superior to the original.There's a new girl in town, and she's lookingat Death. Kimberly's (Cook) about to start a fun weekend with her clichéd friends when all-of-a-sudden (not really, if you've seen part 1) she has a vision of a massive pileup on the forthcoming highway killing her and scores of others. When she comes to, she blocks the cars behind her from entering the highway and this draws attention of police officer Thomas (Landes, one-time Jimmy Olsen).As stated/spoiled by mentioning the series original film, the crash does take place, though there are several "survivors" thanks to Kimberly's quick thinking. While they're a bit and reasonably shaken up, Kimberly puts the pieces together knowing that this exact thing happened one year prior.And again, as the "survivors" die in incredibly new and creative ways, the new cast uses the old to help through this mess: Clear Rivers (Larter) and Bludworth (Todd.)I'm really making this out to be a rehash, and for the most part it is. But, the "new" explanation/revolution is not only thoroughly thought out, but kept the series (ONLY TO THIS SEQUEL) fresh and inventive. Also, Larter up'd the ante, much like what Linda Hamilton did for Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. So it was nice to not only see her again, but see how much she's grown as an actress by this point.I've said it before, in regards to Part One, the rest of the case did what was required of them and the movie was well-made and highly creative, though  again  hokey at times. It's recommended to make it a double feature with the first one, even though it even works as a stand-alone film. And finally, as I mentioned, the extremely detailed opening wreck scene is worth the entire viewing.
(Spoilers) When I first watched 'Go' many years ago, I thought it was just okay until one small scene set the intertwining story lines: As there are three main Christmas Eve stories going on here, in story #2, a character in Las Vegas calls another one (Todd, aka "the good drug dealer") in LA. We already saw Todd receive this call in #1. I was surprised for two reasons: I knew nothing about this movie (including the 3 different chapters) prior to seeing and when that was easy to figure that out, I didn't know they would be so interwoven. I loved this movie. I loved the music (fast and slow), I loved the originality, the acting by all actors  especially and namely Polley (this is the movie that made me fall hard for her, as an actress that is), the sets, the pacing, comedy, dialogue and simple craziness of everything going on. It was like a young adult version of 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' or 'Seinfeld.' As mentioned, one Christmas Eve, grocery-store clerk Ronna inadvertently sets off a chain reaction between multiple lives while attempting to get enough money to avoid eviction the following day. That night is seen by various eyes and almost all intersects/overlaps with pure escapism, comedy, fun and ends up as the less-dreary LA 'Crash' story. I could go on and on about all the actors, they were all pure fun to watch, but probably the top picks would be Polley, Olyphant, Askew and Diggs. Also, even after 10 years since its release, the dialogue and facial expressions (namely from the repeatedly stunned Todd) still had me rolling. It's not perfect, but for a far-above average rave movie with an actual plot, as well as far-above average killer soundtrack, it's worth a "go."
A year ago or so, I watched, for the first time, the original Phantasm. I actually saw the (first) sequel back when it came out in 1988 as a double, dollar-theatre feature with Poltergeist III. My reaction was that it, the original, that is, was that it was all-over the place, had too many horror genres shoved in it, unfocused and because of all that, not very enjoyable or scary.Nevertheless, I watched the director's, Don Coscarelli, most recent feature, John Dies at the End and I must say: this, too, is all over the placebut a lot more fun. And funny.It seems he's focused himself in his craziness in his old(er) age. Yeah, again, it's random at spots, but it felt more linear than Phantasm.Granted, the only comparison between the two movies should be the director, but, I saw a lot from that 1979 feature. I digress. John Dies at the End is a fun ride of the movie version of TV's Supernatural, only these two guys are just friends (though I would secretly wish more for them.) Apparently, these recent High School grads can see the evil spirits of the world and are called upon to ghost-bust them out of town.That's the set up. That and it's about the background story of how they came to be and where they're headed. I wouldn't want to spoil too much  as the actual title suggests, but suffice to say, it's a suspenseful and fun adventure of is it real? or not?Well, it is weird, that's for sure. And twenty minutes in, here were my initial seven thoughts I couldn't wait to post online:My thoughts so far:1. Finally! I'm seeing this. So 2. Please: No spoilers! Well, okay, no more. 3. Wait, two Paul Giamatti movies in as many nights? (Previous night, I watched for the first time: Lady in the Water.) No way? Break out the wine. 4. 'Serenity' is to 'Firefly' as' John Dies at the End' is to 'Supernatural'? 5. Yes, I know the rules to the "choice" of that heterosexual lifestyle, but damn, these boys are hot. Can't they just make out onceeven to say "Not that there's anything wrong with that!"6. Where's the Phantasm Ball? 7. A lot of movies put the title at the end of the movie. Um...maybe this could've been one of those?Again, the movie's weird and out there. But, stick to the end. It's an interesting an original ride. With cute guys, it seems.
Unfortunately, for me, I didn't first get involved with the lovable Robocop until part 2 came out in 1990. Since I was a kid then, and trying to watch as many movies as I possibly could at that age, I had a good time with Robocop 2. Now, I think I've seen it only once since 1990 and not again in over two decades, so we'll see when I revisit that movie.I digress. Speaking about Robocop, the original  and not the not-anticipated-by-me remake in 2014, I was way too young to see this when it came out in theatres. Oh, and I was banned for most Rated-R flicks, unless my parents just had to see a Rated-R film and they had no babysitter. When I finally did, of course, I fell in love with it. It was the perfect 1980s action movie  make that, superhero movie. Yeah, Robocop is a superhero and the movie had all the eight stereotypical qualities of one:1. Introduce a peaceful do-gooder and abruptly (and literally) shoot him down.2. Reintroduce him with special powers.3. Show just a handful of "saving the public" examples. 4. Our hero learns more about himself while inadvertently, inventing a smart, wealthy and obviously evil nemesis to take down our hero. 5. Shoot the hero down, again. 6. Show examples of the evil nemesis's, ah-hem, evilness. 7. Have hero learn and regain confidence...and muscle. 8. A SUPERHERO is born and comes back with a vengeance in the climax.Now, technically, I didn't spoil anything there. This is literally the formula for most superhero movies, including one of my all-time superhero movies, 1978's Superman: The Movie. Oh, and this movie is now 26 years old. Get with it, if you haven't seen it! Generally, in my reviews, I cover the synopsis. Since, I did above, I can move on. I truly loved this movie. It never seems to age for me whenever I revisit it. Sure, there's a few 80s technology/animation  mostly by ED-209  that I can't get past and no remake next year will make me side with them to correct any budget issues here. The lines were great, the action (ah-hem) explosive, the comedy funny, the heart attached and it truly defined that era of films. This movie, if it has to be remade, which it doesn't, deserves better follow-ups. The sequels  now thinking back on them  were comical and the TV seriesI didn't even bother. After seeing the trailer for the 2014 remake (not reboot, because, likely, it'll go nowhere or make that much,) I'm not enthused. But, sticking with this Robocop, it'll be a classic to the end of days. Side Note: My headline reads: Robopop. The reason? When I was young, and we had one TV with limited channels  never had cable until I moved out and there was this Bob Hope special on where in one segment, he dressed as Robocop, but was these kid's Robopop. I thought that was the funniest thing at the time and it's stuck with me since. Perhaps, I should YouTube that to see if someone else agrees with meSide Note II: Okay, not on YouTube, or Google But, I'll always have that memory. Ahhh, the past.
Despite my dead-even average rating of 5/10 stars, The Brood is almost completely from my memory since I first watched it 16 days ago. (I'm a little behind on my writings.)I heard of this movie when I was a kid, and never got around to it until about two weeks ago. I didn't know a single thing about it, other than the cover and title. I absolutely love going into movies cold, you know, without so much seeing a preview, clip, movie still or even the synopsis or cast names. So, I gave this oldie a try.I will have to say, as crazy as it was at times, it was enjoyable. Especially the climax. I do remember that creepy and effective finale.Basically, Husband & Wife split and the female half is institutionalized. Meanwhile, Daddy and Daddy's little girl are witnessing horrible deaths to those close to them. Who's the suspect, and how does Little Red Riding Hood play into all this?I do like Director David Cronenberg, but I think his best work would be years later with The Fly remake. Still, this 1979 film is worth checking out for horror fans.* * * Final thoughts: I didn't even know the definition to the word "Brood" was until I finished this movie and did research on the film. Now that I know and know it's not a term ever used today, I feel dumber despite the knowledge I gained. Fine, I guess I could use it normal conversationswith people I don't plan on keeping as friends.
When the character I was looking forward to seeing the least becomes the best of the bunch, I'm pleasantly surprised. And the second Loki was on the screen, I fell in love with him all over again.Thor: The Dark World also jumped leaps and bounds over its predecessor in regards to CGI and overall look. I actually laughed and shook my head a lot  at the original for its terrible CGI. During this one, I barely noticed a thing wrong with the presentation on screen and that's a good thing, since the first film's disastrous graphics were an incredible distraction.But, getting back to Loki, or who I like to refer to as: Loki Luthor, since he's in every Thor-appearance movie to date, and Lex Luthor was in 4 of 6 (if you don't count "Lex Corp" in the background of Man of Steel.) It was just overkill and lacked originality. Even though, he was one of the few bright spots here, in this Thor sequel, I might change my mind if he's, once again, in a third Thor movie, or heavens, The Avengers: Age of Ultron.Thor's sorta cleaning up the mess left by his brother in chains, Loki, when the incredibly long intro back-story kicks in, i.e. Thor's long-distance girlfriend, Jane, gets attacked by a "Spawn from Hell." Then, he sorta has to clean up that mess with the help from, yep, Loki and the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Leo and Jemma. Oh, wait, make that some characters from the original Thor and one failed comic relief dude.The story's a mess, barely coherent at times and hardly original, pacing and length had me squirming at times, the dialogue's barely acceptable  and the subtitles did nothing to cover up the bad script, the editing's way off and Chris Hemsworth all-but phoned in this Thor. But, dang, that all said, I had a much better time here than the first movie which was way more a mess. Here, in part two, while Anthony Hopkins, Renee Russ and even Natalie Portman did what they could and were entertaining, it was really Hiddleston's Loki that stole every scene and you could sense he was both the glue to the film and the most enthusiastic person to be in this movie.For the some parts, it was a fun and funny ride  I did laugh out loud a few times, only not at the movie, this time around, and it's entertaining for probably one viewing. Noting huge, but definitely a make-up for part one.* * * Final thoughts: I was told there were two "extra, Marvel-sig" endings during/following the end credits. Come on guys; the movie was long enough as it was and after the second of three endings, pending you're counting the real ending, was actually pretty lousy and not worth the 2 minute wait for that one. I did leave at that point since I knew there was a minimum of 10 more credit minutes. Lucky I did take off; I found out later that thee final ending was actually worse than the first two. Bah!
How dumb would it be to start my review with: Kick-Ass Kicked Ass! But it did. It's my highest rated movie (so-far) of 2010, so I have to start on a positive note, however obvious and clichéd.This wildly original, exciting, funny and suspenseful movie is the movie I wanted to see in Watchmen. Both are HARD-R films, both are ADULT-oriented comic-book adventures and both involve a masked adventurer that's eerily too close to coping Batman. (In Kick-Ass's defense, they were trying to spoof, while Watchmen simply ripped Batman off.) But, only Kick-Ass succeeded in adding both fantasy and enjoyment, shock without revolting and dialogue worth quoting.The movie starts brilliantly by telling you immediately this is the Family Guy of comic-book movies, orit looks like its good for kids, but far from it. (SEE: the "leap of faith" and Dave's (Johnson) first fantasy, prior to being a superhero.) He's just a normal, high-school geek, horny for girls (old and young alike) and have equally standing buddies. A la Peter Parker. His "brilliant idea" is to become a masked superhero, or "Kick-Ass," to do what most people won't: help those in need or when attacked.It doesn't go as planned, and they perfectly show the realism if this were to happen. All that happens to him during his "training" made me kept thinking these must be dreams, but they were for real.Finally he gets his big break while somewhat fighting off three thugs and becoming an internet sensation. This prompts other "superheroes" to take to the streets, but with far greater motivations. Big Daddy (Cage) is the Batman-wannabe, and anyone that thinks he's a rip-off, think of the homage he's playing in addition to the refreshing site of someone that's playing the fake-Batman from The Dark Knight's opening: a gun totting and lethal/killer Batman. His daughter, Hitgirl (Moretz) has her own background story, but in the present she's a daddy's little girl and is perfectly willing to do anything he says or does when it comes to murder, death or slicing & dicing.Eventually they meet, but Kick-Ass's over his head. He gets his girl and an Incredibles's Syndrome knockoff sidekick Red Mist (Plasse) with definite ulterior motives of his own. (If you caught the Syndrome reference, then you pretty much know what kind of character he is.) The movie certainly goes into familiar territory with the finale/outcome/climax, but since you already know what type of movie this is 10 minutes in, you can just sit back and enjoy the adventure and fun.I did like Johnson as he did what he needed to in his role. Plasse showed again he had little range outside of his normal McLovin role from Superbad. So, if you like him in that role, you'll enjoy him here again. I'm not a Nicolas Cage fan, though I don't hate him or his acting. Here, I loved what he did with the faux-pas Batman, especially the voice.While Cage stood out, but the number one star of the movie was Moretz. I heard a lot about her "offensive" and "vulgar" character prior. To me, she was wildly original and out-acted the entire cast with her depth and emotion. As realistic as most of the movie was, she was over-the-top, and that wasn't a bad thing. I enjoyed every second she was on screen, especially when she pulled off Kill Bill Vol. 1's Gogo Yubari role as the sweet little terror. (I also loved it when Puss In Boots did this in Shrek 2.) Recently I learned she is to play the main role in the Americanized remake Let Me In from the original Let the Right One In. I already looked forward to the reboot, but now I can't wait to see it.As I've pointed out, there's tons of references (and probably dozens more I left out) to other films. I didn't have a problem with that. It was nice to see them all in a fresh and real-life setting. The movie blends what real kids do, i.e. Facebook.I acknowledge the movie isn't perfect as there's a balance problem where they seemed like they had too many ideas on the table and the film moved from one mood to the next and sometimes without ease. In addition, it was easy to see how (most, not all) the scenes would play out. Nevertheless, I was entertained from the get-go and it never let up or let me down.This is a highly recommended super-hero movie (It even had a great soundtrack) and I'm sad to see it didn't do well with the box office, though I understand it's definitely geared to a specific audience.Side Note: I haven't had a feeling for a low-brow/Spring released movie like this since Lucky Number Slevin four years ago. Coincidentally, neither made the money they deserved and I make no apologies for the love I have for both of these movies. I felt both had great dialogue, humorous scenes, good action and most importantly for my taste: originality.Side Note 2: Contradictory to my normal criticisms and reviews, I really enjoyed the character of Hitgirl. Normally, I'd be all over the abuse of a child and ranting about CPS, etc, but since pretty much her role was so wrapped in fantasy, it was easier to see her as fiction and not a child being put in such peril as would normally offend me.
How on earth can one movie have such an impact, please so many people, make so much moneythat they honestly believe spending a buck fifty on special effects for the follow-up is a good idea?The special effects, namely The Rock's Scorpion King, was so bad in The Mummy Returns, I honestly couldn't get past it. Yes, I know FX doesn't make the whole movie experience, but these were so comical, so cartoonish  and even in 2001  that the movie was more of an unintentional comedy that the humor it tried hard to produce.The movie is, in fact, bookended by the worst special effects, namely the laugh-out-loud pasted on Rock's head finale, but the overall movie was so much a recap of the original 1999, that I barely remembered I was watching the sequel.Granted, they decided the best way to make more money or milk this franchise dry like the deserts its set in, is just to rehash everything from The Mummy (1999.) In fact, the only thing that really changed was the transformation of the actual "mummy" took mere seconds when the first film took much more efforts from the characters.The basic plot revolves around a soul-selling warrior  a la Scorpion King, the new adventures of the new O'Connell family and the Mummy's Revenge, sort of.Look, I've only seen this movie once in theatres in 2001 and just one more time about a week ago. I've put off the review until now and I've seemed to forget everything that happened in this movie, aside from a fairly decent car/bus chase scene I did like, set in London and the atrocious and hilarious Scorpion King finale. One that was so bad, I never bothered with the spin-offs. Even if they advanced in CGI, I seriously couldn't care less to revisit that character.This doesn't fair well for this movie. If it's so unmemorable in less than one week, it doesn't get any kind of recommendation from me.
Admittedly, I had to literally watch this movie two times in a relatively short time frame to "get it."While, there's not much to "get" in (Child's Play VI:) Curse of Chucky, I actually hated it the first time. I had to learn tonot watch a movie in a bad or distracted mood. Yeah, that first viewing wasn't a good one and not the movie's fault.With the second viewing, I learned to appreciate the movie more, and happy that Chucky finally found his way back to the only second installment that could be considered "scary," with the original 1988 film the only other one. Now, it's still not perfect  there are dozens of flaws, inconsistencies and annoyances, but definitely effective overall.And speaking of those "dozens of" problems, perhaps that was their game plan. After all, this is a total throwback to the 1980s slasher movies that I love and appreciate it. It's a 100% homage to not just 1980s horror, but of the original Child's Play. All of those 1980s horror movies had its share of "flaws, inconsistencies and annoyances." Fans, like myself, of those 1980s slasher films, know that's just what we got back then, since they produced them practically every quarter of the year. But, today? Eh, I get the homage, but there's no need to do it, if on purpose, in this day and age.The basic, but again nod to the 1980s, story: after a mysterious package containing a doll arrives at an old and scary house, the residing mother is murdered, and even though her murder is not investigated (??), the surviving, wheelchair-bound daughter has her family and priest visit for the night before the funeral. Subplots galore, some shocking  I did NOT see that affair coming, some blah, Chucky, that doll, apparently is alive and has the need for murder.The movie is a-b-c in the suspense and realization mode of the kills and sadly, Chucky, who's shed his previous two movie-entries "fun, funny and pun-loaded" side, had very little original or hilarious things to say this time. Also, some of the scenes went on way too long. The group is served just plain chili with no sides, or other courses, and while it's tense and there's something bad in one of the dishes, the boring dinner seems to take up a big chunk of the screen time. Further, there's literally five endings to this (only 97-minutes) movie, the last of which (you have to watch at the tail end of the credits for this one) completely contradicts ending #4/5.That said, about the endings, some of them I did NOT see coming, and thoroughly enjoyed the cameos, both of them. Namely the last one, but the first one was also welcomed.There's nothing groundbreaking here, and yet, it should be noted that it is the first Chucky movie that at least attempted  successfully, that is, to be scary. Recommended for die-hard Chucky fans.* * *Final thoughts: Perhaps, there'll be more, but here's my ranking now that the series is (probably) complete:1. Bride of Chucky (4/5 Stars) 2. Child's Play (3½/5 Stars)3. Curse of Chucky (3/5 Stars)4. Child's Play 3 (2½/5 Stars) 5. Seed of Chucky (2½/5 Stars) 6. Child's Play 2 (2/5 Stars)
Director Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later, Trainspotting) is an established and brilliant film-maker and knows this very-hard subject matter did, in fact, needed to be a short film  94 minutes.What this guy, Aron Ralston (played beautifully by James Franco in, by far, his best performance) had to go through for just over five days (go ahead: divide 127 hours by 24) was just torture and I'm just talking about the much-talked about exit strategy. Mercifully, since we really know what's to come before our butt hits the comfortable seat  I'm sure he'd give his right arm to sit down during those 5 days  ouch, sorry  its good we don't have to endure much more than an hour and a half.That's not to take away from his pain. But, quite literally, the events that took place, the background and surroundings, didn't really need much more time. Boyle did just fine with what took place.Simply speaking, avid and arrogant outdoorsman Aron treks alone in the Utah canyons after meeting two out-of-nowhere pretty girls. They invite him to a Scooby of a party that night after he shows them a "wet" time. I'm guessing this might have inflated his ego even more, if possible, and he takes an ill-fated risk causing a bolder to lodge between a canyon wall and his poor right arm.Unfortunately for him, no one's within shouting distance and all first attempts at freeing himself are futile. What follows (for what we know are hours, then days) are his textbook emotions  SEE: Open Water. And that's not discounting what he went through, nor is it saying any of its fake on what occurred during his imprisonment. For, unlike The Perfect Storm, Aron video tapes himself down there.Yeah, it's a true story, and I concur he's more of an survivalist than me, but I'd give up one whole paycheck for the batteries he was buyingnothing I own would last as long as his did on battery juice.I digress. Again, Franco did a fantastic job  pretty much, aside from (potential hallucinations) or flashbacks, he's running the one-man show.Comparatively speaking, the same year produced Buried, another one-man extravaganza about a man trapped in a coffin. Between the two, putting the "trueness" of this one aside, I'd pick 127 Hours even without the gruesome ending and self-mutilation he had to endure/cause.Aside from the great cinematography, the quick length and the performance worthy of an Oscar Nod (only) I will say I admire Boyle not turning this into a "Hero" type of feel-good movie. The man, Aron, did nothing heroic, he put himself selfishly and incautiously in harm's way and he did what needed to be done to get free. He didn't jump on a speeding train (Unstoppable) to save the children! Or trek to NYC (The Day After Tomorrow) to save freezing children! Or, you get the picture. He fell making a mistake after making a mistake of not telling anyone where he was at. So, he made mistakes, paid dearly and now we get an instructional video of what not to do.The movie's nominated for best picture. Sure, it was good, very well made, even though I did NOT care for the music choices very much. Should it win? Absolutely not. Should it be viewed: hell yes.
Yep, everyone's talking all about Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers in 2010's Black Swan. For that, I will put three of my two cents in: 1. She was, in fact, very good and will be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. 2. But, as good as she was, one of my votes goes to Kunis as Lily. 3. And my other vote goes to Annette Bening for The Kids Are All Right. Sorry, little miss Princess Padmé.But, what about the movie? Did you like the Bette Davis classic All About Eve?Okay, it's not exactly like that, or I might be spoiling too much, but it fits the same lines. In this case, we have ballerinas who prove it's NOT easy being black. (Uh, that's a reference to the Swanin case you were thinking of calling me a racist.)We have two aging dancers, the disturbed mom, Erica (Hershey), of Nina and the recipient of the Drama Queen award: Beth (Ryder). And we have two dueling and somewhat "friendly" up'n'comers Lily and Nina. Fine, Lily's not so up'n'coming, but she's certainly coming at times. Bad. Sorry. This is a SERIOUS review of a SERIOUS movie.I digress. Nina wants the role-of-the-present, the Swan Queen, playing dual roles of the good white swan and her evil twin, the darkie. Oops. Sorry. Anyways, she has to fight tooth and nail  mostly teeth, which has bite  to get it. Is she really ready? Will director Thomas (Cassel) let her have it or will he prepare her to be perfect?Nina has multiple issues on her own, SEE: not just disturbed but delusional mommy, but when Meg (Kunis) from Family Guy shows upall hell breaks down for Nina. No wonder no one likes Meg.The question arises if Nina will make it to the final act and will her bloody aliments (or peers) stand in her way.Overall, I did like the look and feel of the movie. The score's pretty good and the acting is near perfect. And it's gruesome at times  yeah, I had to look away, even though it wasn't the grossest scenes I've witnessed. But there are really only two reasons to see this: the magnificent performance by Kunis and the very good job from Portman, especially in the last third  that was Portman at her best.Oh, okay, if you're a horny dude, you'll add a third reason: the sex scene between both those ladies. Blah, blah, did nothing for me, but if you into that sorta lesbo scene  it's really hot and heavy.for less than a minute.
"Sorry." "Sorry, sorry!" "SORRY!" says agent Harry Tasker. Repeatedly.Is it about lying in True Lies? No, about all the destruction he causes and knowing the true Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'm sure he improvised that into the film.Aside from that and the meandering in between multiple and unnecessary subplots, I truly liked this film. It helped it was, unbeknownst to us all, the second to last great Schwarzenegger-helmed projects for a long time (1996's Eraser is the last great one, until 2013's fun The Last Stand premiered.) Also, aiding in this film's success was the unapologetic R-Rating  I miss those movies and the fantastic and often hilarious performance from Jamie Lee Curtis. (Okay, you can include the mostly funny Tom Arnold.) Further, this was when Director James Cameron was having fun and making a quality living. (Later, he would get sucked into the clichéd-heavy world of Avatar and sadly, not look back.) Finally, I love the gorgeous Tia Carrere and was saddened that she rarely starred in anything big beyond this and the Wayne's World films.'Double lives' movies weren't even new back in 1994, but thanks to the all-around performances and direction, True Lies made it feel fresh, and fun. In a thin, though normal-for-the-90s-action genre, plot, Schwarzenegger's Harry has a nice home life with a wife, Curtis's Helen and a boring  to her, albeit fake, job. Truly, he's a spy and is trying to thwart a terrorist attack in Florida. And no, it's not to end the fantastic Golden Girls TV series  that ended in 1992. But, since this movie was likely filmed in 1993, perhaps it was to end the terrible Golden Palace spin off that happened that year.That leads to this, this to that and Helen gets caught up in Harry's lies and despite the movie being fun (and funny) up to that point, the sh|t hits the fan and it gets even better with Curtis's role expanded in the last half.Now, you seriously cannot take this movie seriously, and like most 1990s action, this movie has more plot holes than Arnold had mistresses. And, I can forgive most of them. What I couldn't was the length and the over-the-top cartoon finale. (SEE: jet skiing in the air.)The movie was far too long (141 minutes!) and when we do get to that unintentionally laugh-out-loud climax, you'll agree that, despite how much fun the audience had up to that point, it should've been edited down a bit. Oh, wait, it's Cameron we're dealing with here. Never mind. He doesn't cut anything  he only produces gold, or so he'll tell you.Overall, despite a few drawbacks I had with the film  "Sorry!", overall, it's a fun ride and one of the best Schwarzenegger films in his collection.Side Note: As mentioned, for a period of almost 20 years, this was Schwarzenegger's second to last fantastic movie. The same goes for Cameron. His follow-up to this was the masterpiece Titanic. Sadly, aside from some water-related diving films, and the ho-hum of Avatar, he hasn't come back as Schwarzenegger has. I'm still waiting to see a great Cameron-directed film like beforeTitanic, True Lies, Terminator 1-2, The Abyss, Aliensanyone, anyone? Nowe get, the blah Avatar, and he wants to spend his remaining days on Earth doingthree sequels to those. Seriously? Come on.
I'll admit I'm not one for origin stories. Even with the original Superman: The Movie, Iron Man and the rebooted Batman Begins, I'm thoroughly impatient for them to get to what I came/paid for to see: the character in the suit. That said, I enjoyed every minute of X-Men. Even the Nazi intro.I don't even know how they could've made these characters any more interesting. Especially Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who seemed to fit perfectly in those claws. And though most of the superheroes were younger, the main characters were much older  a rarity in superhero movies. That was refreshing to see more of an adult and comic book adventure.Dr. Xavier (Stewart) has taken the high road in educating young runaway mutants at his school while his old pal, Eric or Magneto (McKellen) curved left and wants to prove to the world mutants are the next big thing, by any means (he feels) necessary. Pretty much both were at opposite ends of the same goal: mutant acceptance. Unfortunately, this is an age-old story of true life wars on racism and homophobia, and it never seems to end. Here, in X-Men, at least we can enjoy an adventure movie while learning tolerance.I definitely liked both characters, and Stewart was perfect for his role. But, McKellen was delicious as the deep Magneto. He played the "bad guy" as not so bad, if you pull back the layers.Meanwhile, we have a least a dozen other characters, all given a perfect amount of time to develop and make us care who lives or dies. Wolverine, a personal favorite of mine, probably has the biggest background (so much so, they continue his journey into his sordid past through 2 sequels and a spin off. Enough already!) but it's also the most interesting this time around. The weakest is Rogue (Paquin) and, like Wolverine, they stretch out her story to the thinnest level in sequels to come.While some of the characters were as weak as Rogue  namely Cyclops (Marsden), most were awesome to watch and even better on how each person's power and personality fed off each other to further the plot along.And speaking of whichMagneto has developed the power to make us mortals into the evolved mutants and plans to use a summit to prove mutants are superior. It's the X-Men to the rescue! Though the movie had a decent budget, it almost felt like they held back a little, avoiding some of the more popular X-Men characters so they could test the waters, obviously for further installments. That was probably the movie's biggest flaw. They didn't do that with Superman: The Movie or Batman. Thankfully, the film was a (deservedly) hit and they were able to expand.This movie is highly recommended. Great action, score, acting, depth, originality anda message! I would even say to see it for non-comic book fans. If they ever make a Justice League movie or The Avengers, let's hope it's even a 1/10 of how great this movie was.
Many films fall from grace in regards to sequels. Lethal Weapon started very good, got great with #2 and then fell below the first one with the third installment, cleverly titled: Lethal Weapon 3.Not that Lethal Weapon 3's all that bad. It's got its comedy, fantastic, though sporadic, action sequences  always nice to see real action in movies over the CGI world of today, and it's got the chemistry still in place between the two leads: Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover.) Unfortunately, what it suffers most from: probably one of the most aimless scripts of all time. This film was all over the place, as if the actors were told, via speakerphone because Director Donner had to be on some holiday spending his check he probably received immediately following #2, just do what you want, say what you think and cough it up. That last part nailed my point when one character, the infamous psychologist from the series played by Mary Ellen Trainor either has a cold, or her explanation of her coughing was cut from the final film.Further proving my critique, the movie is about armored piercing bullets, or cop killers, gangs, retirement, filming a movie, a land project, a new romance, an unwanted romance, an ex-cop, sublingual messages again  SEE: the Murtaugh's new dog, selling homes, the internal affairs department, or police police and the word word. And it jumps from one of these to the next without ease, warning or reason. Sure, they get to the point, but mostly it was about the cast reuniting for some more fun, of their own.You'll have fun, too, but at the cost of trying to sort things out. It's best to leave your brain at the door, just sit back and watch the few action scenes, like the enormously irrelevant but exciting explosion that opens the film. The humor's there  Gibson definitely had it, Glover played a more subdued straight man and Pesci's played his role all over again from #2.This viewing, however, reminded me a lot of the magic I felt when I first watched it, probably a dozen or more times when I was much younger. I forgot some of the lines I've used in real life, like "Kelly's pool hall. Kelly speaking." Yep, I've actually answered the phone with that. Or "It's the Police, Police."  I used to work in Quality Assurance, whereas I listened to phone calls of the customer service representatives of my firm and so I called my department the "Police, Police." Also, I've used "Why? Am I getting to you? Am I getting to you?" I guess the trend is, they love to repeat themselves. Word. Word.You could do a lot worse and if you try and jump past the Murtaugh feeling sorry for himself + the funeral scene, both of which took up entirely too much of the picture, you might have some fun. But take heed: as humorous and action packed some scenes are, this is a huge step down from #2 but a nice companion. I just wished they knew when to throw in the towel and quit here
I'm not blind to see that the filmmakers weren't hoping to make Anaconda more than a B-Movie, but I did see actors acting their hearts out. So, the contradiction made me hate on this movie.Oh, okay, that and the extremely terrible and outlandish actions and visuals of the snakes.I saw this movie many moons ago and possibly saw the first follow-up, which, by the way, is understandably even worse, and never took an interest in seeing it again. But the guys (and gal) over at How Did This Get Made put it on their list, and then, I had to revisit the Amazon once more.Routine, routine, routine this movie was until the snakes arrive. They're (or it might be the inept employees at the CGI camp) so comical that you don't actually get scared. You simply laugh. And I am not just talking 2014 here. I laughed just as equally in 1997 when this arrived. I mean, four years prior was Jurassic Park which effects STILL hold up today. So, NO EXCUSES or PASSES for you Anaconda.Really, this movie boils down to a film crew wanting to capture natives on film in the Amazon, but when one crew member gets ill and another stowaway might be more evil than he appears, things get bad. Like a waterfall that actually shoots water upwards, a double-shot take of characters entering a scene and then immediately entering the same scene, binge-eating snakes, the great Danny Trejo needing a voice over  and a bad one at that, a man-eating snake that, in real-life doesn't actually eat man, costs someone millions and an ending so ridiculous, so hilarious, it's almost worth watching for.Also, I feel bad for one of my all-time favorites, Eric Stoltz. He didn't just phone his performance in, he slept through it.I guess for a Saturday night, we have no plans and we will follow up this movie with a How Did This Get Made recap of the film on Sunday, it would be worth a shot. But, if it doesn't all play out like that, skip it!* * * Final thoughts: Yes, I reference a lot back to Jurassic Park, especially in the 1990s. Truthfully, that Steven Spielberg classic showed us  EVEN TODAY  things do NOT need to look fake if you resort to planning your entire movie around CGI. Later, the Lord of the Rings will prove that an entire world can be as real as ours. So, when I see shitty CGI, such as in this movie, I do NOT forgive them. They just wanted to make this probably $150 million movie on a $12 million budget. Shame!
For every valid reason 'Real Steel' (6/10 Stars) shouldn't work  and believe me, there are plenty  it actually did rise above its shortcomings. To get a few of those out of the way: Too long, too much for the 11-year-old crowds leaving little for adults, too predictable ("Real A-B-C Steal" would've been an appropriate title), and too many cardboard characters. This movie was absolutely saved by a fantastic acting of just 2½ people: Evangeline Lilly as Bailey  the believing girlfriend, Dakota Goyo as Max  the Jake.2 Lloyd of this generation, though with much more talent and Hugh Jackman as Charlie  a fantastic and believable performance. (Just so you know, the ½ person belongs to Evangeline as she was barely good, and yet hundreds of times better than the sometimes  unintentionally  laugh-out-loud and clichéd nemesis's sprinkled about.) Incidentally, the special effects were believable and the movie did a helluva job at making sure we believed this Roboxing sport of the future truly existed. The movie's Rocky-Rip-Off finale somehow worked as well. I was emotionally invested in the climax. And again, it's due to Jackman and the fantastic chemistry established with both son and Atom. Unbelievably, recommended.
Take a Memento: the Inception of Trance only will get weirder and weirder as it progresses. Try and keep up.Now, I am a (Director) Danny Boyle fan, as I am of (Director) Christopher Nolan's. What happens when we combine the two styles? Or, more accurately, what happens when Boyle steals from Nolan? Boyle's Trance is the result.The film, while I did like and, yet, had problems with, was so overshadowed by style, atmosphere and pretentiousness, it was more music video than movie. Sadly, this same thing happened to another favorite Director of mine, Steven Soderbergh. He sacrificed substance for style in his latest films and this knocked him out of my "favorite" Director spot.I had a sense, in the first half anyways, that Boyle's constant  make that, relentless shift in direction, camera angles, speed, visionshell, let's just call this an experimental filmmaking, that he had little faith in the story or characters. As the movie progressed, and especially, the last third, it's clear that there was a fun and interesting story that emerged amongst the chaos. Now, it's pretty much Memento meets Inception, but still enjoyable to get to the climax.Simon (James McAvoy) must regain his memory of what happened to a painting he helped steal in order to repay a gambling debt to Franck (Vincent Cassel,) a somewhat bad man. So, why not employ a hypnotist, Elizabeth (the always wonderful, Rosario Dawson) to dig up those memories of the valuable work of art? But, wait! She might have something up her own sleeveThe movie cannot be taken all-too-seriously. While it's fun at spots, and seems "well shot" at times, the is-it-real or is-it-The-Matrix tricks work for a while towards the finale, but enough is more than enough with the entire maxed-out and spaced-out camera alterations. A mere 20 minutes in and I was about done with the avant-garde filmmaking. I get it, already! You want to show off some "new moves."Please focus more on the story and characters and less on where you can put the camera next, Boyle. You've done this many times before: you previously haven't had to impress us that you know how to mix-up cinematography.Now, it's not an all-around bad or great film, and it's certainly not for everyone. It's for people who like the above referenced films (Memento and Inception) and for things shaken up a bit. The music's good, the performances are good and the outcome is somewhat satisfying, but to get to the conclusion, you'll have to have a lot more patience than I had.One viewing is best. Here's to hope Boyle focuses less on the artistic vision in his future and more on his storytelling, as he's already displayed.
Clearly, the writers of Top Secret! didn't know what decade they were spoofing. From 1950's dances and music to M*A*S*H and Mary Tyler Moore TV references to Satellites (?),Top Secret! simply got lazy at times. After awhile, you'll simply get used to them as none of this is really supposed to be taken seriously.So, get past that, I did, and you'll have a freaking blast as the good enormously outweighs the flaws. Sure, some (make that few) of the jokes are corny, predictable and don't work (Val's head in the toilet would've been funnier animated  wait, it was, on Scooby-Dooweekly) but most will have you rolling  A new version of Frogger, Der Pinto, The Tunnel of Irony, Tic Tac Glass, just to name a very few.American sensation, Nick (Kilmer) travels to Germany just as the rebellion builds up against the Nazis around World War II. He continually saves the damsel in many dresses while singing a few tunes and dances away unscathed. His mission, he didn't really choose, is to rescue the dame's imprisoned father and Batman's butler and escape East Germany.Really, the plot doesn't matter and as slim as it is, it's actually more complicated than the highly superior Airplane! The real joy is seeing true slapstick as it was meant to be, unlike the failed attempts of recent years. And yes, they can make a spoof without Leslie Nielsen, though he's a big part of why most of them worked in the 1970's and 1980's.The movie starts off with a bang telling you it's a silly movie, it only has one shot that they looked at the screen  something I only like in very small portions  and when they did, it was absolutely hilarious and the movie kept to what it was: spoof of war films, or the war itself, or Nazis. In either case, it didn't go in 50 directions like recent and unbearable spoofs, like Scary Movie 2, 3, 4, etc.Highly recommended for those who do love the 1980's, genuine spoofs and booted cows. Make sure you go to the special features on the disc  the deleted are really funny and I'm surprised they were cut, and there's an Easter Egg concerning yet another hilarious scene and its original format. One scene, I might have missed, but I recall a scene in which the table "rises" with the gentlemen's excitement and I didn't see it this time. I'll watch it again, but I'm kind of disappointed that wasn't here. AnywaysSEE IT!
"I saw evidence of humans," says the Seeker.I, myself, did not.The closest movie I could compare The Host to would be The Happening. But, since I stopped laughing at The Host about 20 minutes in, while hating life for the rest of the 125 minutes, The Happening was actually worse. In that M. Night Shyamalan movie, I laughed much more at it than I did with this one.Not that this wasn't downright hilarious, albeit unintentionally. Try these on for size: STORE is painted on the outside wall of astore. A male Thelma & Louise moment that wasn't just incredibly foretold and useless, but also must make the viewer laugh hard even when it's supposed to be "touching." Desert car chase scenes so uninspiring, so bland, they would literally make Max mad. Or this fantastically laugh-out-loud scene:"How does this help? There's no way out," says the Wanderer in reference to barricading the front door of an apartment."Yes, there is! That way!" says voice-over, in reference to ANOTHER DOOR six inches away.The Host plays out like a buck fifty, thirty-seconds-to-write, cheap SYFY Invasion of the Body Snatchers rip-off, as they do tend to do that a lot. And while it started off nicely, it immediately, and I'm talking minute 3 (of 125 agonizing minutes,) went so far south with a voice-over that seriously couldn't have been more comical and disgustingly bad. Even if Adam Sandler's signature Waterboy voice was the voice-over for the female, it still wouldn't as bad. (Actually, come to think of it, I would've preferred to hear his voice-over throughout than her'sand I can't stand that Sandler tone. It's like nails on a chalkboard.)And speaking of Twilight, obviously there are comparisons since both that series and this horrid movie was based on Stephanie Meyers's books, but damn, when the "Oh, look! There's the sky!" scene (yeah, that's the extent of the amazement in this movie from the characters) happens, our "heroine," Melanie, is conflicted with yet another boring love triangle and actually makes Bella look like an intelligently written female character. That takes a lot. At least, the biggest positive, is that this is a stand-alone film and the Earth doesn't have to endure four more brainless chapters.My hope, and I get few of those fulfilled, is that Meyer fades as fast as the equally untalented M. Night Shyamalan did. It took longer than I expected for him, but hopefully this will be Meyer's final nail.Oh, did I forget the synopsis of this movie, much like the writer? Well, outnumbered a million to one, alien "hosts" took over the human race for vague reasons and there's a human resistance. Yeah, I know, this is just hugely original. But, the small and insignificant twist is a human who, for unknown plot-hole reasons, can survive a few five-story drops, one of which causes damage to the concrete from her head. She's then gets the alien parasite and from that moment, there's conflict within her head and the host.The actual conflict is caring about her or the human resistance she joins or the lover boys she manipulates just as much as her Bella counterpart did in Twilight.There's little more to the story, much, MUCH little, and suffice to say, this terrible existence of a film is not even in so-bad-it's-good territory. I would recommend clips, namely of the voice-over, for shits and giggles, but please don't subject yourself to one horribly paced, overlong and poorly edited film with bad casting choices and worst of all: one of the most inept and uproariously bad screenplays in the history of film.I should've known it was the kiss of death when the poster reads: "FROM STEPHANIE MEYER THE AUTHOR OF THE TWILIGHT SAGA." But, beyond that ignorance of the rules of grammar, I never thought I would see another movie even remotely matches the terrible acting, hysterically funny dialogue or tired story than any of the Twilight films, but, there you go. Stephanie, you managed to do it again. Would you mind removing your home state from your bio? We already have enough people from Arizona that we're ashamed of that live here.Needless to say: this will surely be in my Top Ten Worst Movies of 2013 (if not of all-time,) and even on 4/20/13, I've seen some terrible releases this year. This is by far, #1 on the crap list."Kiss me likeyou wanna get slapped!" says The Wanderer. Can I skip the kissing part?
"Where would Tina Turner be right now if she'd rolled over and said, 'Hit me again, Ike, and put some stank on it!'? Rollin' on the river, that's where she'd be. But she's beyond Thunderdome, because she decided to send a message" - Jim Carrey, Liar Liar.Much like Breakin' 2's subtitle, "Electric Boogaloo" was immortalized by MST3k nerds, like myself, Tina Turner's turn in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was made famous in Jim Carrey's side-splitting speech to Jennifer Tilly in Liar, Liar.I would be wrong to say that quote is the only good part of her performance, because, quite frankly, she was a lot of fun in Beyond Thunderdome. Not to mention (lightly), one of cinema's best songs of all time: We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome) by Tina, herself. Sorry, Mel, in more ways than ten, she stole your franchise.It's obvious with each installment, the budget increases, the sandy desert more apparent and the lack of Max being "mad" is irritatingly maddening. In fact, maybe I'm missing the boat, but after three features I just viewed for the first time apiece, I'm still puzzled why he's called that. Perhaps a more suitable nickname would be "Solo Sam" or "Loner Lane."At any rate, again, Max faces the rough conditions alone in the desert following multiple events following the death of his wife and child in a semi-destructive future two chapters prior. The simple fact that this key element to Max's, ah-hem, drive hasn't resurfaced since their passing is beyond me. I'm shocked they even brought up that he was an ex-cop in this one as his tidbit of a background.Subsequent to a robbery, Max finds Bartertown and is thrown into a dispute between two "leaders" of the barren outpost and must fight a brute to gain his belongings back in the deathly "Thunderdome" fighting cage. Following an unexpected turn, Max is outcast and picked up by Ewoks disguised as children who believe him to be "the one" to lead them to the same driving getaway climax as expected in the Mad Max universe.The film's watchable and a lot more mature from the first MM feature, though a step down from The Road Warrior. It is shaky and probably unnecessary aside from a few key and interesting scenes  mostly in the grand finale, BUT, again should be noted for Tina's fun role and Tina's fantastic (and should've been nominated) song.
Though not as great as the original  they clearly knew the duo (Chan/Tucker) had some excellent chemistry in part 1 and thoroughly exploited it  Rush Hour 2 still was actually pretty darn good. And they up'd the ante by sending Tucker into Chan's territory, a reverse from part 1, but also dove deeper into the two's friendship & loyalty.Taking off immediately where part one left off  okay, a few days, LAPD cop Carter (Tucker) is vacationing with workaholic Lee (Chan) in Hong Kong where they unravel a plot of counterfeit money involving Lee's deceased father's ex-partner and crime lord, Tan (Lone.) This sends our newest/favorite buddy/cop duo across the globe from Hong Kong to LA to Las Vegas.Along the way, you still get Chan's impressive and original stunts, Tucker's humor still intact and wonderful guest appearances. Cheadle was wonderful but Piven had me rolling.Again, just as part one, it contained its flaws, including the widely unrealistic portrayal of Vegas and how far these two could go without so much as being immediately expelled from a casino, but if you sit back and enjoy, they kept it as fresh as the first and you will fall in love with these friends all over again.Highly recommended for fans of part 1, action/adventure and comedy enthusiasts and definitely for people addicted to both Chan and Tucker films.
OK, I missed the boat. Much like 1983's Scarface. I simply waited too long.Fast Times at Ridgemont High is as dated as they come, yet all the males (mostly, if not exclusively straight) remember this movie fondly. Heck, it was featured just recently in the most current American Dad episode. (Side Note: thankfully, I just now saw this, so I knew who Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) was and could catch the reference.) So, it's an enormously influential part of the everyday heterosexual male's life.Is it because of the extensive female nudity? The surfer-dude anarchy/teachers N school sucks! attitude? How about the whole package: show a movie that should contain male nudity, such as the boy's locker room or a guy masturbating, but don't because guys don't want to see that?Pause. Yep, that's what guys wanted to see. No sausages, only breasts. Well. You'll get that, plus so little more!Such as NO PLOT. Guys fooling around. A school year that passes before your eyes. Teachers that are a blind as politicians to the American voter's needs.What more do you want?Well, I want more. But, even being late to seeing this movie, roughly thirty years  argh, I need some resemblance of a plot line. Halfway through this movie I was trying to figure out what it was all about. And then when it ended, I said: "Oh! I now knowless than when it started."That saidthe movie wasn't terrible. It was funny for the most part. It had a great soundtrack.Is it a movie I want to see again? NO. Is it because I'm not heterosexual? NO. Is it because I saw it 30 some odd years too late? NO. It's because I enjoy my movies with substance.That doesn't make this a terrible movie as it was a fun viewing. But it does make it a one-time, event film that would've been great for horny boys in the early 80s. Step into (EVEN) 1983 and we've already outdated ourselves. Haven't we? Whoa! Dude!
Okay, I'm a sucker for disaster movies. Of course, for me to watch more than once they need at least the following: decent acting, story, heart and definitely good special effects to make me believe not only that I am there, but that there's an imminent threat presented. Dante's Peak really fits the bill. Perfect? By all means, no, and I don't think Brosnan, Hamilton or Director Donaldson would disagree. They all set out to show a film of heart, with a backdrop of a natural disaster, in this case, an erupting volcano. Sure, it's not original; Dante's Peak solely takes from Twister and even Jaws. And it seems like, similar to Jurassic Park, they had the technology, why not create a definite volcano disaster flick. Giving the Brosnan volcanologist a bit of a background, he loses his girl in a separate volcano incident four years prior. And now he may be jumping the gun in the quiet, 2nd best town of Dante's Peak by saying their sleepy volcano's about to blow. Obviously, the story (and events that follow) is predictable, but that's the fun in going into a film like this. The first half of the film is filmed with gorgeous mountain scenes and a great looking town. The second half is what people bought tickets (or rented) for: a roller coaster of action, suspense and touching moments, though mostly forced. Hamilton and Brosnan save the movie with their believable, though clichéd and predictable characters. And some scenes, you'll just have to suspend that disbelief: seriously, not only is he going to attempt to drive over lava, but put everyone else and the leaping dog at risk? Still, it's enjoyable, the special effects are outstanding and with the lights out, it's a real fun (and hot) ride.
Who would dispute that Rise of the Guardians is a gorgeously made animated film, with some awesome characters, fun, adventure and some heart? If so, then you don't believe and you're part of the(ir) problem.I kid. And, in reality, I didn't want to see this. The trailers didn't interest me, the idea of the "guardians" didn't strike me as original and I really got animated out the last couple of years. BoyI was wrong.Now, it certainly had its downsides  Santa, er, "North"  was really a (omitted, because, well, uh, this is a children's movie) at times, and probably landed on my bottom five of all Santa's I've seen in movies. (The Easter Bunny was no spring picnic, himself, either.) The heart was there, but it was overshadowed by the adventure and graphics, which, again, were spectacular, but the story always needs to shine above cinematography. And I wanted to like the main star, Jack Frost, more, but he certainly went through the same ole motions of "that reluctant hero" until the very end.That all said  and I wanted to get that out of the way, I really had a great time during this and did laugh a lot  especially with the elves and Sandy. Will it be an endless animated holiday classic? (Which one, you ask? Eh, pick one.) Don't think so. I certainly believe The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Polar Express trumps this movie, but that doesn't mean it stands alone away from the holidays as a highly exciting adventure.When the movie begins, we see the origins of Jack Frost and how good he is. I immediately got into his story, because, somehow, I thought he was going to be the villain. I think The Santa Clause 3 warped my fragile little mind on that character. But, alas, after fast-forwarding 300 years, he's still a good and "just wanna have fun" kind of guy. He plays the "where's my place" card and is summoned to join "The Guardians"  a band of childhood fantasy characters whose job is less protection of children as they claim and more focused on making sure children still believe in them. I think Freddy Krueger has played this card more than onceMeanwhile, and the reason of Jack's calling, we have the deliciously fun Pitch, who has the hardest time trying to distinguish himself from Hades of Disney's Hercules from those who grew up on the pre-Pixar animated Disney fare. He's bent on instilling fear into children  oh, he's the Boogeyman, by the way  and casting doubt on the Guardians.He's a pretty decent villain with some great truths  my kind of cinema bad guy. Despite his charisma, will confused Jack join him, or stick with the Guardians to bring joy to all the children who believe? I repeat: this is a children's movie. So draw your own conclusion.2012's animated films had their highs and way lows. Rise of the Guardians is certainly in the top portion, and I am sorry I didn't see it in theatres. But, then again, I get burnt out on how many there are and usually suckered into the bottom portion cartoons.This is a must-see, and if possible, on BluRay. It's absolutely stunning.
Yes, it's predictable (extremely.) Yes, it's typical (Carrey.) Yes, it's a rip-off (Liar, Liar.) But, I find the most important "yes" is: Yes, it's actually funny and in some scenes genuine and heart-warming.Well, some of it is. It's nice to see Carrey taking on more of an "adult" comedy role, not toning down his language humor. So, I found myself laughing a lot in Yes Man.Unfortunately, every time I was laughing, or enjoying myself, it took a dive, whether a very slow-moving scene or an unoriginal idea or just into predictable territory. These were the movie's undoing. Oh, and that the leads (May-December at its best) had zero chemistry. That didn't help either.The nice thing about the movie, unlike Carrey's better movies, Liar, Liar or The Mask, in this one, he's given the "choice" to be "a better man." So, I liked the so-called realism he finally portrayed.Carl is a definite "no-man" in his life or job as a loan officer at a bank. When given the chance to attend a guru's workshop to say "yes" to opportunities, he actually attends and tries it out with success. When he does, in fact, say no, coincidentally, bad things happen.There's a lesson to be learned, as in 90% of Carrey's films and predictability, you'll see it coming. Whether in his yes-choices or romance with the typically very good Deschanel (Carl's love interest) but in this case very misplaced. I loved her so much in (500) Days of Summer, but here, she looks so out of place, it's painful on how she tried to be "perky." For fans of Carrey's earlier work (Liar, Liar remains my favorite of his comedies) this is worth a viewing. In fact, it's his best comedy since Bruce Almighty (2003) but one of his weakest movies. And that's sad. For a lot of the movie, it's down-right hilarious and had scenes that can teach "loving life," but for most of the movie, it's so boring, expected and clichéd.
First off, I am going to give my modern day thoughts on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone since I just now watched it for the first time in about 10½ years. And then, I will tell my story. I will begin with the positives to be nice. To be generous.80% of the special effects and sets worked extremely well with the exception of showing both The Man With No Nose  oops, I'm jumping ahead, I mean: The Man's Name They Only Speak Of Seldomly and ANY flying sequence including that Rubbish, er, I mean Quidditch game. Also, the film was a perfect fantasy for youngVERY YOUNG, that is, kids. Oh, and the score was unbelievably great.Whew. Got that out of the way. Okay, here goes: the movie was too damn long. The movie contained a minuscule amount of plot  or direction and the bulk was just spliced together scenes of a freshman year at a unique school. Quite frankly, it felt like 1,001 ideas and made up names (for useless characters, random spells, odd or clichéd wizardry creatures and places) were basically thrown at us while hero Wesley Crusher, a.k.a. Harry Potter, attempts to figure out what the whole point to this mess is.What started off very nicely in a fantasy and magic-filled-world slowly grinded to a halt so they could show off more fantastic sets and a zillion characters and objects in a school bent on kidnapping kids to learn sorcery. Eventually, it takes about an hour and forty-five minutes or roughly fifteen minutes past what this movie should've been clocked at, to learn what our "hero" (??) Harry Potter should accomplish before the credits roll.By that point, I kept repeating two phrases over and over: "I don't like this movie" (despite the graphics and the wonder it's showing me) and that this is really made for the five and under crowds. Further, when the movie finally did get past the climax of what Harry & Pals (including his poor idiot ginger chap and know-it-all-bitch with terrible hair) need to accomplishthere are FIVE endings. This movie would never, ever, ever, ever end.Oh, and before the judgments roll in, I *have* read the book. Book one, that is. I found it's all-but exactly, word-for-word as the adaption. And that's not necessarily a good thing. Despite its approximately 300 pages, enormously large print, wide margins and drawings  all of which would make it approximately 3 chapters of any normal Stephen King fare  it's just as plot less as the movie until the end. All the way through both the book and movie, I kept fantasying about other movies/books I could be entertained by that contained a point to the story from beginning to end.Now, that all said, it's not a terrible movie. It's a good intro to what's to come and again, it's PERFECT for very young kids. Is it a movie I will ever revisit, or as now, re-watch in another 11 years? Hell no. Now, that I can finally write a review, I never have to experience Harry's seemingly never-ending freshman year at Hogwart's school.And now here's my take on my original screeningA Long Time Agoin our own galaxy, sort of, I watched Harry Potter Part One  since it's known by two different names, for asinine reasons, I will refer this as "Part One"  only due to a babysitting gig I was coaxed into. I had already made up my mind not to see this film, since swords/wizards/fantasy isn't my cup of British TeaBut, since I had seven hours of babysitting two young boys, I thought: why not take up an hour and a half on a movie they'll probably want to see?That was mistake one and two: forgoing my vow and that I mistakenly thought it would be an hour and a half. Mistake number three was that we went on weekend one or two  I can't recall, or I choose not to  so, the theatres and parking lot were still jammed. We barely made our show time after parking and getting snacks.Despite being tortured (SEE ABOVE REVIEW) for the movie's duration, I was pleased I had just used up 5 of the 7 babysitting hours with the journey there, movie and back. As for the boysboy, they LOVED the movie. They LITERALLY sat on the edge of their seats the entire time. (No joke.) Good for them. I'm glad the money I spent on their entertainment and their snacks was well worth it.I, on the other hand, was squirming in my seat the entire time or at least after the first pointless hour. I had NO IDEA that this was over an hour and a half, let alone 2½+ hours  I was so disinterested in seeing this, I had completed no research. NO KID MOVIE SHOULD EVER BE THAT LONG  I originally thought. Not to mention, no kids movie should contain FIVE ENDINGSas stated above: the movie would never, ever end.Again, I remember the boys, one of which is my (now 15-year-old) nephew, loved every single minute and as uncomfortable as I was, I'm sincerely glad they had a good time. In fact, I need to make a point of asking him if he remembers me taking him. He had to be between 4-5 at the timeA year later, I would be dragged into seeing the remake/sequel with my partner and suffice to sayI could write the same damn review all over again.(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years.)
Honestly, I wasn't a big fan of Alien: Resurrection when it was first released. I saw it at Harkins Arizona Mills and walked with distaste because, at that time, I was a thorough lover of the Alien³ film. Years later, I would reverse my opinion by simply opening my eyes to the (literal) horror of Alien³ and realizing, despite the "humor" of Alien: Resurrection, it was 10x the movie part 3 was and a good conclusion of the series.The movie wasn't taking itself too seriously. If it did, it would be very odd for the once-great Ripley character to be spewing lines that only (other Sci-Fi great) Spock would recite. It was fun, scary, adventurous and just enough suspense and originality to be added to any Alien franchise lover's collection.Unfortunately, you kind of have to see the wretched Alien³ to get the background needed: (and believe me, this is a spoiler for those who haven't seen part 3) Ripley's partners from Aliens died, including the young girl, Newt and Ripley gets stranded on Fury 161, a prison planet, but not before being injected with the queen alien. Ripley attempts at destroying the *only* queen by killing it along with herself.200 years and 8 attempts later, the new "company" of militants, clone her and remove the queen alien in order to spawn more alien warriors for the battle..of a war we've never seen. Anyways, they decide to keep #8, or Ripley, alive and she slowly, but surely, regains some of her memories of her uncloned past. Meanwhile, we have on this cloning ship a group of renegades who brought the hosts to those aliens. They're very rambunctious with this new model Ripley, but all hell breaks loose when the inevitable happens: the aliens, smartly, escape on board.So, here it turns into the past, once again, making this a thankful last chapterthe movie turns to escaping off the ship to avoid being either eaten or harvested for the Queen. Luckily, Ripley (Weaver) keeps it interesting with dialogue and quips and they introduce the NEVER-SEEN-BEFORE alien swimmersnot that that's a big deal.The movie's finale still puzzles meeven after watching this several times. I don't want to spoil it even further, but the two (vague) things that bother me was Ripley's willing to go there and why one character/creature kills another immediately. This could just be me, but I can see why they were trying to change it up at the endeven though it ended just like part one?I have already stated to stay away from the "Special Edition" of Alien³ and I might have repeated that hereif only for the incredibly awful, "Men in Black" opening segment. Don't let that discourage you or set the scene for Alien: Resurrection. Simply, get the DVD that contains both, watch the original (theatrical) opening credit scene  though it looks like some Child's Play horror sequel beginning  and then continue on with the rest of the special edition. Seriously, the MIB terrible "special" edition should be avoided, while the rest is just fine.It's a watchable movie, with some really funny lines and scenes  I loved the "it was in my way" bit. It's nowhere near the caliber as Alien or Aliens and it's 10x higher than Alien³but it's worth a viewing to complete the series.Side Note: (spoiler) Once again, they kill off one of the best characters almost immediately. In Alien³ the doctor was axed prematurely and Newt, Bishop and Hicks earlier. Here, it was the captain, Frank (Wincott)he got the same quick fate. Yeah, I get this is not supposed to be a bed of roses, but come on, for oncelet someone other than Ripley prevail.
Let's skip the whole concept of a (creature-)feature where a man falls for a plastic sex-doll. Let's roll past the shockingly unbelievable behavior of the entire townmeaning, EVERYONEwho play along. And let's march past the unlikeliest of heroes: the mentally ill dud who gets all the attention.My suspension of disbelief, which should've crashed around the half-way mark, was vanquished when the ambulance & ER partake in the ruse.I'm getting a little head of myself while circling around a spoiler alert and I'm making it like I hated the feature: Lars and the Real Girl. ReallyI didn't. It was a somewhat sweet tale of an ill male, Lars (played very, VERY, low-keyed by Ryan Gosling) who consciously purchases a life-size plastic female and takes her on as his partneronly he believes she's alive.Naturally, others around him, especially his brother, Gus (Schneider) and Gus's wife, Karin (Mortimer), thinks he's either stone-cold nuts or just very sick. But, under the advice of the small town's only (it appears) doctor, Dagmar (Clarkson), they have to play along, until Lars doesn't need the crutch, er, sex-doll anymore.Obviously, this is a "feel-good" independent and "small-town" kinda movie, so everyone must participate in thinking the "real" girl, Bianca is, well, real. They, incredibly, have the doll teach kids while being shown the high-life (of a town of probably 50, if that's possible) including beauty salons, new clothes/mall shopping, etc.Will the unusual (even before this turns into the Valley of the Doll) Lars accept what ailment he needs to in order to not lean on plastic anymore? Will Lars accept the affection of perky, though, thoroughly annoying, real, real girl: Margo (Garner), instead?Okay. What I liked about the feature was how it was shot, the crispness of the surroundings and most of the performances that never let me believe it was anything but Smallville, USA. I absolutely loved Patricia Clarkson as Dr. Dagmar who not only stole every scene, but enhanced the movie beyond the basic concept corner it backed itself into roughly one hour in. And, as usual, I loved the original concept and drive the filmmakers had.What I didn't favor: I could never get into Lars. I was never convinced he was "something special" that the entire town would love so much, want to heal so badly, that they're willing to go too far above and beyond the act of personifying a THING, even when you get over that it's really meant to be banged and not befriended.Sure, Lars is ill; we get that knowledge prior to the toy comes into his life. Sure, it's not his fault he can't be physically touched or have a conversation that lasts past the 45 second mark. But beyond that, he's not very nice  when he does open up, although he's not very mean. He just wants to be left alone. So be it. He's not in a position to harm himself or anyone else, so just let him be. I guess that leads me to disliking the town that simply won't let this sleeping dog lie.Also, the movie had severe pacing problems. I understand there's probably real people like this out there, and perhaps this should be explored further, but this movie was in desperate need of additional editing. Sometimes, independent directors are the worst. They love their "heart-projects" sooo much, they never want to cut even 15-16 seconds out, probably figuring: "Well, I don't have a major studio breathing down my throat (yet)so I can do what I want (for now)!"Wrong. Cut the fat. Make it tighter. I understand some of the extras or second/third characters are probably dear friends/family, but they need to go.Finally, as mentioned above, the movie really loses steam after awhile. And if you bought all (or any) that was happening with the pretend time the town went through, I doubt you'll find it easy NOT to laugh when the E.R. comes into the picture. I think I recall my exact words were: "OH, COME ON!" while bursting out on what was supposed to be an emotional scene.Overall, it's basically harmless. It contains some good comedic moments  namely at the work place (hang the stuffed animal!) Also, it knows how to step back from being too offensive to some audiences (it is a sex-doll, in spite of everything) and it brings to light an illness that might not be too well known. Also, if anything, it's worth checking out the supreme acting of Clarkson. I would recommend for independent-film lovers or any adult who knows someone in love with adult-sized (sex) dolls.Side Note: On a personal note, I would've had a field day with at least the first "outing" of Bianca. I wouldn't have spoiled Lars's somewhat fun/delusion, I just would've went further with having a great time "talking" with Bianca. Anyone that knows me personally would whole-heartedly agree on how much fun I would have and how I would lighten the mood for anyone within earshot. The uptight couple who couldn't handle Lars's obsession with the doll missed out on a golden opportunity.
I don't see what the problem is here. Cowboys & Aliens was a fun, action-packed, genre-bending and big-budgeted Bmovie. And for me to like it means something; I am not fond of westerns nor subscribe to the alien-invasion films.We've had hundreds of alien movies and even more westerns. But, how much more vulnerable are we (humans) are against alien life forms than in the old west? At least this film shined the light on a new angle to the age-old creature assault kind.Believe it: we have everything handed to us from the two separate types that we would love if we cared for both genres. A man with no name. A man who runs "the town." Aliens with a mission of extraction. A beauty with a secret. A secret weapon triggered by emotion  oh, wait, that's kinda like the Hulk, but still.I enjoyed my time here. It was a fun and (mildly) leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature. Daniel Craig (Man with No Name/Memory) did great and had some exciting action, hand-to-hand combat. The ever lovely Olivia Wilde kept her secret safe to add tension. And the town  and desert neighbors  were alive with great and well-known characters.Sure, the movie wasn't perfectHarrison Ford was annoying, as usual. Why he couldn't be the one that threatened, and then kept, retirement plans like all the other actors that irresponsibly and prematurely stated is beyond me. His last great role was 1997's Air Force One. Please Ford, leave. I'd say, "While you're ahead" but that was 14 years ago. We'll still remember you as one of the greats, but you've dug your own grave for far too long.Basic synopsis: Man wakes in desert with no memory and makes way to dysfunctional old-west town which is about to be attacked by aliens. It's up to the disagreeing town folk and neighbors to align forces, with (primitive to us, or regular movie-goer's expectations) whatever weapons possible to defeat the greedy out-of-spacers.Really, it's that simple and stretched for two hours. It should've been shorter, but it still worked and was a fun ride. Even if you're not keen to westerns and/or alien stories.
By the time of this writing, Blockbuster Inc. stores probably have all but vanished. Each with a sign that indicates that it's "just this store" that's closing. Sad, but that's how the story goes. Remember the Beta Video stores?When I was a kid, and we got our very first VCR  man, that was like the invention of television for those around my age  and I was able to save up enough money to buy two previously viewed movies. And get this: I had to actually pre-order previously viewed VCR tapes and they were incredibly $19.95 apiece!No matter; I really wanted both Lethal Weapon 2 and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. And bad.They were like gold for me. And they, along with a birthday gift of the original Batman, certainly earned their weight. I must've watched those three  my only movies  fifty times each.So, you can see: I am very familiar with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Every inch, score number and frame. I love this movie.Later, I would contest and readily agree, Raiders of the Lost Ark is both a masterpiece and better film, but that doesn't deter on howmuchFUN this third installment is. And I'm not even mentioning the dreadful part two: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. In my mind, there's only Indy 1 and 3. You can even forget the (yawn) Young Indiana Jones (so-called) Adventures.Everything worked in this movie: suburb acting, hilarious and fun dialogue  mostly from the chemistry (or banter) of the two Jones's, extreme adventure, exciting action, fantastic characters, nostalgia  for fans of Raiders and great twists. And one of the best aspects is also a spoiler,  sorry, but if you haven't seen this 22-year-old epic, that's your fault  it has one of the best endings in the history of cinema: they actually ride off into the sunset. Brilliant and beautiful ending to the series!** - that is until they ruined it with the overkill: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Best advice? Think of this as the actual LAST adventure and forget that wretched sequel.Heck, I can't really pinpoint many, if any, faults or flaws in Last Crusade. Pooossssibly, the over-long opening segment with the original "Young Indiana" played by the late and great River Phoenix? Even that was entertaining, fun and had an awesome score track. So, technically, it's not a setback, but perhaps needed a little more editing.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is overwhelmed at school, but is more so when his father, Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery  in, Literally one of his best on-screen performances) is listed as missing. Indy is tempted with the prospect of finding the mystical Holy Grail, even though he, himself, doesn't believe it. He does set off on a mission to find his father, but we all know, he'd equally like to find this "Lost Cup of Jesus Christ."He meets up with (what I grew up referring to as "the blonde") the beautiful and seductive dame Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) and they quest to find daddy Jones and ward off Nazis. Not so much a spoiler, but he does rescue Henry Jones, Sr. and the race for the Grail is on between the Jones's and the Nazis.I left out a lot, but that's the basic, BASIC, premise. Seriously, if you have not seen this, or have even, see it (again, if you have) and learn to enjoy the film that frankly defines adventure. And a movie that captures the heart of the original, the atmosphere of the serials of before most of our times and how movies were really made: pre-CGI.On a related note: while some people are anti-3D, I am boarder-line anti-CGI. Sure it's a cheaper way of filmmaking, but I feel it's just that: cheap. Rarely will it be believable in my sight, for the most part it's all-but a cartoon and extremely laughable. That said, it can worksometimes. The recent 2010 Alice in Wonderland film is a perfect example of how it can really work and impress me. But, 80% of the time, it's just plain corny, distracting and again, CHEAP. My favorite action/adventures films are how they used to be made: with both inventiveness and heart. Like this one. Heck, I'll take a blue/green screen any day over a computer telling me what's "real" looking.But, I digress. I hesitate in calling this a masterpiece (in filmmaking, at least) but in my mind it is. And seeing that this is an opinion piece, I will go on record: it doesn't get much better than this.I remember some of the promotional shots on the late night shows from Harrison Ford, et al, that casually admitted Temple of Doom was a disaster  I AGREE  and this was a make-up movie. It sure the heck was! This was thee number one redemption movie of all time.Note to Hollywood: continue the redemption. Make movies like this, verses the CGI-laced, no-script films of the last decade or so. Remember what it's like to have this much fun in the movie going experience. I remember. I recall 1989 when this was released as my all-time favorite year in films released. Too bad, they haven't come close to '89 in 22 years.And Hollywood won't listen. I ask that you do. Support and watch movies like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Remember what it was like to have fun in the theatre, what it was like when real special-effect crews did real work on the fields and not in the office and remember what it was like to be a kid again. See this movie!
Hard to believe it's nearing 20 years since they released Speed. And it, pretty much, still holds up today.This was just one of the long lines of very good to great movies that starred and was certainly not helped by: Keanu Reeves. At the time, he was the luckiest man in Hollywood, from Bram Stoker's Dracula to Speed to The Matrix. He got to be in the cream of the crop without having to show any depth or acting ability. Perhaps, that's what director Jan de Bont was looking for here: a soulless and cardboard cop and well, there you go.Actually, the real star here was Sandra Bullock and this was her break-through role. She stole every scene, had the best lines and timing and looked stunning. Hell, even Dennis Hopper's juicy and fun Howard "anything but a" Payne was no match for Bullock. So, if you forget the forgettable Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton and, naturally, whiteout Reeves, the true stars were Bullock and Hopper.They were so good, that even with the great amount of enormously enjoyable action, it's worth seeing just for them two.Speed focuses on disgruntled Payne and when his terrorist plot of bombing an elevator  too bad he didn't pick the one from the terrible Devil movie  is thwarted by the cops (Reeves's Jack Traven and Daniels's Harry Temple,) Payne shifts to road wars. He rigs a bus that, once it hits 50 mph, it will explode if it slows below 50 mph. Luckily, for everyone on this LA bus, when the bus does hit 50 mph, it's navigated by shrewd, albeit rightfully scared, passenger Annie Porter and Traven, who happened to "catch the bus."There are rules, of course  this is a 90s terrorist action flick, duh. No one can get off the bus, and Payne wants money for an undisclosed and anti-spoiler reason, or he'll blow the bus. Annie must pilot this bus through the already terrible LA traffic while the stiff, er, Jack figures out what to do.Since the years, and now almost decades, since this came out, this movie's been dissected enough. Sure, there are huge plot holes, some even big enough to drive (or leap) said bus through  even at 50 mph, but if you sit back, leave your brain at the door, you can enjoy the ride. It's campy 90s action fare, and for those of us who loved it back then and still do, this is the movie for us.I will say, I do have one huge problem with this. Okay, maybe not the original, but the sequel. STAY AWAY FROM (anything but) Speed 2: Cruise Control. That movie was a tragedy from beginning to end. And this kind of movie did NOT need a sequel. It was great as it was. Just have fun here and don't take the next bus.
I could fill two pages of quotes from Liar, Liar and only skim the surface on how incredibly funny it was. Yet, I wouldn't be doing the movie justice because it's not all about comedy, but heart, drama and growing.A lot of movies try hard, they really do try their best to blend comedy and human drama and come up with the same conclusion when water meets oil. Director Shadyac picked the perfect crew, writer and actors to make us truly believe the heartbreak these characters go through.Immediately labeled as a "liar" or lawyer, as teacher corrects student Max Reede (Cooper,) attorney (and Max's father) Fletcher Reede (Carrey) is close to the top of his firm and inching closer. Unfortunately for him, he's sacrificing the love he truly has for his son, whom he shares joint custody with his ex, Audrey (Tierney.) He doesn't just sacrifice, he's abolishing all hopes and dreams of the little one, even when Max, nor, oddly his mother, give up on him. In the main premise scene of the movie, Max make a birthday wish that for one day, Fletcher cannot tell a lie, strangely enough, the day starts at 8:15 PM.Unfortunately, Fletcher has the biggest and Make-Partner case of his life defending Samantha Cole (Poker Goddess Jennifer Tilly with unusually short and blonde hair) when everyone knows she's slimy/guilty/slutty and the only way to get her "just rewards" in her own divorce case is for Fletcher to lie.He needs a work around, when it's finally clear to him (THE PEN IS BLUE!) he cannot even fib. Serious comedy ensues when he juggles his anti-deception (apparently in any form), his son who might be leaving 3,000 miles with mom and new fiancé, the case, his boss & boss's boss and actually taking to heart what this really means.A la Groundhog Day. Which, by the way, ranks slightly over this movie, but both are under the same fantasy realm in which a character must embark on unusual circumstances to, well, learn a lesson.I hate to downgrade the movie to "Okay, fine, you have to like Jim Carrey to like this." I understand the world's divided with Carrey lovers/haters, Adam Sandler haters/lovers, etc, but I have spoken to multiple people that don't care for Carrey and still love this movie.I'm thinking it has to do with the excellent acting all around, the deep humor and characters and also the heart that went into the story.If you've seen the recent Toy Story 3, and you see that little girl in the finale sad she couldn't get the toywell, that's a cartoon (and well done, I might add.) I truly felt Max's heart shatter when his father lies to him or lets him down. At the same time, I honestly felt he never gave up, even though it was absolutely knocking him down. Simultaneously, I felt Fletcher grow and show true love for his son. You don't get these two characters in half the Dramas that come out.And this is labeled as a comedy. It's freaking hilarious from moment one to Carrey actually making fun of his own career, concerning funny faces, to the outrageous finale that if you feel like you don't believe that could happen  remind yourself: the movie's based on a birthday wish that actually comes true.Make sure you watch the deleted scenes, including the outtakes in the closing credits. Too bad this received a PG-13aside from a few minor words and sexual situations, this really is good for the whole family. SEE IT!
If you love ChristmasIf you want to feel the magicTry your best to Survive 'Surviving Christmas.' This movie is the #1 worst excuse for a Christmas movie. It makes 'Christmas with the Kranks' bearable. It's built on lies, deception, desperation and an incredible lack of humor or homage to the Christmas spirit. At very least, it has Scrooge's blessing, before he becomes good, that is. Here's the deal: Stay clear of 'Jingle All the Way,' 'Christmas with the Kranks' and 'Surviving Christmas' and you will have a blessed holiday season this year. 1/5 Stars.IMD(b) is making me write more. How much more can I say about this? I hated this movie with a Christmas Passion. Jamie Lee apparently was good for one role. Okay, I liked her in TRUE LIES. But other than those two, and I hope you know other role I am referring to...
The Dictator definitely had its moments. Want to see them? Watch the trailer.I'm kidding, of course. There are more in the movie, itself and the more I think about it, since I've seen this movie, I laugh a little extra. I also admire the man who completely and utterly mocked the horrible dictators, dead or alive, of the world.Sacha Baron Cohen has already won my heart with his spoof Mockumentary characters Borat and Bruno, but here he literally spits in the faces of such evil men. Who wouldn't give him a high-five for that feat?That said, The Dictator isn't a great movie, but it's an enjoyable enough film of said Dictator who goes from riches to rags in New York City and "learns" about compassion along the way. And along the way, for us viewers, that is, we just get multiples of sketches strung together to make up the running time.There really is a thin straight-line plot, but for the most part you will, as stated, just see scene after scene of things the writers find funny. You might, as well and Cohen does keep it lively in his never-faltering portrayal of a bad, bad man.Normally, I don't include movie quotes in my reviews, but this one line is worthy of anyone seeing this and I will leave you on this as there's not much more to say about this movie:"Why are you guys so anti-dictators? Imagine if America was a dictatorship. You could let 1% of the people have all the nation's wealth. You could help your rich friends get richer by cutting their taxes. And bailing them out when they gamble and lose. You could ignore the needs of the poor for health care and education. Your media would appear free, but would secretly be controlled by one person and his family. You could wiretap phones. You could torture foreign prisoners. You could have rigged elections. You could lie about why you go to war. You could fill your prisons with one particular racial group, and no one would complain. You could use the media to scare the people into supporting policies that are against their interests." - Aladeen
I admit I watched Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire for the fact actress Sidibe most likely will win best actress. In addition, Mo'Nique was getting a lot of praise. The biggest surprise and another reason I needed to see Precious, was the words: Mariah Carey and good acting were in the same sentence. That alone is the price of a ticket for the surprise of the century.Truth is, they all deserve it. The movie itself was good, or very good, though hard to watch at times. If you can put up with almost two hours of physical, emotional and sexual abuse, you might be able to see the very fine performances of the ladies I just mentioned. Also, you will see the truism and excellent transitions of the characters. For example, any time away Precious (Sidibe) has away from her very abusive mother, whether one day, one week or several, you will honestly see the sun rise from behind the horizon. She's typically shy, quiet, angry, depressed  all typical of those who spent years abused and ridiculed, but with free time, or mother-less freedom, she opens, ever so slightly. This is why I liked the movie, and Sidibe's awesome performance.The heartbreaking story is of a heavy weight 16-year-old girl who gets kicked out of school for her second pregnancy in the late 1980s. She's obviously closed in, angry, depressed, withdrawn. (By the way, this doesn't come natural for real life Sidibe, but you can't tell in the film. True acting.) Her only release, it seems, is when something really bad happens, she begins a daydream of fame/fortune  her way of dealing with the lemons she has been dealt.It turns out, her mother is an enormously abusive, racist, possessive alcoholic and drug addict. Beyond belief. There's obvious layers (to be revealed later) on why she is so mean and condescending and due to the depth, I think Mo'Nique also deserves a nod. She's also successful in bringing her daughter, Precious, to absolute lows that Precious does put up with it, albeit with a little abuse thrown back.Thankfully, being expelled from school is the best thing for her. She gets thrown into an "alternative" school where a "Lifetime TV" teacher grants her new life as does the pending baby she eventually gives birth.The best reason to see this movie is the so-underlining grants of hope, as previously mentioned with Precious's time away from home and the performances, so demanding. The only problems I had was a little of the pacing and the aforementioned "Lifetime TV" teacher, while good, was a bit clichéd.It's a tearjerker, it's heavy on drama and extremely hard to take with the racism, abuse and sexual assaults, but if you see the world through the eyes of someone who really had to live this type of life and attempts at making it all better, it's worth a viewing. And a high recommendation.
Way back in 2008ish, my boss told me about Mr. Brooks. I have never heard of it, and despite some solid performances in his career, I was a self-proclaimed dislike'r of Kevin Costner. Butsomehow I trusted my boss's judgment.To this day, I still want to thank him. This movie is marvelous. Fantastically written, interesting and deep. It screams "Based on a novel (or novels) by" but, to my shock it was just an original screenplay. That kind of saddened me; I wanted to buy this book right away.Speaking of being well written, this movie is all over the place and yet in one direction  and that's a compliment. For two hours that in no way feels that long, the intertwining stories are so interesting, the time flies.And all the performances, sans Dane Cook, were excellent. Not to be harsh, and he was mildly good for what he needed to do, but the choice to book him for this was, eha bad one.Next-Door-Neighbor-type: Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner) is a "recovering addict" ofmurder. Worse, he's got a persona following him around, with the name "Marshall" (William Hurt  by far, the best performance in the movie) who plays the role of little, red devil on the shoulder fairly well. Oh, I forgot to mention, he's also a "from the ground-up" chief executive officer of a box company and family man.Well, things go south when Mr. Brooks falls off a two-year ride on the wagon and a "Mr. Smith" (Cook) not only notices the murder but wants to become the next Mr. Brooks.Believe me when I say: those little tidbits of a synopsis are incredibly minute to what all goes on in the movie. I even left out major character/players so you can discover this gem's full potential all out on your own, like I did from my boss's recommendation.I love suspense, mystery, horror, but most of all: I love an interesting, original and deep script with fantastic characters. This satisfied a great deal of all my yearnings for a good time at the movies. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
J.J. Abrams doesn't like to give away much, especially in his film's trailers. It's a wonder they ever make moneyfor those who don't know who he is.He did it with 2008's Cloverfield and now with Super 8. If the coming attraction was wide open, like most movie previews, it would probably have a tagline such as "If you liked Goonies, Stand by Me or E.T., you'd like"Dang; I promised not to spoil too much, like what's already been given away by a lot of viewers and critics. Suffice to say: yes, it's like thoseand it's set in 1979, so anyone up for a little nostalgia, should see this immediately.I relished in the homage played and the inside jokes for many things, including the "advanced technology," just recently defunct, walk-man. But, similar to the 2009 Abrams reboot: Star Trek, the props and feel are just part of the fun and joy.Those were fantastic. This guy KNOWS kids, namely adolescent boys. He had them pegged and the timeframe they were dealing with. This feels extremely like it was made in 1979, but with today's technology. So, I guess I'm saying: it's not only great for nostalgia's sake, it's perfect for those of us who not only grew up in that era, but for those film lovers of the above mentioned films/series.Allow me to go into the plot line, from pretty much the trailer's POV plus a little more that won't spoil too much: several Ohio kids are filming a movie when all of a sudden a train crashes  not just in their presence, but right on top of them andsomething escapes. Following that, the town is thrown into turmoil due to lost dogs, appliances and electricity. Toss in the big, bad government/military and intentional confusion and you have another throwback to the 1970's monster movies.It definitely goes beyond that, as it has a lot to do with the film the kids are making, in addition towell, young love.I really don't want to give away too much more. About the plot that is. What I will comment on is all the other wonderful aspects beyond the fantastic re-creation of an era I grew up in. Such as great cinematography, both depth to the characters and chemistry between them  you'd think they really had known each other since kindergarten and special effects that were not only good, but brought you back to another timeframe: the original Jurassic Park from 1993.Now, the movie's not perfectthe "creature" that's hidden from audiences that haven't seen this, is really clichéd and not very imaginative. (It really reminded me of much larger 'Species 8472' from Star Trek: Voyager. Wow, that's a double whammy: it dates me in addition to outing me as both a trekker and a Voyager fan. For all of that, I declare: I am not ashamed.) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_8472Also, it has severe pacing problems and yeah, a lot of it could've been edited out. I'm curious to hear (in the future Bluray's audio commentary) if this was intentional. For, when you go back to movies of our (or could just be my) era, it was pretty much the same thing. It generally took forever to get to the "goods." A perfect example is: Superman: The Movie.When I was a kid, the same age as the boys/girl in this movie, I loved Superman II. Why? Because Superman shows up all-but immediately and there's tons of action. And yet, Superman: The Movie is 10x the film the first sequel was even though it takes well over an hour before Kal-El finds his tights.These slow, plot-building/character-developing scenes were common in the 1970s, 1980s and probably before that. Okay, I get that, and I get the yearning to bring us all back. I don't think they needed to go that far.So, I don't think I'll be seeing this again anytime soon  I'm really testy when it comes to slow-moving films that would be better off with a higher speed, even though, I did have a ton of fun during this. The dialogue between the kids wasn't just REAL, but often enormously hilarious. Not to mention the acting/closeness/chemistry from the kids was genuine, namely from lead children Charles (Riley Griffiths  who really channeled the heavier-set kid from the introduction in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) and lead Joe (Joel Courtney  who is this generation's "Elliot" from E.T. He not only did a fantastic job here, he literally carried the entire movie with his acting, emotions and facial expressions. If I was a 13-year-old boy again, he would be the one I would both relate and yearn to be the most.)I would highly recommend this fun movie. It does get darker and more violent as the movie progresses  something it doesn't promise in the first half  so, leave the little kids at home. If I were back to these kid's ages, when I absolutely loved films like this, I would probably watch this hundreds of times and love every minute of it, despite my "grown up" viewpoint nowadays.Side Note: OHI forgotDon't forget to stay through 90% of the end credits. I knew to, thanks due a certain movie-review podcast, http://www.fatguysatthemovies.com/. I did see a lot, if not more than two-thirds of the audience, leave before the "surprise" finale during the end credits. Make sure you stick aroundif you really had a great time, like I did, it'll be enhanced in the conclusion.
Calling Plan 9 From Outer Space the worst movie in history is like calling former #1 movie of all time, Titanic a success. But, really was it the worst movie? I disagree. Mainly because even though Wood, Jr.'s intentions may have been to make a serious Sci-Fi horror, while combining a bunch of the genre's creations, and as crazy as he might have been, he must've known that this movie was just fluff and not Oscar material. I've seen a lot, and I mean A LOT worse than this, mainly because they were trying to be serious and were trying to get awards. I doubt the awards season ever entered Wood Jr.'s mind.That said, wow, WOW, this movie was hilariously bad. Incoherent scenes and characters, laugh-out-loud horrible dialogue, funny special effects and the cast seems so, well, dumbfounded on what to do on the set. That's not the end of how bad this movie was, just the beginning. Costumes from "outer space" that were either made from 10-year-old King Arthur fans or just rented and had no business on "space aliens." Also, it had sets, namely that main graveyard or the cockpit, that were so funny, so deliciously bad, you can't help but laugh again and again. I could go on and on, but suffice to say, this is thee perfect example of how NOT to make a movie. In fact, nothing at all works here. Nothing, but, again, humor for the audience. (Side Note: best to watch it via Rifftrax, though I know it doesn't need much help; they just make it all the more enjoyable.) I guess the well over-stuffed and confused plot involves an "elevated" alien race landing/hovering in the skies who's deep plan is to raise the dead in order to prove their existence to Earthlings who apparently don't believe the fake saucers in the air are real due to the government cover up. Some humans are attempting to undercover the conspiracy, but must battle 3 zombies/skeletons and "intellectual" aliens. (Unfortunately, they never meet the head, and enormously flamboyant leader  I would've liked to see that meeting.) I am not sure if books have been written on this movie, but I can see volumes written dissecting this movie. (I bet Wood Jr. didn't see that coming.) But there are so many aspects to scrutinize on the different scenes or dialogue that didn't work or the characters, namely the long-nailed, 2 inch waist of Vampira or the mouth-breather Tor or Bela and his cape  something that would work in Dracula, but here was obviously used to cover up that it wasn't him half the time.How could anyone hate this movie? It's the main definition of so-bad-it's good. I'm actually awarding this a full star higher than the bottom of the barrel 1-star, because of the enjoyment I got from watching it. Never before have I ever seen such a mess, embarrassment or perfect movie to watch while under the influence. And again, if you can purchase the Rifftrax audio commentary, it's a welcome addition to the already fun experience.
To avoid any kinds of spoilers, I will begin and finish this review with: I loved The Cabin in the Woods. See it. Thank you. Good-bye.(Man, I probably would double my fanbase all the way to two if all my reviews went like that)There's been such an internet uproar on spoilers for movies, this one in particular. So much so, I finally avoided all podcasts and all reviews  EVEN if they stated theirs didn't contain any. (Yeah, I know I am saying the same thing, so I understand if someone won't read this. But, allow me to assure you, I will NOT give anything away. It would be wrong on many accounts, but for the most part, this movie is plain fun as it progresses and divulging any secrets would ruin someone's amusement.)On a side note, sadly, one unhappy viewer on The Facebook® gave away one of the aspects I didn't know about. I quickly stopped reading and immediately dismissed their opinion thanks to ruining one part of this great film.This movie was, in fact, great, and as mentioned, it progressively got better  which was hard for me since I ABSOLUTELY loved the intro and film's title appearing on the screen. In fact, few impress me, but this would fall in the top three next to The Silence of the Lambs and the "changed" one from Death Proof.Generally, I give a synopsis, and perhaps I can give a general onefive youths, all stereotypical Breakfast Club molds and usually found in these "cabin in the woods" horror films, travel to said cabin to party, but things aren't gonna be easy and they might have listened to the old, tobacco spitting gas attendant warning them to go no further. Sound familiar?Oh, GOD, if it were that simple, it would turn most away. I, however, LOVE those types of films  and had wished the early 2012 release of Don't Go in the Woods would have been a 1/10 of that. But, I digress, that movie wasn't and this is dozens of times more fun, original, intelligent, scary and hilarious  namely I loved the character of Pothead Marty who delivered the funniest and surprisingly deepest lines. It surely nourished all I craved growing up and so much more.I can see the reviewer's POV of giving away spoilers, despite their wrong-doing. This movie is almost 97.5% impossible to describe without spoiling anything the trailer didn't provide. But, like that remaining 2.5%, it can be done and suffice to say: This is the best new movie I've seen in 2012 and should be seen by all horror (and horror-comedy) fans, especially ones like me  who grew up with horror all the way from the late 70s through to the 1990s horror.It was so good that any down time that's usually in the (honestly and I'm afraid) overused "Cabin in the Woods" horror story lines was filled with interesting, funny and fresh approaches. You cannot pinpoint pacing as a fault here or unoriginal ideas, EVEN with the same 'ole plot that's actually presented here.Summing this all up: if you're a horror-comedy fan, a (typically 1980s) "cabin in the woods" horror buff, you will love this fresh, exciting and bright approachdespite how dark it can be.Oops, I hope I didn't SPOIL anything there.
Jack Reacher was a fantasy. Barely would it ever happen, so why not have fun in its fictional tale?Half the movie, we have super-soldier, Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) in charge and smarter than the average bear. The other half, he has no idea what he's doing, getting himself into or a match for what he's opposing. Had they been consistent with Jack's methods, I might have been onboard with his plight. Sadly, they seemed to not know what kind of man this was and this translated in an unsympathetic audience.Basically, Invisible Ultra-Ex-Soldier Jack is called back into the spotlight when a sniper takes out citizens in front of the Pirate's PNC Park in Pittsburgh, PA. (That's a lot of P's.) He's being summoned to investigate the so-called close'n'shut case against the shooter. And the defense attorney's career/life might be in question. Will they find the truth? Will Jack clear his name once accused? Will there be a sequel, like the novel series this is based on?No. To the sequel question. This movie did not make the box office equivalent to necessitate a follow-up film. In good faith, I agree. While entertaining and somewhat interesting, it wasn't great or even really that good. Maybe the books are better, but sadly, I saw very little of substance in this character of Jack Reacher.Now, I am a huge Tom Cruise supporter, despite a lot of people's objection to him and his old couch-jumpin' days. But, since the script was unfocused and the title character was written so badly  He's strong! He's weak! He's confused! He's on top of it! And so on!  I can't see another JR movie any time soon.
Perhaps I wanted to like Ted more, but regardless of my expectations, I laughed out loud more times during this than most movies I've seen in two years. And though the audience also laughed, I think I was the loudest.It's doubtful they got most of the jokes; Seth MacFarlane's humor is mostly targeting one generation  specifically mine and, well, his.Stepping aside from the endless references, this is the closest Family Guy movie we can count on. For now.As with most little tyke "I wish for" movies, Ted(dy) bear (MacFarlane) comes to life for a young boy, John and thanks to this gift, the little boy, now a large boy, never grows up. Even during his fourth year with the stunning Lori (Mila Kunis,) John (Mark Wahlberg) continues to smoke a lot of weed, skips on advancing his life and complies with all Ted's wishes.Not that, that's a bad thingWell, maybe the age old story that wraps around the movie, but I guess they felt they had to go that route to make a feature length.Note to Seth: you can spend 30 seconds or less developing a plot and the remaining 95% in complete chaos. Much like the movie you spoofed that spoofed other movies. (No spoiler from me. Someone else spoiled it for me  SHAME!)Anyways, that "storyline" almost led to its downfall with the terrible pacing and long stretches of nothingness. Thankfully, Ted returns to the screen, and literally saves the movie each and every time. He also reminds us not to take this all too seriously, for the most part, and I liked that.And this movie. It's offensive  to some  I'm sure, but then, those closed minded individuals need not see this movie. I don't want to look at naked breasts so I'm not buying a Hustler magazine, even though they do not offend me like most guys get put off by seeing naked dudes.Not to cut this short  I really don't want to spoil the jokes, cameos or scenarios any further. I highly recommend this movie, for fans of Family Guy AND American Dad and those who like real humor that doesn't hold back on the swearing or racial jokes in fear of alienating bigots. And I look forward to purchasing this on BluRay and having a little party to revisit all the incredibly funny scenes. Like The Fighter fighting. I was ROLLING with that scene. Priceless.
Take that, Transformers! THAT'S how you show a city under attack with heart, action, pacing, special effects, fun, excitement, characters to root for, humans to empathize with and most of all, legitimate comprehensiveness.Cross-over films are rare, but I'm a fan of them. Freddy Vs. Jason did a great job of bringing two of my childhood favorites together in 2003. Nine years later, The Avengers didn't really bring together my favorites, but it sure as hell put very good characters in a fantastic action/adventure superhero film.Aside from some second-act pacing problems and an insipid villain with extremely questionable and blurry motives, the movie worked extremely well with huge, unique and deafening explosions, some of the best 3-D I've seen  and I'm hugely critical of that format, large action sets, fairly good score and cinematography, deep characters and a whole lot of humor. Further everyone with the exception of Hulk, had equal sharing time on screen. (Sadly, Hulk had only two scenes, albeit THEY WERE WORTH IT. They blew whatever the previous two entire movies based on his character out of the water.)Very nicely, you wouldn't have had to see the previous six or so Marvel/Avenger movies  they were extremely crafty re-introducing them and their individual backdrops with swiftness. But, if you had see the other films, like I have, they included everyone you loved from before, including a cameo from someone I prayed would be in this. Hint: Initials PP.During a secret-agency S.H.I.E.L.D experiment with a mysterious blue box of the gods, evil and jealous brother of god Thor, Loki strolls into our realm and is hell-bent on ruling Earth. I guess it's time to assemble Earth's Mightiest Heroes for the Avenger initiative.Of course, like creator Stan Lee's brilliance displayed over the decades, these aren't your normal super-heroes; they have depth and typically are individuals not playing well with others. Hence, a good portion of this film is a boxing match. Naturally, there are reasons behind this as well furthering the overall depth of the epic.Will the Avengers avenge Earth? I don't want to spoil it, but you'd really have to be blind not to know. I can definitely say they each uniquely KICK ASS in their respect roles.Probably thanks to, or in conjunction with good direction, these actors KNEW their roles and had them down pat. With the exception of new-(to the series)-Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner, each one of them, again with 80% equal sharing time, were pitch-perfect.I always love Robert Downey Jr and especially in his Iron Man role, and if you did, too, you'll be laughing and marveling at his performance all over again. Same with Chris Evans who was GREAT as Captain America and really had his character pegged. Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury were good and even though Jackson had to tone down to the PG-13, he was still badass. Scarlett Johansson was awesome and still gorgeous and Jeremy Renner was a lot of fun to watch again. (Recently he was wonderful in Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol and hopefully he'll continue the trend in the fourth Bourne film later this summer.)Finally, Mark Ruffalo has always been an actor I've admired and I think he did fine here and oodles better than Edward Norton, the last Dr. Bruce Banner actor. But, I still think, movie-wise, that is, Eric Bana has been my favorite Bruce. (Note: I said Bruce, because Bill Bixby will always be the best Dr. Banner ever.)Excluding Loki's horned and silly god-outfit, I actually bought their costumes. And this is saying a lot for a movie that I previously scuffed at the sight of the funny blue Captain America uniform and when he donned them in the film, I feel right into it. I believe that's thanks to Evans who was so great that it never occurred to me for him to have anything else on.I believe the overall movie elevated itself higher than what could've happened with a premise of assembling multiple superheroes and story lines. That said, the special effects were about 90% fantastic with the remaining percentage devoted to the awful out-of-world and in space aliens surrounding the ho-hum and dull villain. They had the same problem with the original Thor movie and (on the DC-side) Green Lantern.I wanted to rank and rate this movie higher, especially since I had an absolute blast laughing my ass off and was captivated with the action fun, but in addition to what I previously wrote: second act pacing problems, laughable aliens and bad villain, it also had the clichéd go-to "idiotic idea" in the very climax, I downgraded it a bit. Still, I awarded it 4/5 stars and cannot wait to see it again. Preferably on IMAX again.SEE IT  even if you're not a fan of the superhero franchises.Now BRING ON WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SEE: the Justice League movie!!
(Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointCheers.)I've seen this a few times, so this one will should be easy enough. I'm on the fence on really liking AvP or Alien Vs. Predator. For one, I always loved Bishop and Lance Henriksen, so it was nice to see him back after his absence in Alien: Resurrection. I'll stop therethere is really no comparing this to the origin series of either Alien or Predator. They sincerely made their own movie, even when using all mythos from the original franchises. That said, they really made a clichéd-filled and predictable movie that REALLY dropped the ball because they had the opportunity to put the character Alien into our time, the present and on EARTH finally and they chose to set this in the distant regions of Antarctica? But, still, it's a fun little movie with great special effects and like (the superior cross-over) Freddy Vs. Jason, you really do get the best of both worlds in a leave-your-brain-at-the-door sci-fi adventure. Recommended.
I don't what took me so long. I really like Jesse Eisenberg, Morgan Freeman and pretty much the rest of the cast. I love caper tales, super human (and smart) character films and any movie dealing  even a little bit  with Vegas. Boy, was I wrongnot to see Now You See Me opening night.This movie was fantastic. Fun dialogue, adventurous scenes, great twists and served all my personal needsmeaning, I love fantasy films with incredibly smart characters  à la super human  that are always 3-5 steps ahead of their enemies. 2001's Ocean's Eleven has to be the king of all of those movies. While this one was a thrill ride and it's under that masterful film, it's still highly entertaining.Basically, four street magicians are "mysteriously" brought together and band the enormously successful "The Four Horsemen" magic show on tour. After a year of being a huge hit, they begin robbing places using their talents, which, of course, leads to being eyed, and chased, by the authorities. What's worse, if it could be for them, is a truly bad guy  Morgan Freeman's Thaddeus Bradley, who's stalking them and loves to expose and reveal other magician's tricks on DVDs for money.(Truly, this character is despicable. I know people do things for money all the time that's truly wrong  buying politicians, running cigarette companies, drug dealers, etc, but magic is for fun, the shows are deep and lasting amusement and you only hurt those who are trying to both make a living and entertain. This man is just plain wrong.)The nice thing  for me, at least  was that these four always "appear" to be ahead in the game and smarter than the average beardetective (Hairy Mark Ruffalo's agent Dylan Rhodes.)Sure, these can be considered clichéd and stereotypical smart-ass characters, but I love to see super human characters on screen. James Bond has to be one of the more famous of them: Always invulnerable, always comes out on top and never ceases to throw good lines at the bad guys, lovely interests and superiors.I won't rate the movie as perfect, or even near-perfect, but I did have a great time. Even though it's magic they perform, some of the tricks even made me say: HmmmReally? And the further you get into the story, the more you can predict what the outcome(s) will be. All but one, that is. One major and final twist made me literally floored when revealed. In addition to loving super human characters, I adore at least one huge twist I never even thought about. I guess it's like being at a real magic show.Not really to be taken seriously, but just to have a great night with the moviesI thoroughly recommend this caper. See Now You See Me.
Seriously. After watching The Last Stand tonight, I did, in fact, want to write an essay on why it's better than Iron Man 3. Okay, I thought better of it, but I will honestly say this: I had a helluva lot better time with this movie than the latest Multi-Billion Dollar Iron Man sequel.Why? Because Arnold's (possibly last  literally) movie never lied to me. I went into Iron Man 3 expecting a great action flick and instead got a sad ratio of 80% humor and 20% action. Here, in the wildly entertaining and first movie to pass 3 stars from me in 2013, 3½/5 Stars, I got both: tons of action and comedy. I did laugh out loud a few times, but was thoroughly entertained with many MORE action chapters than the movie starring Robert Downey, Jr. currently in theatres that probably cost 1009x more.This, The Last Stand, is 80s/90s action galore. It blatantly tells you this throughout. It takes itself seriously and throws in the humor when appropriate. It's not like the recent Expendable flicks, for, it takes itself way too seriously. And I had no problem with that. It was like visiting an old friend from 20-30 years ago, and these soldiers/small-town sheriffs with a heart were a lot of fun to watch.The very basic story is about a cartel fugitive madman who is in route from Las Vegas to Mexico and an aged sheriff who is thrown "back into action" with a solid motivation to stop him.Literally, that is the movie. But, I had fun watching the prep, the preparing and the payoff. Only, the movie isn't as perfect as I'm making it out to be.Of course, there are flaws, there are plot holes and there are clichés and predictability galore. Those I can ignore, since, again, the movie didn't lie to me on what it was trying to accomplish. What I didn't like was the lack of solid characters, the WAAAY overacting from the normally overacting Forest Whitaker who always thinks he's trying for another Oscar and an Arnold who looks way too weak and old for this sh|t. And even with that saidHe was the best part of this movie. With all going on, with bad and good guys setting their place, I still wanted to see A.S. kick ass, and realistic or not, he satisfied my needs. For him to go further is questionable, but here, he was believable and fun.Sadly, with most of the ARIZONA based movies, I either find: multiples of spiders, ants, piranhas and psychos. It's nice to see humans take command than the animal kingdom.DO NOT EXPECT a lot and you WILL BE REWARDED. I did expect a lot with Iron Man 3, again, and got let down. Here, I wanted a fun movie and let myself go. Mission: Accomplished!
Honestly, I didn't expect I would like 2010's remake Alice in Wonderland. I did expect all FX and no story or acting, a la Avatar. Enjoying this as much as I did shows why never to judge a book by its cover. (Or other movie reviews, to be precise.) Thankfully, though, I didn't have much to base this on as I have never read any of the books and even though I wasn't a huge fan of the original animated Disney film in 1951, I haven't seen that one in a very long time to remember enough to compare this to. So, I basically went in with a clean slate and saw what Director Tim Burton wanted me to see. As usual, it was his vision.I was blown away. I loved the spectacle of the Underland, the characters, the actual wonder of the film. Sure it had its flaws, but overall it's a must-see, especially in IMAX 3-D.Young Alice has nightmares of a "wonder land" of strange characters, including a smiling cat and is comforted by her adventurous and free-spirited father. Fast-forward to "present" day when Alice's 19, her father's long gone and she's courted to marry someone she just met as per custom in royalty. Well, taking a lot from her father, whom meant the world to her, she becomes the Runaway Fiancé and lands into the infamous rabbit hole.Much like The Chronicles of Narnia and Hook combined, the movie shifts to the odd characters tugging her to this place or that to eventually rid the Underland of the Red Queen by slaying her pet, as foretold by a scroll. The lesson here kids? Alice must choose her destiny and not have her destiny choose her.As much as I loved the surreal and wonderful world of down-below, I did have some complaints that withdrew a full star from my rating. (Some of this might be spoilers, so you can skip two paragraphs as not to have things revealed.) #1 Why Be Like Hook? If you're gonna make a huge budgeted remake  why start with part two? Though, I did favor this tenfold over Steven Spielberg's Hook, in a sense, they were the same movie. Older Alice/Peter inadvertently gets thrown back into their retrospective "adventure lands" and take almost the ENTIRE movie to remember who they are  despite every character shouting at them all the way who they really are. I would've preferred a retelling of the original classic, Alice's first adventure to Wonderland.#2 The Chronicle of Narnia's Final Battle seemed forced. Yes, it was foretold, but it seemed like it was just there to mimic Disney's other (unfortunately, failing) franchise. In addition, following was a pretty lame attempt at The Wizard of Oz's conclusion. Perhaps that was part of the book that I missed, but not only did Alice barely change throughout the movie, when she reentered the human world after realizing this was not but a dream, it was as if nothing happened. She shared Dorothy from Oz's sentiments, but lacked the true emotion.Those said, I liked all the characters and was thrilled they weren't what my own expectations of them to be, i.e. they kept throwing my visions of who they were supposed to be out the window. I liked to be surprised. Despite the previously mention finale, Alice (Wasikowska) did a wonderful job, Mad Hatter (Depp) was good as, again, I expected Willy Wonka and he most certainly created a new character and Red Queen (Carter) was great at being bad, very bad. The twins, or Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Lucas) were two of my favorites in adding humor and Cheshire Car (Fry) was awesome as was the White Rabbit (Sheen.) The only ones I didn't care much for were the White Queen (Hathaway) and Stayne (Glover) for Hathaway didn't sway too far from her other established characters and Stayne was the only graphic I didn't buy throughout the whole movie.This brings me to another point. As everyone's still googly-eyed over the "spectacle" of Avatar, I found the entire Alice in Wonderland to be so much more believable in graphics, characters and background than even five minutes of Avatar. All except for the too-tall character of Stayne. Luckily, though an important character that does appear for just under half the feature, he doesn't dominate the screen for 90% of the movie like those laughably unrealistic blue smurfs (Na'vi .) Seriously, I never thought for a moment they weren't in Wonderland, or Underland, but I had a huge problem buying the goofy Na'vi and that turned me off for nearly all of Avatar.At any rate, I would thoroughly recommend the wonder of Wonderland. Everyone seemed to have a good time (in the film, that is) and it's nice and tight, quick and to the point. It gives you what you came for, just the right amount and didn't make you yearn for more. Though I would still see a sequel  pending all parties involved here return, I really wouldn't want one. I liked how this pretty much summed it up, and in spades. Or is thathearts?
While not solid recommendation, I totally suggest people to see this movie if not just to get to one of all film's best use of music: Bittersweet Symphony by The Verve in the finale. Actually, the entire soundtrack completely rocks and it helps I was a 90s boy.In addition to the phenomenal music, was probably Sarah Michelle Gellar's best performance before and since. Throw in a hilarious, all- but cameo from Joshua Jackson and a decent, but from better-than-this, Reese Witherspoon and, sadly, most of my praise ends there for this Dangerous Liaisons take of Cruel Intentions.I love super-human, deviant and always six-steps-ahead characters such as Sharon Stone's Catherine Tramell in Basic Instinct and since I've seen that movie dozens of times, it's nice to venture to other films similar to it. Gellar does a terrific job as Kathryn, the student-body President of a prim 'n proper private school, whose goal is to manipulate as many students as she can to simply amuse herself. Her evil cohort is her stepbrother, Sebastian and together, they eventually land on virgin territory, literally.Reese's Annette is the virgin and, in a nice twist, Kathryn temps Sebastian with her own body to land Annette. There are a couple of other subplots with laughably bad side characters and those bring down the movie to an amateurish level. So much so, it's hard to give this movie a solid recommendation. If you can get past the corny dialogue, acting and unintentionally hilarious coincidences, it's worth a watch for Gellar and her devilishly brilliant and bored rich-girl evil witch role.* * *Final thoughts: Maybe I need to see Dangerous Liaisons again. I remember liking it, way back in the 90s when I saw it. And while this is no substitute, by far, it's still fun just for Gellar and that song that will forever be in my mind: Bittersweet Symphony.
Honestly, I don't want to spend too much time on this incredible piece of crap. Sure, I've heard it was terrible, it made all-but zero at the box-office and Megan Fox can't act. Blah, blah, I will enjoy or dislike a movie despite the popular opinion. But, now I am the spokesperson against Jennifer's Body. (As well as Megan Fox's.) How do you know the movie you're making during production is a turd? And if you step back, watch some footage and say, "Uh, guys, hold on a second. WTF is this?" do you simply give up and shut down the set while apologizing to the crew and reminding them your decision will help all mankind? In this case, they didn't shut down production, but you can sure as hell tell they gave up half way through production, if they made it that far. The rancid subplots or main plot, if there was one, just kind of dies somewhere in the first half and never recovers.The result of their inability to cut their losses is a film that exploits all that is evil about badly made films: Horrible editing, inconsistent and incoherent plot, bad special effects  oooohhhh, she flooooooats using the high school drama team's wires, disgusting acting and worse dialogue, laugh-out-loud revolutions and plot holes to fit both Fox's and writer Diablo Cody's ego. (Yeah, that big.) Let's see if I can actually come up with a synopsis for this. Mind you, it's been a few hours since I've seen it and I fell asleep half way through. Unfortunately when I awoke, I had to finish it.Here goes: Jennifer (Fox) and best girlfriend (literally, in one scene,) the appropriately named "Needy" (Seyfried) are inseparable until they go to a tavern that has a band playing and the place burns down. In one of the movie's most outrageous WTF? moments, and believe me there's dozens where my eyes widened, Jennifer simply goes with the band in their van as the place is blazing and people are dying. We're supposed to assume they're going to (after) party as most people do when burning bodies drop like flies around them.All's not well with the students at Hell High, including Needy's brush with Jennifer as she spews black goo and is covered in blood the night before. But, in another WTF? moment, the clock ticks past 5 minutes and everyone's back to normal.Eventually, Needy's on to Jennifer's sudden change and the body count rises. She knows and does nothing. We know and we don't have the power to do anything but turn off the movie. In my defense, I fell asleep, and thought I was refreshed enough to tackle the finale.As not to give too much of a spoiler, there's reasons, completely insane, but nevertheless motivations on why Jennifer's so, well, perky following the student's deaths, but suffice to say, don't even bother getting that far. If this was Netflix'ed, and you open the envelope to discover this inside, simply slide it back in, seal it and apologize to your mailperson that he/she has to waste time returning it.I actually found one positive in the film (and this is a definite spoiler): The finale's set up to have yet another huge bloodbath high school dance, a la Carrie or the more recent, Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever , yet it didn't come to pass. I'm guessing it was another problem they had in the storyboard room or for budgetary issues. Either way, I'm actually pleased, though not enough to raise the rating I give but ½ a star, that they didn't go to the obvious. That said, it did make the dance scene irrelevant, boring and annoying. It should have been cut. In conjunction with this spoiler, there are so many unanswered questions for people who have seen this lazy crap.(More spoilers) Why did she only attack/eat boys? How exactly will killing someone, sacrificing them and introducing a demon into a town with the name "Devil" (yeah, the movie sinks that low) in it produce better record sales? Why did an actor I love watching, EXCEPT THIS TIME, J. K. Simmons have a claw for a hand? Why would the bad band members who had books and witchcraft props all over their van act like they didn't know how to conjure up a demon and relied on the internet?Okay, I have given too much away, and inadvertently gave the reason behind the demon that is Jennifer('s Body). I've also spent too much time. Skip this. Seriously, it is as bad as they say it is. Megan Fox now stars in three of my least favorite movies: Transformers, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and this one. She's still young and extremely beautiful enough to get, no, demand a better script.
I would think Stephen King would be more p|ssed about the just plain awful documentary, Room 237, than the movie it's based on.I need to make a retraction: Not one day had past when I wrote a review that said the masterpiece The Shining should be taught in film schools, I saw Room 237 and thought differently. Just enjoy the classic for what it is. If you look as deep as these buffoons did, you're missing the extreme pleasure it is just to watch it.Let's get the "synopsis" out of the way so I can really tell you what's going on: Five (or six?) strangers, unseen by viewers, provide their conspiracy theories disguised as commentary of 1980's The Shining and their stories range from wildly outrageous to downright nitpicking. Meanwhile, as they're telling their stories, completely unfitting and distractedly horrible stock film footage "paints" the picture of what they're trying to convey. Too bad; neither their background nor the stale footage is interesting.And what gives? Why didn't anyone want to reveal themselves? Why couldn't we see anyone? Hell, I would've preferred the standard "professor in front of a bookcase with raised eyebrows" shot than Tom Cruise (from Eyes Wide Shut) relentlessly and ridiculously playing one of these invisible loonies. (I hope he threw a fit for being associated with them.)I digress. I guess these are all "professionals" and are well-known, well, to some. But, I've never heard of them, at least prior to the showing and they only give me the impression that they're all snobs and never held my attention for more than a few seconds. I'm glad I don't know who they are, because I wouldn't care to follow them.I get the point of the faux-pas "live" audio commentary. It was not just to get the nobodies (to me) to tell their first or 1,500th feel for The Shining, it was for them to desperately try to convince people of the deeper meaning behind the movie, or at least, show the movie goofs. Three theories that I can recall are extremely far-fetched, but I guess people see what they want to see:A> Director Kubrick made the movie about the oppression of the Native Americans.B> Director Kubrick made the movie about the Nazi holocaust.C> Director Kubrick made the movie about the "fake moon landing footage." (This one was my favorite conspiracy theory and made me laugh the hardest.)Now, I completely agree on the central theme: Kubrick was a genius in his cinematic achievements and even without so much researching his background, reading any of the books based on his life or even seeing all his movies, I can see him adding many, if not hundreds, of subliminal tidbits in his movies, namely, The Shining. So, some of what these comedians were pointing out, made me raise an eyebrow, but not much else.I could go to any movie, masterpiece or not, and see the color blue in every room, in one form or another and say the movie was about The Great Depression. Heck, people read the Bible and can spend this much time as Room 237 did to point out on how it fits their agenda.At any rate, going back to the three biggest conspiracy theories, which by the way, can't all be right at the same time  or maybe, Kubrick laid these breadcrumbs for fools to follow so he can be further amused when he was alive, the Native American one was the most obvious. They verbally spoke about and visually showed artifacts, paintings and symbols throughout. My six-year-old niece, who shouldn't be watching this scary movie in the first place!, could've pointed that out.The second one, the oppression, obsession and ominous killing of the Jews in WWII, was a little deeper, but quite a reach. Again, I, too, could see the number "42" or three additional numbers that could be added or multiplied to make "42" as say it was either about the year Hitler began his genocide, or I could say it was a cozy reference to the Brooklyn Dodger's Jackie Robinson. I mean, I could even throw in that there was "a black chef who, we all know, chefs love baseball and he was, well, black."The third one, the moon landing fictional film, I've heard before. Not in reference to The Shining, but in passing. This one did make me laugh, enough so, that I couldn't even remotely believe what the commentator was trying to preach. He went as far as to change letters, or create anagrams out of words in the movie. I guess since one character basically becomes an "iceman" and dies at the end of the original film, then the director could be saying "cinema" will die eventually, as well. Seriously. I should do this. I should make a "Checking Back into Room 237" sequel and come up with anything I want to make of it. I'll start off with "As you can see, Jack gets a drink poured on him and he's lead into a red bathroom, which is an obvious reference to Stephen King's Carrie, to which Kubrick was trying to say he was p|ssed that he missed on making that movie over this one. And, to further my point, there is a ton of blood pouring from the elevators, which, as we all know, elevators go up and down, like the pig's blood that went up and eventually down on Carrie at the prom"Wow. I'm even starting to convince myself that I am right in my theory. In fact, perhaps I should watch The Shining again to see if I can make more stuff up.Final words: Tommy Wiseau's The Room is a helluva lot more entertaining than this Room was. Skip this. See the masterpiece, instead.
She is one determined bitch. So, you really should go to the dance with her.The Loved Ones introduces more than its share of subplots in its incredibly short time on screen. Sadly, while that took away from the film  such as: far too much of the precious film length was spent on an almost 95% irrelevant "teen adventure" of a friend's pot smoking and being groped  it was interesting enough to continue watching until we got back to Plot C: the abduction of the already-spoken-for high school boy who (RIGHTFULLY) turned down Plain-Jane Lola's proposal to go with her to the dance.Sure, he was in the right, but he was surely wrong. In this particular case, at least.Suicidal cutter, Brent (Xavier Samuel) is still reeling from his part in the accidental death of his father, but he definitely has time for love. When asked to the, I guess, Australian version of the prom, by Lola (Robin McLeavy,) and he turns her down since he's going with his steady, Lola's not happy. In fact, in one of the film's many plot holes, her father  obviously on the command of his sick daughter's wishes  miraculously tracks the love interest in the middle of Nowhere Desert Hills, kidnaps him, sets him up for a dance of dread at their home and the "fun" of Lola begins.Simultaneously to now abducted Brent, you'll be treated to multiples of plots: I shan't ruin the film's all-over-the-place screenplay, but suffice to say, most of the pieces fit, albeit they're really not all that interesting. I do give the movie kudos for not giving us what could've been a straight-forward torture porn revival, but only to a point. You gotta make it somewhat appealing when the other side stories are taking up a good portion of (only) 84 minutes.That all said, the movie's positives are somewhat abundant. The soundtrack is fantastic, the acting from the younger-version-of-Jennifer-Tilly, McLeavy, was decent, some scenes were fairly effective and above all else was the satisfying finale. Obviously, I'm not going to ruin it, but it's the ending I always crave in these types of movies. Every bit of the climax was on my "OH, GOD, I HOPE IT ENDS WITH" And, it didn't disappoint.A friend recommended this to me, and I will say, as much as I wasn't enamored as he was, I am not unhappy at all that I saw it. Thanks to (you know who you are) for your recommendation!
Believe it or not, while the Hangover series overstayed its welcome with a part III, it still was 10x the movie the bridge film was. Now, that's really not saying much.I absolutely didn't fully dislike this film. But, then again, nor did I laugh. Hardly at all. Sure, The Hangover Part III was fun, adventurous and got the Wolf Pack back to where they belonged: Las Vegas  if just for a bit. Unfortunately, it just barely had a few lines of comedy. Sad. This is SUPPOSED TO BE A COMEDY. THIS IS A COMEDY SERIES.At any rate, again, it's better than the terrible, atrocity and shot-by-shot remake the second movie was. In fact, it was a little bit of fun I've missed since the first adventure in 2009.Basically, once again Doug is absent for the majority of the film and his friends must track down the flamboyant Mr. Chow for the deadly criminal Marshall who's holding Doug as collateral. They span two countries and try and outsmart the actually-smarter-than-meets-the-eye Mr. Chow to Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.The guys looked tired in this and Zach Galifianakis was the only one who seemed to put effort into his role. They were clearly doing this for a paycheck, and maybe make up for the dud the second one was.It's not a movie to watch more than once. In fact, as I've recommended before, you really should only stick with the first one, which was a great comedy, fresh and fun. No need to venture all the way to part III. (But, if you decide to do that, go ahead and skip over Part II. That movie doesn't even tie in here. Mercifully, so.)Side Note: One of the biggest things I admired about the original The Hangover, was that they got the Vegas scenes right. In too many movies, like 21 and Con Air, the Vegas skyline or continuity to the locations of the movie's characters is way off and anyone who's ever been to Sin City, will know they have no idea what they're talking about when they showcase the characters on the Las Vegas strip. 2009's The Hangover showed us scenes that made me feel I was right there and that's a rarity. Sadly, Part III, went backwards and got the strip all wrong. For example, Stu is driving southbound on Las Vegas BLVD in a crazed chase scene and moments after he passes the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino, suddenly he crashes into the old strip approximately 5.5 Northeast of his location. This is all fine and dandy for the two people left in the world that hasn't visited Las Vegas. C'mon guys; we're not that stupid.
I knew someone who didn't much care for horror movies, but he kept screeching "TINA!" around me and his partner attempting to either A: scare us, B: simply make fun of the dialogue or both, in A Nightmare on Elm Street. I can say that, nor the movie itself, scared me. In fact, none of the series (so far) 8 installments, including Freddy Vs. Jason, scared me. And that's okay; it wasn't the scare factor that impressed me or kept me wanting more. It was the humor and inventiveness.Growing up, I was a huge fan of the Halloween, Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hellraiser and A Nightmare on Elm Street series, or in other words, cheesy 1980s horror/psycho killer films. (Yeah, I know some of them started in the 1970s, but it was the 1980s that made them famous.) The one series that topped all others, even to today, was the Freddy Krueger films.Generally speaking, the first in any series is usually the best one. I.E. Halloween, Hellraiser and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Though I thoroughly enjoyed the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, it wasn't the best and by no means is it a perfect film. But, it set the stage. It took it's predecessors to a new level. Namely in creativity. Which is one of the reasons why I liked this series the best. Well, that and Freddy is the best of all the serial killers in the aforementioned horror franchises.Nancy (Langenkamp) and her high school pals are having bad dreams, and slowly they discover that they're all experiencing the same horrific nightmares about a man in a "weird hat, red and green sweater and knifes for fingers." What they don't realize is that even though the dreams are really, really bad, they soon become deadly when Tina (Wyss) is murdered supposedly by her boyfriend during the night.Boyfriend Rod (Corri) is framed and in jail, but the killing continues! The kids, namely future series heroine, Nancy, attempt to put the mystery together while trying to stay awake and find out who this man of their nightmares is.No spoiler here, but it's Willie from the original V series! Okay, it's just Freddy Krueger, known here as Fred. (At least they didn't call him Frederick.) Nancy must rely solely on herself and her instincts to solve the mystery surrounding Fred, why he's in her dreams and stop him. And seeing the people around her, her blatantly drunk mother, her "dumb jock" disbelieving boyfriend and her angry and overprotective cop dad are all of no use. (Heck, all of the cops should be fired  I loved the hesitant one in the closing when Nancy's going berserk. Hilarious.)I guess why I rated A Nightmare on Elm Street only 8 stars is because of the laughable dialogue, the inconsistencies and irregularities. For example, some things can come out of the dream when captured, such as the hat and (spoiler  someone else) but then the trellis she doesn't even hold onto comes back with her. A feather from her pillow is seen floating but the mirror Fred crashes through survives. Nancy requests 20 minutes to capture the killer and still has time to set half a dozen traps, have a nice mother-daughter talk and fall into deep sleep. And Fred is only supposed to appear when one's asleep; yet, Nancy receives a call from him and the ending blows any of the story's mythos out the window. Literally.I'm not just talking about goofs, as all movies have them, but they set up a premise, a good and original one in a series of horror movies that relied on a masked killer stalking in the shadows. At least they tried here to change the trend. But, unfortunately, they kept breaking their own rules. It actually would've made more sense to have him as a ghost and then all bets are off. (Granted, he's sort of a ghost, but with rules.) As for the dialogue, though some of its iconic by now, it really doesn't hold up. A few years back, I saw A Nightmare on Elm Street in the theater for a one-night presentation. Being a huge fan, I arrived way early to get good seats, but still thought hardly anyone would show up. Well, it completely sold out. And to my surprise, everyone practically laughed all the way though it and it appeared both at and with the movie. I had to, myself. Even though I grew up on the series and loved them, the movie really was silly, namely for some of the lines, acting and characters  Oh, that drunk mother! Alcohol should be part of any nutritious breakfast! I don't think the audience was really criticizing the movie, they were just having fun.Aside from negatives, I am still awarding the movie 8/10 due to the movie being enormously inventive, original, fun and despite Fred(dy) not being in it too much, he was extremely iconic, an instant super-villain. Also, I'm glad it started a cult following since a lot of the sequels explored a lot more and were, in a lot of ways, far superior to this original one. So, it did set the stage, introduced a whole new world and just as Jaws did for swimmers, this one did for sleepers. Only, with Jaws, you could choose to stay out of the water. Here, and in real life, you eventually have to sleep. Maybe for the last time.
It saddens me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors, locations and genres, i.e. Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, D.C. and political thriller, but 'The Sentinel' really hits a low. It's like they had a great idea up front, signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew improvise the rest. And I wish I could blame it on yet another bland performance from Basinger (not only do I feel she's one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I'm still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one, and definitely the only bad actor in the film, to win an acting Oscar for 'L.A. Confidential.') But she wasn't the only problem. Sutherland, who I love as Jack Bauer on '24' once again playsJack. I miss his old 'A Time to Kill' or 'A Few Good Men' days. Douglas certainly took a hiatus from acting and phoned this one in. Plot: Someone, some Secret Service traitor, wants the President dead and Douglas is (haphazardly) being framed. Will someone believe him? Actually, no spoiler here: as quickly as they came up with that subplot half-way through, it's over before you know it. And why did someone(s) want the President dead? Is that to be revealed in the sequel? Too many plot holes, too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable 'The Sentinel' is. If you only see one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone who's familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one 'Law & Order' episode you'll know in the first few frames. Was it terrible? Not really, the cinematography was good, and despite Sutherland playing Jack again, he's still got it.
"Welcome, to Jurassic Park."It seems like such a simple line, as it is, but I believe it went two directions: #1 it told you, the audience, were in line for an exciting, roller coaster ride of fright, suspense and intrigue. It's true; it didn't let you (or me) down. And #2: it started both the brand name of Jurassic Park in addition to the return of the big blockbuster. (Ironically, as it started off as a new brand name, it was marketed the same way the movie, itself, was preaching against. Much like Natural Born Killers taught us not to concentrate on violence. Good job!)There are just too many comparisons that can be made about Jurassic Park and Jaws, aside from the obvious: both were directed by Steven Spielberg. Both are huge summer blockbusters that bring back the heart to connect with multiple audiences. Both are When Animal Attack stories. Both had the predictable outcome due to its "family nature" despite the gore. Both begin with a seemingly insignificant scene of death and foreshadowing. Both had source materials that were, in fact, deeper, more graphic, more adult and radically different endings. And both had one central leader who thought better of doing the right thing, valuing money over saving lives.Not that I'm knocking the movie. It was, as stated, one helluva roller coaster. I have yet to visit the actual ride at Universal Studios, but from what I've seen by someone who taped the whole experience on YouTube, I doubt even the "real" experience is half of what this movie drags you, joyfully, that is, through.John Hammond's rich and loves to make flea circuses small and large. So he "steps on what others have done" and genetically engineers dinosaurs on an island he's (ONLY) renting. I wonder what kind of pet deposits he had to produce like whenever I rent an apartment.So, due to an "accident" leaving one dead from one of the smarter dinos, Hammond gathers up some prominent scientists, doctors and one lawyer to endorse his zoo/theme park, a la Jurassic Park, before it opens. Immediately, and not even allowing for the tour to be over, the group, Grant, Sattler and Malcolm justifiably see problems with "control over nature" albeit zoos apparently don't count. That, above, is just the intro. The real movie arrives at one of the most influential and exciting scenes in almost any movie: Attack of the T-Rex! The power went out during the final bit of the tour and our heroes, including two thoroughly annoying kids, are caught between a meat-eater and a hard car in soft mud.From there, you get grand-scale adventure with crisp scenery and a hunt/be hunted suspense film as the dinos escape their habitats due to a greedy enemy of both Jurassic Park and Jerry Seinfeld (Knight.) I've tone down a lot that happens, but really it's a paper-thin plot with more emphasis on the adventure over depth. Not that that's a bad thing here. What works is the suspense, the fun, the humor and lines of Goldblum, (again) the adventure along with suburb cinematography and one of the greatest scores in any movie  kudos to another wonderful theme from the great John Williams.Did I mention the graphics? I was amazed back then, but damn, it holds up STILL (for the most part) 17 years later. Many have tried to reproduce, but haven't even come close to how real the dinos look and due to that, the suspense was heavier on whether or not our heroes will survive. If someone were to watch this for the first time today, they might even overlook the fantastic overlapping of the dinos and man, but think about it in 1993: like The Matrix, this changed cinema indefinitely.That all said, I wouldn't go as far as to say this is a "leave-your-brain-at-the-door" feature, though it's close. Besides the cardboard cutout characters, there were flaws I just couldn't get past. Whether technical, such as the obvious car being lowered in the tree and the obvious green screen behind Goldblum while they strangely out run the T-Rex, or the continuity of one moment our heroes are looking over the edge and seeing the goat and the next, it's a 10-story drop. Hardly any movie's perfect, but in addition to the technical and continuity flaws, this also has the burden of having one of the oldest plot lines in Hollywood.I've read the source material by the late Michael Crichton who wrote both the book and helped write this screenplay. Of course, there has to be changes. They got the gist in the film, and I understand the change of the finale from the original draft/source material  Terminator 2: Judgment Day did the same thing: Hollywood just loves to leave franchises open for sequels. Both T2 and JP's books had definite closures whereas the movies left it WIDE open. (In T2's defense, the "book" was made following the movie, but involved "Judgment Day" rightfully thwarted.)I still award this 8/10 stars for being, well, so much fun. It's nice to get back to the real summer movie, it's nice to hear such a wonderful instrumental background juxtaposed with lush and beautiful surroundings and it's especially nice to see two of my favorites: Goldblum who was at the top of his game and Jackson, though he really, REALLY toned it down for his role. And finally, as mentioned multiple times, despite all that's wrong, it was a true adventure that seems big on the outside, but Spielberg did a perfect job of toning it down to a simple, though intense, story of survival. See it!
The extraordinarily unfunny Your Highness wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. Sure, it sucked backand I caution on using harsh language so not to be a hypocrite.For, that was a big problem with the movie: the filthy cursing. I'm no prude. Notinanyfashion. But, the overuse of the F-bomb, amongst many other profanity used, was simply lazy writing. It wasn't funny, clever or needed. In fact, it was just plain stupid when I heard them use the 'F' word for the 167th time.I'm not even going to honor this film with a full-length review. Suffice to say, it's not the worst period-piece, swords & dames adventure  Year One is far worse than this  but it's pretty sad when not ONE SINGLE LAUGH comes from a "comedy."At least, Year One had Michael Cera to entertain usthis had no one great. In fact, I can only think of two characters to mention that (BARELY) rose above the rest: Isabel, played by the almost always awful Natalie Portman, who was a tiny bit fun because she's a she kicking butt and a creature by the name of "Steven" and that reason should go without saying.This movie would be best suited for those under 3 and find the homophobic humor of yesteryears funny. Heck, half of it's not even homophobic as it's about incest. And it's for people who thought: Hey! James Franco did such an AWESOME job at the Oscars, he must be good in everything.I realize now I'm going off in many tangents, like this movie itself, but another thing this movie p|ssed me off about is Danny McBride, someone I've defended until late. 30 Minutes or Less was just plain awful, this one was actually WORSE. If these two movies were my only impression of him, I would've surely given up on him before I saw his previously, more hilarious roles.To sum this horribly UNFUNNY and UNIMAGINATIVE comedy up: It just makes me miss the masterpiece The Princess Bride is. Skip this sad excuse of a movie, or if you must see it, wait for the local network TV premiere where it's edited for language making it a grand total of a 22-minute movie. Though, even that seems too long of a time wasted on this.
Remember when vampires were scary? Remember when they portrayed as the beasts they really are?Though I hate the Twilight series, despite the laughs it gives me, I admit, I love the TV series: True Blood, with its romantic and adventurous with a bit of humor take on the vampire lore.That said, it's refreshing to watch how vampires are supposed to be shown. And that's only half the battle! There's two complete movies in here (three, if you count the excellent documentary: Full Tilt Boogie based on the making of From Dusk Till Dawn) and both are wonderful to watch. You have the heavy Tarantino-laced opening half about two despicable bank robber brothers Seth (Clooney) and Richard (Tarantino) who literally destroy lives in the path to Mexico and the second half  a completely different movie using the same characters who now find themselves deep within a Vampire Haven at the Titty Twister bar.It helps I love both Clooney and Tarantino, but I'm also very fond of the multitude of other actors: Michael Parks, Tom Savini, John Saxon, Hayek, Marin, Trejo and Keitel. And everyone was on their game throughout. In addition, the music and score rocked, the dialogue was absolutely spot-on and the tongue-in-cheek & no scene taking itself serious were awesome. If you like Tarantino's other films, or Clooney  you really have to like him, you will love this excellent film. Even Lewis, whom I've despised since Cape Fear didn't ruin my fun.I've now seen this at least a dozen times, each time I thoroughly enjoy it more. Director Rodriguez seemingly did the impossible and made it work 100%: he not only put way too much in the movie, he also turned these two ruthless murderers into characters you (gasp) rooted for. Generally, I don't like the overcrowding of films, but Screenplay Writer Tarantino made it seem just like a very long and event-packed day.(Very) Basic rundown: Seth escapes prison (well, courthouse) with the help of his brother and (severe) sex-offender, Richard, and the plow through many innocents to get money from a bank and attempt to get across the border. (Side Note: Even with the hilarious Marin playing his first of three characters, the border patrol agent, this scene would probably be impossible to take seriously in today's time.)One method to get into Mexico and hide out, is to kidnap a "Lost Faith" Minister (Keitel) and his two children who are riding in their new mobile home. (The dialogue between Keitel and Clooney from the moment they meet to the end is reminiscent of Ocean's Eleven's Clooney and Pitt's banter. In other words: a whole lotta fun.)They do make south of the border and to a strip club/dive, the Titty Twister, and dominate Seth commands respect while making the kidnapped family drink and converse with him. Okay, he does get the respect he desires until, well, uh, practically everyone turns into a vampire and it's up to a select few to combat and survive from Dusk till Dawn.It's a fun experience, especially if you're into Tarantino films  there was a lot of Reservoir Dogs here, after all. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Everybody be cool. You be cool.
Generally, I like espionage films, especially ones with gorgeous backdrops, like The Bourne (original) Trilogy. I like underdog vs. the big-bad-corporations movies, such as Erin Brockovich or Michael Clayton. And I love twist movies where you're always two steps behind the movie. Sadly, The East is not one of those, but it sure as heck wants to be.Now, don't get me wrong; it's not a terrible or even bad flick and it had it's share of moments. But, the simple fact that the entire movie, from beginning to end was predictable. Maybe because I've seen too many of these movies? Perhaps. With the exception of the extreme casual movie-watcher, anyone who's seen at least one of the movies above will foresee exactly where this is going from the get go.One interesting twist on this spy games film, was the setup company the lead character works for. That was something unusual and original:Sarah works for a private firm specializing in protecting other large firms from radicals and terrorists. She's desperate to jump on the "The East" case, which is a band of renegades who preach: An Eye For An Eye. Whatever large company wrongs the general public or nature, The East targets them with the same treatment they produced. Such as oil in a house of the CEO who dumped oil in the seas. (To avoid major spoilers, the other examples I would normally list are omitted. The only one I provided happens within the first minutes of the two-hour film.)Sarah must find, infiltrate, spy and report on the "terrorists" next gigs. Literally, if I wrote any more, it would, again be spoilers. But, the questions I did want to convey, you'll already ask and know the answer to half-way through, if not sooner.The movie was made with noticeable talent, but in front of and behind the camera. I did like Ellen Page and loved Patricia Clarkson. Also, the score's decent, the cinematography's nice  I had been to many of the locations in D.C. where a lot of this was filmed, including that canal and some of the shocker scenes, again  despite the predicable factor, were enjoyable. And the ending, though not as tense as it could've been, was acceptable. Especially, the credits.That all said, some of the scenes were way over the top and somewhat not explained, such as the rituals The East had. Sure, they "tried to explain it" and it was meant to further the motivation of the character(s,) but the answers were weak and gained no sympathy from me like I believe they were meant to. The over the top shots included Sarah crazily eating an apple to prove a point, and yet if felt more insincere than realistic. Also, the lack of plausible security at a firm that specializes in just that or the laughably vacant authorities.Though not groundbreaking and may not 100% pull you in the direction I believe the creative team meant to, it's still recommended for an evening in. And maybe you'll get a little more do-good'er urges than I did.Side Note: This is just me, but for the first twenty minutes or so, I thought the main character, Sarah, was played by Ellen Page. It's been awhile since I've seen her in a movie and thought she finally grew in height and depth for her character  changing from the role she typically always plays. Once, the "real" Ellen Page enters the scene, I had to do a double take. You may not see it, but damnthey looked a lot alike. (Perhaps, the Director saw that tooSarah abruptly dyes her hair blonde and never explains why)
You know these kinds of movies. The ones that grow on you. You can watch the entire thing through and mildly like it, but for hours, if not days, following, you find yourself laughing and/or enjoying the product you experienced.Superbad has now done that to me twice. Well, I've seen it now twice, and both times I kept finding it "just okay" or "barely funny" throughout, yet following and especially in discussion with a work buddy the next day, I found my laughing out loud at some of the lines and humorous (supposedly) irrelevant scenes.I also thought of how innocently they re-created high school, much like the John Hughes comedies of decades past. Aside from the goofy, but hilarious cops, everything pretty much played out as if this was based on true events. (Was it, Seth?)BFFs Seth (Hill) & Evan (Cera) venture through their last weeks of high school slacking, complaining and upset they can't continue their lifelong friendship into college as they're headed to different schools. While wooing their prospective mates, the inexperienced duos plan to hit up a party one night and they're set to purchase and bring the booze. Only they're underage.In comes Fogell (Mintz-Plasse in his introduction role thatwillseriouslydefine him from here on out) who got a fake ID with the one name (Cher, anyone?) McLovin on it and that he's Hawaiian. I'm guessing this was California, but most license plates (and police uniforms) state "Clark County"  which, of course, could be just about anywhere.At any rate, they go through hell & high water to get the tainted water and to the girls of their dreams while realizing they're losing more than they're gaining.If these were adults, it would be hard not to relish the many events, close calls and fun times they actually had. Meaning, they act like this will happen every day of their life outside of high school. It could, but it's 99% doubtful. Perhaps if these characters were real, they could, in fact, look back and cherish the absolute fun they had, if not just on this night.There's a ton of swearing and some sexuality towards the end  I did say this was realistic, so its crucial to the plot and actually separates this from those Hughes movies. It's also surprisenly touching, and I'm not referring to the bromantic "drunk/love" scene towards the closing. It's on the escalatorthe look Seth gives is so real and heartbreaking, it almost makes the whole movie, if you haven't already yet appreciated the humor  namely from (once again) the brilliant Michael Cera.It's not overloaded like the other Johan Hill/Seth Rogan movies with cameos, though there are a few. I couldn't believe my eyes when Clark Duke is spotted in the party with barely a line to his character. And speaking of Rogan (as Officer Michaels,) as funny he was as the rookie cop along with Officer Slater (Hader) as the drunk veteran, I thought they actually brought the movie down a slight notch. Sure, they were both hilarious  namely with the liquor store clerk, but they are the absolute only unrealistic part of the movie.That said, it's a real thinker. I've been told by more than one person  and as stated, this is my opinion as well, that this movie isn't great the first time. But it sure as heck grows on you the more you think about it. That's good writing.Side Note: after recently watching Easy A, a movie I fell in love with Emma Stone, it was great to watch her here. I sincerely hope she goes far in her career.
The best thing I can say about 2008's remake Death Race is it certainly knew what it was and didn't lie about one aspect. The worst I can write about it happens to be attached to one of my favorite actors of all time: Joan Allen. How incredibly miscast and it was an embarrassment to see her here. Her nasty prison character might as well been played by Rosie O'Donnell.That said, I actually enjoyed the feature. I was looking for an action movie I had not seen (and speaking of which, I still have yet to see the original) and I am a huge Jason Statham fan. (Of which, he gets a pass for his role, unlike Allen. Not only does this fit his resume, he did a great job on what he had to accomplish.) Also, I knew what I was getting into. Like I said, it knew it's audience and showed what it needed to, no holds barred. It didn't seek out Oscar buzz or ever attempt to take itself too seriously. But, was it predictable? Yeah. Unoriginal, of course. Horrible dialogue, definitely. But, was it enjoyable for what it was? Absolutely. And on a personal level, this The Fast & the Furious knockoff reminded me a lot of one of my all-time favorite video games: Burnout Revenge. So, it was exciting, for at least me, to watch a live-action version of the races and "secret shortcuts & hidden items" as portrayed in the film.Synopsis: In the far, far, distant future of 2012, there is no economy and privately run prisons run reality shows (originally a gladiator/type fighting ring, possibly a lead-in if they made a prequel) that show a race for freedom, literally. If a prisoner wins five races, or subsequently survives five go-arounds, then he/she will be set free. Wow, whoever said things too good to be true aren't just that? There's just no way they're lying, or that this isn't fixed, or things happen specifically for ratings. I believe in corporations, such as this one exploiting death on humans. They'll never lie or try and be unethical.Along comes Jensen (Statham) minding his own business, trying to make a living off $300 for over a hundred hours of hard labor and caring for his wife and daughter. In another benefit of the movie, they fast forward to the inevitable framed-murder of his wife so Jensen could be sent to this particular prison and race for dame Hennessey (Allen.) In this type of movie, the attention span of the stereotypical macho male who would watch this is, at best, a few seconds long, so it was nice they just plowed through to get him in place to race to the freedom he should have anyways.Nowwhat everyone waited mere minutes for, the races. They're bloody, fast and as the title indicates deadly. Unfortunately, this is where I felt one of the biggest downfalls. Spoiler: though we're supposed to root for the wrongfully accused Jensen, he kills one prisoner in absolute cold blood. To keep up with this "rooting for" him, it probably would've been better for them to go with the accidental/but just-deserved death of this man. But, I'm guessing they just wanted the audience to get some of his revenge, the barbaric way.Throw in a few "plot twists" hardly any that work, but one did, you have the remainder of the film. Again, a film that, though critically (and apparently audience in reference to box-office) panned is actually good for its target audience.I'll repeat myself, though this is not an award winner, and made specifically for one reason: live-action video game, Allen thoroughly disappointed me. Every great actor has their embarrassments, such as Meryl Streep for She-Devil, Ben Kingsley for A Sound of Thunder (wait, amongst many more, but he's still great,) etc, etc. But here, I just felt there was no excuse. Luckily, I still enjoy her, and always will, in better movies, such as The Bourne 2/3 movies, The Contender and Manhunter.Death Race (2008) isn't for everyone, and usually, this wouldn't be for me either, but for what it was, a mindless slur of action and death (boy, they had zero compassion human life) it's enjoyable as a throw-back. Recommended for the target audience only.
If trailers ruled the worldI would never have seen this movie.I love zombie movies, TV shows, satires, etc. But, I do not like zombies that can run faster than both Superman and The Flash combined. And there you have it, World War Z: Supersonic Zombies.Call me old fashioned, but it's scarier and more suspenseful when they zombies were mindless corpses who barely could walk and, yet, could still sneak up on you. The one exception I will make is 2004's remake: Dawn of the Dead. Sure, they were fast and vicious, but the cast and the story clearly made up for the fast-forwarded zombies.Here, in the adaptation of the book it's based on, IN NAME ALONE, Hero Gerry Lane travels the world in search for answers to this zombie outbreak and continuously bypasses a single bite or multiples of unrealistic tragedies. In fact, he survives so many times, this might as well been the more realistic version of Roland Emmerich's 2012 film.Now, I'll be honest: I did have a somewhat good time here, despite the endless clichés, the lack of Rated-R Zombie gore and the 300 mph running, ant-like zombies. It just missed the mark so many times, that I can't wait to read the book that this is, again, IN NAME ONLY, based on.Truthfully, I have NOT read the book, but from all the fans I've heard from, this movie adaptation has extremely little, or 2%, of what the book was all about. And that's too bad. This only makes me want to read that novel and forget any of this ever happened. Maybe, they'll do what they did to the HULK, quickly remake it in a few years to what it was supposed to be in the first place.Specifically targeting the movie, it was "okay." Some hokey scenes, such as the jail lose-yer-teeth chapter or ANY presentation of a zombie going the speed of light, brought this movie down. So much so, I think there almost could've been an award-winning film here. But, no. This is just above B-Movie average and left a lot to be desired by the zombie-loving crowds.Side Note: When I saw the trailer for this movie, and I had never heard there was a book this was based on, I was excited. UntilI saw the zombie were both running faster than a tornado's force and then building an "ant pile" against a wall. I literally could not stop laughing, and I doubt that was the reaction they had in mind when they made the preview.
Which "one year" were they planning on filming? 'Year One' jumps all over the place with more time traveling than the 'Back to the Future' trilogy. And it just doesn't stop there; as many as the scenes blend from one time-period to hundreds years later, scenes also just start/stop without rhyme or reason. In other words, bad editing. It was as if they thought if they could get Black and Cera together no matter the result, it would be funny and profitable. It was neither. Okay, I take that back: the movie actually gets a half star more because Cera did deliver some funny one-liners. But that didn't hold the mess the rest of the movie was. And what's with the incessant need to prove one's heterosexuality? 'Fired Up!' is another example of a two-dude-buddy-comedy that states up front that these men are attracted to the opposite sex, yet throws it in our faces countless times to remind us they're not gay. We get it. If this is all you can base comedy on, you must've been working with three pages of a script and then ask the actors to improvise the rest of the movie. Bad choice. We follow Zed and Oh from their disgraced departure from their tribe through multiple and random Bible stories. So random, I'm shocked they didn't get Moses and Jesus in the same room for a skit. At any rate, the very thin plot has them attempting (only at particular times) to rescue two women they knew from their tribe. Black phoned his performance is and should be ashamed at acting goofy thinking that's enough for today's audience. Cera plays his signature role. And the multiple "cameos" are so old-school by now, it wasn't even fun to see them. Skip it.
Wow. Do you wish to see an apartment of strokes & the end? No, I am not spoiling Best Picture Nominee Amour, for they tell you the woman dies in scene one of the movie.Then, they transfer us back to the days she can walk on her own, and slowly  YEAH, VERY SLOWLY  shows us her deteriorating to that first scene.Basically, you'll see a husband taking care of his amour during two strokes. Okay, not basically  that is all you'll see. Nothing more from this apartment they live in, in France.I'm not necessarily bashing the movie, as it was well shot and well acted, but there really is nothing here other than what we should all expect to do when our elders are close to expiring.Aside from the believable acting and the "one shocking scene" I really didn't see coming, this movie could've been summed up in 30 minutes and not over two hours.I know this has no chance of winning the Best Picture Oscar, and thank God for that. No real recommendation from me.
I would begin my review of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix with the statement I've made before: A return to greatness, but sadly, the series, to date, has never been even close to this level of quality.True. And it's one of the biggest sequel-improvements of all time. Where Goblet of Fire (#4) was almost an entire waste of filmmaking, Order of the Phoenix (#5) leapt countless bounds past it and wasn't just a great Harry Potter chapter, but a fantastic film on its own merit.Let's see, when have I felt this way before during a series? Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1/5 Stars) to the follow-up: Halloween: H20 (4½/5 Stars.) But, to be closer to home, or from a Part IV to V we have: Batman & Robin (1/5 Stars) to Batman Begins (4/5 Stars) or Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1/5 Stars) to Superman Returns (4/5 Stars.)Order of the Phoenix was a fantastic ride, filled with very good special effects, funny lines, the most beautiful cinematography since Prisoner of Azkaban (#3,) a (much needed) tight, well paced and crisp story with the most depth given in the most realistic way to the characters, a incredible story of good vs. evil, friendship and connection and had the best, the most exciting and suspenseful climatic finales of the series. In fact, if it had ended here, aside from the obvious doors left open, I would've been okay with that.BUT above all that, the fifth Harry Potter movie FINALLY contained direction, intensity, passion, a clear vision and lacked all the randomness that was thrown into the previous four installments. My main complaint, so far, was the chaotic and haphazard scenes that did not further the stories and were blatantly obvious scenes from the books to only appease that one demographic (the book-club fan) and not a new-comer like me. I have felt the series, leading up to and including number four, had been irresponsible in the sense they chose to be narrow-minded and forgo the art of making a movie to stand on its own two legs. Order of the Phoenix, didn't just have that; it had wings.I digress, Harry uses his powers in front of a non-wizard in order to save him setting off a chain of events leading up to the over-powering and blind Ministry to slowly, but surely, take control of the school. In real life, this would be called: the TSA.The most obvious of bad people, Miss Pink, is inadvertently causing Harry and his (this time) extended gang of friends to fight for themselves, literally, because The No-Nose, Man in Black is back.I wouldn't just recommend this movie to Harry Potter fans. I wouldn't just recommend this to normal Muggles. I would simply tell people to skip the first four and begin the series here. I'm almost joking.For the first time, from what I recall, the use of flashbacks and background events from the first chapters were shown. Gather what you need to put the pieces of the past together and save your time as this, the  THANK YOU!  shortest of all Harry Potter movies, is the tightest and best paced of all of the films.Needless to say, I had a ball here. It's the kind of story I want to see, the depth of characters, namely Harry Potter himself (FINALLY), that I want to enjoy and it's an adventure with heart that made me care for those on the screen. This is the first time I have said this about a Harry Potter feature: I can't wait to see this one again.(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)
Wow, what a fall from grace 'Psycho III' was. This cash-cow, over-kill sequel is pointless, practically plot less and absolutely suspenseless. Let's just say it's 10x less of a movie #2 was and 100x less than #1. It was an extremely feeble attempt to enter Bates into the slasher franchise genre (Let's see a 'Myers Vs. Bates' movie) and it failed harder than sending Pinhead into space. It didn't start off bad: yet another flawed blonde (she denounces God by accidentally killing someone) wanders through the desert upon, where else, the Bates Motel, surprisingly still in business. I guess the writers of #3 did actually watch the first two (even with just a 90-minute running time, a good portion is flashbacks in B&W whether or not the scenes were originally) as they wanted to add some more good/strange characters into the mix, much like this series predecessors. Some villains are so good as baddies, you unbelievably want them to survive/succeed, such as Hannibal Lecter. I can't believe how much I wanted Norman dead in this movie, hopefully ending the series, or even this movie sooner. Sure, it's not 100% bad, there were a few interesting scenes (Shower Scene Take 2!) but they didn't add up for this to be watchable. In fact, this is the movie all (including myself) feared #2 would've been when they decided to make a sequel to one of the greatest movies of all time. It's just sad how they think Bates was worth turning into another Myers, Voorhees or Kruger. He's just obsessed with his mother, and though his condition was brilliantly laid out in #1 and somewhat in #2, this was just beating a dead horse. With its enormous "WTF" scenes, it should've been renamed: 'I Spit on Psycho's Grave.' And it does.
Yeah, they claim this to be a true story, but it's so bizarre, they might as well have told me Brazil was also backed by true events.I Love You Phillip Morris is called a breakaway for Jim Carrey. That part, is solidly untrue. He's turned from his goofy form multiple times: The Truman Show, The Number 23, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Majestic, etc, etc. I guess they're referring to: he's now, SHOCK in 2010!, playing a gay male, oh, no!Big deal. But what is a big deal is, if these were "true" characters, Carrey did NOT break away from his typical brand of slapstick. So, I'm lead to believe either the true Steven Russell (played by Carrey) is just like Jim Carrey or Jim Carrey put little effort into conforming to the true Russell. Either way, I doubt I will, or hope not, to see any award nominations this time around.Furthermore, McGregor is no stranger to playing gay or out of character. But, his character, Phillip Morris, is just as annoying to watch on screen as Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Capote. (Please note, I think Hoffman did a fantastic job at portraying Capote, but that didn't help me like the flamboyant character/real life subject anymore.)Russell is a former Christian and family man turned liar and a con-artist who literally can get away with anything, everything while fooling just about anyone, a la gay-Frank Abagnale Jr. from Catch Me if You Can  a thoroughly more enjoyable film. Granted both this movie and the Leonardo DiCaprio film take place way in the past where, I suppose, check kiting and credit card fraud was a bit (lot) easier, I still have a hard time believing Russell got away with a tenth of the scenarios/disguises. Perhaps if it did happen as they say, then it falls on the fault of Carrey's believability.Nevertheless, you simply have to believe he can become who he wants, working his way to the top of any firm and fool former prison inmate, Morris, into loving him. There's a little background on that prison time, and more on Russell's growing up.Deep southern and deeper flamboyant Morris will simply believe anything Russell says and does, or he's just blinded by love. And as the inevitable downward spiral web of lies Russell falls into, he does show a hint of true love for Russell. (Yep, I get the title of the film and 83 times he says it in the film, but you do have to look deeper than the words of the world's gayest liar.)This movie took a VERY long time coming to the U.S. (Long story, look it up) and was it worth the wait? Yes, and no. I wouldn't completely dismiss it, but it is very weird. And I'm not referring to the gay scenes. Been there, done that. It's just an abstract movie pretending to be and art-house classic.
Freddy should be p*ssed. Pinhead's not only trying to take some of slasher shares, but pretty much just copied the superior (1987's) A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. Let's compare, shall we?Both take place in an insane asylum. Both have a blank stare blonde. Both have a doctor who doesn't believe up front, but starts to both side and help the main star. Both have a heroine that strangely looks like Heather Langenkamp. Both also have a character named Kirsty (yeah, I realize she was named that originally, but it's still too close.) Both involve a labyrinth of one's darkest fears. Both have a wise-cracking villain, including a new baddie who has clay-mation snakes, with blades, no less, coming out of his hands. Both have bad lightening affects. Heck, both have mute inmates with powers integral to the plot.Wow, I didn't know it was that many. Probably more, but suffice to say, Pinhead's first sequel, the only one in the long-running series that's a really a direct continuation, Hellbound: Hellraiser II isn't as bad as I've portrayed it, but it's not up to #1's standards. They didn't even improve on the computer-generated "flashes of light" that causes more laughter than fear.Taking place seconds, then hours after the first one, Kirsty (Laurence) is magically in the aforementioned asylum being questioned for the deaths, including her father, in her late uncle's home. Quickly, the good doctor, Channard (Cranham) intervenes as he's a "Brain Doc" who knows how crazies work. It's obviously, up front, he's got ulterior motives for Kirsty, her next room over neighbor, the puzzle-solving mute, Tiffany (Boorman) and the objects in Kirsty's outlandish story of the Attack of the Cenobites.For plot's sake and the audience who may have not seen the original, Kirsty suddenly knows more than her character could possibly about the magical doorway opening box that calls upon the Cenobites and their motivesand what all happened at the house she just escaped when her family was wiped out in the first movie. Oh, and conveniently, not only is her love interest out of the picture, but she doesn't give him a second thought.So, let's see, she gets a message from her father, who's now in hell and it's not too difficult to tell that may not, in fact, be from her real father. Nevertheless, the first chance she gets, she dives headfirst into the labyrinth of Hades to rescue him. I thought most of those there just want a glass of iced water?Meanwhile, Doc Chan acquires the blood-soaked mattress where the Original's Diva Julia (Higgins) laid to rest. He knows (again, thanks convenient plot) enough to take "nobodies" or criminally insane patients of his, to that mattress, and allow them to kill themselves  in a really grotesque manner  to bring back Julia. Her transformation from the red mattress that's only fit for a Motel 6, into real flesh and blood kind of fast forward's the process that seemed to take a lot longer in #1.After the obvious parallel with The Bride of Frankenstein, or is that Bride of Re-Animator?, he willingly enters Hell's Maze to, I guess, learn more than his education allowed.There's a lot more, and I've only skimmed the surface. Suffice to say, all parties involved have fun in Pinhead's domain, each with their own agenda and a lot of plot holes surface  such as why there's no rules to Hell, then there are, then real is fake and real is real, etc, etc. (Not to give it away, but the ending's death to the new Cenobite and the spinning post had me shocked. A WTF shock, that is.)Pinhead finally shows up half way through, and he's been missed here, since I really did think I was watching Nightmare on Elm Street 3B. His lines were excellent: "Time to play," "Your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell" and "How can it send us back, child? We're already here" are just a few of some of my all time favorite lines. The good-doc also has some good lines ("The Doctor is In,") but unfortunately, they overlapped the score a bit too loud and it was troublesome to actually hear him at the most opportune times.It certainly up'd the ante in blood  even for today's standards, this is pretty gruesome, and they kept up with the complex plot with multiple characters and story lines. The actors were delicious, namely Bradley, Higgins and Cranham. Even Booran tried  she did have a good line herself: "Shit!"It's a good compliment to the first movie, though inferior. So, it's recommended, even with its multiple flaws and outrageously hilarious special effects  even for 1988.
One more year until Die Hard that set all the clichés for future action pics. Until then, you'll just have to settle for Lethal Weapon, the movie that set the buddy-cop clichés. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.What a fantastically realistic, original and fun movie the original Lethal Weapon movie was. In addition, it broke barriers by adding a lot of subliminal "Can't we all just get along" messages. Some less obvious than others and some in your face, like making the two "opposite cop partners" white and black. (Later in the series, they shove "Save the Dolphin" messages down our throats.) Still reeling in his wife's untimely demise, excellent/top notch/Jack Bauer Detective Riggs (Gibson) is suicidal, a la a "lethal weapon" and is teamed with over-the-hill Murtaugh (Glover) to solve a case involving someone in Murtaugh's war-laced past. They don't get along, have totally different personalities and must learn to work together for their common goal: justice. By means offists and gunpowder, for the most part.A lot of this sounds eerily familiar and predictable. And it isfor someone watching this for the first time today. But, again, this is the movie that set the standards. You'll have to thank this movie for the countless, and I mean countless, like in the hundreds, of rip-offs. Thankfully, this beginning of the "new age" buddy movie was very well done, but not without its flaws.It is said that the majority (if not all) of the Lethal Weapon films are improv'ed. Sure, they had somewhat of a script, but for the most part, the actors just did there thing. 90% of the time, it worked. When it didn't, it was slow and a little bit too realistic, like you were watching a dysfunctional family or cop partners on TruTV. Thankfully, that was only 10%.My parents took me to Lethal Weapon 2 in 1989. I was 14 and was allowed in due to being accompanied by adults. I had yet to see the original for years to come. I fell madly in love with part two. Unfortunately, once I was able to see this, I was disappointed as it was not as action-packed or funny as part 2. That said, this is still worth watching. You will see excellent acting by Gibson, the iconic Busey of the 1980s and the origin of the buddy-cop movies to follow. Absolutely recommended.
"Tagline: the most controversial film you will ever see." Uh, I think I've seen more controversial before and since. What I settled on was: the most bizarre and plot-less movie I've seen.While I'll admit, I honestly didn't really get most of what 1996's Crash is all about, but the jist is: female nudity, swingers and sex, mostly around vehicles.Here's what I did get out of it: an open-relationship couple James (Spader) and Catherine (Unger) not only get around, they compare notes with each other. I'm guessing they're so unsatisfied with each other, so depressed in life, that they need the company of strangers. That all changes (or advances) when James "accidentally" crashes into a new sexual awaking, involving steal, metal and automobile demolition with a head on collision. We're asked to not necessarily accept one's unique sexual desire to be at its peak during a car crash, but acknowledge to each their own  a philosophy I live by, unless it harms another living being. This, however, leads into one of the problems I had with the movie: the lack of realism. While stunt-driver/James Dean lover Vaughan (Koteas) isn't all there upstairs to begin with, Helen (Hunter) is all-but non-responsive when her husband is killed in the same crash that James caused. In fact, her only reaction is to get better soon enough, so her and James can have sex in a car in the airport's parking garage. Okay, fine, again to each their own, but you have to suspect the sanity of some of these character who are so detached from natural human instincts whether it be shock, anger, hatred, fear, love, depression, something, anything.The rest of the movie generally gets stranger and stranger as all characters in the movie push forward into more graphic and mechanical sex until their addition demands more. And that's what this is, right? Sexual addiction, whatever the means that turns these people on and like all addictions, it's progressive. One must keep feeding it to get that "high." For whatever reason these people feel its necessary to mix intercourse with intersections, it's highly dangerous to themselves and others. This is where I pull back from the "each their own." When someone is so selfish in their own desires, they ignore others that could be hurt, maimed or, of course, killed.Regardless of their self-centeredness, there's really not much more to this story. You could've easily been watching yet another film about drug addicts and watch how their lives alter from when they were just a social druggie to $600/day degenerate. And though I don't agree with the "controversial" comment (and if that's the only reason they made this, to make a controversial film, then I lost all respect for the filmmakers) you almost have to admire these people for making a very original film, albeit based on a very uninteresting subject. Side Note: I did have to laugh out loud as this movie reminded me, strangely enough, as a line from Student Bodies. I could imagine any one of the characters from that movie saying in Crash, "Cars make me hot!" or "Wrecks (or wrecked cars) make me hot!" I guess, this means I didn't take the movie too seriously, and why should I when you get one (probably) unintentionally silly scene after another. Yeah, this did push my so-called "open mind" to other's unique hobbies a bit far.
(Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointCheers.)Oh, I wish I took notes during The Adjustment Bureau because I just didn't like it and can't remember exactly whyfor the most part. Sadly, I would have to rewatch this 106 minute movie to recall, but suffice to say, it wasn't all that good. I remember the idea was fine, but poorly executed, way too far-fetched and the "bad guys" were so unintentionally comical in their hats and methods that it was hard to root for "our hero" willing to give up everything for a chance encounter. It's a Skip it.
I didn't just hate 'Obsessed,' I was p*ssed off at it. Yes, it was a blatant rip off of 'Fatal Attraction' and 'Disclosure,' but I was hoping for a little more. Anything original. Give me something! No, here we go again: woman "obsessed" with a married man, woman is crazy, wife is jealous, man is trying to correct situation to go back to normal. As much as I love Ali Larter  trust me, she was thee only reason I watched this, I was not just saddened by her choice, but I disappointed. As beautiful and talented she is, this is what she agreed to. The plot revolves around promoted VP who's just beginning a family with a new home and is the object of a temp's affection. Gee, wait, I wonder if she'll turn psycho on him. What p*ssed me off, besides the horrible rip off this was on the already mentioned movies (which by the way, are 10x better than this junk), was how no one believed him. Here we have Beyonce that seems enormously obsessed as well ("Call me every 10 minutes, husband! I can't live my life without knowing your every step!"  give me a break) and she throws this tough woman character around him going off on him for "trust" issues without giving him 5 seconds to explain  trust me, she had me rolling with her hypocrisies. This, in no way made me side with the wife, in fact, I thought he needed to leave them both to catfight it out and leave such deranged women. And speaking of which, not to really spoil anything, everything in the movie led up to the inevitable female-on-female fight. Each "prop" was so painfully obvious: I wonder when she'll crash through here, or land on this. Gimme a break.
(Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointCheers.)Still, I'm puzzled on the subtitle or need for it, but still, I had a fun time with Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem. It's wildly all over the place with multitudes of subplots, one after another, but at its core, at least they set the Alien creature in our time frame and in a populated place on Earth  which I've wanted for 6 movies. I don't care too much about Predator. In fact, after seeing those three movies and the first spin-off, Alien vs. Predator, I still don't yearn to see more of them. (I'd much rather watch the same and copied character, the Hirogens, in Star Trek: Voyager.) Anyhoo, this movie reminded me a ton of a Dean Koontz Movie and it's definitely not without its flaws, but it's a fun, leave-your-brain-at-the-door sci-fi adventure, albeit very dark. Too bad they left it wide open for another sequel which I didn't think would be madefive years later, it really seems unlikely.
I never got vested into the series until #5, still my favorite installment because they were finally honest and embraced the fact these are live-action cartoons and with each of the many "Yeah, right!" near misses and stunts, it makes it actually fun. #6, though not as good, but still entertaining, carried that tradition.Unfortunately, someone decided to go back to being serious. Sure, there were some "Yeah, right!" scenes I enjoyed in Furious Seven, but they were few and far between. In fact, maybe just 2-3 in an almost 2½ hour movie. Sad.Not to say this was a bad movie. The action scenes, though cut down tremendously from previous chapters, were really good. Mostly involving Paul Walker. And speaking of PaulYes, RIP Paul. I really did like him and his presence in movies. But, his part here seemed almost irrelevant. Yup, I liked his fighting the same dude twice, and he did have the most exciting "Yeah, right!" escape in the best chase/action scene in the film. But, his part in the team just seemed blah. I understand his arc, destination, etc, but his character was actually the lamest of all of themincluding the bad jokester.What I did like most about Furious Seven were the characters played by Michelle Rodriguez and Kurt Russell. They absolutely kept things interesting. Unfortunately, the two I wanted to like more, but was sadly let down by, were: one of my favorite action stars, Jason Statham who was not as exciting to watch as is the case in any of his other films and The Rock, whose measly 10 minutes of screen time was a joke.Unbelievably, for this series, that is, they worked on the story and, while still simple, it was enjoyable. Basically it was twofold  revenge from the brother of someone they previously killed (Die Hard with a Vengeance, anyone?) and yet another big brother device they need to obtain from the bad guys sothe US government can use it. Um, seriously? I am proud to be an American, but would absolutely think that device would be best in the bad guy's hands than in our Government's. (Thoughthey probably already have something similar, if not exactly the same, to the one in the movie, anyways.)While the movie was decent and the few action scenes were good, I'm not 100% leaning on a recommendation since it was just sodamnlong. And what we came for just took too much time to get to. Maybe for fans, but even then, they were probably expecting what I was: another silly live- action cartoon, albeit fun, ride. They just took it way too seriously, especially for a part 7 in a franchise. That all said, at least director James Wan gave the dudes in the audience the two things they wanted most. And when those two things showed up, for my own amusement, I had to shout out at the screen: "GIRLS! GIRLS!" and "RACE SCENE!" (Taken from a hilarious YouTube video that summarized the previous six installments. And don't worry  the movie was so flipping loud, especially during those scenes, no one could hear me.)* * *Final thoughts: Yes, this is a movie. Yes, fiction. But, dang it, one of the most pointless and clichéd scenes that simply drove me nuts was one where a gun could've ended a dispute, but was discarded in lieu of a street fight. Again, I recognize this as a fictional movie, and definitively a Fast & Furious sequel, and Indiana Jones already did what I wantedbut still, it was frustrating. At least make the person run out of bullets and then do the butch, male fighting. Sheesh!
Honestly, I wasn't anticipating Kill Bill Vol. 2 to be better than Vol. 1. In fact, I thought I would be bored since I already knew Tarantino generally cuts back on the action and ups the dialogue in the second half of his story lines.Of course, I had to see the finale of the seriesso far. (Again, I'm not looking forward to a Vol. 3  spoiler alert, I don't want to see "The Bride" die, like the future setup movie it's sounds like it might be.) I was NOT disappointed. In fact, Vol. 2 is actually better.While Thurman still does an excellent job  her best performance (EVER) was in Vol. 1-2, everyone else stepped up their game. Madsen, as always, was great and Hannah was perfect. Even (new to the series, character) Esteban (Parks) was wonderful. But the scene-stealer award goes to the late Carradine, God rest his soul. Honestly, as many things that were masterful about this movie, he was worth the entire admission price.Plot line: "The Bride" continues down her revenge path and continues to get knocked down in the process. Way down, like 6-feet-under, literally in one scene.More background is revealed, as well as more subplots. And the obvious final confrontation with Bill and her daughter  no spoiler, since that was foretold in Vol. 1.While the action is cut down in Vol. 2, the plot, dialogue, suspense and plot moves forward in fast-motion. Tarantino again delivers, but this time, 2-fold. And with the finale speech from Carradine, it ends on a perfect note. (It helps I'm a huge Superman fan.) Not to be redundant from my Vol. 1 review, again, everything works in this movie: Music, score, style, acting, originality, suspense, action, cinematography and dialogue. Everyone should see both Vol. 1 and 2. I loved all the actors in this movie, especially the extended roles of Carradine and Parks.
500 Days of Summer? Big deal, I live in Phoenix, AZ. We have 500 days of summer every year.Actually the little movie was a big deal. Currently, I am only awarding it 4/5 stars, however, I think this will be one that will grow on me. It's only been a short while since I've seen it, and I can't get it out of my mind.That being said, it did fell forced at times, the side characters were only mildly amusing (his friends were good  not great, but his sister was so clichéd that she was almost hard to watch) and you can tell the movie it was trying to mimic in the opening with the outlined city (and then throughout.) Okay, if you couldn't tell, watch/re-watch the brilliant Juno.In addition, I really want to say Gordon-Levitt did a great job and should be up for an Oscar nom. But, I can barely say he did a good job. He was trying to play a stuck-in-his-past (well, at all times) geek and though he got that down, no real depth or believability came from him. The movie really belonged solely to Deschanel.She was perfect on many levels. Stole every scene, showed growth and depth consistently and had a perfect on screen persona, a genuine charisma that grabbed you as you got to know her. She deserves, at very least, an Oscar nomination for her real-life character.Probably the majority of people go through relationships like Tom and Summer have. It's no spoiler that this relationship was doomed from day one (of 500  obviously.) They tell you that less than a minute in. You want it to work out, you yearn for the nerd to get the free-bird (again, literally) girl. However, as previously mentioned, it was not meant to be and one of the most brilliant aspects was the revolution in the closing on why not.I know I've been through a relationship like this. One party believes in fate, that one special, soul-mate (that's me, duh) while the other's skeptical and may not be the true "one." It does hurt that both me and Tom share more than the years in an office job trait  we're both nerds stuck in the past.Nevertheless, back to the movie. We follow their relationship for 500 day, back and forth from day 42 to 303, then to 121. A lot of the comedy stems from these wonderful transitions. Such as, the fantastic dance segment to Tom's mood in another day of 500. (Side note: Spider-Man 3 did pretty much the same thing, following Peter Parker and in his mind a lovely stroll through the city and a vintage song playing. How did a movie that probably spent $500 million less get this kind of scene right?) Like I said before, some of this felt forced, including a Jerry Macguire blow up, but there were a lot of wonderful scenes, a lot of comedy that made me laugh out loud. It is an adult comedy, and even though most of the movie is pretty much "clear" (and "clean") of today's adult romcoms  i.e. any Paul Rudd/Seth Rogen/Adam Sandler features, it will remind you, you're not watching a PG-13 film.I definitely would recommend this small movie to mass audiences, if not just for Deschanel. It was refreshing to see an original spin on the romantic movies of current years. A movie that puts a lot of 1970-80s references to people my age (or Tom's and Summer's) without shoving it down our throats.
The best thing I can say about The Bounty Hunter, was that this didn't star Katherine Heigl, becausethis movie has her name written all over it. Instead, we have the EVER RACHEL (Friends) Jennifer Aniston  hell, does she even have it in her contract she can NEVER change that Rachel hair 'do?But, the worst I can say about the movie is that it's toodamn...LONG. It's not a terrible movie, as a lot of people/critics are saying, but stretching an 85 minute, already predictable concept for an additional 26 minutes is just torture.The other problem involved too many subplots. The ENTIRE gambling debt/Cathy Moriarty scenes NEEDED TO BE CUT. Not even added into the special features or any Easter Eggs. Don't get me wrong; I love Cathy  I'll never forget her in Soapdish. But, the movie would've been tighter if they briefly mentioned he had a gambling problem for it was completely irrelevant to the central plot or why these two (obviously) need to be together.And here we go: the always perky, though down-on-his-luck, bounty hunter Milo's (Butler) next assignment is his ex-wife, Nicole (Aniston.) She's working on a suicide story for a newspaper and of course, her getting picked up by Milo is a major distraction.On a side note, she's not much of a gambler  that we know of or that they established, but she allows herself to be a wide-open target at a horse track in Atlantic City, NJ. Sure, it took Milo a little wit to find her, but perhaps that was another scene that could've been cut or re-written.At any rate, he gets her and he gambles while there  in the most realistic scene in the movie, he leaves happy to go to the games, he returns drunk and totally drainedBEEN THERE. Incredibly  well, they do explain, but it's weak  he agrees to delay her trip to jail so they can solve her police corruption/suicide story.Hilarity (if you're into this kind of screwball comedy) ensues and the question of the most obvious conclusion arrives: will they get back together?For the most part, the movie's harmless, but it needed to be shorter. Rachel, er, Aniston needed to be someone different for onceSeriously, it's not just her hair. The woman cannot act. She cannot be ANYONE but Rachel.On the brightsideat least the role didn't go to the dreadful Heigl (SEE: the 1½ star The Ugly Truth, also starring Butler or the dreadful Killers  the movie that I simply couldn't get past 10 minutes and I turned it off.)Side Notes: Just for the record, I did like her in Knocked Up  but that was it. Also, on a completely unrated subject: I hate gambling scenes in movies. They make me look away as if someone's guts were being spilled. Why? Again, been there, done that and we almost ALWAYS get the same results: Hopeful target with a smile, a SURPRISE win on the first roll or turn of the cards (not really, since we knew it was coming, but still) and the inevitable crash and burn. The minute a gambling scene happens in a movie, I almost always turn awaybecause both the end result is predictable but alsoI don't wish to revisit that same feeling.
There have been a lot of comparisons between the new series of The Hunger Games and the Twilight (so-called) "saga" lately, and I'm not innocent of avoiding paralleling the two. Well, the moment The Hunger Games begins, those unfair similarities should be tossed. The two franchises are as close as the Star Wars episodes and The Alien films.While The Hunger Games isn't perfect by any means measurable, it's light-years ahead of the Twilight duds. Better acting, dialogue, suspense, action, emotion, heart and special effects are just the tip of the iceberg on how much better The Hunger Games is, but then again, that's just denouncing the comparison.So, I digress. The Hunger Games has really only one major thing going for it which is actually making me encourage all to see it: Jennifer Lawrence (or J-Law.) The actress herself and her fantastic character of Catnip, er, Katniss are worth the price alone. I already liked her tremendously in Winter's Bone and come to think about it, I believe I said the exactly the same thing about that movie. So-so movie, EXCELLENT performance, so much so: everyone should see it just for her.Other than J-Law, this movie was really...eh. Yes, the cinematography was splendid  WHEN THE CAMERA WASN'T SHAKING all around when no one else was  and some of the effects were pretty decent. But, damn, was it ever slow, predicable and has the most LOL vision of the future. I literally did laugh out loud every time the clowns of the future were on screen.Before any fans shoot arrows at me, I have NOT read any of the books. But, even if these ugly and unnecessary 1960s Star Trek rejected costumes and makeup designs were in the source material that does NOT mean they have to be in the feature film. I mean, if the screenplay writer or director didn't update certain characters/costumes, Robin of Batman Forever/& Robin would look pretty...well, molestable from the much older Bruce Wayne. And the X-Men even commented on the ridiculous yellow suits and look how great they turned out. Well, for the first two installments, at any rate.(Sadly, they failed to hear this kind of complaint for Captain America in the forthcoming Avengers movie. Hey! There's still time to edit out that hilarious uniform, Disney. This goes for you, too, Thor!)Anyhoo, what I am guessing is hundreds of years into our future, the reality TV show lives on (THANKS, America) only this one has the kids killing other kids. As much as I'm against that, if Jersey Shore stole this idea, I would finally watch my very first episode of that awful MTV show. Repeatedly.Not really a spoiler  seen a movie trailer lately?  but Catnip volunteers/sacrifices herself in place of her weakling sister for this wooded and hologram'med death match of 2 younglings from each of the 12 districts (why the aliens from #9 didn't participate is beyond me.) She leaves behind an obvious love choice and must fight/help a new love choice (Dang, there's that Twilight comparison again) in order to survive the "game" of life.The idea's not new (The Running Man anyone?), but this new horror of kid on kid deadly violence is. This absolutely should've been Rated R and be more serious. 'Course, they wouldn't make the money they'll know they'll make by copping out to the PG-13 crowds.In all seriousness, this has a VERY violent movie premise and whenever the movie tried to make some lite comment or joke, I barely laughed because it's like making a teeny-bopper movie about everyone being a rapist or molester, but everyone still can enjoy a few laughs from time to time.Also, as I mentioned, it was slower than it should've been, felt very much like the first in a series and seemed to take far too long to get to the actual "Games" than it should've been. All along, I felt this was a perfect prequel movie that should've been the fourth film  à la The Hobbit after we're already invested in the series.Okaythat all saidagain, it's worth a viewing due to the absolutely Oscar-nomination-worthy performance of J-Law  who delivered the only unpredictable aspect of this movie (I never knew which way her character would sway while all other characters or scenes were A-B-C) and maaaybe a consideration for Woody Harrelson, whom I normally don't like, but did great here. No one and I mean no one  even the VERY cute guys  did great, but they were 16-acting-classes ahead of Robert "Eerie Edward" Pattinson, Kristen "Blah Bella" Stewart and Taylor "Jake the Dog" Lautner of the Twilight series. Oops, sorry about bringing that up again. See? I'm not immune to the comparisons.And finally, the movie, quite honestly, grabbed my attention enough that I really, really look forward to part II. No spoilers because I haven't read the novels, but I strongly want one of my new favorite characters, Catnip, to take down the establishment. The ideas, though preposterous, are sadly and minutely accurate (ah hem, Nazis or Republicans, you pick) of a possible and tyrannous outlook of mankind. They're horrifying, although, if this were a 1980s/1990s action flick starring Arnold or Sylvester, the "man" would've been taken down by now.Since that isn't the case and this wasn't made 20-30 years ago (though you would believe it was with the costumes, makeup and hair), I'm really looking forward to seeing my new heroine take on Kiefer's dad and put an end to the games. You go gurl!
Sorry, I try and come up with a better headline for my reviews, but since Mission: Impossible III had the extreme unfortunate timing of being released almost immediately following Mr. Tom Cruise's rants, raving and couch jumping, practically no one saw not only the best of the franchise, but one of the best action movies I've seen.Though I did not grow up on the original Jim Phelps series, despite my father's futile attempts, I thoroughly understand the concept: Spy + Action. The first Mission: Impossible dealt ONLY with the spy part. The second movie, ONLY action. Finallythey got it right with Part III: they successfully blended both spy and action and(SPOILER don't read the final part of this paragraph if you haven't seen Parts I or III yet) the team lives, like they're supposed to! Unlike Part I, where 90% of the team diesIN THE FIRST 20 MINUTES and they improperly make the leaderJim Phelps, himselfa bad guy.At any rate, public opinion really should've been thrown out the window on this one. Seriously, I have no opinion on the Oprah couch rants or Tommy's battle with one-time-famous Brooke Shields (The Blue Lagoon) and it should NOT have any bearing on the quality of this nearly excellent film. It's like my fruitless protest of Chick-fil-A since its run by Mormons who like to close the doors on Sundays. I mean, they have great chicken sandwiches, no?A lot of the success of Part III has to be contributed to the soon-to-be-labeled-MASTER J.J. Abrams (Star Trek (2009).) They had faith in him to rejuvenate the series, and he would'veby a mile with the quality used in this film, if not for the judgmental public. Shame on you! You're missing out on (again) one of the best action movies ever.I'm all for people giving their educated opinions on topics, but when you dismiss one thing because of another, you're not giving it a chance. I'm not completely innocent myself, but I find more and more, I am opening my mind prior to watching a movie despite past bad performances or public outcries. For example, Sean Penn is not my favorite actors and he's a huge advocate, but that won't stop me from watching his movies to see if I'll ever be impressed. And, unbelievably, I have at times.I need to step off the pedal stool, and talk about the greatness here. We start at the end with an obvious object of (sorta ex-) spy Ethan Hunt's (Cruise) affection being tortured while Ethan can't do anything to stop it. Going back in (time in) the story we see how Ethan's adjusted well with his personal life after semi-retiring from spying. Unfortunately that (very quickly) goes south when he's called back to duty to rescue an old student of his, Lindsey (Keri Russell.)She was working on something called the "Rabbit's Foot" that eeevil Owen (Hoffman) wants to obtain and sell. Ethan must scale the globe to solve the case of the missing rabbit's foot, appease his mean boss (Fishburne) and save his girlfriend.The movie's not in line with the Bourne franchise, but it's fairly close. Its fun, has great dialogue, a wonderful villain in (the ALWAYS impressive) Hoffman, has exciting action sequences, marvelous cinematography and the best score of the (first) three movies. Oh, and it's funny, thanks the always hilarious Simon Pegg.I understand the movie (unjustifiably) bombed, thanks, America, but I am glad Hollywood still have faith by bringing it back with a fourth installment in 2011especially now starring one of my favorites: Jeremy Renner.Put aside your feeling of Tom as a human  who are we to judge?  and just enjoy this hugely fun roller-coaster of adventure.
Where Airplane! shot through 100's of jokes and had the highest joke per frame than any other movie, Unstoppable succeeded in the same ratios. Unfortunately, their version of jokes is also known as Disaster Movie Clichés.Seriously. The movie's only 98 minutes long and they have twice that many predictable, overused and pathetically "heart-wrenching" scenes to last six Lifetime movies.That all said, if you have never, ever, EVER seen a Disaster Flick with the feel-good, underdogs will overthrow the big-bad-bosses, you might actually enjoy this flick. Heck, I even felt a bit of some tension, despite the overblown finale.Here we have two completely wasted roles in Washington and Pine in the leads. Wasted as Washington is generally very good and Pine definitively has potential, yet they could've shaved some of the budget by casting unknowns. Oh, wait, they needed them to sell the movie.OK, this "inspired by a true story" isn't anything new, nor close to the truth. (SEE: the true story for yourself. 70mph runaway train, my ass.) Yet, if you leave your brain at the door, by all means, step in and enjoy mindless entertainment.On par with World Trade Center, we have "Hero" Frank (Washington) and up'n'coming Smartass Will (Pine), each with their "Oh, we care about their background family issues" stories on a training (ha, get it, training. Sorry, I have to find amusement somewhere) when ALL OF A SUDDEN the idiot from TV's My Name is Earl (Suplee, also playing, surprisingly, an idiot here) lets loose an unmanned train at 70mph that mightverywellDESTROY AN ENTIRE TOWN! Naturally, we have to give it to the big wigs to screw up with uneducated answers that might VERY WELL COST LIVES! If only they sped the train up to 88mph and while back in time the inevitable toxicants on the train wouldn't harm anyone in 1885 Pennsylvania.So, anywaysthey don't play heroes, but must become heroes to stop/slow down a train that, beyond little odds, should destroy a small town. And outside of the obvious conclusion, you know it's based on a true story so.guess who wins in the Man Vs. Machine climax?Get past the VERY typical (Director) Tony Scott music video (also overused) cinematography  man, I'm getting sick of that  or step-by-step/A-B-C Disaster Movie plot, it was the media in the film that p@ssed me off the most. If Seinfeld's finale taught us anything, put down the damn camera and either step out of the way or help in some way. I'd give up "knowing" what was happening to our brave heroes or their techniques, without their constant and horrid narration.Whewrant's over. I don't give this the lowest rating because it's harmless and at under an hour and a half, you could do worse (like watching a Syfy Saturday Night Disaster Movie Marathon) but honestly, not much better.
Like to go back to the ole Killer-in-the-Woods days, like Friday the 13th or (newer) Hatchet? Experience the Severance payback only the English can provide.I'm guessing (and this is coming from seeing it, as well as the behind the scenes footage) they were intending this film to be a tongue-in-cheek horror/comedy. Well, it was funny for a bit  and yeah, I get British humor  but for the most part, it was, in fact, just another slasher flick. I will say this: it did contain its gruesome scenes (when necessary) and surprises, though few and far between.What we have here is an office group "celebrating" some good profits and some "team-building" in the forest. What we don't have here is: safe travels.when they're led off the road into uncharted (to both them and, well, any normal humans) territory.Enter in David Brent (er, sorry, wrong British comedy reference, Michael Scott for you Americans) leading every stereotype office worker, not that was certainly a bad thing  they all made it like The Office, in fact  and they're being hunted and picked off one by one while the remaining get wiser. You kind of know in the beginning who'll make it, but it's (kinda) fun seeing them get there.The stand out performance was Danny Dyer, whom I'm not that familiar with, but would like to get to know better seeing him in this. The DVD extras highlight him further, especially with his humor both on and off screen. Side note: he's not very modest, again, not a bad thing, but that's an English thing, I know.It's funny, it's scary, it's only mildly original, but it has a great finale, a la Robert Rodríguez. Despite my not so high rating, I'm still recommending it to the killer-in-the-woods and dark comedy genre fans. If you like both, it's unlikely you'll be disappointed.
Man, I love courtroom dramas. In movies and books. Also, I'm a huge Michael Douglas fan. Furthermore, Metcalfe is extreme eye-candy. So why was Beyond a Reasonable Doubt soooamateurish? There's probably many reasons. Even though it's not based on a John Grisham novel/idea, it's as if Grisham was either drunk or was having a really bad year and thought of this idea. So, even the worst of Grisham's books/movies was 10x better than this mess. Douglas seriously was only looking for a paycheck or was just coaxed into starring and putting his name on top for sales  either way, or both, it failed, financially. In addition, the dialogue and clichéd characters are just plain awful. And the "surprise twist" ending was seen from the opening 20 minutes. Before you criticize this part by saying what I hear a lot: "Oh, just sit back and enjoy the movie  stop trying to guess the ending!" Uh, they're marketing and writing this as a "mystery" so they're, literally begging us to try and outsmart the 14-year-olds who wrote this.C.J. (Metcalfe) is trying to make a name for himself in the new media and his big break would be to bring down D.A./Governor-to-be Mark Hunter (Douglas) for planting evidence to win cases. C.J.'s brilliant idea is to find a murder and set himself up as the killer. Once the evidence is planted against him, he would spring the trap on Hunter andeverythingwouldbejustfine. But, will it? Duh.Amongst all the other problems of the movie, a major one involves the timeframes. Sure, the movie was set to be under two hours so they kinda sped this process up, but in reality  something, I'm assuming the movie's asking us to believe its set in, this would take months, if not years. C.J. makes it not only seem like a slam dunk, Pulitzer Prize winning article, but a quick conviction of Hunter.Another issue I had, and coincidentally I just wrote another review (Extract) with this complaint, was the wasted talent. Douglas should absolutely know better. Not all of his movies are five stars, but he has picked quite a few great ones. He has no excuse. But Metcalfe, in his best Tom Cruise imitation here, shouldn't be wasting any time or (his little bit of acting) talent here. According to what I've read, since I have yet to meet him, he bases a lot of his screen presence on his looks. His looks won't last forever, so, please pick better scripts. And then you'll get more notice as well as the ability to grow as an actor.I'm awarding this the lowest award  1 star. Though it won't be on my all time worst top-ten lists, I simply cannot find a redeemable quality from this movie. A movie that feels sooo student film project.
First impressions rarely let me down. Rarely.Picture it, way back in 1996, Cine Capri in Phoenix, AZ, I first watched Independence Day andhated it. I went with two buddies, one of which said afterwards that it was realistic portrayal of the aliens. I said, "In movies? Or (pointing) up there?" He confirmed he meant from above. Sheesh. Eh, to each his/her own, but I didn't (at the time) find anything realistic about it.It was the second time I saw this, however, that grabbed me and opened my eyes to the best big-budget-B-movie ever made up to that point. And that's exactly what it is: a B-Movie with a Budget. It took elements from practically every MST3k-mocked mid-20th Century alien invasion story, but added the element of excessive funds.Further review of this movie, it also added hilarious lines, decent acting and state-of-the-art (EVEN by today's standards, 14 years later) special effects. So, you must know, this is the ultimate leave-your-brain at the door movie. Sit back and have a roaring time.Impatient people do not have to wait long for the movie to kick-start what it's here for; the alien mother ship makes it's "Star Wars" entrance seconds into the feature and all hell breaks loose first in the US government, but then the world as smoky-fire clouds reveal the "baby" 15-mile-wide ships over the world.Bam! Start the soap opera list of stars from various parts of the US. We've already met Constance (Colin) and President Whitmore (Pullman) in D.C. but then there's his First Lady Marilyn (McDonnell) in L.A. who shares the city with couple Steven (Smith) and Jasmine. NYC holds David (Goldlum) and Dad (Hirsch)  not to mention the hilarious Marty (Fierstein) who, instinctively cares for his mother and lawyer. For good measure, throw in crazy Russell (Quaid) who, not to really spoil anything, acts like Cartman from South Park episode one. There'll be more, but, I believe the movie revolves around this already extended cast.Unlike most disaster/end-of-the-world films, this is the best cast ever assembled in this particular genre. Unfortunately, even though I really did like the actors and their characters and felt the chemistry was perfect, that statement isn't saying much. Take Director/Producer/Writer Emmerich, since he happened to direct this one. Three of his follow-ups had so many big names and so many disappointments that I hardly cared enough about them to mind if they perished prior to the big and clichéd finales. 2012, 1998's Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow were all sub-par to painful and each and every character was so one-dimensional and thoughtless, we lost a lot of what those movies were all about: hope.Don't get me started on the other Emmerich comrade, Michael Bay, and his terrible list of both movies and assemble of way below average characters: Pearl Harbor, Transformers 1-2, The Island and A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010.) (Personally, I didn't like Armageddon, but at least he had one-two worth rooting for in that disaster film.)At any rate, I loved the characters in Independence Day, but the true stars of the film was the special effects and tongue-in-cheek dialogue. After you get to know the different personality and employments of the actors, the rest of the movie is a just plain roller-coaster of aliens trying to eliminate us, humans failing at eliminating them, an actually plausible and believable love story and, of course, the kick-ass, though obvious FIGHT-BACK finale that does NOT disappoint for a single second.I'm a score-man. I love a beautiful and relevant instrumental background music track, and this movie's got a great one by David Arnold. It's not only action-packed and has elements of perfect Sci-Fi moments, but the number one quality it had was: HOPE. The movie centers around humans (FINALLY) banding together, putting way "petty differences" (LOVE THAT LINE) as spoken by the President in a great motivational and human speech, and the hope we have to survive. Truly, I love a score that through no spoken words, speaks tons for the movie, and mood, at hand.I've already mentioned how I liked the cast, but I'd like to focus in on some of my favorites. Back in the mid-1990s, it was unquestionable that the summers belonged to WILL SMITH. Bad Boys, Independence Day, Men in Black, heck, even some unfortunate fools went to see Wild, Wild, West. Personally, I like when he actually acts and not just play "Will Smith" but here he's at the top of his "Hey, I'm Will Smith" game.Further, I'm a fan of Jeff Goldblum, and you kinda have to be, to like him here. He's also playing his signature "Hey, I'm JeffuhuhGoldblum" role. He was hilarious, smart and I liked his true desire to use his talents to solve the little alien invasion problem.Mixed these two together, meaning Goldbulm's David and Smith's Steven, finally, and towards the end of the movie, it was heaven. They played off each other; two complete strangers who could both bounce off each other with 100% separate personalities, but had extreme chemistry. You almost wonder what took the movie so long to get them together.Finally, just plain see this movie, if you haven't already. It's extremely fun and even better on a big screen. In fact, this movie has been used in one of my long-standing arguments whenever I hear someone say "Oh, I'll just wait for video." Like Twister, Independence Day looks just, well, so small when you watch it on the television. Picture how threatening a 15-MILE-WIDE (TV Series) "V"-shaped ship hovers over the cities as seen in the movie theater and then do the same for a 7 inch spacecraft on your TV and tell me this one was "worth" the wait for video.
I actually had two new surprises, from a 1981 film, as I revisited what I always labeled as my "Favorite Werewolf Movie of All Time," The Howling: it's not, in fact, my favorite, and (ARE YOU KIDDING ME?) The Doctor (Robert "The Doctor" Picardo on Star Trek: Voyager) is the sex-crazed werewolf, Eddie, that sets the whole movie into motion?OK, that reveals that I am a die-hard Voyager fan, but it also states how this movie keeps impressing me after all these years.A lot of avid werewolf fans love An American Werewolf in London when I barely liked that feature. Picture it: I was a kid, I had little patience. Okay, I still have very little of that "quality" but I needed to see the werewolf and soon or I would be busting at the seams. And American simply takes too long  especially when the man becomes aDOG.So, I always loved and was always faithful to (the original and you better stay, STAY far away from the sequels) The Howling because it gets me what I wanted the most: the anti-dog (stand-up) werewolf and quicker.Unfortunately, I realized something with this viewing: This movie ALSO takes a bit to get to the goods. There's an enormous set up that I had (as an adult now) little patience for, as well. The problem is: the version I watched overand overas a kid, was the edited TV version.When I watched this now, it was the DVD, with nothing edited out and it took more than half the relatively short horror flick to produce the werewolf. Now, that said, when it did appear, it was Fantastic. So much for the CGI of today that literally mocks what a "real" (meaning, what I consider to be a MAN-WOLF, a standing man who turned into a wolf) werewolf looks like.What we have here is: News Anchor, Karen (Wallace  later known as Wallace-Stone) is investigating brutal attacks and agrees to meet Eddie who readily attacks her while changing into a werewolf. She doesn't fully realize this as a rookie cop shoots and supposedly kills him.Shaken and stirred Karen agrees to a mountainside retreat under the guidance of Dr. George Waggner (Macnee) with her husband. Unfortunately, she's unwilling to partake in sex, and Marsha (Brooks) is. And unfortunately for Karen, her husband is willing to partake in sexwith Marshaand a quick bite, transforming him into a werewolf.Scared, Karen calls her news station friend, Terry (Balaski) up who, along with her own husband, has been researching "the beast within." Once it's realized this group of spiritual healers at the retreat aren't up to actual healing, it's time for heroism, escape and the story of the century.The reason I realized this is not my favorite werewolf movie is because, frankly, Jack Nicholson's Wolf, is actually an overall better made film. While The Howling gave me everything I absolutely love about the myth of the "wolf-man," i.e. a man that resembles a wolf, albeit a 6-foot-tall one, Wolf had better acting, story, dialogue, etc.That said, I will always cherish this film. It had comedy and a lot of tongue-in-cheek references (please tell me you noticed the dozens to other films.) And when the movie finally got going, half-way through, it was fierce. In fact, the mid-section of horror/attacks is some of my favorite werewolf attack-scenes in any movie to date, let alone any When Animal Attacks film.
How misleading are the trailers for Edge of Darkness? Enough to deceive the audience from spending their time or money on it and let it barely reach half of its production costs. Not to mention distribution, advertising, etc. (Heck, even I was fooled into being excited to see both the return of Mel Gibson after a long, long absence, but also into seeing the dark Gibson, so perfect in the theatrical version of Payback.) It cannot be a coincidence that not only was it marketed as the next (and far superior) Taken, Edge was released exactly the same weekend one year following. And it's no Taken, despite the ads. The bright side is that you get three movies for the price of one! (No, that's not necessary a blessing.) Edge starts off with mellow cop Thomas Craven (Gibson) picking up/reconnecting with his daughter (Novakovic) in a special way. Making dinner, giving fatherly advice, holding her up as she vomits uncontrollably. Well, what (we find out later) would've killed her in mere hours anyways wasn't enough for the impatient bad men of the story who decide to blow her away on their way out to go to the hospital.Still sticking with Story A, and probably the best part of the entire movie, we truly feel Craven's anguish over his daughter's death. Welcome Back, Mr. Gibson. Unfortunately, we move onto Story B, the investigation. This is where it's highly misleading from the ads.For the most part, Story B is rather slow moving and slow to reveal the shallow plot/secrets the entire movie's based on. In addition, the "so-called" fast moving, angry, man-on-the-"EDGE" and with "nothing to lose" Craven seems just to be going through the motions, never really exciting, nor someone to truly root for. We've pretty much given up the Story A's grief as it's now Story B: The Conspiracy Investigation.Sure, there were one or two scenes of action/movement, and maybe one good line of dialogue not already ruined in the movie preview. Other than that you get two real aspects of Story B: a typical "rouge" cop investigating and possibly the world's dumbest (or unluckiest) assassins. No spoiler that the bad men want Papa Craven dead, but with the hundreds of opportunities  he always drives his own vehicle! He stays where he's the most accessible: his own home!  I can't phantom anyone not being able to expose these bad men. It only looks like the script called for Craven to make it through, obviously so the audience can cheer him on, but they practically kill off half of Boston and can't touch this walking target. He's just a cop; he's not Jack Bauer.But alas, keeping him alive as the "hero" who needs to pull the plug on big bad corporation is the conspiracy theory the movie's based on. (And actually, Gibson's other movie, Conspiracy Theory was so much better. Save your money and just rewatch that one. Or better yet, watch Michael Clayton and see how far superior, far more believable corporate baddies "take care of problems." Proof? While Edge won't win any awards  or even be nominated, Clayton was not only nominated for 7 Oscars, it deservedly won for Tilda Swinton who showed true humanism to people who feel they need to pull the triggerfrom a distance.) As if I haven't spoiled enough thus far, (the shortest of all stories) Story C boils down to the revenge thriller people wanted when they bought their tickets thinking this was Taken 2: Make Room for Daddy. Sorry, it was too little, too late. And all the plot twists and character defects shown throughout the movie in quick/confusing snippets are tied up, but again, we had long since given up trying to put all the clues together in Story B.Edge of Darkness barely receives a recommendation from me, if not for all of Story A and the last 1-2 minutes of the movie that I liked a lot. A very original ending that couldn't of happened any other way, if you think about it. (And for those who have seen this, I'm not referring to the woman running into her "boss's" office. That was too obvious.)
The trailer makes Lawless look like the most thought-provoking, action-packed western/gangster/prohibition of all time.From what I can rememberNo. I was simply bored and didn't believe most of this supposedly "true story."A friend at work  who no longer works with me, huh  not only recommended it to me, but demanded I bring her DVD home and watch it before she left the company. I did, for several reasons.One: I do like the actors in the film, including Tom Hardy, Shia "pre-crazy" LaBeouf and Guy Pearce. Two: I've heard others praise it like this coworker did. And, again, the trailer made it lookexciting.Eventually, I found the true reasoning on why this ex-coworker loved it: She had a crush on Tom Hardy. Not that there's anything wrong with that, asdo I, but, it's not enough for me to spend almost two hours with an okay story with extremely little surprising twists.Unfortunately, it's been a bit of time since I've seen this  two months or so, and not much has stuck with me, other than how bored I was through most of this. And how I doubted most of what happened. For example: this supposedly took place about a hundred years ago and a character is sliced across the throat. Not only does his live, but without proper care for hours after his incident.Normally I provide a synopsis, but I've long since forgotten this mostly joyless experience. Suffice to say, brothers-in-booze have a clichéd business man to deal with if they want to continue with their anti-prohibition ways. Throw in some spicy heroines and some mumbled speeches/loyalties and there's the rest.Not that it's the most unoriginal film, but it's certainly not the most memorable one. It's recommended for that tight circle that cares about that old era in America history.* * * Final thoughts: Fine. I agree with my friend. Tom Hardy. What a man. Also, Shia. So these two should be enough reason to bring me to see this multiple times in the theatre. If the internet didn't exist and it was 1985.
It's definitively a rarity: seldom sequels top their originals. 'Blade II' is one of the exceptions. I admit, I'm not one for "origin" stories as they normally take too long to get to what we came for, and the original 'Blade' is also an exception: it didn't take too long and was thoroughly enjoyable. However, any problems with #1 (bad, very bad, CGI, Blade acting amateurish) are gone and they move (fast) forward with a very good story and action. An already-established Vampire Mix-breed Hunter, Blade, is given the opportunity to team with his nemesis, the vampires, when a new advanced-model Vampire enters the ranks. Their (or his, to begin) mission: destroy all vampires and then supposedly wipe out humans, following. Blade's no dummy, so he's taking all precautions after rescuing his mentor, Whistler, teaming with him and newbie, Scud. It's an extremely interesting concept to the relatively new series and though it mostly plays as a "mystery," it's pretty easy to figure out from the get-go on how this will play out. Nevertheless, it's fun if you just sit back and enjoy, if blood-thirsty vampire action's your idea of entertainment. Pending you watched this when it first came out, it might be more original, but after the success of 'Hellboy' (also starring Perlman,) 'Aliens' (boy, it had a lot in common with Cameron's film) and any of the 'Underworld' movies, it's hard to see this original as it was in 2002. It was, despite some obvious "plot-twists" and some silliness  slooooow-mo scenes can be annoying at times and watch how interesting sunglasses can be. Regardless, sit back, root for the male-vampire slayer as it has a little bit of everything for an action, horror, comedy and adventure person to enjoy.
Here's a movie that I wanted to drink, er, like more.Drinking Buddies screams attention: attractive stars, independent film, beer. But, the script is muffled, the acting okay and the conclusion questionable. Hell, even the poster features a Jake Johnson without any facial hair, and yet, he has a full-on beard throughout the movie. He has more hair on his face than a lot of guys have on their body. This isn't even a remote comparison to the different color of outfit Julia Roberts had on from the Pretty Woman poster. This is a blatant error on the marketing department.Nevertheless, the movie's about nothing but he-likes-her-she-likes-others and the beer between them. Kate (the absolutely gorgeous and deserves so much more, Olivia Wilde) is so incredibly selfish, she inadvertently drives away male suitors. She has one incredibly predictable mate, but she's still so set on her own life, she fails to see it.After her inevitable break up with her "buddy," her friend-love-interest buddy doesn't bother moving in for the kill and the movie drags to the realistic, albeit open-to-discussion finale.Aside from the movie that could be so much more  with a few more re-writes, that is, it made me absolutely dislike Anna Kendrick. Now, I've loved a few of her films: Up in the Air, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and 50/50 to name three, but I never liked her in those movies. She's one-note and she's a boring "young girl" who relies only on her smile and so-called "innocence." To me, of the many movies I've witnessed her in, she's been the same and never adds anything to the films I cherish. She is beginning to be the female Keanu Reeves; she has great movies on her résumé, but she, herself, was awful. (Oh, and it doesn't help, and yet, explains a lot, that she starred in the Twilight series.)I digress. This movie, again, could've been aided by a few more re-writes as it didn't falter in the cinematography or filming realms. It just wasn't that entirely original or interesting enough to necessitate a higher rating or even a second viewing.Skip drinking during this and drink with some real buddies.
I actually do like a lot of rebooted/remakes, such as Dawn of the Dead, Halloween or Star Trek. But, of course, for every three that are good, a dozen or more are mediocre at best. That's not the case here.Granted, I have not seen, nor really desire to see the original Ocean's Eleven, after what I read and researched about it. I'll just take this movie at face value.More than just a remake, this movie ranks HIGH on my all-time favorites list. I have probably seen it twice the number in the title and plan on more visits to one of the most creative, funny and just plain entertaining movies I have ever seen. It helps that I am a George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon fan and I can enjoy Brad Pitt and Andy Garcia from time to time. But, put all of those, plus a lot more, together and you have probably the highest level of chemistry between any casts in any movie.Ocean (Clooney) is released on probation from jail and first things first: he starts high-rolling his latest heist scheme by rounding up the usual suspects through his buddy, Rusty (Pitt.) Their diabolical plan is to rob three Las Vegas casinos in a single night, all from the same vault under the Bellagio. To do so, they need (almost) a dozen men and everything to go as planned.That's the basic premise, but there is so much more richness to this movie that causes oodles of repeat watching.Number one: Even though the chemistry is pitch perfect across the board, even involving enemies, its Clooney and Pitt that make this jump three levels. Their banter and understanding of each other while finishing each other's thoughts and sentences hasn't been seen since the 1950s. Usually that involved Cary Grant and a various female lead. Here, sexuality aside, these two cats had it down. They added humor, pose and you rooted for them every step of the way, even though, in reality, they're the bad guys.Number Two: The remaining cast was excellent. Each held their own, each had their own depth. Not two alike. Damon was great as the nervous and up'n'coming'thieving Linus, brothers Virgil and Turk were played hilariously by Caan and Affleck and Jemison played the computer nerd wonderfully. Those are just four. Mark my words: EVERY SINGLE actor in this film was perfect in their respective roles. I could go on another 1,000 words on each one and not do them the justice they did for themselves.Number Three: It's pure fantasy. I consider myself somewhat a Vegas Expert  I've been following, studying and visiting Sin City since I was about 13-15. THIS COULD NEVER HAPPEN. Even if one aspect of their master robbery plan would partially work, it would be thwarted in seconds. And that's part of the fun. You know this is unrealistic, yet, we're so drawn into it, it's extremely enjoyable. That's due to (#4 below) the dialogue and character depth that acts as a (no coincidence) diversion to the improbability of what's happening on screen.Number Four: The dialogue was original, deep, snappy and quotable from line one. Speaking of which, those first two words spoken, by both the probation officer and repeated by Daniel Ocean, "Good Morning" seriously became my tagline, no matter the time of day. I would walk into Santisi Brothers, my local pub and watering hole for going on ten years and tell my favorite waitresses "Good Morning." I did it so much, that I didn't catch myself sometimes and some newbie's would tell me it was evening. I always replied, "It's morning somewhere."I mention that story because this movie had such an impact on me, it became part of my subconscious. Oh, and there's plenty more lines I absolutely love: "Whiskey. And whiskey." "I only lied about being a thief and I don't do that anymore.  Steal?  Lie." "All reds!" There's more than a hundred more. Admittedly, some still go over my head including ones about the caper lifestyle I'm not familiar with. Though I can't necessarily follow what an "Ella Fitzgerald" is, it just proves how brilliant this movie is. (And no, I refuse to Google it. I love my ignorance and the movie's intelligence.) It's nice to revisit a movie and either hear/catch things I haven't before or enjoy the dialogue I did.Number Five: I get cranky when it comes to Vegas-Themed movies. They rarely get it right  Con Air and 21 being the most offensive and misappropriated views of the city. This movie got it right. And it was gorgeous. Though now a (only a tad) bit dated  it's 9 years old, after all, it still captures the essence of the beautiful strip, inside the casino and out. It doesn't just take the finale in front of the Bellagio water fountains to tell you: they knew Vegas.Number Six: Simply intelligence. This script was perfect. Rarely will I encounter such a well written, well rounded script from minute one to the end where they introduce Julia Roberts. Everything worked here, from dialogue, to interactions, to tension, to comedy. In a word: masterpiece in writing.If you have yet to experience Ocean's Eleven, you are missing out on a modern classic. Whether or not you like George Clooney or Bad Guys as heroes, you will love this. This worked in 2001 and will be timeless enough to be shown in 2050 and have the same impact. SEE IT!
I feel obligated to re-write a brand new review of Zero Dark Thirty.On January 14th, I wrote my heartfelt review of this movie with my true feelings about all the events and characters portrayed. Sadly, I feel the need to censor myself and save myself from, well, me.No, I don't believe in censorship, but I do believe in choosing to live. What I originally wrote was fairly harsh and absolutely opinionated on how I feel about the topics brought up in this movie. In the light of self-preservation, I am only releasing this second commentary of one of the great movies of 2012.The best part of Zero Dark Thirty was the fantastic performance of Jessica Chastain. Everyone else was good, she was excellent. I hope she wins for the Best Actress Oscar.The cinematography, score, dialogue and acting were all top notch, as was the directing. I can understand Lincoln might win, and while I wouldn't be upset with that, this is a great and suspenseful film of one CIA agent's plight of finding Bin Laden.I understand this is very unusual of me to release a second opinion of my own opinion, but trust me when I say: Even I can recognize I can be over-the-top at times and for the safety of Steve, trust me when I release only the good points.Side Note: Anyone curious, ha, please feel free to email me and I will send you a copy of my original and stronger approach to this film.
About a year and half following the official US release of Super Troopers, Reno 911!'s first TV season debuted and lasted for another five seasons and one movie of their own. In Super Troopers' defense, I began with Reno 911! first and watched all seasons, at least once, and the movie, Reno 911!: Miami, before I just now got around to fully see Super Troopers.I say "fully" because I've tried once before, approximately 4-5 years ago, but gave up 10 minutes into it when I wasn't laughing one bit. I also gave up, because what they presented to me in that opening shot  concerning three potheads being harassed by juvenile-acting highway police officers  looked like it had such potential, but instead had two dozen missed opportunities. And, that was just the first 10 minutes!Well, finally, just yesterday, I got a chance to see the whole and overlong film through to the end. And my first impression was: "Man, I am missing out on some incredible inside jokes. These guys lack both any tiny little bit of charisma or humor. What am I missing here?"Don't get me wrong; I understood the jokes. I got where each one was headed from the beginning of each scene, I just kept thinking that this kept missing the mark everywhere.And noI am not comparing it to the incredibly superior and similar Reno 911!. I let this movie stand on its own, but maybe that was a mistake since both the TV series Reno 911! and its movie took this concept, in addition to mocking the long-standing series, COPS, and improved in every step of the way.But, that's unfair to the movie, so, again, I watched it on its own merit.The very basic synopsis of Super Troopers is: a bunch of wise-cracking boys in men's bodies are somewhat trying to hold on to their Highway Patrol jobs when budget cuts loom. So, after a long series of hijinks, the movie settles in on a plot (yeah, it took awhile to get there since I'm now referring to the third act) of proving themselves, albeit it's juvenile, once again.While the movie wasn't incredibly stale and unfunny, I didn't care for the cast whatsoever. There was no one I could latch onto, root for, care about. They may all be friends, or a group in real life  hence the inside joke I failed to get, but they were incredibly blah. Each and every one of them. Combine that with jokes that were ho-hum, it was a displeasure to get to the end.At least a childhood favorite of mine, Lynda Carter, showed up in a tiny, but welcoming part and there was a shower scene with the bear of the group. Finally, I got to two parts that made me, um, sit up and notice.Overall, while not the worst comedy I've seen, it's not recommended. Just stick with the incredible, talented and charismatic cast of Reno 911! instead.
I was in the mood for a real, honest "feel-good" movie and was not disappointed in 'Requiem for a Dream.' There's heartwarming drama, true family ties, love, comedy and all around wholesome to be found in this uplifting tale.Of course, I'm just kidding. Despite one character taking uppers, this serves up the downers, in truckloads.Four characters in various degrees of drug usage and stages of narcotics spiral out of control, and yet, I felt the movie serves up the extreme consequences only a few go through. Granted, I am not a drug user, nor do I associate people that live this kind of existence, so what do I know? It just seemed to me, in a very short time, less than a year, these people went from (sort-of) real world to near death or worse.The movie begins with a son scaring his mother by removing her TV. My first reaction was he was trying to help her from her television addiction. On the contrary, it was to sell it for the x amount of times in order to score drugs with his friend. They, with the addition of the son's girlfriend come up with a "surefire" way to make it big and out of the life-path they've set themselves on. Hmmm, without giving anything away, I wonder if their slam-dunk plan will work. Meanwhile, Mom gets her dream come true: guest starring on the one and only show on TV (really? There was never anything else on?) To prepare, she inadvertently gets hooked on uppers her careless doctor prescribes. Even her son tells her "Say no to drugs."Overall, I liked the movie that doesn't just also tell the audience to avoid drugs, but shows why in very original and unique ways. Great performances, especially Burstyn (Mom.)Unfortunately, the reason I didn't give it a higher rating was though the story was predictable, the results seemed somehow sped up. Also, the music, which was sometimes good, most times was so overbearing/such a distraction to what was going on or the dialogue spoken. And finally, as unrealistic (again, I'm not a druggie, so I'm mostly assuming) as their lives seemed to turn out, they made the rest of the world crazy, too. Blind doctors, electric shock treatments to cure prescription woos and a station that runs a "game show/self-help" program 24 hours a day, 7 days a week marathon on 3 simple principles of "being a winner." I know those exist, but mercifully, they're only usually in 30 minute 3AM time slots.
Ah, Monsters Must be a Sequel to Monster If Cloverfield had babies on The Road with War of the Worlds in District 9, Monsters would be the offspring. Only these "kids" would certainly cost a lot less.That's the most amazing thing about this semi-original take on the Giant-Alien-Monster Movie: the budget. Sure, it's a completely simplified version, and you really don't see enough monsters to make it plural, but the backdrops, the metal carnage and the Great Wall of America all lead you to believe this cost well over $100 million. Yet, it was made for an unbelievable $15,000.Beyond the low-budget, great sets/cinematography, if pacing and lack of the title character bother you, you might want to see the above mentioned movies. All the way through, I thought this is the longest set up, a la Cloverfield's not-so-grand entrance. And then the entire hour and a half passed and literally almost nothing had happened.That's not to say it was a bad movie, it did have fairly good dialogue, very un-clichéd "heroes," completely believable acting and as stated, wonderful props and cinematography. But, unlike die-hard Shyamalan fans, I do NOT subscribe to the less-is-more theory, ESPECIALLY during Giant-Alien-Monster Movies. Cloverfield was really pushing it, but was better than this film.A much prettier Paris Hilton-type, Samantha (Able) is to be escorted by womanizing photographer Andrew (McNairy) from Mexico through the "infected zone" and back home in the U.S.A. Only, everyone wants to, as well, and at the same time.This isn't your normal "immigration"/no passport dilemma: Six years prior, NASA discovered aliens in space (you won't see this), Aliens land on Earth (you won't see this), Aliens take up residence in Northern Mexico (you won't see this), both governments set up "the zone" and work together to contain them (you won't see this) and now are mating to stay high in numbers. (Okay, you'll see a bit of that last part.)See where I'm going with this? The film is one of those "WAY after the fact movies" such as District 9 or Reign of Fire, but at least Reign showed a fantastic intro of the times before the attacks. It just makes it seem like this a sequel to Monster, you know, the movie where everything you hear here actually happens? Again, it was made around $15,000, so despite the lack of set-up, they still did a fantastic job on showing the aftermath.So, originally they want to take the ferry back home, but when that falls through, they're escorted, themselves, part way through the "infected zone" to attempt to make it home. Along the way, it's an obvious boy-meet-already-taken-girl story. That said, their actions were fairly believable, though you better like looking at them than the actual monsters.Overall, it's an interesting take and even with the wonderful battle examples either on the tele or in front of them, I still would liked to have seen them firsthand. Are we still going to have to wait on the very good acting and story (like here in Monsters) and the top-notch Special-Effects driven Giant-Alien-Monster Movie? When will the two meet for lunch?
Okay, we've crossed, what, the fifth dimension? And now, we're entering the Twilight Zonewith Pinhead in tow. He's just got back from space, at any rate.Hellraiser: Inferno wasn't exactly terrible  it was refreshing to see just another chapter that didn't involve Kirsty or the history of Pinhead or his toy-boy, but it wasn't exactly brilliant either. Believe it or not, Sheffer, whom I've really liked since I first saw Some Kind of Wonderful many, MANY years ago, actually really held his own and the movie together. I guess he had to: Pinhead (Bradley) was barely in it. I'd say, maaaybe 5 minutes tops.On a side note, that ole head with pins probably has an entire screen time of 30-35 minutes spanning the first five movies. I've never timed it, but I'm sure I'm not too far off. Yeah, I get it's not supposed to be about him, his lack of presence instead, but even Freddy didn't get interesting until episodes III and IV of his series.But, I digress, we're here to discuss the (first of many) Direct-to-Video Twilight-Zonesqe chapter where we find filthily dirty, but oh-with-a-heart, Det. Joseph Thorne (Sheffer) who inadvertently (is there another way?) opens the scared box'o'pins, the Lemarchand's Configuration, while sleeping with someone who's not his wife.Yep, she dies, he's a suspect  sort of, and all the while, Thorne's trying to solve that, save his name, appease his wife & child, consult a psychologist, find a missing child and still find time to snort some illegal white stuff he gets from no other than the ice-cream man. Believe it, there's even a lot more going on, but needless to say, it's a mystery that ends up like a Bill Murray movie  brilliantly, I might add, but I'm not revealing which Murray movie due to the ultimate spoiler.I liked it, and again, it's refreshing to just see a "chapter" verses having to have all that incredibly overplayed background story. It would've been nice to see Bradley as Pinhead a little more often, it would've been better with a budget (SEE: Direct-to-video) and it's not life altering if you do or don't see it, but overall, it's at least worth a screening. For fans, that is.
Well, let's get this show off to a running start: within the first six minutes of the definite NC-17 flare, Shame, you'll see full-frontal male & female nudity, male backside, peeing, showering, prostitution and masturbation.Is this a reason to watch this movie? Well, if you're a voyeur or addicted to sex. Ahhh and that's the point of the movie. Perhaps the 2012 documentary Bully should begin with full on bullying for the opening six minutes to get its position started up. (Maybe it does  I haven't seen it, nor do I have plans to.)Honestly, I knew this was coming, so to speak, but that is not the reason I wanted to see it. Reasons twofold: I've heard nothing but good things about this film and Michael Fassbender's fantastic performance of the sex-addicted businessman, Brandon and because I never found little Mikey attractive. THAT helped me stay objective.(Oh, and backing up a little bitspoiler alertthere's nothing LITTLE about Mikey. Damn, I can see he waited for the right project to show *him*self off.)And right project this indie film was. It was, indeed, a very well shot movie. It's titled: Shame, but I would've probably went with Pain. These characters in this movie center around pain and don't know what to do about it.It's not an all-around original idea, a group of main characters in misery, but the spin of sex-addiction, dependency, anti-dependency and infidelity juxtaposed with a fairly good script, fantastic cinematography and score, make this is must-see for film-lovers.Brandon's "perfect life" of wealth, position and a kickass apartment is highly disturbed from a female attempting to come back into his life. Naturally, we think this is an ex of his, but after awhile, it's his needy, self-absorbed and highly-dependant sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan.)Brandon was already on the edge due to his increasing need to either pleasure himself or others  all but 22½ hours a day, and when Sissy comes in to acquire a place to live, he spins further into the abyss.I'm not sure if there's really a message here. I've already stated this is about more pain than shame, but it might bring to light to some folks to realize there's more addictions out there than nicotine, alcohol or pain meds.For those who do NOT buy into the sex-addiction disease, you're a fool. Although this fictional movie shows one side, keep in mind you can be addicted to all kinds of things, or everything, and it is destructive. Learn what yours is, for we're all subject to this, and get help if you need to.Stepping off the pedal stool, this is a very good film, purposely slow and wonderfully shot. I loved the instrumental music, even the track also played in Hannibal. It's sad, yes, but mesmerizing at the same time. Recommended.Side Note: Aside from the lack of killings, strangely, this movie reminded me a lot of American Psycho and oddly made me want to watch Lost in Translation following. Not sure why. Perhaps I'm addicted to cinema and it's destroying me.
A "Plan B" was talked about in the movie, but the producers failed to come up with one when Escape Plan was released.Like the Grindhouse revival, Stallone has been trying to revive the 1980/1990s Action Heroes and with some success. Unfortunately here and while not a complete dud, he failed. Heck, had this been released in 1990, we would've said "eh," and now I look more forward to the Terminator sequel!Master escape planist Ray has hacked his way out of the most secured prisons around, but he met his match during his latest "outing." Without the aid from the outside and with the friendship with said Terminator, he might be able get out of this fine mess.Most of the films Stallone wants to bring back to the next gen have similar and thin plots, but the comedy and homage make them special. Sadly, no humor is found here, nor much homage. Just a bunch of set up, more talking and the less admirable clichés are overly used.Also, the movie "stars" 50 cent, which I wouldn't have recognized had I not recently saw him in Last Vegas. Mercifully for that movie, he was in it for about 50 seconds (or less.) In Escape Plan, he much more screen time and not only are those frames worth less than 2 quarters, but I sincerely hope I don't see him in any more movies.The rest of the secondary cast, Amy Ryan, Faran Tahir, Sam Neill and definitely Jim Caviezel were all so plain, lifeless and cardboard and without the fun irony/homage to the clichéd movies of decades past. None of them had fun here, nor did we.While not a waste, it wasn't worth the almost two hour running time just to get the two titans (Stallone/Schwarzenegger) together. It did have its moments, but not enough to avoid all together and just wait patiently for Expendables 3.* * * Final thoughts: 50 Centshut that mouth. I know you're in shock you're allowed to be in so many movies, but act like an actor, close your trap and take some classes before your next attempt.
oops, sorry, wrong movie.Actually, the appropriate title to the latest John McClane action film should've been Old Habits Die Hard.I'm not sure how a mere 97 minutes can feel like three hours, but A Good Day to Die Hard certainly accomplished that and very little else.Where should one begin with this mess? Besides making the previously weakest entry, Die Hard 2, look like a masterpiece, this film was so horribly shot, badly written and wasted a bunch of potentially great scenes of cars getting demolished with a cameraman who apparently had to pee  badly  the whole time.I wanted so much to give Bruce Willis credit as some of his lines were actually funny, especially when he's roundabout calling his son a wimp. But he looked so old and out of the game, he even went beyond the "I'm Getting Too Old For This Sh|t" played out routine.In the film, that reminded me of the terrible experience I had with Taken 2, the "story," if you can call it one, John McClane wastes his vacation in a foreign land while missing hundreds of opportunities for him to complain about getting lost or not following the ways of Russia. He's there for his son who's about to be indicted for something bad  eh, it's just a really weak setup for John's son to break out a very bad man with information to indict another bad man.With zero disregard of human life and property that the character John McClane showcases in the previous four installments, John follows his son, Jack and people after Jack by means of potential murder on the highway. When all characters are together, they must get bad man's "the file" and out of Russia.(Notice how I care so little about these characters to even name them? You'll care even less with villains so plain, dull and forgettable. Hell, they're probably listed that way in the script: "Bad Man #1 talks to Bad Man #2 on the cellular")Much like how the extremely enjoyable Halloween: H20 was followed by the dismal Halloween: Resurrection, A Good Day to Die Hard literally spit on the fantastic previous installment: Live Free or Die Hard. And that's sad. You never know when a series will end, and they should've left well-enough alone with part 4.Please do NOT make another one of these films. I promise to forget this ever existed and will even imagine John McClane dying hard of natural causes or a great white attack immediately following Live Free or Die Hard so that this just looks like a bad dream of son, Jack.
I sincerely took a chance on Serenity, for not only have I not seen the show, Firefly, I knew absolutely nothing the basic plot, the characters or anything tied to the short-lived TV series other than it's Sci-Fi and, well, that's it.This is an unfortunate side-effect of marketing, and eventually the movie, itself. For one, I study movies, even ones I've never seen or intend to. Eh, it's more of an obsession than hobby, so for me not to know one additional thing, other than the Sci-Fi aspect and it spawned from a then defunct cult-TV series, it's pretty poor advertising that was step one of the movie's weak box-office and viewings by the public. Not to mention, the name change from Firefly to Serenity couldn't have helped. Also, being a newcomer, I spent the better half of the movie trying hard to get to know the crew of the Serenity ship. It never appeared like this was made for ANYONE but those who are familiar with the show.Per shame. I almost gave up half-way through. And luckily, I didn'tit was about to get a whole lot better in the second half through to the end. For that, I am grateful I watched it.Like I said, once you get past who's who, what they do, why they do it, where they're fromhold on, this was a lot of work to "catch up" on a series 1/1000th the viewings of Star Trekand the somewhat corny lines  some worked, most didn't  you can finally relax and get into a decent story and a helluva lot of action.I don't want to seem like I'm completely criticizing the movie, for at the conclusion, it's not hard to see Serenity makes Star Wars look like an AGES 5-7 movie and Star Trek an unrealistic fantasy of the future. Despite the corniness that's spread throughout  I'm seeing Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Fillion) as a cross between James T. Kirk, Indiana Jones and Jack T. Colton (Romancing the Stone) thrown in for good measure  it's a pretty grown up Sci-Fi Action/Adventure that involves no aliens and multiple deaths, including ones you'd never suspect.Let's back up. A Sci-Fi Action/Adventure set in the far reaches of spaceand no aliens? Hallelujah! Not that I'm bashing Sci-Fi Alien films, I do like them, but what a refreshing and original take. RARELY will any filmmaker have the balls to reject the ancient alien-on-the-ship routines. And despite somewhat-plausible mutants and a psychic  River (Glau), it's one of the few realistic Sci-Fi movies ever. Bravo.SoIn the far-distant future of Earth-relocating into new worlds, we have this renegade group of thieves on a junk yard of a ship who take on a girl, River and her brother, doctor Simon (Maher) and inadvertently begin an adventure while A: trying to stay alive & hidden, B: solving a mystery and C: growing.I didn't really attach myself on any one character in the opening; I am a bit of a Trekkie, and since these are the anti-Enterprise crew members, I was very skeptical at first. The "C" from above is just one aspect that I really liked. The growth of everyone, but namely the Captain, was a wonderful addition. I mean, it was hard to like him, even when he tries to be coy with his one-liners. Doing the right thing is as foreign to him as the Alliance he so hates.And this Alliance does mimic a darker version of Star Trek's Federation meshed with "The Company" from the Alien films, so it's not exactly unique. No matter, what it lacks in originality, it makes up with a human, though he acts more like an android or Sith, in the form of The Operative (Ejiofor) who was one of the best aspects of the movie. He does "what he thinks best for the overall picture" despite being a self-proclaimed monster. Also, he wields a steal sword that I'm not quite sure if its homage to the lightsaber.As I said prior, I did almost give up  something I am known for doing .08% of the time  but I'm glad I didn't. The graphics were sublime, the fight sequences  namely from River  exciting and it had one large space battle that trumped Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith's opening scene. And that movie came out mere months before this one.While I did like the Episode III's opening  this one flew right past it. I think it has something to do with the realism and this scene/movie did NOT contain the tragedy of bad acting George Lucas demanded from his leads. Sure, Serenity had its share of unbearable jokes/lines, at least they left them out of this one scene (you'll know what I am talking about when you see the giant cloud in space) whereas Lucas felt fit in adding his signature toddler humor and acting while they shot Episode III's space battle opening.What can I say? I would suspect around 150 people actually saw this movie in the theatres, and I doubt more on DVD. I HIGHLY recommend this feature. Though not perfect, it's completely worth a viewing for any Sci-Fi buffs looking for a more grown-up space saga.
I'm presuming they don't care if people compare Splice to, I don't know, countless other movies. From Frankenstein to Re-Animator, from The Fly II to Species, from It's Alive to Jurassic ParkSplice just simply isn't original. Again, I'm sure they expected the typical critique of the spent idea and was hoping for audiences to look past it and concentrate on the story and characters.WAY unfortunately, I found the characters completely uninteresting and the story incredibly uninspiring and since the movie tries so hard and rests mostly on both Brody and Polley's shoulders, I expected more.I admit as much as I am a Polley fan (Go, Dawn of the Dead) I'm the exact opposite with Brody (King Kong, Predators.) In fact, I simply can't stand him. Now, that doesn't stop me from watching his movies and putting aside my distaste of him and his acting to watch his movies  I thought he was decent in Predators. Regrettably, he's back to his bland acting here and at times was unwatchable.Thank goodness for Polley, then right? I love her. I really do. Here, her character was so all over the place that I question if that was her fault. Here she's smart, here she's short-sighted, here she wants to be a mother and here is her unconvincingly 15-second background. You really couldn't side with her, nor hate her and worse, you could care less if she succeeds or not.Enough about themthe movie also rests on the shoulders of special effects. Not once did I NOT believe the creature both Elsa (Polley) or Clive (Brody) created existed. That takes a lot of talent and know-how. Sadly, it, or "Dren"  HA! it's Nerd spelled backwards, ah, hem  played mostly by Chanéac, was just plainboring. Yeah, yeah, I get the beeps or squeal she makes, but the bobbing of the head, the "learning," etc, was not only insipid but didn't hold my interest farther than if I studied goldfish for more than 3 minutes.So, I'll give them kudos for at least the special effects and also for the music and scoreother than that, there's simply not much more here. I didn't hate the age old story of a couple who want to experiment with splicing DNAs together to make blob monsters and into humansbut I certainly never want to see it again.I really can't recommend it. The story is all over the place, ideas begin and fizzle, the dialogue average at best, the emotions way below that. They were just going through the motions. SKIP IT.
Look, I'm just not going to spend too much time on this (mostly) piece of crap. Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult suffers many defeats, probably the first/foremost: The absence of the original ZAZ (Jim Abrahams, David & Jerry Zucker) creators who brought you the masterpiece Airplane!, the way above average The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! and the mostly funny Top Secret! Them, like the police chief in the first two Naked Gun's knew well enough to distance themselves.Sure, it defeats some comedy disasters: unbelievably, it gets better as the movie progresses. How much better? Well, start on the absolute cutting room floor and work your way up a few inches. So, there were a few, I'll admit, funny segments in the 2nd half to finale, but most fell flat. Such as "Where's Waldo"  REALLY?!?  and an actual "Beavis and Butt-Head" tribute? Gimme a break.I failed to mention to amount of homophobia in the previous two chapters. This one tops the other two threefold. Yeah, I get one was mocking The Crying Game  duh, but it's still not a pleasant thing to see, when it's this vicious and not simply funny.I'll quickly skim the plot: Jane (Presley) and Frank (Nielsen) are fighting and leaving each other..again. Frank is also leaving Police Squad behind, as all movie cops have to retire somewhere in the story line. And some bad guy in jail (Ward) plans a break out, with Frank's help in the slammer undercover and metal-wrapped to avoid gay-sex in the showers. Ha ha ha ha ha ha and ha. No, I'm really not laughing at prison "dropping the soap" jokes. Literally  they went there.Anyways, the target is the Academy Awards for no other reason to blow up the place because this movie won't come close to winning any awards.Now that it appears I've completely bashed this movie, I will say there are a few funny moments: Jane's exit from Frank  really hilarious as were the fake movies and presentations at the Oscars. There were a few tiny, tiny moments sprinkled, but NOT ENOUGH for a recommendation.Seriously, this movie, despite some moderately funny moments, felt eerily spliced together and most as an afterthought. Even the Oscar fake movies, as humorous as they were, seemed rushed. This movie gets no endorsement from me, and thank goodness this would be the last  mark my words: I guarantee neither Leslie Nielsen or George Kennedy will anytime soon be appearing in a fourth movie, much less any feature length film. And you can forget about O.J. Simpson  who hilariously plays a dumb and distracted cop here  once he's released, he'll undoubtedly do something else incriminating.
When you only like the car  barely, I might add  of a feature film, you know you're in for some trouble.If the terrible Remember Me or the wretched Twilight series isn't proof enough, Cosmopolis should seal the deal on how incredibly bad of an actor Robert Pattinson is. Keanu Reeves must've mentored him, because, lately, we're seeing a lot less of Reeves and more of Pattinson. Funny, years ago, I wished Keanu gone. Be careful for what you wish for, they say.I digress. This mess of a dialogue-only movie was so all over the place, so tedious, so dull, it should actually be studied for what NOT to do during a film class in college.Admittedly, I didn't understand all the whines and statements coming from these completely uninteresting and random characters, but I truly believe even if I had, I would hate their pompous statements all the more.Let's see if I can sum up this entire movie in one sentence: Some rich rat-man in a limo wants to go from point A to point Haircut in New York City via a souped up limo.Really, that's it. 109 minutes of him traveling to get a haircut. Yeah, yeah, he's bad mouthing people along the way, feeling sorry for himself, drinking and having sex, but that all seems incidental to getting his hair done. And  spoiler!  he doesn't even get all of his hair cut, just half of them! So, if you're super excited about watching Mr. Pattinson getting his hair done, sorry to disappoint!Some might say: well, that wasn't the point. To which, I reply: then what the hell was? It's clear the writer was trying to prove some rich equals poor statement or some plight of the big bad corporation leaders against the little guy. Yeah, I (somewhat) got it. I've just never seen it displayed in such an incomprehensive and shitty way.It has been a long time when I wanted a movie to be over so badly that I checked the time every 3 minutes or so until it was finished.Obviously, skip this ride. Take the subway in NYC. It's probably safer that way.
I honestly think the movie, Snakes on a Plane, was literally based around the line: "Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!" by Sam Jackson. They thought, probably in a pot-induced night, of Sam saying that and wrote the script around it.Either way, it worked. The marketing, the advertising, the repeat, um, businessthe line and the movie worked. Okay, to be honest, the line worked more than the movie.I always appreciate a movie, specifically a B-movie, that never takes itself too seriously and knows/shows exactly what it is. In this case, and of course: Sharknado, the title says it all. But, despite the premise and obvious B-movie fare here, the movie does tend to take itself just a tiny bit seriously and the pacing and length is way off.What starts off as a stereotypical action no-brainer, albeit fun film, the movie wastes a tremendous amount of screen-time on the no-name passengers on the plane. So much so, one gets enormously impatient for said snakes to invade the title plane. I was.But, the goods pay off and when the carnage starts, it's unapologetic in its B-Movie mindset.A witness to a murder from a very bad, bad man lands civilian Sean on a plane with Neville, a FBI agent. In order for him not to testify, and boy this is NO SPOILER: snakes are on the plane to bring it down. Deadly, aggressive and penis-chomping ones.Going into this movie to hate on it is like a Duck Dynasty fan getting offended after watching Brokeback Mountain. You gotta know what you're getting into and if you like Sam Jackson, even a tiny, tiny bit, you're gonna love him here. I did.* * * Final thoughts: I haven't seen this since it debuted in 2006. While I did like it, but not love it, I thought it did exactly what it set out to and so, I admired it for that. Not that I was ever planning to see it again, I did have to revisit it once I saw countless Sam Jackson memes this Christmas (2013) season that playfully and hilariously used his line after 7 years. I just had to see this again and even though I had the same reaction now as I did back in the mid-2000s, I wasn't displeased I did take this flight once more.
I know the sad truth that Tom Cruise isn't a box office draw and hasn't been for a good decade or so. It is sad because he consistently brings his A-game and above average films to the screen. Last year was the enjoyable Oblivion and before that, I thoroughly enjoyed his fourth Mission: Impossible film and romantic-action Knight and Day.Even with that said, I was hesitant  actually a tad more than that, on seeing Edge of Tomorrow, a movie that I already pegged as Groundhog Day 2: Source Codes and I thought he was stuck on the futuristic, heavy metal genre that I was getting tired of. Mercifully, a friend briefly tempted me to go see it with him and I abruptly made the correct choice to join him.Immediately into the feature, I felt Director Doug Liman's presence and was pleased. Of course, I am a huge fan of his films, mainly The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs. Smith and Go, but to me, even the best directors rarely hit home runs the majority of the time. Hereyeah, even with knowing the very basic concept of the film, I knew I was in a quality made film and one I would enjoy even when the "big reveal" came to fruition that was completely foretold in both the trailers and posters.And since it was not hidden, it's no spoiler for me to say, the film's about a cowardly, non-soldier military officer who keeps waking up the same day-before-battle (once he dies) only to attempt to both figure out why it's happening and how to deal with the literal day-in/day-out monotony. Luckily for him, he all-but immediately finds his biggest clue with super soldier, Rita, and together they'll work on the winless battle they are in against unfriendly alien invaders.The performances were pretty good, mainly with Emily Blunt as Rita, and I always favor Cruise in his films. The action was fun and the side jokes, or mostly one-liners from Cruise, were often hilarious. And as much as CGI, big Sci-Fi alien action and blow'em up! films aren't a draw for me, this one worked for me and reminded me of a much better version of The Matrix Revolutions.Now, the only real downsides were the unimaginative alien race (again, SEE: The Matrix films) and the script wasn't fully there yet. Normally, I would mark down on the initial and somewhat unoriginal concept, but this did its own take on that and added more than enough to get past my preliminary fears of seeing Groundhog Day/Source Code all over again.Overall, it's a definite recommendation with a largely fun, funny and enjoyable first two acts and a completely satisfying and refreshing conclusion  one we rarely see any more and I mostly yearn for. * * *Final thoughts: Once again, Liemax and 3D has disappointed me. First off, we all know, or should, that the majority of "IMAX" screens are mini-versions of the true IMAX experience. AMC is notorious for these. I accept that since there are only two (that I know of) true IMAX screens in the state I live in and the closest doesn't usually play motion pictures as well as it's kinda far. In the case of Edge of Tomorrow, it didn't even fit the full Liemax screen causing a hilarious, but disappointing, letterboxed version on the big screen. Secondary, the 3D was eh, as usual. I truly wish there was an alternative IMAX, ah-hem, even Liemax screen, that showed the 2D version. I could just go see them in the normal screen, but even with these problems, it's still slightly better than normal. My plea is that they show some standards and not settle for this mediocre attempt just to get a couple of extra dollars out of us. And, with the low box office so far  even on day 2 of release, hopefully, they'll try and do better because this is not encouraging me to give any positive word of mouth for the Liemax "experience."
Just 10 days shy of the 5-year anniversary of the limited release of World's Greatest Dad, Robin Williams' life ended eerily like his character's son did. This prompted my friend to watch this and request that I, too, see it and share my thoughts.I had never seen it, but wasn't opposed to seeing it  I do love Robin Williams all around and especially in his darker and deeper humor roles such as Insomnia and One Hour Photo. Boy, was I taken aback.Not by the subject matter or the potential idea placed in Williams' head, but because of how light they made of suicide, including unintentional suicide. I understand this is a dark comedy and certainly not meant as a laugh-out-loud riot, but it was actually painful how the "director/writer" (ha - Bobcat Goldthwait) all-but made fun of young kids who commit suicide.Backing up, the movie follows an unsuccessful writer/single father/teacher who's raising a definite problem child. Mean, cross, dumb, sexually frustrated and horribly homophobic this kid is, but the dad, Lance (Williams) isn't doing much to stop it. His own depression and self-pity is clearly sending his son on the wrong path. No real spoiler  it is the film's premise, one night the kid, Kyle, lost the battle on his (at least) second attempt at erotic asphyxiation and in probably the only selfless motion from the Lance, he makes it look like just a hanging in the closet to save his son some embarrassment. He even writes a suicide note using his own writing techniques.Sadly  well, less sadly than the loss of a son, things spiral out of control as the deceased brat becomes a hero throughout the school both he attended and Lance worked. Daddy now has to struggle with both the lies upon lies and the fact he's finally be recognized for his writing capability, albeit indirectly.The movie's obviously going somewhere and you know where. At least you know until the final WTF finale in which you get to see a fully nude, aging Williams skinny dip. I get why they did it, but it didn't help my disgust throughout the entire film where they basically make suicide a kind of a joke.The movie is riddled with very bad people and in fact, hardly contains a single soul you can attach yourself to. You have the brat of Kyle, the selfish father, the player teacher, the Sauvé, but deceitful other teacher, the blind principal, the abused and likes it only friend and the power hungry psychologist. So, even though this is that kind of movie that is not peppy, nor motivating, it is sadly disrespectable to make comedic light of kids killing themselves.UnlessI completely misinterpreted this movie and it's literally trying to make the darkest and most evil movie. Actually, I think I'm giving them too much credit. * * *Final thoughts: I miss Robin Williams. The day he passed, I was driving home from work and heard the news on our talk radio station; only, I came into the middle of the "breaking news" segment. For the longest of time, they spoke of someone huge who passed, but wouldn't say his name. Finally, they mentioned "And he loved San Francisco" and immediately, I thought: "Oh, my God. Robin Williams is dead."Finally, they confirmed it, and I took the rest of the night in deep sadness as if I'd lost a friend. I didn't want to watch a movie of his, because I was too shaken up from the loss of this absolute genius. Eventually, I broke down and put in Aladdin, a movie I hadn't seen in a least a decade. I sang and cried through that.Even here, in World's Greatest Dad, he was great. It's just too bad that the movie wasn't and hopefully this didn't officially make him think about suicide until it got too hard half a decade later.
OkayI admit itI'm not a huge Alien fan. Well, of the aliens, yesjust not the 1979 Ridley Scott movie: Alien (#1 of 4, so far.)This is how it went down: When I was a kid, I watched all and any horror I could get my hands on. Of course, mostly with the permission from my parents who wouldn't even let me watch Gremlins. Somehow Alien got past me and I must've watched the (far superior, I wouldn't know until much later) sequel Aliens a dozen or 50 times. So, I was kinda used to that one and loved the action and the multiple aliens.See? That was the problem. You sincerely backtrack by watching #2 first followed by the original. The movie is oneoftheslowestmovingpictures I've ever seen. And it only contained ONE alien (not counting the face-hugger or the eggs) that's only shown after a good hour or more passes AND then in only bursts of screen time.When you're a kid, this is un-scary and thoroughly unacceptable. Hence, I didn't care for it back then. What happens when you're an adult, as I am now? Yeah, same. I was unfrightened and bored for the most part.Lucky for the movie, the only real bad thing I observed was the pacing. The "one alien" concept, I accept, was necessary to show how threatening these things were. But also, in 1979 with budgets and such, I'm sure it was also the only thing they could do. (Thanks, James, for the sequel and confidence.)But, by God, the pacingtick tock. I'm shocked this wasn't directed by Michael Mann (Heat, The Insider, and Manhunter,) one of my least favorite directors for his inch-by-inch/minutes feel like hours story telling.Okay, I'll give it to the adults (it is rated R, so I assume  ha  that no one under 17 was admitted) in 1979 that this idea, though not entirely fresh  alien attacks were a 1950s staple duh, might have scared some people because, quite possibly, it was the first hard R gorefest involving an (not illegal, but space) alien with a budget.Also, the movie had excellent acting and rich characters with depth  I've been told, though not confirmed, that the cast didn't care for each other, but you wouldn't tell that here, an excellent score, gorgeous cinematography, fantastic sets and designs and introduced two of the best characters in cinema history: Ellen Ripley (Weaver) and of course the never-ending/hard-to-kill Alien.Up to the point of those last few praises, you'd think I hated the movie. Well, no, but it's nothing I ever want to revisit. I can appreciate all those wonderful qualities, plus, again, I loved the character of Ripley and the idea of the alienbut I can enjoy myself tenfold in the follow-up, Aliens.A quick rundown of the synopsis: hard working/middle class space miners are returning to Earth from deep space when "Mother," their ship's version of Hal 9000 or "Computer" (on the USS Enterprise, the NCC 1701 version, not the one where porn's shown freely) intercepts a "distress" call and commands the ship to investigate. The crew's awaken from their cryogenic sleep and are unhappy.Well, they will be soon when one is "impregnated" from a soft alien scorpion. (VERY) soon the full blown alien bursts, literally, onto the scene and it's up to the unprepared passengers to fight off the unwanted guest. Actually, they're more like cattle, until the unlikeliest (in 1979, that is) hero(ine) emerges, warding off both machine, man and beast. Talk about a bad wake up call.Again, the movie is very well crafted  this did elevate the same ole "alien" story with great special effects and we have to thank both Director Scott and Sigourney Weaver for creating such an awesome character in Ripley. But, get a Mountain Dew before watching or have the patience of a hungry tortoise who's a mile from food to get through to the end. Better yet, pop in Aliens. They'll give you the run down on this entire movie in a just a few brief minutes and then you can enjoy all the action, drive and horror the aliens can really produce.
When I was growing up, and let's just focus on the late 1980s and early 1990s, I scrambled and got thoroughly addicted tothe movies. I'd see anything, everything, on video or at the (because I poor) dollar theatre. The Fly II was one of those movies I experienced in 1989.Hell, because of my age, I hadn't seen the original just yet. I did know that I loved movies, specifically horror, and Eric Stoltz from one of my all-time favorite movies my sister introduced me to: Some Kind of Wonderful. So, as a kid, and with Eric and horror, naturally, I LOVED this movie.Well, it's been years, um, decades since I've seen this last. Like the Fly's Son, I've grown a bit. It's not the FANTASTIC movie I remembered, but still pretty damn good. Heck, it even has a great, though somewhat improbably and total 80/90s premiseThe (even though they changed the actress) "mother" Veronica Quaife from 1986's The Fly, gives birth while inadvertently dying herself, to a pod who becomes a fast-growing and hyper-intelligent child. Let's just say, by age five, the "boy/child" looks like Eric Stoltz. He "grows" up in a lab, but eventually works for the obviously evil corporation to complete his late dad's teleportation experiment.Well, like I said, he's super-smart, and he pieces together, by either brain or sight, what's going on around him, andit ain't pretty. Sooner, than much later, he's rapidly becoming the hybrid he originally was intended to become since his father was BrundleFly, a combination of the average and annoying house fly and, the sometimes as equally average and annoying house, human.The original movie proposed a solution and this movie explores that.While technically a low-brow, somewhat slowly paced and clichéd horror movie sequel of the late 80s and early-to-mid 90s, the idea of it, the acting by Stoltz, the exciting and thrilling climax and series-signature gruesome, albeit effective special effects, it's worth a watch. Of course, it's nowhere near the magnitude of the "original," but as a decent companion piece, it's recommended.* * * Final (3) thoughts: While the original had the line: "Be afraid. Be very afraid," I absolutely loved the line: "I'mgettingbetter," by Stoltz. To me, that was powerful. Oh, and it was also nice to see my favorite soap, Melrose Place's Daphne Zuniga again, even though this predated the nighttime show. And finally, John Getz, the only original cast member from the "original," i.e. not stock/deleted-resurrected footage, was absolutely hilarious in his role. I didn't really care for him in the 1986 film, but here he brought a lot to his role and the plot.
Despite the very unfortunate and clichéd title such as 'Manhunter,' it's sad this little tight suspense film didn't get more notoriety when it hit theatres in 1986. There are a lot of huge positives in reference to the book it's based on, 'Red Dragon' (why they changed the movie title escapes me.) For, they got the Will, Freddy, Reba and Francis characters down to the tee, especially and mainly Will (William Peterson). Tell me, this wasn't Peterson's audition tape for 'CSI.' They were all but one in the same people. Another thing they got right (and later, the remake 'Red Dragon' got horribly wrong) was the just snippets of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (along with the title change, they somehow managed to spell his name wrong. It's a wonder if they read the source material.) This isn't a 'Hannibal' film, though it introduces him and thankfully, author Harris saw something in Lecter as he's an enormously interesting character and spawned more books/movies specifically centered around him. The bad in this film is the deletion of some key plot points/characters, such as Francis's Grandmother and his trip to the museum. Sure, the movie can't go on forever, but like most of Mann's films, he wastes a lot of time with very SLOW moving, I suspect "tension building" scenes but in reality, it's just slow. The movie's horribly dated in action and music  and at times overbearing to the action on screen. And the ending was downright hilariously bad, terribly edited and psychedelic. So, that kinds of ruins any tension Mann slowed down shots might have raised. The plot revolves around retired FBI Will hunting a serial-family killer before the next full moon and the affects it has on him and his own family. Watchable, but just about average.Side note: I don't generally read/watch videos a lot about the movie prior to my review, such as quotes, trailers, other people's comments, trivia or goofs, so in order not to ruin my opinion. I'm sure the goof I will mention has been noted before. It was hilarious in the grocery store as the products behind Will & son continued to change as they stood still. Unfortunately that broke the tension it was attempting to build.Overall, I liked the movie  oodles better than the Edward Norton/Anthony Hopkins 'Red Dragon' version. I've read the book and loved how Peterson portrayed Will Graham. He was quiet, thoughtful, and powerful even in his silence whereas Norton was loud, dumb and spoke way too much. He also looked years younger than the character he was supposed to be. Joan Allen was perfect, and it was creepy as she had to sit there and "not watch" the home videos. Finally, Noonan was one hundred times scarier than Fiennes. Seriously, who wouldn't be scared of 6'7" man vs. someone, what, 5'11" on heels?
Beautifully shot in downtown Chicago, The Negotiator is one of my all-time favorite movies. Excellent dialogue, great acting, suspense and tight shots/twists make this a must-see for all movie-lovers.And to top it off, it starts two of my favorite actors of all time: Spacey and Jackson, even though Spacey doesn't show up until a third of the movie is over.That's okay, because after watching this, probably a dozen or so times, I always get completely enthralled in the suspenseful and gripping opening third and then, even when the movie's already near-perfect, in comes Spacey to add so much to the story. And he was absolutely perfect. His demeanor, smirks, dialogue, command and scene-stealing make this repeat viewing movie a joy each and every time.This is not to take away from the other cast members, namely the always wonderful Jackson, who, once again, adds so much depth to a troubled man put into extraordinary circumstances.After an example of expert hostage negotiator Danny (Jackson) in action of taking down a horrible person who put his child in danger, he learns of a corruption/conspiracy to rob the cop's retirement fund. Without much time to digest the information, he is framed for his own partner's murder. With only his wife on his side, he takes his accusers hostage easily since he knows all the tactics and "rules of engagement." He's a quick thinker and appoints Chris (Spacey) as his own personal negotiator who's immediately puzzled on how Danny's own "friends, coworkers and cops" want Danny to fail despite the efforts Danny takes to prove his innocence. From there, the onion peels to the conspiracy and who's involved and who will survive this ordeal to prove Danny's innocence.Say what you will about this movie, its length or it's A-B-C mystery solved, it was a tight, suspenseful, original and extremely well acted and wonderfully written. Every few years, I revisit this movie and the lovely part, is I always seem to forget which of the cops on screen are involved and who's just trying to do their job.I especially love the Chicago shots (one of my favorite cities) and the interaction, whether by phone or in-person, between two of the screen's legends: Spacey and Jackson. Whether or not this could really happen, I get lost in the fictional story and root for Danny and Chris who's caught so much in the middle. Spacey really shines and this smaller role for him should show his genius and fun he has in the movies. This is an absolute must see.
Ah, now with the 3rd and 4th actors playing the monster Hannibal Lecter, hopefully they can put this series to rest. And with the final two in the series 'Red Dragon' and this one 'Hannibal Rising,' both completely underachieving, perhaps they will. This 'Rising,' this prequel to the legend Hannibal becomes, is all over the place. Though it mainly wraps itself around revenge  something he barely seeks in the later years, it's about WWII, killing Jews, interracial/family "affairs," training, homicidal families (don't just watch your back around Hannibal!), school and war criminals. Not to spoil too much, but Hannibal seeks revenge on the men responsible for murdering and eating his younger sister and a dutiful cop is completely and utterly onto him. It almost seems like everyone knows he did it, yet, later in life, this is all forgotten, forgiven and he makes a huge name for himself as a world-known doctor. I'm not sure how no one bothered to look up his background, but then, its fiction. I believe the main problem is that it wants to be too many movies in one, but there are other problems as well. The older actor, #4 Hannibal, tries and is enormously unsuccessful at mimicking the #2 Hannibal played by Hopkins. The other major problem is the consistent, and utterly annoying after awhile, flashbacks. They start the movie as a WWII film, and end that segment with young Hannibal and his sister in a house with very bad men. Skip to, uh, "present day" Hannibal in an orphanage. They spend the rest of the movie filling in the blanks on how he escaped when they could've saved so much time by just showing immediately what happened when it happened. This wasn't the weakest link, but it is easily skipable.
What a violent, horrible, gruesome, pointless and definitely vile movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 was. I can't even increase this mess above 1 star even with the somewhat creativity in the sets and the change of ideas/scenery from part one. I won't allow any leniency to this piece of TRASH.Anyone that complains about the poor quality (including myself) of the Friday the 13th or Halloween sequels should know this takes the prize in rapid decent in quality. Sure, the movie's based on violence and the acts of the stupid (cannibalism is one thing, eating your own flesh from a hanger is just plaindumb), but beyond the blood, there's absolutely nothing. This movie is just stupid and completely evil. And I am not referring to the characters.The plot involves the family moving across Texas to wreck havoc and collecting bodies to producechili. Originally, when I was younger and saw this for the first time, this grossed me out. Perhaps, I've become immune, but this viewing just made it look silly.Anyways, a radio disc jockey (Williams) hears a killing and is persuaded by a renegade officer, "Lefty" (Hopper) to continuously replay the killing on tape on her show to draw out the bad family. It works! But to the near death of said radio employee.She's quickly introduced to the family of saws and it's up to chainsaw wielding Lefty to take down the family in an underground fantasy land.Seriously, this movie, this turd, is so full of plot holes, so full of stench it should never have been made. I only forced myself to complete the movie (I don't write reviews on uncompleted viewings of movies I watch) so I can report people need to stay away from this. I cannot believe the director of the classic original returned to direct this.There is absolutely no reason to watch this. Even if you're into this sadistic genre, there's hundreds of other films to check out. Ones with plot, acting, somewhat good dialogue, character explorationthis movie contains none of those. SKIPit's not even for the curious.
When I was young, I was not allowed to watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off in fear I would "get ideas" on how to skip school. Thank God my parents didn't allow me to watch The Boys in the Band or I might get ideas on how to become gay. (Sorry, old reference  1970, but Brokeback Mountain wasn't around when I was a child.)Too bad. For me, that is. This movie is as near a comedic masterpiece as one can come upon. Perhaps I would've been a better writer, or told better jokes had I been subjected to such genius.Ferris Bueller, genius? Why, yes. Originality? Check. Jokes that hold up and a script almost 99% timeless? Check. Relevance, drama mixed with comedy, convincing and believable acting? Check, check, check. Wow, that's starting to sound like "Bueller, Bueller, Bueller"Speaking of which, and this may be just my opinion, but this is one of the most quotable movies, next to Office Space that would come out 13 years following. I, myself, have been single-handedly quoting this movie since I saw it for the first time 20 years ago. And surprisingly, I haven't even seen this movie since then, not once, but I can still quote the film almost verbatim. (Though I got the Kristy Swanson "Um, he's sick" line mostly right, I sure as heck toned down on how long she rambles. And, I completely blew the "Cubs/Bears" bar line. But then, it was something I probably didn't catch before  I had no idea the Chicago Bears weren't a baseball team. Ha. I hated sports back then.)And now, watching it for the first time in two decades  now with critique eyes, I have to make the statement: this is as close to perfect as a comedy, er, make that, any movie, as one can achieve. The only things holding it back from being flawless, well, thing, is probably the pacing, but that's only slightly a problem in the third act and boy things get back on track for the finale.I found myself laughing out loud, rooting for our "heroes," shaking my fist at the evil principal, singing along with the fantastic soundtrack, mourning with Cameron and getting so pumped at the climax, I just wanted to start from the beginning to watch it all over again. These statements are very rare coming from me and gave me a deeper appreciation for this film than I ever have before.If anyone hasn't seen this classic tale of high school rebellion, allow me to elaborate on the synopsis: young Ferris (Broderick) is trying to enjoy every day as if it were his last, and he does this by skipping school and dragging his best friend, Cameron (Ruck) and girlfriend, Sloane (Sara), along with him.This will be his ninth (or second?) absence this senior year of high school so he wants "to make it count." He fools his parents, disturbs his jealous sister, Jeanie (Grey) and irritates his principal, Ed Rooney (Jones) enough to make it his mission to catch Ferris in the act of ditching school.Along the way, kids (and adults alike) root for Ferris to feel better (SEE: the now debunked ska band, Save Ferris), the threesome have zany and close-call adventures in the downtown Chicago area and learn about their lives, future and how to further avoid being caught.Will Ferris get back home so his parents don't realize he faked a sickness to avoid school? Will Cameron deal with his dad who loves his car more than life (or son) itself? Will Sloane get the proposal she desperately wants while dealing with the fake death of her grandmother?If you have not seen this, you MUST. Without (re)watching and reviewing all of late Director Hughes movies, it's tough not to put this absolutely excellent and all-but timeless film in the top 2-3 spots of his films. Oh, and by the way, it's almost timelessI honestly can't see too many things that would have prevented this from appearing fresh, even after it being released 24 years ago. Caller ID, maybe?
(Contains semi-spoilers, but damn  it's been out for 33 years. That said, this is my VERY FIRST viewing and if it's yours, read this following the conclusion of the relatively short film)Wait, this was, in fact, set in the future! When Mel does go 'Mad'!Actually, that's part of the problem, of many, that is, I had with Mad Maxand I mean *I* was the one with this singular problem: I thought this futuristic film was a post-apocalyptic tale and I looked for evidence of that for about 70-80% until I finally realized, it's just in the future.That's my bad. But, honestly, I try NOT to do much research prior to movie and the post-WWIII storyline I've heard about, is in the sequels. (Frankly, I don't even know that's 100% accurate, because again, I don't read about a film or background until I've been through the product itself.)I digress; this severe GRINDHOUSE/Horror movie (?) feature was so all over the place, I honestly had even further troubles keeping up. What I gathered is: this is the dim future, and I mean dim as in they had almost zero budget, or spent what they had on the demolition of ugly cars, and a gang of partially gay bikers are unruly and cops, for the most part, are highly inadequate to thwart their selfish habits, let alone keep the roads safe.After countless scenes of randomness, we get to what I'm assuming is the theme, and all in the final 15 minutes of the movie (yes, it took that long): Cop or not but surely semi-mad, Max's family is killed and he seeks revenge. Yes, even their infant who seems to vanish and reappear in the storyline at will. Too bad the one-year-old didn't go on another holiday right before the killing.Sure, I get the point of each event leading up to the climax is showing reasons why Max should be, in fact, mad, but you'll be more distracted with a grandiose and overbearing score, over-the-top Bmovie qualities including filmmaking, dialogue and acting and oddly satisfying cinematography  if you like clouds and empty roads. Oh, and you also might notice the number of gays here, or maybe not. Guys licking ice cream off his buddy's face or a "Police Sergeant" (?) who frolics shirtless with a scarf and waters plants, might make this the most homoerotic future road movie I've seen.You know, if they spent more time on the script, than fixing cars and motorcycles that will inevitably end up on the side of the roads while the drivers are thrown two states over, they might have had a real movie here.Finally, obviously fast-forwarding decades, it's proved that Mel can act mad or crazy, inside or out of film. Why then, does he give the tamest performance of his career in a movie called MAD MAX?Ha, I kid; he had years to mold his anger management problems into complete insanity.Side Note: Damn, those EYES on the big baddie, Toecutter, BEFORE he met his doom were really freaky. I can see (ha) if his eyes bulging out due to the impact, but no he's just anticipating a unpleasant demise.Side Note II: I'm curious if 3-years later, the writers of a famous TV show starring a car named K.I.T.T., would make sure the title included a 'K' to separate itself as far away from the character in this movie whose name, Nightrider, was repeated dozens of times before, but mostly after, his death.
Since my second job of buying lottery tickets isn't paying off, I've decided to make my first million by means of a webcam. It seems easy enough: Film a boring house with a boring family for about 90 minutes, label different scenes as Day 1-30 and make sure my buddy opens/slams doors and drops items (by means of cheap fishing wire) in the background while I scream on mic: "What was thaaaaaat? Oh myyyyy goooood!"Thanks Hollywood; you've made my rich dreams come true. You've proved you don't need millions to make millions. I can make a movie like Paranormal Activity 3 (1/5 Stars) just for the price of the webcam. Maybe even less. I guess I could return the webcam since the entire movie can be made in less than two hours and my buddy could be an intern. HmmmOkay, I'll be serious. These movies, these chores to get through, should come with the disclaimer: "ONLY If You Believe in Real-Life Paranormal Activities, You Will Be Frightened. As For Sane People, We Apologize for the Inconvenience of the Next 90 Minutes."But even that statement won't hold up much. For, these movies aren't even trying to make you believe they actually happened. So, you'll get a fictional movie (pick one: Paranormal Activity 1, 2 OR 3, they're all EXACTLY SAME MOVIE) and for about 90 minutes, you'll have roughly 1-2 minutes of something happening or changing in the background. Wow, you devoted fans have a shitload more patience than me!Look, yeah, I don't fall under the "Believe in Ghosts" mentality, but truthfully, in a rage when I got home, I said: "Bloody Mary" 3x in the mirror  as instructed in the movie  just to end it. Miserably, I guess I didn't believe enough because nothing happened to finish off my pain.Worst of all, since I was so incredibly bored, I didn't laugh (AT the movie, mind you) as much during this third installment as I did the first two. Okay, okay, I admit, the ghost acting like a ghost, i.e. wearing the traditional white sheet  that was flipping hilarious!  and the ending, which seemed like 4 hours to get to, made me laugh hard. Especially when the emotionless, dull and trite Step-Dad gets bent backwards to death. Yeah, there, I spoiled it. Maybe I did you a favor.Don't worry; the movie is as scary as a kid by a campfire holding a flashlight under his chin. At least when he tells this dud of a tale, he probably can sum up the entire movie in less than 5 minutes. Really, there's not much more story here to restate.Wake up, America! We're losing the war on terrible movies every time you put even a buck into these terrorist's, er, director's pockets.(Waitwhy were there two directors for this again? Oh! So each can point the blame finger at each other when people finally realize the idiocracy portrayed here.)
Quick Review: 'Rango' was mercilessly NOT set in 3D. I don't have a big problem with the brought-back format, but C'mon alreadyit's still just a gimmick. At any rate, 'Rango' relishes in homage to the past Westerns  though it's not technically a Western (too much of a spoiler on why not)  and even then, it's story is really, really old. That said, visually, it's stunning, its attention to detail is that of Pixar-quality, it's hilarious at times and a recommendation for all despite it's too-long running time. Oh, and in spite of the fact it voices one of my all time favorite actors, Timothy Olyphant, they really should've got the real-deal in that great scene. It's a SEE IT. 4/5 Stars.
Not since M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening has there been such an unintentionally hilarious and horribly constructed movie starring Mark Wahlberg. Perhaps M. Night should've directed this, as well. At least, I there would be more laughs to be had.In one of the most wretched series that began with one of my all-time least favorite films, it's hard for me to admit: Transformers: Age of Extinction might actually be worse than any of the previous three. Aside from this movie making me actually feel stupid and wishing I made a better choice with my life for the nearly three hours of torture I endured as some kind of sick, self-punishment, the movie had terrible dialogue, laughable characters, thoughtless acting, comical slow-mo, head-rolling toddler jokes, unintentionally hilarious shots, lazy special effects, inept direction, stupid human stories, an incoherent script that should put the writer on death row and the most atrocious editing I've ever seen in a movie.Other than the aforementioned main problems, it would take way longer than the horror this was to nitpick the hundreds of more things wrong with this. Suffice to say, this movie feels like everyone involved was either legally obligated to make a part four or they had guns pointed at their head to make this trash. One way or another, zero people put their heart into any of this.Plot synopsis: None. There is no plot. Fine. Chicago was destroyed in the boring last chapter, all alien Transformers are hunted and some Transformers want to kidnap others, some want to destroy and some want out. Much like us.Look, Transformers 1 killed my childhood. I grew up on Transformers and aside from the alien names and the movie's title, they changed practically every single other thing about my toys, cartoons and comic books I worshiped as a kid. Unbelievably, I have to actually rate this lower than that terrible first installment. Oh, in case you were wondering, parts 2 and 3 were 100% terrible as well, but this is people not even giving a sh|t anymore. Even the people behind all these Transformers movies just don't careabout improving the series or any sort of quality in movie-making. Okay, fine, that all said, you have to give it up to Bay: he's nothing but consistent. These movies go on for far too long and each with an hour climax that, by the time it shows up we're so uninterested and uninvested, the finale is just plain boring. I barely even pay any attention to all the carnage. In this film, however, it is rather amusing that one of the many, many villains, Galvatron, keeps asking all the other males to help him find his seed. Not sure if that was intentional, but still funny.Consider my warning: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It doesn't even fit in the "so bad, it's good" category. It fits in the "two-hours, forty-five minutes you'll never get back" league.* * *Final thoughts: Was Bay mocking America? Was there a reason every single American flag ever made was in this and shown at super-slo-mo as if that would make me forget I was watching one of the worst movies ever made that had nothing to do with protecting or serving U.S.A.? In a movie that's bent on stupidity-overkill, these excessive "patriotic" gestures had the reverse effect on me and made me feel this was more anti-American than pro. Shame on you Bay. Leave the country and never direct a movie again!
Did you know the Lethal Weapon franchise was mostly ad-libbed, or improvised? And guess what? THEY GOT IT RIGHT. Okay, 3 out of 4 movies, but still. That's better than The Other Guys going 0 for 1.Pardon me, but this movie was just plain painful to watch. It was as if they had a bunch of one-liners and "ideas" for jokes, then started shooting the movie until about 75% of the film was completed and then thought: Oh, sh|t, we forgot to throw a plot in.Well, they looked like they were having a party  they certainly invited fifty of their closest Hollywood friends for cameos  too bad we weren't.I'll admit, some of the jokes worked and I smirked a few times, but for the most part, the jokes were forced and the so-called "gags" went on for far too long. (Yeah, I get it: Gamble (Ferrell) has a pretty wife and he treats her like she's a horse. And speaking of which, STOP BEATING THAT DEAD HORSE! Damn, after fifteen minutes of that, move on!You'll know you're watching just slapstick and you'll know to leave your brain at the door when the movie opens with the most expensive gag in the disguise of a police chase in downtown NYC. Supercops Highsmith (Jackson) and Danson (Johnson) destroy everything in their path with little regard to property, rights or humans. Again, this is slapstick, so they're considered heroes.UNTILthey (not really a spoiler) perish and it's up to "the other guys" Gamble and Hoitz (Wahlberg), those wacky and goofy and excruciatingly unfunny odd-couple of cops, to take the lead. But, their chief (Keaton) doesn't have much faith in them. And they don't do much to prove their worth.Nowtake that concept of them acting all wacky and goofy and excruciatingly unfunny for about another hour (feels like three) and then get to what the movie's about: Redemption, I guess. They lost me when they finally got to what their mission is. And let me spoil it, a bit: it's about corporate greed! The same thing that's going on for, well, quite a while now.And if you're not up to date, make sure you stick around for the credits for a liberal message on the wrong-doings of the CEOs, Government, etc.Blah, blah. This movie made me miss Riggs and Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon) and Lee and Carter (Rush Hour) SOOOO badly. It wasn't the worst movie I've seen in this terrible year of 2010, but it certainly proved One Liners and Will Ferrell both need to stick to Saturday Night Live. At least those skits are over and done within about five minutes and not making us suffer about a hundred more on the same one note.
I admit: I cheated.In my defense, I tried to watch the 2005 remake, House of Wax, 2 times prior to finally getting past the 30 minute mark with use of Rifftrax (MST3k  the update.) Though, it wasn't the funniest Rifftrax track I've heard, it still made this horrible "Wrong-Turn" movie bearable.And I don't think it's just my prejudice against Paris Hilton  even with the knowledge of one of the biggest marketing/spoiler in history, so much so they made window advertisements and even tee-shirts that read: "SEE Paris DIE," it was still hard to watch this crap.I was right. It wasn't just Paris buying it  and I'm not talking about publicity. The movie's 113 minutes (too) longprobably 25-30 minutes too long. If you're a Jason Voorhees fan, this is what it resembles: Friday the 13th (the original) didn't (technically) contain Jason, but part II does. House of Wax was those two movies; it makes you wait through one solid movie to finally get to the "goods."But, it's not about the horrid pacing, or length, it's just another "Wrong-Turn" clone: younglings wander off the beaten path to save time, obviously not lives, to get to ____ (insert party time activity.) In this case, a football game. Well after pissing off the obligatory hillbilly, they rest in the middle of nowhere despite a horrid smell  which was barely explained.Two make it to an eerie small town  is there any other kind in these backwoods movies?  while the rest attempt to make the game. Too bad for them! Traffic is so bad, they decide to put themselves back in the same original locale, or in harm's way.Here's the most unbelievable part (not really): they get picked off one by one by a -gasp- deranged, disfigured and masked killed until the obvious survive. Throw in some boring tension between (hot) Chad Michael Murray's Nick and his captured sister, Carly (24's Elisha Cuthbert), every character urinating roughly every 20 minutes (if you're into that sort of thing, girls peeing or guys pissing together, then this movie's for you!), unnecessary subplot of Paige (Paris  really, did they plan that too (stupid of) a similar name out for her?) being pregnant and brothers who try and appease a dead mother by turning the whole town into waxed still-zombies, and you have the rest of the movie.This movie is so long and contains very few surprises for anyone who's seen any "Wrong-Turn" film before, such as: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003, or the original), The Hills Have Eyes (again, remake or original, sequel or not), House of 1000 Corpses, Severance, Psycho, or Wrong Turn (duh.) Actually, there's probably dozens of more examples, but these are the only ones that came to mind.I will say it was effective in two scenes: The finale's (obvious, but still "fun") melt down and the "finger" incident, which I didn't actually expect. Are those two (15-combined-minute) scenes worth the whole  sometimes, but rarely gory  trip to the wax museum? Nope. Even when you add Paris dying or the mediocre Rifftrax commentary, it's still not worth it. Stick with the better recommended movies of this horror niche genre, mentioned above.
Well, I don't want to give any real spoilers (heck, it practically spoils itself) but 'Horsemen' sadly is an unfinished movie, like an exciting auto chase in the middle of a film and without warning the good guy swerves off an unseen cliff and the film's over.Speaking of spoilers, all the way through this, about four scenes before something happens, I kept thinking, "Oh, he's this" or "He'll discover this" or "The killer is" Despite the fact I thought the movie was well shot, the locales made the most of the depressing city it portrays and Quaid did an above-average job, as he almost always does, the movie was very flat, (again) predictable and too clichéd.We have a recently single parent who's putting his job (law enforcement) in front of his two boys. We have a detective that visits an "oh, I'm smarter than you" criminal in jail for clues to his case. We have torture porn. All of these are very familiar stomping grounds.Unfortunately, when it's revealed (well fully, all the clues are spewed from minute one) why the bad things are happening, it's so off-center and contradictory (There are no four horsemen! There's thousands! And when the four horsemen comewhat?)I think there was a great movie here, if they had finished it. Perhaps another 2-3 rewrites and it would have been more eerie. Basically the movie's about a detective bent on finding a killer or killers in so-called random murders, with clues left behind, before the next person dies! I can barely write that without laughing. Go watch (or re-watch) 'Seven.'Side note: I'm surprised I didn't get the phrase "Come and See" before Quaid's character did; I've heard it before listening to one of my favorite songs more than a dozen times: Johnny Cash's 'The Man Comes Around.' I first heard that song during the opening credits of the much better movie: 'Dawn of the Dead' (remake.) Yes, I know the original reference, but I haven't read that verse as many times as I had heard the song.
What is there to say from a series of a series of fall-down, show penis, hurt oneself clips by the time you hit part three? I dunno. This is the only experience I've had to see a whole movie, much less actual TV episode of the Jackass franchise. But I can tell of my first encounter in Johnny Knoxville's world that this is just another day out of the office.Jackass 3D's only attribute, as far as I can tell through poo, is that it was filmed in just that: 3D. Now, I didn't see it in the third dimension, but I doubt that really added to the already infamous group of below-the-belt (literally) nitwits.Admittedly, I laughed at some scenes. Such as the plane's exhausted power (ALL BUT the already tired skit of "Is it real or is it Memorex" part  I mean, really, that's like doing a spoof of Brokeback Mountaintry to keep it up to date, guys) or the midgets in the bar or Johnny doing the dance when the buffalo roamed. And the soundtrack was good  seriously, it introduced me to a (now) 40-year-old song: "Brand New Key" by Melanie, that I really liked.That all saidand believe me when I say, I'm a newcomer to all this, despite seeing various skits from time to timemost of the stunts looked sooo staged. Some people were puking before any action or SMELL happened. Or laughing hard before the target was humiliated.I understand that it was a difficult task of filming these stunts (you should NEVER EVER EVER try ANYWHERE) for 3D, but aren't we supposed to have the slightest belief these are truer than the established fake reality shows on TV? Okay. Fine. Leave your brain at the door and be prepared to look away from the screen from time to time, such as if you're offended by male nudity  uh, that's one of the only reasons I watched this, hardy har har  or people needlessly having their teeth pulled or their excess (body fatted) sweet drunk.Even though it's mindless fun at points, if you're not into (very soon to be or by-now) middle-aged men doing stupid stuff for a buck, there's absolutely no reason (ZERO, actually) to see this, other than witnessing Seann William Scott before he checked into rehab. Otherwise, have a good time at watching America once again humiliate itself, much like Jersey Shore did on a weekly basis.
Waitdid I just watch a Michael Bay movie? You know, ALL CGI, easily forgotten, no story, characterizations and reads line-by-line from the chapters of: The Book of Eternal Clichés?Despite my low rating for Battle: Los Angeles, it truly wasn't the worst "action" or "war" or even "alien" movie I've seen. Heck, its oodles better than the extremely similar Skyline. And still, again, it's just as forgettable as your breath in cold weather.And that's sad. They put a lot of effort into this. They took this 'war against aliens' plot/movie veeery seriously. But, not enough to hire a writer to make this as enjoyable as the 150% better Aliens.What do we have here? A fantastic actor, Aaron Eckhart (c'mon, he was great in Erin Brockovich and In the Company of Men) who plays Sergeant Michael Nantz wants to quit the forceone day too early! Apparently, aliens want to take over the world, and use our water for energy. Only if we had that idea, you oil-diggers.Anyways, that's the plot. Well, fine, okay add in a lot of gunpowder and firearms and 1,007 clichéd lines and "hopes" and you have the rest of the film. Even if you didn't (for some strange reason) like Independence Day, you'll still disappointed that very little here is explored outside a shaky-CAM. Just as an example, the Blair-Witch-Held-CAM is so vibrant that when characters are motionless, they're still being shaken up by the audience's POV.Again, I didn't hate this mess of an "experiment" but I was so uninvolved in it, that I wonder why they had such a budget and never asked why it was important to have character depth  i.e. people we CARE ABOUT, or some kind of an original plot. Seriously, Hollywood, watch an actual war movie or an alien film  starring Sigourney Weaver, of course, and find out what really works. Don't just blow stuff up with "Portal 2" figures running around in the background and expect the audience to side with our "heroes."Skip it. Literally, it's not the absolute worst, but it's never something you'd wanna write home about if you're in the military.
I feel like I need to drain this pool of Piranha as soon as I can.During Oscar time, or pretty much "The December Push," is an award-movie overkill to a lot of critics. They see a ton of well-made, praise-worthy films and hence, the movie dumping ground, or January, is a refreshing time to relax and watch LEAVE YOUR BRAIN AT THE DOOR features.Well, the opposite is true as well. Once you see multiples, or even one horrible movie, like Piranha 3DD, you want to cleanse your palette with a higher class film. After this terrible sequel, I'm ready for a "freaking Gone With the Wind" quality of film.** - Thank you, Parker Posey or "Kitty," for that quote I needed from Superman Returns. It fit nicely.I was excited. I loved the first Bmovie, Piranha 3D. No exaggeration on the word "loved." I saw it opening night, when many didn't. I bought the BluRay. And I've seen it probably six times on both DVD and BluRay.The sequel, or 3DD, started off fairly well. It had a very decent Final-Destination-type news reel explaining the previous film's onslaught of prehistoric and deadly piranha in the fictionally named "Lake Victoria" (or, really, Lake Havasu, AZ) and if this could happen again. Following, there were awesome throw-backs to the 1970/1980s WHEN ANIMALS ATTACK films, that I cherish, with some unsuspecting young adults that were picked off one-by-one by the killer fish. And in a few unique ways.In addition, they were giving the audience  way in abundance  what they were expecting: a ton of water, a reasonable amount of pretty girls and, of course, countless breasts and more.Well, that was all the way to about the 20th minute of 83. From there, sadly, it went straight down the drain and in a hurry with countless missed opportunities.One MTV-Girl/semi-owner of a water park near the original's movie onslaught of prehistoric piranha attacks discovers that these creatures, for some odd reason, are attracted to chlorine in her swimming pools and all-but whimpers: "Oh, I guess, shucks, something's gotta be done."As with most WHEN ANIMALS ATTACK films of decades past, namely Jaws II, a new resort is just opening and they're gambling a tremendous amount of money to open an (in this case) adult theme water park in the shadow of the previous installment's (animal induced) terrorist attack. There's no difference here, in Piranha 3DD. Except, they left all the fun, originality and spark on the beach and not in the water.I know what you're thinking. This movie is "silly fun." A "guilty pleasure" in the making. A movie NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. Well, let me assure you: This is beyond the definition of Bmovie. This is beyond BAD.It's sad, as well. As stated, it did start off promising, but once someone was aware of the creatures, once a character had stomach pains because, well, she had one more egg in her than what she was born with, it didn't just get silly, it got incohesive. It got random. It became aimless, fell apart, felt rushed and had absolutely no clue where it wanted to land in the end. Hell, after the incredibly low body count compared to the first one, the end credits of space-filler outtakes wasn't even a grand finale of minimal success they were shooting for.Most surprisingly, despite the advertisements, it was actually doubling the negative D's in anything in regards to carnage or gore. Sure, it still had its moments, but probably contained a third or less of the bloody and gruesomeness of the first feature.And speaking of advertisements, I do have to note, and YEAH, I'm GOING TO SPOIL THIS  because I care so little of this feature, I'm glad they did trick me in the previews. The one scene in the trailer I couldn't buy was the girl taking the bath and a miniature piranha filtering out through the faucet. Well, mercifully, that was just a dream of the girl. I originally thought, that was damn silly, but then, so is the movie. Thankfully, as completely implausible as that is  in addition to everything else  they rightfully stated that could NOT happen, no matter the faux-pas rules they laid forth.Look, listen: I wanted to support this movie. I wanted to stand behind it and was ready to. I believe, while the first film was candid with its convictions of honesty of being a genuine Bmovie, this one was confused on where it wanted to stand and the lack of a well-balanced script was its downfall. During the last two-thirds, or the majority of the feature, it was all-over-the-place in absurdity and never remembered what made the original so brilliant. The danger was gone, the humor lost and even contained way too many slo-mo scenes for "laughs" which were neither funny or imaginative. Heck, even the girls (or guys) all looked like they were found on the street, not the eye candy these movies generate, as the first one got correct.IF ONLY the first third of this movie was a "deleted scene" on Piranha 3D's BluRay, we could have a nice closure and not waste any time during one of the worst final half's of any movie I've seen.Needless to say: SKIP THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE! There was a reason it was barely released in theatres this weekend: if it was a wide release, it would proved the (human) terrorists actually did win.
But, it took to the final few frames.The Spectacular Now certainly wanted to be more than it was. While interesting, well paced, well made, well acted and kept the viewer going, it was uneven at spots, unsure of itself and took way too long to teach the lesson it wanted you to know.I always love Miles Teller. He has this confidence and modesty, this humor and humble attitude with each role he takes on. He's high up and yet grounded, he's the coolest kid and still relatable. Some might see that he's the same in every role, but I disagree to a degree. He does have a bit of range and I think he'll only extend those lines with his future.Here, he plays a sexually active, hard-drinking and laid way back high schooler who gets dumped by someone he fancied more than most girls and rebounds instantly with a less popular, more down to earth, but gorgeous inside young lady.Tellet plays Sutter, someone who struggles but doesn't know why. He's confident, yet wonders how he is. He moves forward but feels stuck. Aimee, his new girlfriend, has many layers and is someone we should all know. And yet, Sutter might be plotting something, he might be messing with her, using her or he might actually need her.While the movie has the indie feel, the urge to give us what we always watch these low-key high school romances for, it felt more real and true than a lot of the same genre I've witnessed. And while I struggled to get the "higher meaning" and WOW moment throughout, it wasn't until the final couple of shots that tied it all in for me and held my smile through the credits.Give it a shot, watch it through and smile like me. It is an interesting and deeper movie than it appears on the surface* * * Final thoughts: But..Fair warning. I've seen more drunk driving in this movie than on a full season of Cops. This is hardly ever explored or looked down upon in this movie. Honestly, I cannot believe how this is not condemned nor shown the true consequence of this needless and selfish act. If one can remember how horrible this deed is and not let these lucky characters get away without so much a scratch, i.e. understand this is fiction without real consequences, you should be able to still enjoy the film.
Get Outta Town Let me start withI wasn't a big fan of The Departed, and I liked American Gangster a whole lot less. Both seemed to try and grab the Oscar, and hard, e.g. trying too desperately. Granted, Departed won it (thanks Jack) but I generally don't favor movie's only motive is for awards. (Or actors, such as Denzel Washington.)That all said, I'm not sure The Town was set out to grab any awards, though I'm sure with 100 best picture nominations (okay, 10, but still) it's sure to get a nod. That's not saying too much since 2010 basically sucked and I would be racking my brain to come up with 10, let alone 100.And yet, The Town SHOULDN'T win anything. In fact, the only nominations I would approve (but not win, mind you) would be: Best Cinematography and Best Supporting Actor for the always impressive Jeremy Renner. The rest of the cast, or talent, barely would pass an audition, let alone get any consideration.The worst part of the movie was the over-used and well-done tired plot, including the infamous LIE subplot involving the laughable Ben Affleck and his honey, Rebecca Hall. The story, co-written by the lesser Affleck (Casey is just so much better) isn't anything new and brought little to the table.OK, so we have ho-hum and very little depth bank robbers who wear disguises and/or forget to shave  shocking trickery!  who pull off their latest but must take (and eventually release) the manager, Claire (Hall) and in their suspicion, lead robber, Doug (Affleck) follows her once the "heat" is over. Naturally and completely unsurprisingly, he falls for her.I'll pause a momenthere's where I prove how bad Affleck was in both acting and (co-)writing: he asks her a dozen or more questions on what she remembers or who's been talking to her. Maybe I'm being cynical, but she's pretty dumb, naïve, scared or just a plain idiot not to see why he's asking so many questions.Fine, not everyone can put two'n'two together, but you'll have to get ahead of that plot hole to move on to the others.The FBI knows whodunit, but they need to prove it or get a witness tonail them! Sorry, needed to put emphasis on that, because the movie asks, er, begs, you to have some urgency even though we know everyone's on the same page. Oh, and when Doug's being interrogated, let me say this: He ain't Keyser Söze. Hell, he ain't even the Joker. It would be more interesting to see the interrogation scene from Marathon Man, and if only I could play the dentist hovering over Affleck asking "Do you think you're safe?"Let's move on to the other obvious and clichéd plot of DougieBoy wanting to do his "last robbery" and start fresh inin Florida? Anyways, if they brought anything to the table that hasn't been done before in the countless "I'm getting too old for this sh|t" retirement bits (SEE: Lethal Weapon One, Two, Three), I might have given a sh|t myself.I'm not going to spoil anything else, but to say: they try to unsuccessfully sneak some character depth to the story (The FBI agent that won't give up!, The Mother & Child who also want out!, The Mob won't let him go!) The positives about the film was, again, Renner, who wasn't on top of his game  nowhere near, but still good to watch and the striking, though formulaic views of Boston. Honestly, I don't mind scenic aerial shots of cities, or on the ground and in unfamiliar neighborhoods of cities. So, I did like how the film was shot.Unfortunately, it was always ended with a close up of the Dudley-Do-Wrong mug of Affleck. Buzz kill.You have no one to root for. No depth of the characters other than what's spoken and not shown. You have nothing new under the Boston sun. And you have no reason to subject yourself with dozens of other already made, already better film versions of The Town. SKIP!
"How's the writing?" Cleveland stutters."Slow," replies Vick (probably should've) Ran.No truer words were spoken in one of the most ineptly shot, annoyingly uninspired and hilariously bad chapter in M. Night Shyamalan's long list of bad ideas. Want proof? His title character of Lady in the Water is namedStory.As much as I hate M. Night's films, even though they give me great joy in unintentional humor, he's never one to really shoot a film worse than a film school dropout. 30 minutes in and I cannot believe he would allow the close-ups of peoples backsides and horrible angles be shown. Unless, that is his fetish.If it is, that's all the more disturbing. Even more for the poor audience having to witness one disastrous scene after the next. It's more alarming because this was supposed to be a "children's bedtime story," meant for his kids and all we see is more backsides than actual characters.Besides the horrible filming, there's an almost endless supply of bad creations in this boring story. Wait, I'll stop thereI get it now! It's purposely boring to put the kids to sleep quicker. Okay, you get that one, M. Night.I digress. This movie's bad on so many levels, it's tough to list them all. But, I'll try.The racist and stereotypical characters are just plain stupid. Yes, that's pretty nondescript and adolescent to write, but when you can see them in the rare full-shot, they're more cardboard than a Peter Piper Pizza specialty pie and more caricature than the pop-up book this M. Night loon probably viewed for inspiration. The locales are boring, the mood is tenseless, the background story is laughable and the comedy is nonexistent. Further, I can tolerate many different disabilities, and I get why the main character, Giamatti's Cleveland, stutters, but he's all-but making fun of real-life people who suffer from that problem.The bent list actually goes on in this silly story and I will say it includes the fact M. Night should never star in his own films. Yeah, I get he's a pompous, overly bigheaded director, but to give a face  literally  to the one that makes me so mad I wasted my time, is not comforting. I don't like the fact my hatred is boiling as he's on screen.It's almost hilarious to give the synopsis, because of how ludicrous it is, but suffice to say, it's about a man finds a water lady who is chased by jokes in the leaves and needs a writer and an eagle to be carried away. Yes, it's that simple, odd and uninteresting.Oh, and I almost forgot, as a poor attempt at tongue-in-cheek or an insult, M. Night includes a movie critic character that blatantly points out all the wrongs in a bad film. In what I suspect is to bash his own critics, M. Night actually does point out what's wrong with his own film. If you can call this a film. And what's even worse, he doesn't even understand what a real movie critic does, or how they act. It's like making a cartoon character of a football player using a stick figure.As the movie progresses and gets more and more preposterous, the inconsistencies, terribly writing, odd behaviors, out-of-character dialogue and interest in any of the leads become as distant in the viewer's mind as the Delta Quadrant. Hell, I can see where "horror" is supposed to be involved, maybe even a little of suspense, but it's so muddy and obscure, this is as scary as a car manual.One of the character's books he's writing is called "Cookbook." In this case, I hope Gordon Ramsey cusses out M. Night's terrible creation."I'm not anything, you know. I don't think I'm anything specialWhy are people suddenly going to take me seriously?" asks M. Night's own character, Vick. FINALLY we agree on something.
I really hope the inevitable sequel to Wreck-It Ralph brings more of the my-day video games to the forefront than this one did.And thatis my only "complaint" about this movie  and trust me: that's really not a gripe at all. I loved this movie, up and down, from beginning to end. While I would liked to have seen more of my favorites growing up, like Street Fighter II and Pac-Man (well, Mrs. to be exact) the story of Ralph, his old and new peers, were absolutely awesome on their own.I know everyone and their mother and grandchild loved the Shrek series, or at least the first two. I did like them both (and the great spin off: Puss in Boots), with Shrek 2 being better than the original. This movie, this near masterpiece in animation, was MY Shrek-like homage to my youth.Nearing his 3rd decade in the arcade, Wreck-It Ralph wants more than bad-guy status and to win an award so he may live comfortably with his pals in his video game's penthouse. So, crisscrossing different stand up games  the ones I thoroughly enjoyed at Chuck E. Cheese's growing up  he has the adventure of a computer byte. And so do we.The movie had great cinematography, songs, depth and fantastic voices. Also, many fun, funny and interesting characters appear and despite all the clichés and predictable plot lines, every one of them are fun and exciting. I found myself laughing, tearing and touched by the paths the movie took and I'm sorry I didn't see this great (and should-flat-out win the Best Animated Oscar) film sooner. SEE-IT.
Well now. 900 reviews down and I thought it would be special to go back to the beginning.Picture it: Phoenix. 1991. I saw the movie version of The Addams Family with the intent of reviewing it for The Demon Dispatch, my High School newspaper and it would become not only my very first review I ever wrote, but my first realm into being published.I still have a copy of that review, so I will include to the bottom of this recap (on my website only.) But, until I finish writing this "new" take on a movie I just recently watched for the first time in at least 15 years, I won't revisit that so that this will be pure.Pure. That is a great word. The movie's now over 21 years old and damn, it's held up and still "pure" today.The movie follows a wacky family and bases itself more on the comic than the TV series of the 1960s, though, it really resembles that sitcom. I even grew up on the show  reruns, damnit, I am not a child of the 1960s, for pete's sake  and I still loved this reincarnation of the strange house and family.Now, the conflict of the story  person pretending to be someone that's long-lost and he may actually be that person  isn't really new, even in 1991, but the events, the comedy, the dialogue, the sets and graphics and above all, the acting make up for the lack of originality tenfold. I could list every single actor in here, from the great performance of Anjelica Huston and awesome Raul Julia and the excellent Christina Ricci to the newcomer and impressive Jimmy Workman and never end this review on how everyone played their part to the tee and excelled in making their characters truly alive.To this day, again, more than two decades following release, I find myself marveling in this movie, laughing and appreciating all the efforts made to make this an instant classic (back then and today.)
(This review is heavy on spoilersbut it's also 16 years old and it's your fault if you haven't seen this yet)Perhaps it's unfair to finally get around to re-watching and reviewing the original 1996 Mission: Impossible. The evolution of each movie is so clear that this looks it was a lost episode of the 1960s TV show it was based on.And it feels like it's been that long since I've seen this. I remember disliking it and wrongfully being confused  I can't see why now, but I never realized how much I didn't care for it. Mercifully and much like the franchise has evolved, the original does get better as it progresses.Only your mission is to get through the first half before the fun begins.The movie opens up with what I'm guessing is 1st year spies. It's one thing to explain to the audience this gadget does this, or causes this harm, but for the characters to act foolish like they know less than the typical non-espionage viewer, is just plain pathetic. Prime example is poor, out-of-place, Kristin Scott Thomas who, apparently, never heard of either the TV program or any spy-film before.Worse than these high school dropouts posing as international agents, is that they kill off the majority of the team within 25 minutes from the start. YOU DON'T DO THAT  or the original series wouldn't have lasted as long, obviously.And what's even worse than that? (Fast forwarding to the end) YOU DO NOT MAKE JIM PHELPS THE BAD GUY. Seriously? I can see why they did it  the star, Tom Cruise, wasn't going to play the older, white-haired leader and they (or most likely he) wanted to give the pending franchise to his Ethan Hunt character. Fine, but you still don't make the long-lasting hero the villain. You don't even kill him off  just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc.Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent. Yes, I said diskette  the old 3½ inch diskette that probably couldn't even hold the contents of this review, let alone any kind of list as big as described in the movie.I digress. As mentioned, the amateurish crew is dismissed early and Ethan "Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's DEAD! They're ALL DEAD!" Hunt is blamed. This is where it gets good  for a few moments. After he meets the fantastic Vanessa Redgrave as Max, he recruits future staple and great Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and short-timer Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to break into the CIA headquarters and the (at the time) wildly original, tense and fantastic wire-hanging scene takes place.Of course, just so the movie does escalate past the 2 stars I gave it, during the best scene, there's a rat  REALLY?  that scares/distracts Franz in an air duct. Much like the first half of the movie, this makes me feel they weren't taking any of this too seriously, making this just a few steps above Get Smart.Following that, and literally jumping to the end, there's a fantastically unrealistic leap of faith from a helicopter and a super-train in a tunnel that makes me unintentionally laugh every time I see it.The movie made a huge mistake of being mostly spy and very little action, whereas Part II was also wrong at playing the opposite card. Luckily, they *finally* hit their stride with Part III and Ghost Protocol that, rightfully, matched both needed qualities equally.This actually very slow "action" movie, which does contain a somewhat reminiscent of older spy-films, albeit dumbed down, was just a misstep from fairly decent director, Brian De Palma. It's almost worth a shot, just to find out who Ethan Hunt is and why Jim Phelps doesn't show up in the sequels. It did contain some decent cinematography and a very good score, but overall it's a miss. Thankfully, the sequels, with the exception of parts III and Ghost Protocol, are pretty much stand alone so you don't have to endure this experience."I've been disavowed," says Ethan. Don't worry: it won't be your last time.
True, I'm not an Adam Sandler fan, but 50 First Dates was recommended to me by a friend, so I obliged. Mercifully, Drew & and the Great 50th State of Hawaii saved this movie.She was fresh, wonderful, funny, beautiful and carried this repetitive idea of a short-term memory girl and her relived days, every day through to the end. Granted, there's been better movies with the same idea, such as Groundhog Day, but this was a touching love story of a player (Sandler) who woos the girl who can never remember him when she awakes. It's a barely recommendation.
It's been a very long time since I saw the below average original, and I have been craving a good and fun adventure. Obviously, I was thinking they stepped up the game to the surprise hit, first movie, but, alas, 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' was a lot worse. Every time I wanted to like this silly, SILLY movie, my mouth kept dropping and it simply got more preposterous. And I'm not just referring to the plot. They made a dumbed-down kid version of 'Indiana Jones' and yes, even younger than 'Young Indiana Jones,' so you really have to be prepared for the simplest versions of espionage, dialogue okay for a preschool play and a storyline even Dora the Explorer would turn her nose at. Sadly, it's not a standalone movie; they expected you to remember every character and relationship from the first one as they give almost zero background. This was a problem for me since it's been years since I saw #1. That said, apparently Benny (played by Cage  who now ranks as one of the worst actors of all time, his one shinning grace was 'Leaving Las Vegas' and I think he should have left Hollywood as well) is upset because his great-great-whatever relative might have been involved in the assassination of President Lincoln and Benny will stop at nothing to clear his name! Including kidnapping the President! A very forgiving President, of course. "Oh, well, if you're trying to clear a dead man's name, I can see why it's justified in committing a felony." I'm really looking in too deep into this globetrotting and predictable "adventure," but I was disappointed in that you don't have to G-rate down all the gags, acting, dialogue and sooo-secret twists to have a great movie (see: Indy 1 & 3.)
Sure, you would be scared too, if you're Buried alive. It's happened before in the movies. But, to me, and a lot of my fan(s), I'm referring to The Bride (Uma Thurman in Kill Bill Vol. 2.)Sure, since that was fiction, she knew how to escape. She pounded the roof of the wooden coffin in the ground with her fist until it broke and dirt escaped into the tomb. Once enough poured in, she literally dug her way upwards to safety so she can go and request water in a nearby café.Again, that was fiction. And The Bride had training  who knew she would need to pound her fists for that very reason? But this guy, Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) is supposed to be a more realistic "trucker" for some made-up company in Iraq during the beginning stages of the rebuilding of Iraq during Bush's regime. His crew was ambushed, killed and/or maimed and he was stored in a wooden casket to be held for ransom.Let's be frank: he's a dick. Sure, he's in extraordinary circumstances, but he's still a prick. Let's stop there for a bit, shall we? Let's back up. This guy, Paul, is a trucker for some company and stupidly thinks there's easy money to be made inTHEE MOST UNSAFEST PLACE IN ALL OF THE WORLD. Then he's caught and buried for ransom.I hope this doesn't happen in real lifebut I'm sure it does.to .003% of the world's population. So, we're supposed to relate to him?Anyhoo, the movie begins as he awakes in the literal coffin. But wait! He's given all the right tools to coordinate himself out.Unfortunately, we get to know him as he's suffering through this ordeal. Can we really side with him? How often will this happen to the normal folk, like us, where we really feel "oh, this could happen to us?"Not often, I suspect. Further, since we can't really put ourselves in this guy's shoes, would we really act like the (sorry, again) dick he is?Okay, the ending really does shock, surprise and (sadistically) impress me. But, not enough to hold up for the whole feature. In a REAL life situation, simply watch 127 Hours for more realism and acting. Poor Ryan Reynolds. At least he tried at acting. Maybe he should just stick with being a (more) fictional Super-hero.On a side noteas grim as it was  no, I've never been buried alivethank God  all I could think of throughout this featureWhy doesn't he start pounding the rooftop until his fist(s) bleed? I mean then, he could dig-dug his way to the surface like The Bride did. After all, they specifically told him he wasn't too far from ground level.
V for Vendetta really shot itself in the foot. It was advertised as a "comic-book" adaptation with action!, adventure!, sword-fights! And yet you will get 95% of the action the previews show in the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the film. The rest isjustplain dialogue.So, if you're looking for a typical, Hollywood/Comicbook/Superhero action movie with a mask vigilante who prefers snappy comebacks and swords over bullets, look further. Rent Batman Begins. You won't be disappointed and you'll be satisfied with your childhood fantasies coming true.Butif you want an amazing and adult "comicbook film," and a thought-provoking, wonderfully paced movie with extremely rich dialogue, character development and suspenseful intrigue, you can't do wrong with this excellent film.It's the future! And the grand ole U.S. of A. is no more. Leave it to England to rise above with a new dictatorship hell-bent on keeping people heaven-bound with "good" messages and bad symbols underground. This doesn't sit well with 'V' (Weaving) who wants to model his fate with events centuries old. In other words, he wants to blow up the Parliament  on the (Remember, Remember) "the fifth of November." Make that, he wants to do it next year. This yearhe has plans.And the plot thickens. Why is he doing this? Why is he waiting a year? Why doesn't he ever take off that mask? And why does he bother with Evey (Portman)? You knowI'm gonna stop here. I've given possible 1/5 of the plot synopsis away. Watch this wonderful movie and discover the rest of the storyline for yourself. Now, let me compliment the rest of the efforts from those involved.Let me begin by saying I am NOT a Natalie Portman fan. At all. She was wretched in the Star Wars prequels. She was unbearable in that Wal-Mart Baby movie. (I'm so uninterested in her, I won't even look up the title of that one.) And yet, I did think she fared well in The Professional, but she wasn't what made that movie. Hereshe did a good job. Not excellent, but finallywatchable. She did what she needed to do, she showed emotion when she had to. The shaved head/G.I. Jane/Alien3 look was needed for the plot and yet, she barely stood out in the movie. Who really shined was a personal favorite: Hugo Weaving.I understand, you can't see him in this movie; his role might as well have been animated, butthat voice. His voice was mesmerizing. I've been a fan of his since The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert and the first Matrix. But, unlike a lot of animated features, his voice carries the movie; his dialogue rich and serene. No one could've filled the 'V' mask as he did.When the action's hot, it's great. When the dialogue is rich, it's splendid. When the intrigue is on, it's interesting. You have an above-human character, one I love in almost any medium: the superhuman-human. And as devoted as he is to his cause, he's still human. They show plenty of examples, but mostly in Portman's Evey.There's so much to love in this movie  namely the originality, message and dialogue. It's worth a viewing and it's definitely worth a second shot. Of course, a lot of the "surprises" or "twists" are gone in your second plus screening, it's thoroughly wonderful to fully pay attention to what they're trying to portray or say in their directive.I'm sure I left out all I wanted to say or convey in regards to this awesome experience, but I must say: Give this a shot. Know that it's not all action, despite the fantastically choreographed action-packed introduction. Know that this very well could (and might) happen. Let's just hope there is a human being that's smart enough, strong enough and determined enough to show us we're not just cattle.Side Note: Listen to the dialogue. Rewatch the film and really listen to it. "People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people." And always "Remember, remember, the fifth of November." Side Note 2: (Spoiler Alert) I am thoroughly glad that, despite this being a "Comicbook" adapted movie, it was NOT left open for a sequel. Not that, in most cases, that's a bad thing (I loved The Dark Knight, for example) but it's nice, for once, to have a complete movie/story on your hands. And just merely the trailers for this feature indicate a series or franchise. Thank God, they sealed the deal with just this one wonderful movie.Side Note 3: I recently recommended this film after watching a second time to a friend of mine. Not only am I pleased he liked it, he loved it. It's now in his top 3 of all time. I look forward to his comments on my site. With his enthusiasm, I might have to watch this a third time, sooner than it took me to watch it a second time  several years.
Quick Review: 'Attack the Block' was an extremely original take on the Alien Invasion cinema genreonly it's not easy to get through. For one, you have to like the bad guys  siding with the opposition and put up with the dialect of 2-year-olds. I understand its dark-humor, but it got extremely tedious hearing one word sentences by these buffoons  no, not the alien buffoons, but close  even if it was supposed to be "realistic." That said, it's recommended for those who like both alien-invasion stories and something fresh. For as low budget as this promises, it has just that: promise. And a new scaled down, even lower than Cloverfield, and more intimate view of us VS them. It's a watch. (3/5 stars)
How this literally took seven whole years to be released is beyond me. I mean, don't all horror fans love Mandy Lane?OK, admittedly, All the Boys Love Mandy Lane is predictable, once the initial and fantastic, albeit horrifying, opening act is over. The conclusion is so foretold in so many ways, that I wondered why they bothered covering up the twists. Butthat doesn't mean it should've been shelved for far too long.I mean, I've seen plenty of predictable horror crap, one after another and most with a lot less talent and budget as this. Despite the easily seen "tricks," I enjoyed this movie until the ending.In what will go down as one of my favorite horror movie openings, the movie begins with the lovely  or so they repeatedly told/showed us  Mandy Lane passing everyone in high school to meet up with her geekfriend/gay best friend/brother/whatever, and her getting invited to a pool party. There, as she's admired further, her friend gets picked on pretty bad and sadly, a tragedy happens at the party.Nine months later, the still pretty and sought after Mandy Lane gets invited to another party, but now out on a ranch with a bunch of horny, drinking and drug lovin' boys and girls. Surprisingly, no one pushes said drinking or drugs on Squeaky Clean Mandy Lane, but the horny part? See the title of the movie.As with Friday the 13th (or, of course, Scream) rules, anyone caught having sex, doing drugs, etc, will be offed in creative ways. This film does not ignore those regulations. In fact, a lot of them, including the tragedy in the opening segment before the ranch house, were pretty damn creative.And as with the aforementioned Friday the 13th and Scream movies, just to name two examples, there's one or more twists. And, again, as previously mentioned, those were pretty obvious almost from the get go.While some of the areas of the movie were fairly original, most weren't and despite that and the foreseen "secrets," the movie was very well made and the absence of a lot of blood and gore was welcomed  horror movies don't always have to have a ton of blood to be scaryor creative. It had its suspenseful moments, justifiably moody, every actor invested in their roles and satisfying for someone, like me, that's so incredibly tired of paranormal films. I do like a multiple of different horror genres, but my least favorite is the paranormal/ghosts stories.It seems that every horror movie, but maybe 3 over the past 4-5+ years have been of the paranormal kind. Yes, I'm aware this was originally scheduled to come out in 2006, or during the "torture porn" cycle of horror movies, but it's thoroughly refreshing to see this now, in 2013, since even the "good" paranormal horror flicks are getting pretty stale and completely unmemorable.All in all, I recommend this horror movie and it's a great homage to slasher films fans like me grew up with.* * * Final thoughts: "I think I'll finish high school first."  says a character who was near death. Gotta have goals!
Let the games slow down. Thankfully the best thing I can say about 'Saw IV' is they cut back on the gore. They didn't necessary replace the gruesome aspect of the series with more plot, story or acting, in fact, if anything, they all but eliminated those aspects that were the only thing holding the previous installments alive. Okay, sure this movie is gory, but comparatively speaking, it's "SawLite." Here we have more of a back story of Jigsaw (and the Mrs.) as he had died in the previous film. That's not a spoiler; the movie starts with his autopsy. It didn't really gross me out, as it was all medical, though it might be not for the squeamish. It does set the scene for some of his postmortem games  basically what parts IV+ are set up since they killed off the main character/ring-leader. Unfortunately, as that's a key plot point to keep the series (or games) alive and incidentally, its downfall. From there, you never know if you're in the present or past. It is flashback, upon flashback, including, hilariously the now made-famous: flashback within the flashback. (I saw that once on 'The Simpsons' and that was hysterical. Unfortunately, here, it's to be taken seriously, though I still laughed.) Just to jump ahead a bit, in 'Saw V' it's more relevant, but part 'IV' sets the stage where they simply just make up stuff that happened in the background to keep the story alive. If you watch this movie, or the following one(s), you'll see where character's just appear where the writers want them to  around corners, behind doors, etc. I pity them as it seems like they're grasping at straws to keep the series going. Not a horrible movie, but, boy, they needed to end it with 'III.'
Let the games begin. And so they did in the original 'Saw.' Crafty, original, simple and suspenseful this mystery/horror 'Saw' was. The unfortunate biggest flaw was not really the movie itself, but the torn-porn trend Hollywood jumped on and since, produced dozens upon dozens of imitations and far less quality pictures (including 'Saw's own sequels.) Aside from that, I was quite pleased, though disturbed (with the violence and gore) with the concept of a serial killer that doesn't kill. In 'Saw,' two men wake up in the dirtiest of scummy bathrooms, chained and armed with a mission (rules, if you will) to not only put all the pieces together on how to survive, but how to decipher on the reasons behind their imprisonment. Multiple flashbacks and exterior shots, whether presently or in the past, make the viewer actually think for once and try and solve their dilemma as well. I'm simplifying this, it was a great concept, and despite the low budget, excellently made. For those not used to horror, or in the trend previously mentioned: "torture porn," this is not for the squeamish. It's enormously gruesome and hard to watch at times. However, I liked the message, though it was a rough ride to get to it. And the message? Simple: Appreciate life. If one can get past the gore and really listen to what the brains behind the operations  Jigsaw, then you'll get it too. In fact, take this as a lesson and go out to enjoy life now, before something like this happens to you. I'm kidding  I certainly hope this never happens. Years after Freddy, Jason, the 'Scream' ghost, Hannibal, et al, Jigsaw stands amongst them and played beautifully by the actor playing him. (No spoiler on who it is; that's part of the game.)
Another fantastic comedy did 2011 produce with Crazy, Stupid, Love. Too bad, I don't flock to see comedies in the theatre too often or I would've enjoyed this one a lot sooner.Some old concepts rolled into one movie get a breath of fresh air thanks to fantastic writing, humor, characters and acting. Everyone involved put their 100% in; everyone had realistic reactions and moved this almost two-hour movie to feel like it flew by.Most notable was Ryan Gosling. He plays the clichéd womanizer, but does it with such depth and ease; you'll both love him and hate him simultaneously. It's no wonder he recently was nominated for a Golden Globe for this performance.Too bad Steve Carell was snubbed, though. Sure, he plays his typical mopey self, but he does make you feel for him every step of the way. And though his scenes with Gosling were great, his comic timing and lines with Julianne Moore were priceless. She laughs at his lines  that's her character queues  but it almost seems genuine, like she didn't expect them and laughed like the rest of us did.This isn't to take away from everyone else. I always have a special place in my heart for Emma Stone. Let's just say: everyone, including the love struck son, Robbie played by Jonah Bobo, did a fantastic job.Immediately into the feature, it's announced Emily Weaver (Moore) wants a divorce after 20+ years of marriage to Cal (Carell). He flips, literally  out of a moving vehicle, moves out of their home and begins anew at the bar. There he's courted by Jacob (Gosling) into the art of picking up women.The movie's a lot more complicated than that with multiples layers and other characters and how they love their own interests as well as react amongst themselves. And despite the web spun from one corner to the next, the movie masterfully never strays too far and stays on track.Great movie, incredibly funny and touching, it's an absolute must see. One of the best of 2011.
After an incredibly slow first act and some below par and childishly written songs, Frozen actually finally takes off and left me pretty pleased by the finale.What worked best here the original take on the age-old Disney Princess animated feature. There was no grandiose villain, the conflicts were real and the love did show despite what I had thought the characters should've/would've done. Oh, and the stereotypical sidekick goofball character Disney loves to throw in wasn't exactly an original idea, but thanks to incredibly hilarious writing and ideas, I loved almost every minute the tiny snowman, Olaf, was on screen.Unfortunately, the movie was all ice capades for me. Despite the very long and sluggish start, my biggest problem was the music. For the majority, but one song  and that one, Let It Go, was just okay in the movie, the lyrics were so elementary and quietly frankly, unpleasant to my ears. These songs along with Olaf might have been there to please the younger audience, but not one soared to my expectations from these Disney Princess animated films.Luckily, it's easy to get past the songs since the majority of them are in the first half and it's the second half of the film that makes this movie ascend.After an accident involving a Princess's unexplained power to manipulate ice and cold, the King and Queen separates their two daughters from each other and the world for many years. Unrealistically, but then, this is a fantasy tale, the powerless Princess of the two clings to hope that she can be best friends again after many years of isolation and intentional avoidance.Once the years of seclusion are over, hell literally freezes over by the unresolved issues from the ice Queen. Will her sister save her from herself and the kingdom? Will they all thaw out? Will it ever be explained how some have powers, some bodies can break apart and others can rock and roll?Stick with the tale and it will, ah-hem, warm your heart by the ending. Not the best Disney/non-Pixar film in years  Tangled was much better, but still worth a watch. Just, bring a sweater.* * * Final thoughts: It was nice for Disney to go back to its roots in their classic format, but it was even better that they shook the story up and modernized their filmmaking. This was a smart, and definitely profitable, move to keep up with the other studios. I don't always praise Disney, but they did right here for the most part.
If one could strive to be as much an unknown hero as Rodriguez, I would bow before them.This movie, this documentary, Searching for Sugar Man, is so inspiring, so original so upbeat and so greatI'm sorry I didn't see it sooner.Thanks to a dear friend of mine, I was introduced to a perfectly paced, wonderfully shot and excellent to the ear documentary about the search for the man, the genius, that no one has heard of. Including myself.And now, I'm glad I have heard of him. I loved this man's music. I loved his plight, his journey and both his humanity and humble life. This is a great film and one of the few that cast an original story with an original way telling a documentary.While most documentarians wait for the grand finale, for the ultimate surprise, this Malik Benjelloul decided, half-way through his film, to reveal the first of two wonderful shockers. I did not see that coming. In addition, once revealed, I didn't see the ending, by a long shot. Uplifting, to say the least.Searching for Sugar Man tells the tale of an unheard of musician of the late 1960s/early 1970s in Detroit, MI, USA. He performed here, there and finally got somewhat discovered. Only, the grand USA wasn't ready for him. Mercifully, seas away, South Africa got a hold of him and this, inadvertently, helped cause a much needed revolt.Sadly, this tale of a genius musician who didn't take off in America, didn't know of his own influence overseas and because of this, he gravely didn't expand as he should've.According to reports, he eventually killed himself on stage during a concert in which he was wrongfully booed.Admittedly, I've never heard of him. Most of America hasn't either. And this is a wrong. The songs played in the movie  nicely accounted for with titles on screen  make us all want to buy his albums. I am going to. Mark my words: I will buy his CDs.The movie is a search for this mystery man, this "Rodriguez," whom we should all hope to become someday. He's true, he's real and this well-deserving award-winning documentary shows how both the humble thrive and how a documentary director can masterfully film a story.This is an unknown story of an even more unknown man. See it. Live it. And preach it. Oh, and buy the album. When you find out where the proceeds of a humble human go, it won't make you feel guilty one bit.
Most times, it's better to read online critics, or humans, write "horrified" reviews than any praising reviews of movies I like. Brunos a great example of fun movie-bashing reviews. These people were horrified? What did you expect? That's like being surprised when a politician lies or Simon Cowell criticizes. Same goes for the small percentage of the population (such as myself) that hated Transformers 1 and expecting something better out of 2. I'm not sure Cohen's objective here was to bash the gay-bashers. Some see this as political. I didn't. I just laughed out loud at someone who was trying, and succeeding, in entertaining me. Sure there's homophobia still in the world, I see it every day and since it makes me cringe to hear the comments and parents teaching their kids to be equally ignorant, it gave me a little pleasure in seeing them cringe back. Bruno cracked me up as it almost seemed like he, himself, wanted to laugh at what some of the targets were saying. Unfortunately, the majority of the funny scenes were in the trailer  the "Swapped OJ" talk show and the military training. (I really had to laugh out loud at that one  if I were forced to partake in such discipline, I surely would have acted the same way, and of course, get knocked down for that. It'd be worth it.) The best scene comes later, however, with the "Str8 is Gr8" cage fight. Regrettably, while I loved Borat a lot more, too much of this movie seemed extremely staged and I did find myself wanting to laugh a lot more than I actually did. Still, worth a viewing, if just to watch all the guys in the audience squirm every time nudity or gay-sex is on the screen, which is quite often.
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is a movie I would normally hate. Or pick apart. Or dread seeingif I was paid to review films.But, oddly, I had a tad bit fun here. And there's more than a few reasons:1. Gemma Arterton owned her Gretel role. She was fun, a little more deep than appears on the surface and commanded the screen. 2. Likewise, Famke Janssen was also pretty good. While I've always liked her anyways, she was delicious in her bad girl role. 3. The movie never takes itself too seriously. It never tries to climb above silly, period piece action. 4. While it falls apart in the (anti)climax, it has enough strong and fun scenes to carry it there. 5. Mercifully, it's Rated R. This is NOT a kid's movie and they didn't need to make it both lowbrow and for the Twilight crowd. This could've easily fallen in a trap of PG-13 crap. 6. Jeremy Renner takes his shirt off. Done.As mentioned, this movie is, in fact, silly. It's NOT to be taken a bit seriously. Its plot and plot holes weren't exactly easy to ignore, but again, let the two female leads carry you through  along with a few good explosions and fun, and you'll have a good time.I grew up on the fairly basic story of Hansel & Gretel when I was a kid and loved it. And maybe this is why it was Rated Ronly adults my age or around my age or greater would've heard of this fairy tale. How could the young, I-Whatever Gen even hear of either Hansel or Gretel?Anyhoo, after being left alone in the woods as kids by their parents and changing the original story, Team H&G fight off their first witch and never look back. Enter present day, sorta, and a new threat of kidnapping witches brings the duo to save the day.There will actually be just a few unexpected surprises, though mostly predictable and a lot of CGI blood leading to the finale we all know is coming. One with a suspension of disbelief so great that believing in witchcraft is incredibly minor.Recommended, but know what you're getting yourself into.
I did enjoy Bad Teacher, more than most people and more than Bad Santa. Cameron, whom I've appreciated since her debut in The Mask, did an excellent job of showing that side of dark and selfish, yet actually human. Her character actually took what most people think, whether they admit it or not, out of the mind and into action. She actually did a bang up job, including some, albeit rare, bouts of humanity. I also enjoyed Jason Segel's character and Jason's wit throughout. Sure, overall, she is a "bad teacher" and not recommended to stand (or bend) in front of any student or human, but it's a fun little ride when you leave your brain at the door.
Recently, I started carpooling with an old friend of mine and we conversed a lot to/from work. Occasionally, he would say: "You're killing me, Smalls." I let it pass even though I didn't know what he meant by it.I guess after the 3rd or 4th time he said it, I inadvertently repeated that phrase to another coworker in a similar situation as my carpool buddy put me in. They laughed and exclaimed that they loved that movie. I asked "What movie?""What do you mean, 'What movie?'" they shot back.I explained I didn't know where that movie line came from, but I somehow knew how it fit into conversation. They laughed and could NOT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM believe I had never seen The Sandlot.Over the course of a few months, I would get the similar response of disdain that I had not seen this movie. In my defense, most of my coworkers are much younger than I and I explained to them that by the time this movie debuted, I was already too old for a young-kids-coming-of-age film. (Later it wouldn't be so bad, but at the age I was in 1993, I wanted to be older and not associate with younger kid movies.)Incidentally, this movie fell off my radar completely during the 1990s and 2000s, until that "You're killing me, Smalls" phrase erupted recently. So, I made it my mission to finally see it. (Believe me; I had a minimum of 22 people criticize me for not seeing it.)One recent Sunday night, I finally made time for itand DAMN. I am SOOO sorry I didn't see it sooner and further, I regretted I wasn't born later, like a decade later. This would've been MY movie. No doubt, I would've seen it a minimum of six times in the theatre  where I got the money for that many viewings from my poor family, would be the same challenge these boys had with the baseball replacements. But, I would've seen it many, many times. Not that I would've needed to: the famous quotes from it, much like the SMALLS line, would've been permanently engraved into my subconscious from the very first viewing and for the rest of my days.I would've surely identified with Scotty Smalls. Innocent, new, inexperienced and friendless. He moves into a new neighborhood in the early 1960s and takes a bit of time to become part of the gang. Once he does, he's there for life.I am the same way with each stage of my life. Especially with all the moving around my family made us do from the time I was seven until I was almost Junior High School. And then further, outside of school, when I moved from job to job, even when it was years at each employment.I digress. If not for so many movies, TV shows and other life-events in the way, I would probably watch this movie a multiple of times. I absolutely loved this movie, up and down, inside and out. I laughed out loud, cherished the "PG-Rating/family rating" which I don't watch too often, identified with the group of kids and reminisced of times, journeys and adventures I had outside and in the neighborhood as a kid.Sadly, I missed both the show: The Wonder Years and the movie: The Sandlot as a child. But, that doesn't mean I have to from here on out.* * * Final thoughts: I don't normally do this, but I want to personally thank my new coworkers and older friends for making me see this classic. I know a lot of other kids my age idolized movies such as The Breakfast Club, The Lost Boys and Stand By MeI never got into those. I wish I had been born later I would've surely idolized this one. So, thanks to you: Jessica Bojorquez, Andy Recinos, Nicole Meglen Davis and of course, Smalls, himself, Brandon Schildts. If I missed anyone, I apologize... Thank you too!
Do I really need to put my two cents in on one of the all-time "classics"? Hasn't this been talked about to death already? I was coerced into seeing this movie I never, ever wanted to see from a friend that said I wasn't a movie-lover (I am) if I've never seen this. And when I plugged in the movie and saw it was 2½ hours, for a movie I'm not that invested in, I began questioning our friendship. For the first hour or so, I chuckled a little, though it did keep my interest. Then, BAM, it seemed to take off and I got giggly for the rest of the extremely fun and funny ride. One thing that shocked me was: how much faith they had in a five-(or less)-minute sketch on SNL. They must've had this huge budget  blowing up buildings, destroying malls  and the length was far too long. Butat the same time, that was the biggest problem: it was far too long and it took far too long to get going. That said, it was thoroughly worth the journey of the men in black once it did build steam  especially from the comic genius John Belushi (check out the fantastic nonchalantly they handle the out-of-left-field situations they find themselves in) and the "guest appearances," my favorite of which was, believe it, Carrie Fisher. The funniest segment, that made me pause it since I was laughing so hard, was the soaring cars in the climax. 4/5 Stars.
As so the story goes: after every great comedy comes the fall.The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear has more of a fear of disaster as it trends lightly on humor, but juuust enough for a recommendation. Some jokes work, most don't, unfortunately.Drebin's (Nielsen) back, but now (like Die Hard 2) he's in D.C. Wait, the first Naked Gun also took place in L.A. like Die Hard 1, hmmm. Well, next on my list is Naked Gun 33 1/3, so I'll see if that one takes place in New York City. (Nope, thanks IMDbit's back to L.A. for the Oscars, which that movie certainly didn't win any.)But I digress, Drebin's now suffering his loss of love of Jane (Presley) who's moved on to another psycho, Hapsburg (Goulet) who's body switching an environmentalist, Meinheimer (Griffiths) in order to keep the planet burning up likeGORE WOULD PREDICT!Will Drebin, his trusty sidekick, Hocken (Kennedy) and a now more used Nordberg (Simpson) win the day and in turn, the heart of Jane? Well, duh, but, it's just an exercise in patience with the now-tired old jokes.I just recently re-watched this movie about a week ago, first time in more than a decade, and it's already starting to fade from my memory. That's not to say it was horrible, as some of it was kick-ass hilarious, such as how they stop the bomb. But other scenes, such as the ridicule of George Bush the First and his First Lady was, well, far below any SNL skit. And speaking of which, why didn't they get Dana Carvey?Watch as a far inferior follow-up to the smash original, but don't expect much.
If I could give a movie a solid 5/5 stars simply for one song played in the movie, this would be that film. But, sadly, the song in question, "Half of Something Else" by The Airborne Toxic Event, is so wrongfully buried in the second half of the credits.I remember watching Going the Distance a long while back and I did something I rarely do: stay through to the end of the credits. No, I wasn't looking for that annoying 10-minute wait to see three-extra-seconds in a Marvel movie. I generally do that in movies that I truly love and had an extreme, though positive, emotional time with. Luckily, I did here, since I caught the song that would truly become one of my all-time favorites.Upon this second viewing, now on a BluRay I purchased, I still did have a blast and loved a ton of it. Unfortunately, it didn't hold up a hundred percent well for me, but I still had a great time with the cast, lines and over-all soundtrack  and not just for that Airborne song.With only weeks left before Erin has to leave the state and move back to the other coastline, she begins a pitch-perfect relationship with the supposedly noncommittal Garrett. As that ended at the airport, Garrett does, in fact, become committal and they begin a long-distance relationship. We all know where that's headedOkay, the script had some minor issues and the originality wasn't prime, but damn, any problems Going the Distance had was severely trumped by the comedy, depth, side-cracking/side-characters, (again) great music and overall: the deadpan delivery of lines and chemistry between the leads.It's not groundbreaking, but of the two times I've seen this, I did burst out laughing more than several times and fell in love again. Definitely worth a watch, especially for Justin Long and Drew Barrymore fans.* * * Final thoughts: I've been meaning to watch this one again for a long time. I've never forgotten about that song, "Half of Something Else," but when it recently played again on my car MP3 player, that was enough for me to revisit this film andto hit repeat a few times for the song during my drive.
I'm sure I've said this before, but I don't know how they could've made Couples Retreat any less funny. And they had an all star cast, full of comic appeal. But, it seemed more like a "Rat Pack" excuse to get everyone together and on a very nice island.Actually, that's probably the only reason the movie was made: everyone got a nice vacation on a beautiful oasis.And it was beautiful. The water, the mountains, the greenery. The enormously fake-CGI sharks, not so much.Unfortunately, the laughs and the weak and predictable plot were made from the same crummy computer that produced the sharks.Four despicable sitcom couples are conned by one of the couples into a therapy journey on a gorgeous and tropical island. Will they or won't they learn to accept and listen to each other? Is anyone serious they can't see how this will pan out? Also, is there any indication of a "surprise" or "twist"? Hardly.In addition to the typical homophobic scenes and almost zero laughs (even the ones that made me half-snicker were so foretold that I was almost bored waiting for them to appear), we have horrible editing and plot holes big enough for the cartoon sharks to swim through. Scenes just start and stop with no rhyme or reason, characters complain of being too tired or beat up but we never learn what made them sluggish and some couples participate in activities while others are off the screen for an extended time and regroup with everyone without an explanation.If it weren't for the beautiful cinematography, I would've fallen asleep at the beginning. It was as if it was a screensaver, so I'm surprised I didn't snooze. (Ironically, the only truthful thing about this mess was a character commenting about the scenery as I just did  it was like a screensaver.) Suffice to say, like the equally brain-dead (though contains a breathtaking island) A Perfect Getaway, you should break up with these couples before your time is wasted. Heck, it was 113 minutes when it should've been 22 for the normal sitcom it replicated. Don't let paradise fool you: SKIP IT.
Upon leaving the theatre for Prometheus, a young girl asked her guardian if there'll be another one. It took all my will power NOT to say: "Yeah, like 30 years ago."I'm coming late to dinner, so to speak, by finally sitting down and writing my thoughts out on this Alien prequel (and YES, it is an absolute prequel; don't let anyone attempt to change your mind.) At first, my delay was welcomed  it allowed the experience to sink in. Also, it probably also didn't help I was on holiday in Las Vegas and the last thing I wanted to do was do something that made me think.But, as the days numbered (now) three, probably too much has sunk in. Such as the pros and cons. Above all else, and this opinion hasn't altered, the movie was gorgeous, breathtaking, even. In Director Ridley Scott's long sci-fi career, it's as if he's taken all his ups and downs and produced the nearest to perfect cinematography  well, directed, that is  in his films. The first two-thirds, or so, were absolutely amazing. And I didn't even see it on IMAX, which I should have; I saw it on a screen probably built in the 1970s at some rinky-dink UA on-strip movie theatre off the beaten path.What also didn't change in my mind since I saw it opening day, was the acting of both female leads with Charlize Theron as the best of the two. Though Noomi Rapace did good, I believed Theron just ate up every scene and I thought she had the most depth. Michael Fassbender was okay in his android role  no spoiler there, the original Alien's AH-HA surprise, "one of these (crew members) doesn't belong" was not a factor here. I didn't have so much of a problem with him, as I did with how convoluted his character was written. And that brings me to the negatives.While the writing, for the most part, was very well done, it did have its moments of awkwardness since it tried to take on too much and introduced tons of avenues. And unless this was written in Lord of the Rings fashion  which it very well could've been, it couldn't possibly have solved, explained or given conclusion to half of the ideas.Director Scott isn't shy of slow-burning his movies to almost a halt at times. With the exception of my favorite of his, Thelma & Louise, his movies are at a snail's pace. Knowing that, I allowed the movie to draw me in and for the first half or so, it did that in spades. I was enthralled with the cinematography, a huge plus for my movie-going experience. However, once the sights were done and the stories went in 5 different directions, the movie slowed and it was almost torture to get to the inevitable and much desired Alien-tie-ins. Of course, you'll have to wade through several endings to get there.The movie, without giving too much of the sixteen or so story lines away, is about the discoveries of a god-worshiping symbol found in multiple, non-connected civilizations roughly 80+ years from now. Taking that, some greedy guy's money (oh, I wonder how that will turn out) and a trip to another planet and we have further questions with what went down in that obviously civilized alien planet.One huge thing that separates this movie and the original 1979 Alien film apart was the writing, the script that I all-but complain about above. The first movie (which I did revisit just last night  I had too, this movie MAKES you want to watch that original Ripley Raid again) was enormously straight-forward sci-fi-suspense-horror. There was not a real shred of originality or depth  even in 1979, but the execution, acting, mood and graphics was what made it so special. Here, in Prometheus, the questions, somewhat answers in the screenplay made Alien look like an infant. This was an adult movie with real profundity.Now, I say I all-but complained about the writing, and that was not my intention; I was just kind of disappointed on how it just branched out a little too much in the final act and that was sadly it's undoing as it had such a great two-thirds of growth slightly squandered in the finale.That said, it's a movie to see. It's not only for true Alien fans, as I am, but it's absolutely amazing on how it can stand on its own without having to ensure you see any of the other ones. In fact, it might be a fun trip if one were to see them all, in order, beginning with Prometheus, without ever seeing the originals.I highly recommend this. Further, don't make my mistake of seeing it on an ancient screen that probably cost less than the monitor I'm using to type this; see it on IMAX. And finally, despite my reservations listed above, it's still an overall exciting, increasing suspenseful (as well as gruesome towards the end) and again, beautifully made film that I wish at VERY LEAST gets a nomination for best cinematography.Oh, and by the way, to answer that kid's comment more accurately following my screening and after my re-watching of the original Alien, I would say there has to be at least one more movie in-between this prequel and the 30-years-later storyline of Alien. Unless, they'll just want to call the minor inconsistencies just basic overlooked flaws.
In the far, far distant future of 2010, people are segregated into, uh, districts due to crime rate, or control, or whatever and a lone do-gooder, Leito (Belle) fights "the man" Taha (Naceri) to keep the peace. All's well in his martial arts fight for survival and justice until they finally catch on to kidnap and use his sister to shut him down. Then, convicted of a crime he didn't commit, he serves time. Meanwhile, French big-wigs use their cop, Dudley-Do-Right Damien (Raffaelli), another martial arts fighter, to infiltrate District B13 in order to retrieve bomb set to demolish the area and millions of "innocent" people. Will Damien and Leito form a bond long enough to take down the Kingpin Taha, retrieve the bomb and save the princess, sister of Leito?These and more exciting questions are answered in this week's episode of District B13!If you like Jackie Chan films, The Transporter, "Futuristic" buddy movies, Luc Besson and District 9, you'll pretty much like District B13. (Okay, that last one, District 9, isn't really related other than the segregation part.)I've read it's action from beginning to end. I strongly disagree. There's maybe 3-4 action sequences tops though those are really well choreographed. Man, I hate blue/green screen fight scenes, such as Transporter 2 & 3. That's what made #1 the best of that series  you got to see Jason Statham at his finest. Same here with Raffaelli and Belle. Mainly Belle, but they're both fun to watch for the fourth of the movie they're in action. The only problem is the rest of the film is just the hokey, so-called plot.But then, again, like I mentioned, this is in the tradition of Jackie Chan/Transporter films: very, very minimal plot, horrible acting, unbelievable odds which always side with the hero and laughable dialogue. Knowing what this type of movie it is, you can enjoy it, as I did. There's little to take from it, but watch it for the incredible stunts and fun you'll have watching the "small" hero(es) take on the bad guys.
(Mild Spoilers) Not that I had anything particularly bad to say about 'Moon' when I give it a straight-average rating, but it wasn't something that jumped out at me as wonderful or incredibly bad. I liked the sets, the lunar shots and I always love Kevin Spacey, even just for his voice. But on the dark side of this 'Moon,' it was rather slow at times, it had the same ole corporate story (Ripley didn't just battle aliens in her outer space films) and Rockwell  act as he might, he never really does anything for me. 'Moon' is set on a moon base, a few weeks shy of the end of the three year contract for Sam. We're told up to this point that he's heard voices, seen images of people not there  side effects of long-term space jobs. What could possibly go wrong with only mere weeks left? Enter another Sam, or is it an image, or is it a clone? I liked how the movie turned from somewhat boring scenes of working out and connecting with his wife/daughter on Earth to the mystery of Sam 2.0. I think it was a noble effort and on the same track of another low-budget space movie 'Sunshine.' Both were based on very old ideas, both with twists and both without the budget to be a huge box-office hit. I can recommend it for those interested in sci-fi and are extremely tired of the alien/dark corners genre that's overcome a lot of sci-fi movies of the past decades. Also for Sam Rockwell fans (again, I'm not one of them) due to this being basically a one-man Rockwell-fest. I, on the other hand, wish just once big-bad corporate doesn't play the bad guy. Yeah, I know in reality, they're rarely perfect, but still.
Imagine Lethal Weapon and all your other favorite buddy cop movies, but without the humor, charisma, heart, originality, big-budget, huge action scenes and actors that have chemistry together Oh, wait, you've seen The Glimmer Man, too?There is a plot here, a straight line, something that was originally pitched, but I failed to see any of that. I guess this was an excuse to get a man (Seagal) who was mere inches away from blowing up (and not in a good way) before he involuntarily retired from "acting" to pair with the least famous Wayans brother as his zany sidekick.Only, he really wasn't that zany, and Seagal wasn't that action packed. Or so he would tell us. Repeatedly.Let's dive into what they called a plot: There's this serial killer on the loose and another group who, I guess pretend to be him, or something like that and there's corrupt cops and some testicle-dust that helps one of our heroesI'll be honest: it's been about a month and a half since I've seen this for the one and only time. I only watched it as it's my mission to conquer all the movies I haven't seen that the How Did This Get Made? podcast "reviewed." I'll be further honest: I didn't hate on this movie. Sure, it wasn't perfect, but maybe there was a good movie somewhere in this mess and the action by just-on-the-edge Seagal was somewhat fun. Wayans not so much, but I've enjoyed his other (behind-the-camera) films a ton more. So, he's forgiven.This movie was truly a mess and not recommended. Only if you wanna partake in the same challenge I gave myself: watching all the How Did This Get Made? podcast films so you can enjoy their take.* * * Final thoughts: Casablanca deserves better homage.
I think why Up in the Air shot straight to the top of my 2009 best list is not only was it a perfect movie, it connected with me. I've seen a few dozen 5-star movies in the past few years, but none has connected with me personally since Lost in Translation.As depressing as it could be at times, it showed truism with the scenes and especially the dialogue. The movie was so well crafted and written, so tight and real, I loved every minute of the movie.It helps that I am a enormous George Clooney (Ryan) fan, but the biggest surprise for me was how incredible Vera Farmiga (Alex) fed/bounced off him with excellent ease. Listening to them go back and forth, especially with Anna Kendrick (Natalie) indirectly insulting them, was as much fun as watching Clooney (again) with Brad Pitt in Ocean's Eleven (or any of them, for that matter.) Ryan is set in his job, which because of the freedom of traveling and not being micromanaged, he is in love with his life on the road. His job (not the most ideal or friendly of employments) is firing those in multiple cities throughout the USA for approximately 320+ days a year. He does this due to the corporate big-wigs are too much of a pansy to do themselves. But Ryan has the gift of turning any negative statement (quiet, shouted, violent or sworn) into a positive. Yes, it's his job to do that, to ease people into their new "lives," but he is effective in actually helping some. (On a side note, and this is probably why this was a personal movie for me, I have to do the same thing in my own job. Unfortunately, bad news is what I have to give to some people. Though I try to detach myself, as Ryan is perfect at, I simply cannot at times and it is heartbreaking to be the bearer of bad news.) Of course, there wouldn't be a movie without conflict, so in comes two new women in Ryan's life. On the road, as usual, Ryan meets Alex in a bar. The scene was so juicy in dialogue and filled with spontaneity, I couldn't believe (at first) that this was their initial introduction. But, that sets the scene for their "non-involved relationship," whether sexual or just company in the long days away from their own homes. A perfect union of noncommittal, planned out encounters.The other variance in Ryan's life, the other female is a 23-year-old, extremely wet behind the ears college grad, Natalie who's book-smart, but hardly street-wise. Her idea is to save money by transferring live fires to chat-room lay-offs. Impersonal? Absolutely, and Ryan immediately clashes with her in one of the best scenes in the movie. Nevertheless, Ryan's boss (Bateman) sends her out with Ryan with fantastic comedic scenes, including and especially the ones where Ryan, whom you know pretty well by this point, is pitch-quiet.And that's how well made this movie is. You know the characters. You not only feel for them, you understand them. All the while the movie does progress and characters grow/develop and even more layers are uncovered. If the movie didn't grab me from frame one (and it did) the longer it went on, the ingenious plot developments, including comedy and drama and definitely realism, the more I fell in love with the film.It's almost award time. Here are my wants for Up in the Air: Best Picture, Best Actor (Clooney), Best Supporting Actress (Farmiga), Best Director (Reitman) and Best Adapted Screenplay. If it wins for all, it is truly a perfect world, but the following is what I am willing to settle for.No one, and I mean no actor living, could pull off the role of Ryan as Clooney did. I am hoping for another Best Actor Oscar for his performance, but I will settle on Farmiga as Best Supporting Actress. Not only was she a surprise scene-stealer for me, but she was absolutely excellent. I strongly believe also this should win a Best Adapted Screenplay at very least. And it's funny, usually when I said that, before the Oscars are announced, I'm usually right. I also wanted the following to win Best Screenplays (Original or Adapted): Brokeback Mountain, L.A. Confidential, The Silence of the Lambs, No Country for Old Men, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Juno, Lost in Translation, Little Miss Sunshine, American Beauty, Fargo, and Pulp Fiction. All of which won. (To me, the "Original" award is even better, but nevertheless, I still wanted them to earn a screen writing Oscar.) As you can see from the list before, my favorite aspect of any movie begins with the script. Everyone of them above received a 5/5 (or close to) and it was related to the script. Real dialogue, interesting ideas, originality, pace. These are all things I look for, probably first, in a film. And Up in the Air captures all of these. So, again, in case the Academy Award voters are off again  and 7/10 times they are in the majority of categories (namely Best Picture), I'm hoping for the win in the Best Adapted Screenplay section.See this movie. Especially now with the economy in the state it is. Sure, the source material's years old, but this is as fresh as it can be. See it, at very least, to understand what happens on the other side of the desk when you're laid off or fired. Of which, I've been both and never bothered to put myself in the other's shoes.
I sure did get in trouble once. I'm not saying where, but let's just say it was at one of my employments. I entered into a conversation on where people were talking about a certain group of individuals that were oppressed. I casually mentioned that gays have been mistreated and even killed by bigots.One person, in particular, blew up and I should've predicted the HR call coming a couple of days following. I was not  neither back then nor now  stating African Americans had it worse or the same as gay people. But BOTH parties had/have it pretty bad.Here, in 12 Years a Slave, I kept witnessing the Bible being used as an instrument of destruction, for justification of slavery. Well, in today's time, I hear the same thing: People using the Bible as a weapon against humans, specifically the homosexual community. So, I do make a comparison between the parties.I digress, this movie was fantastic. The performances unique, rich and deep. The originality on the WHITE MAN BAD, SLAVERY/OPPRESSION WORSE genre of film as of late was refreshing and the lead actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor and his character of Solomon Northup was incredibly invigorating. Hell, the movie itself was great, but he and his character alone, is worth watching the whole film.In probably the most original story of slavery I've seen, 12 Years a Slave tells the "true" tale of Northern/free man Solomon Northup who was deceived, kidnapped and sold to the South as a slave for __ years. Now this movie is only 134 minutes long or just past two hours, but I wanted more. I wanted to hear, or read more of this man's plight. (Luckily, this was based on his novel, so I will have to check that out.)Aside from one clichéd and obvious character  I won't spoil who this was, but let's just say: he's one of the producers, I got a clean prospective on this topic (again: WHITE MAN BAD, SLAVERY/OPPRESSION WORSE) than I've seen in the countless movies of the past couple of years.Absolutely recommended. This story of this man, this incredibly bright, talented and loving man, should reach your heart, too.* * * Final thoughts: Sorry, Chiwetel. Any other year, I might vote for you to be Best Actor at the Oscars. This year, I vote for Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club, his best performance to date. And this is coming from someone who loved him in the same year's Mud. But you were still great, Chiwetel!
I understand a lot of comedies of the past decade practically force you to stay through the credits to see additional comedic scenes and/or outtakes. It's pretty sad, though, when Hall Pass's only laugh out loud moment is in said end-credit scene. (Note: I'm referring to "The Next Hall Pass" person. I have to specify since there are three separate end-credit segments.)This is not to say there were other funny bits throughout, and there were, but nothing that made me truly laugh hard. In fact, for the most part, I questioned this as a comedy and more of a drama.Married buddies with a severe case of Wandering Eye syndrome get a "hall pass" from their wonderful, beautiful and fed up wives for one week  or so. This is to say, the wives and children, if any, vacate for several consecutive days and the boys can be boys in any way possible. Oddly, they continued to work this week, when it would've been a sure week-off for me had I been given that chance and in this situation.At any rate, the boys act even more foolish when they're given their freedom than when they were "restricted" in marriage. They failed to learn the obvious reason they were so tempted and other females were so attracted to them prior to the Hall Pass: they were unattainable. Anyone that is "taken," per se, or in some cases, heterosexual and the wanting party is homosexual, they're high on the list of attraction. Rabbit and the Dog, if you will.Will the duo stay faithful? Or even, will their wives, as they, too, are on "a break"? After over a 100 minutes  depending upon which home video version you watch  you may think you know where this is going, but I actually was surprised a bit.So, the movie gets some kudos for some good twists I didn't foretell, but overall the movie was somewhat uneven and the laughs were probably for a more specific audience than I. I like these guys, these actors, especially the women halves, but damn, it just wasn't that funny.I wouldn't say the movie was a waste, but it certainly could've been re-written a few more times and cut down to a good 90 minute comedy movie standard. Luckily, Luke Wilson, one of two boys, has enough charisma to carry me, as did Jenna Fischer. But, if you're looking for less drama and more comedy, look elsewhere.
One of the most positive statements I can make on 1986's 'The Stepfather' is they give away immediately who the bad guy is. Most of the 1980's thrillers, psycho killers, et al that deal with a "Dr Jekyll/Mr. Hyde" seemingly nice guy to friends, families, neighbors took way too long for the "secret" to come out when everyone already knew from just the poster outside. I liked that and though it puts more weight on O'Quinn's shoulders to act deep into a psycho's head, he does it with ease, almost perfection. Unfortunately, everyone else acts like cardboard, but that's okay. Same occurrences happened with Kidman in 'To Die For' or Washington in 'Training Day,' both good (not great) films. All movies mentioned had top notch lead performances. (The following would be a spoiler, if it didn't happen 2 minutes into the film) 'Stepfather' begins with O'Quinn's exit of one family (he slaughtered) to another. He wants the perfect family, or, he just simply has his bar raised too high. New stepdaughter is suspicious, and though justified, she's almost annoying throughout. Meanwhile, someone's seeking justice for the most recently slaughtered family. They were lucky to produce this film 23 years ago, because this guy's leaving his trace and DNA everywhere and for the police to just throw their hands up and give up seems ridiculous by today's standards. But, think 1986, think that this was loosely based on a true story (and of course, if he were more careful, it could easily happen again) and you'll enjoy it more. One other thing I loved about O'Quinn's performance was he wasn't 100% nice guy when he was Dr. Jekyll. He was clumsy, forgetful, human. He played the evil-half perfectly as just someone being very ill. But, when that happens, be someplace else.
You don't get much to go on from the original poster and you'll take less when you complete the movie, Dogtooth.Talk about child abuse: In the subtitled Dogtooth, the father (Christos Stergioglou) keeps his wife, son and two daughters captive in their secluded home with a big backyard (or two.) Like trained pets, they know well enough never to escape, leave or venture into the real world  just beyond the fence. They just stay put, day after day, decade after next in the confides of the home while daddy is the only one who gets to leave for work.What's more (and obviously, with the above stated facts), they're homeschooledalbeit incorrectly. Just one of many examples is the quote of the movie from mother: "A 'cunt' is a large lamp. Example: The 'cunt' switched off and the room got all dark."This "experiment," that strangely resembles and actually improves upon M. Night Shyamalan's The Village, goes a little haywire when the kids act up. And boy, am I downplaying that.The movie is both extreme independent and experimental. It's not for mainstream and it gets darker as the film progresses  both in sexuality and grotesqueness. I recommend it ONLY for film lovers interested in something new.
Coming back down from space, though "supposedly" still in the future, I finished two back to back nights of two back to back Stanley Kubrick films: 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. And my initial thoughts were: "Well, at least he's improved, albeit not by the REAL future's The Shining standards"Actually, I can certainly acknowledge this is a well-made film and possibly a little ahead of its time in 1971, but there were just a few areas I just couldn't get past.Such as, by words only, meaning hardly a moment on screen, was this a "futuristic" society. Yes, I'm aware this is 1971, and possibly filmed prior, and I didn't need to actually see things that didn't exist until decades later: cell phones, laptops, etc. But, almost everything in this movie was that timeframe without a speck of imagination of what the future might hold. For example: Records (yes, including the obvious 2001: A Space Odyssey LP,) landlines, cars, weapons, postersthey're all of the same period as the movie. Oh, I guess you can say medical experiments and blue hair might be considered "advanced," but I felt no efforts were made to convince me they thought ahead. (Wait, I guess, hoodlums drink drugs, er, milk, at bars in the future. Yeah.)Opposite the lack of visuals for the so-called "FUUUUTURE," were too many mix-matched color or bland schemes on screen. While I am not a Kubrick fan, I absolutely can appreciate his drive, dedication and attention to the smallest of details. Since I know how masterful he is, I was shocked on how unpleasing the movie was to my eyes with the sets, colors, etc. Absolutely, this could've been his intention, and possibly his mark for what the "bleak" future would bring, so I do claim ignorance in that. But, nevertheless, the movie didn't disturb me in the "darkness" it should've portrayed; it was distracting on how nothing blended well. So much so, colors and sets reacted like two magnets close together.Finally, given the time, Kubrick at the helm and especially following his finale to 2001: A Space Odyssey, the movie just had to go to odd and out-there psychedelic facial expressions. Of course, this could be interpreted in many, a few or even one right way, but for me, while I was watching both the F. Alexander character's overacting face outside the bathroom and Alex being fed at the end with his mouth opening and digesting food in such a way even a toddler would ridicule him. YesI have an idea why these actors made such drug-induced expressions, but it blended in with my previous point on how unpleasing this was to watch.Now that we're past what personally irked me, I want to again state: I felt this was a well-made movie from all involved and I understand it's been dissected, interpreted, reviewed and acclaimed by many. In fact, many of that group might dislike, discount or flat out say I'm wrong for my view of the movie's shortcomings. Granted, that's everyone's right to an opinion as I am just giving what I witnessed.Since I provided my three negatives, here are my three positives:The story was very well done, classical, even. I loved the point of the journey of Alex and especially the outcome(s). Also, while admiring and enjoying Malcolm McDowell's performance, it was rather hard to see him so young! My Malcolm McDowell that I grew up on was from Star Trek: Generations and more recently, Rob Zombie's Halloween 1 and 2. (Of course, this is not a criticism; it was just weird for me, personally.) And finally, the dialogue was fairly well-done. When I could understand it, that is. Thank God for closed captioning. But, again, that's just me.The movie centers around carefree, selfish, off and criminal(ly insane) "teenager" (McDowell was 28 at the time of release, so probably 26-27 during filming or so and looked it. In words only, he was a "teen") Alex, his brethren or "droogs" and his eventual capture, voluntary rehabilitation and eventually retribution in the most fun, yet unrealistic series of unfortunate events.That one paragraph summed up the entire 136 minutes, but I would encourage people to see all that's involved in this fine movie. It's unapologetic use of the penis  phallic symbolism, rape and torture, both by criminals and government alike, might turn off some people, but I admired how far this director would go to show his vision of what these character's state of mind and surroundings were. Perhaps it was enormously taboo and experimental back 43 years ago, and I'm sure that's one reason it was nominated for best picture.I thought I remembered having seen this roughly 17 years ago and that was the only time. Following the hardest scene for me to watch  the eye-opening scene (and not because of what he was watching on the screen in front of him, but my sensitivity to activity around the human eyes,) I don't recall a single segment. I probably gave up on the movie back then and thus, this is my first ever, full-viewing of A Clockwork Orange.Despite my appreciation of most of this film, it really isn't a movie I'll probably watch again, any time soon, at least. Lord willing, I'm around in another two decades and maybe, I'll revisit the droogs gang with their milk'staches again.
I'd have higher praise for the remake, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' (6/10 Stars) if I hadn't already seen it. Shot-by-shot, line-for-line in the original Swedish version. Now, something's might have changed, and I certainly don't have the patience or time  they're both RATHER LONG (combined, they run over 5 hours)  to do a side-by-side comparison, but from what I can recall, almost zip was changed aside from the language spoken. That all said, it still was good to watch, I loved the enormously complex plot and charactersespecially the excellent character of Lisbeth. Hell, I love her character and this actress's, Rooney Mara, acting so much it's worth the second trip. I even love her character's name. But, for real movie lovers, I'd just stick with the original.
"Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead." Pulp Fiction has to be one of the best crafted movies of all time. Sure, it's out of order and some people (including some dear to me) got confused, but it's so well made in the sections it's presented, it deserves to be on the top of all people's best of lists.Yeah, it contains violence and a lot of it. Some language and it's excessive. And believe it or not, for being a "guy's movie" it contains full frontal male-nudity (thanks, Bruce.) But, it's creative, inventive, original and a helluva lot of fun.There's a dozen or more subplots to explore, but for the most part, it involves the zany adventures of Vincent (Travolta) and Jules (Jackson.) They're enlightened hit men or simply, employees of one Marsellus (Rhames) and they're on a mission to retrieve a golden briefcase. In the interim, they accidentally shoot someone, get shot or dance off with a drug addict.To be perfectly honest, despite the previous paragraph's spoilers, there's so much going on in this movie, it's hard to describe everything that happens. Needless to say, you MUST see this movie.It contains the following: excellent acting, great comebacks/tributes (Travolta and Stoltz amongst others,) wonderful dialogue, comedy, cinematography, soundtrack, score, originality and enormous breakthrough for a director/writer (Tarantino) who is likely to go down as one of the best directors/writers of all time.I have practically memorized the soundtrack and quotes. And even the joke involving tomatoes. It's rich and deserves an audience from the 1990s to present. Perhaps Tarantino didn't know what impact he would have with his "fictional" story. But anyone that's seen this knows what a master he was when he created this world.I have no problem for saying the following words: Alfred Hitchcock is a favorite of mine. Tarantino is drawing very near to the master Hitchcock was. As crazy as Tarantino may appear, he knows what he wants, he knows how to spin an extremely creative yarn and he doesn't seem to care if anyone else agrees. To me, I hold him in the highest respect for his visions.
Well, I completed my homework assignment of watching The Runaways. Can I go out and play now?The objective of the task a friend gave me was to see a different side of Kristen Stewart since I thought I hadn't see a movie with her in it yet  outside the Twilight series, that is. Turns out, yeah, I did see Jumper and Into the Wild, but I do not recall her in those. Hereyou'd be blind not to notice her even while she's fairly mellow. As always, it appears.Now, I'm not a Joan Jett fan, though I do enjoy her music when it comes on. I'm so ignorant on the topic of her past or present, I thought it was just her and some backup chicks. I didn't know anything about "The Runaways" band, nor the sequel: "Joan Jett and the Blackhearts." (I guess I was right on my thoughts for that one.)Well, despite my ignorance and the fact this movie really wasn't about Joan, I enjoyed the ride of the girls wanting to develop a band from virtually nothing into sexy stardom. And they didn't waste any time jumping right into the destructive drug usage.Perhaps this movie was accurate, because not only was Joan Jett one of the major producers, she apparently was on set all the time pointing out the accuracies. If this is true, and I have no reason to suspect otherwise, it was a pretty dull ride with so little happening, the movie seemed to be stretched out as far as it could to make this a feature length. Again, that's not to say I didn't enjoy it, but it wasn't the most "explosive" biography I've seen. (In fact, the original poster's tagline was: "It's 1975 and they're about to explode." Hardly.)But, it did have fairly decent acting all around with, surprisingly the best performance in a movie about an all-girl band was Michael Shannon as Kim Fowley. He was sure out there, but I thought he was above the rest. And the rest wasn't that bad: the two leads, Stewart as Joan Jett and Dakota Fanning as Cherie Currie were very goodat looking melancholy all the time. Sure, that, again, might be accurate; these real life ladies might have been a bit of a couple of downers. I did believe in their performances, but they didn't grab me to care one way or another where they ended up.The soundtrack, of course, was killer and the decades old scenery believable. I would recommend this movie of the (sorta) rise, (sorta) fall and (sorta) reinvention of an all (sorta) kickass girls band  they really didn't see that badass, by the way.And, yeah, it was nice to see some range out of Stewart, even though in the two big rolls I've seen her in were sorrowful and downhearted rolls.
Thank God, following this mess, did creator Alan Ball still have faith in Anna Paquin to put her in the fantastic role of Sookie Stackhouse in True Blood.That is, if he or anyone saw Margaret in 2006 when it was supposed to be released.And speaking of which, a delay in film releases isn't usually a good thing. Sometimes it is  Titanic  but for the most part, it's the kiss of death. Take that, G.I. Joe: Retaliation!Here, it was like Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger's Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation: Just because an actor(s) is now famous, you need not release terrible projects to make money. This, I assure you, like TCM part IV, will not make anything.At any rate, we have zero characters named Margaret and instead follow bratty, rich-snob and melodramatic Lisa (Paquin  who, if this was made today, by far would've been cast by Kristen Stewart) after she doesn't just witness a death by bus, she's partially responsible.That's not spoiling anything due to it's the premise and happens minutes into an over-long, should've-been-a-TV-miniseries 150 minutes. For the remaining 2+ hours, we somewhat deal with that, but also school. Classes. A stage mother. A boyfriend of single mother. Pot, drugs and parties. Sporadic screaming. Laughable side characters. A brother who doesn't even know why he was cast. And a whole lot of other boring ABC Special topics.I started to like the style and cinematography of New York City in the first act, in addition to the emotional strain of the city bus accident and the ramifications on a teen girl and thought this was going to be a great and well-made indie flick. Well, following the accident  and again, that's almost immediately, if felt like they fired that director and went a different and cheaper route. I know they didn't, but I have no idea how it could fall apart so quickly when it started with a bang andwe have more than two hours to go.And with that in mind, as the movie winds down, the bad filmmaking snowballs fast. Editing got spotty  or shitty, emotions (and screams) ranged up and down without rhyme or reason, story lines opened and faded, secondary characters either came and left abruptly or stayed and made me laugh on how horribly written they were and the lack of appreciation for the talents (and use) of the three M's: Matt Damon, Mark Ruffalo and Matthew Broderick was unforgivable. And one of the worst let downs was the name of the movie. Why the bleep was it called that?I'm sure my ignorance is showing with that last statement, but from what I could put together  during the 2½ hours I tried to stay awake  was the fact that the name "Margaret" was used in just once scene, and if I recall, it was concerning a Shakespearean play. So be it  but that doesn't help someone who hasn't studied the play to "get the meaning." I would've even preferred the title "Momma Got Thrown Under the Bus" even if this was deemed a drama.Final words: as much of a terrible movie this is, mercifully, no blame can be put on Paquin, Ruffalo, Damon or Broderick. It was clear: none of this was their fault and they will have continued to shine in the six years since this abomination was constructed.
I'm puzzled on how much Teeth bothered me. Let me back up: Yes, I am a male, but what these boys went through in this movie  spoiler, sorry: castration by actual sharp teeth in a vagina (that is the premise, if you're upset about the spoiler)  would never, ever happen to meeven if some women had actual teeth in their vagina. And yet, it still freaked me out.I had shelved this clever and original little indie horror film on my watch-list for many years. Yeah, for the reason stated above. But, finally, getting around to it, I was thoroughly impressed with it.Sure, it's not a perfect movie and sometimes unbalanced, forced and had some questionable scenes  namely from the police's investigations, but the mood, acting and direction was all there, as was the horror.Taking from the time of the mid-2000s, Dawn is the purity-ring kind of girl. Of course, she has a reason: she's a product of mutation of a Venereal Disease to the Max. Not just has teeth evolved inside her vuvla, but it's a fully-function chopping machine too! So, naturally, even if she chose to, her sexual life might be a tadcomplicated. Oh, and it does, several times.As the movie, ah-hem, evolves, the movie carefully, and beautifully, keeps the suspense up by not adding a $100 million dollars in special effects. I'm not into CGI at all, especially from 2007 and the "less you know/see" theory worked very nicely here.I marveled in the originality, the low-key tone and definitely the finale. It might make heterosexual young males squirm  especially with the many examples of dismembered, um, members. But, it's still a fun and helluva ride to the end.* * * Final thoughts: Do I really need to explain why this wouldn't happen to me? Really?
Continuing my self-torment of watching recommended, albeit bad movies, I endured yet another terrible Sandler feature in a long, long list of god-awful attempts at humor. But, strangely, as his movies have progressively gotten worse, this one was probably the least painful experience I've had with his films since The Wedding Singer.The reason Blended wasn't as tough to watch, were the 3 or so actually touching moments and one single laugh from me thanks to one of my favorite on screen funny ladies, Reno911!'s Wendi McLendon-Covey. That all might sound like a praise for this bomb, until you realize this is just about two hours, or a half-hour too long, and I was only referring to the scenes I enjoyed that took up approximately 2% overall. You'll have almost unbearable torture for the remaining 98% to put up with.In an extremely long setup to an extremely old plot, two blind date victims literally get forced together by very bad writing and holiday in Africa. That's the meat and selling point of the story and where it sinks to record lows for a Sandler flick due to all the jokes from what feels like six decades ago. What's worse than that, these "writers" actually thought they were funny enough to repeat the same types of jokes over and over and no, they never once were funny.It's sad, really, because that 2% I really liked looked like it could've been developed, or, ah-hem, Blended, into a much better, more original and actually funny movie. This movie had the ending from the beginning for anyone who's ever seen a single other movie before and they expect us to waste two hours while trenching through real sh|t before what we know is going to happen to finally happen. No, it's not so bad, it's good. For the most part, and I am not exaggerating here, it's jaw-dropping terrible. I literally dropped my jaw in disgust at what these folks found both hilarious and acceptable to show the public. But, in a world where people like to take pictures of what's in the toilet after they used it and make that viral, I guess some like to do the same in movie theatres. * * *Final thoughts: I am sad, though. I have loved Wendi McLendon-Covey since Reno911! and she's never given a shot. Heck, when she is in a movie, she's reduced to a third or fourth tier character. Luckily, she was part of the 2% I liked that caused my half star from the one star rating it probably deserved. That said, if someone on YouTube would kindly compile all her scenes into one vid, I would be most grateful.
While trying a little too hard to be Adaptation, Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, True Romance, Very Bad Things, Lucky Number Slevin and Did I Leave Any Else Out?, Seven Psychopaths was a somewhat enjoyable piece that I wouldn't want to see again.Maybe it's because I'm not at all a fan of Sam Rockwell or maybe it's because the movie was all over the place and the direction of the film was unfocused enough that I found myself caring less and less about the main characters thrown around like Kino balls. Aside from my initial statement of all the movies it mimicked, it was somewhat original in its take on a writer's blocked screenplay creator and his wacky, well, psychotic friends. Butthat didn't make it highly enjoyable.Alcoholic Billy is struggling to write his next big screenplay and is using the stories of his pals far too closely to write "Seven Psychopaths." Along his journey of fleshing out the stated seven, he gets thrust into the incredibly bloody and cruel criminal world and the quest for retaining one's dog. (I would find that silly, but then the movie really isn't to be taken seriously, anyways.)The movie's funny at parts, I will admit, and mostly from Woody Harrelson's doofus of a leader role and from the sad and tired dreamer Christopher Walken plays. And though some scenes were literally laugh-out-loud, such as the imagination of how the movie should end by the campfire and the end credit scene, overall, I think it was trying too hard to be insider-Hollywood and be far too tongue-in-cheek for its own good.No doubt the movie was well shot, contained good cinematography and a decent, though forgettable, soundtrack and score. I can't comment on the predictability, for they told you  LITERALLY  how this will play out, so much so, it might as well been called ___ Dies at the End.I appreciate a movie so much more when it tries to be its own invention and not relying on so many movies (just a handful off the top of my head is in the first paragraph) to take after. And though this may be another Love-it or Hate-it feature to a lot of folks, I'm neither. My opinion: eh  could've been worse and a whole lot better.
Maybe I don't have a heart as big as a horse's, but I think I have something else that is! Badum-ching! Anyways, I guess I just didn't have as much sympathy for this War Horse (4/10 Stars) as some might.For one, as grand and as beautiful as the movie was shot, thanks, Mr. Spielberg!, I never connected with Mr. Ed. Everyone kept calling him "a miracle horse" and I was given virtually no evidence of that. He just kept aimlessly wandering through a war-torn Europe while meeting several individuals who saw something in him that the director failed to show me. Thanks, Mr. Spielberg!I take that back, he did some supernatural things: he managed to make a joke when being trained to jump, he taught his hottie horsefriend what the humans were trying to do when they wanted to put a harness on her and when said lover was being recruited to haul a weapon of minimal destruction, Mr. Ed decided to step in and take the position while having some horsey sense on what the humans were trying to accomplish.Other than that, he was just a horse. Nothing special. I guess we just have to take what his human counterparts said for truth: he's something special.I was trained in journalism: Show, don't tell. Sadly, they didn't show me hardly anything to grasp on. They just told a very long story of point A: boy's beloved pet being sold and his coincidental journey home during WWI.Heck, here's more words, verses them showing me anything: in the finale (Sorry, Spoiler Alert!) the horse is getting ready to be shot because he's injured. And after a (not really, but again, they told us it's a) dramatic save from the boy's original master, immediately, his wounds will be treated "like the soldier he is." Whatthehell? What did this horse actually do, or the boy, for that matter, for Mr. Ed to receive special treatment?Speaking of that climax, I did have a little fun. In the final act, the horse has roughly 15-16 moments where I wanted to scream the clichéd slo-mo and cartoonish "NOOOOO!" when he might be kept from his master. It was hilarious after awhile. I mean, Mr. Spielberg treated the horse like his other World War epic's hero: Oskar Schindler from Schindler's List. You tell me who's the real hero, Jew-saving Oskar or Mr. Ed, without laughing out loud.I'll say it again, the scenery was crisp and beautiful  no shaking away a Best Cinematography Nod, the score was gorgeous and the acting was adequate. But the story was all over the place and I had to stop a few times to wonder what this movie was really about. It finally just boiled down to, like I said: the horse's journey from Point A to Point B and a million backdrops, a lot that were hilariously corny  such as the "enemy" that wanted to help SuperHorse and threw a dozen wire cutters to aid in the freedom of the boring horse.Oh, and when did everyone in Europe speak English? I'm sure Germans would've preferred their native tongueah, never mind, this was a toned down War movie. SEE: when deserters get punished, it's hidden from our eyes. Lame.
Admittedly, I had a grudge against this movie. But, not until the following year (1991) when the Oscar Nominations were read. This got nominated for Best Picture and not Pretty Woman? And not just that, very few eyes were on, what I considered (and still do) a masterpiece, Pretty Woman and more on Ghost? It would be years until I saw this again.I was sorry when I finally revisited this in the mid-1990s because, I had to concur: this was a well made film. Great in a lot of areas, even. And I've loved it since.Not so much a spoiler, thanks to the name of the movie, but Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze, RIP, in yet another masterful performance) dies fairly quickly into the movie and becomesthe title character. He's not transported either up high or down below and must learn the ways of the ghost. Mercifully, with the help of (the fantastic character, and Oscar winning Whoopi Goldberg as) con-artist (?) Oda Mae Brown, Sam can both reconnect with his widowed lover and catch the bad person who put him in this purgatory.The movie does work in mysterious ways. It's highly hilarious and touching. It's suspenseful and deep. It contains a triple pleasure: a great soundtrack, score and cinematography. And with it's "on the surface" clichéd characters, the actors bring much more to the table. Even though everyone, including the "Subway Ghost," acted their best and made their roles their own, Academy Award winning Whoopi Goldberg shined the brightest in here, despite her blatant racism. I still laughed and loved her throughout her (sadly) short time on screen. I have always been a Whoopi fan, but here, I believe she brought her best out.This very positive review comes from someone who doesn't even like ghost stories. This one felt many more times different than the others I've seen and I will watch this many more times than the typical modern day and boringly predictable paranormal films.Side Note: While I did not downgrade the movie because of the following: I have to say, this movie made me thoroughly dislike Tony Goldwyn. Granted, he played his slimy role as he was told or felt his character needed to be seen. But, he's literally like a magnet to my magnet when I see him on screen. He's the one thing I cannot look at when watching this movie and I haven't liked him since. Just a personal preference.
After trying to describe the independent film, Rubber, to a friend, which is actually a lot more complicated than just the line: "It's about a killer tire!" he stated my so-called "movie-critic"ness has been lowered and he lost respect for me liking this movie.On the contraryRubber is EXACTLY the movie I should like. It's not the norm like the wretched and failed romcoms of recent years, or the clichéd shoot-em-ups or any of the reboots/remakes. It's one of the most original movies I've seen in multiple years. And further, it specifically tells you  COMMANDS YOU  to not take it seriously.Even though the concept of a "Bmovie killer tire" actually intrigued me  somehow I knew they wouldn't screw this up, despite the laughable concept, they took the movie far beyond that of a demonic tire that hunts, kills and shows a little of a human side. Heck, how, on what appears to be to be a minimal budget, they got the "rolling tire" shots, is actually beyond me.The movie introduces a cop, Lieutenant Chad (Stephen Spinella) that appears out of a trunk of a car that purposely crashes into flimsy chairs in the middle of Nowhere Desert, CA, that seems to talk to the screen about movies that have "no reasons" which I took  and I think I'm correct in this  as DON'T TAKE THE FOLLOWING MOVIE SERIOUSLY, but is really talking to a group of movie-goers, a la test group. They're provided with binoculars to watch the "action."What they see is: a tire (appropriately named "Robert") that awakens (FOR NO REASON) and tries to learn to walk, er, roll. And he (or she  it contains a huge hole after allohhh) quickly gets the taste of killing or destroying. Only, at only point it learns that it can't kill everything. So, naturally, it uses telekinesis to blow up its prey. (I remember thinking that exact thoughtand then laughing out loud that nothing of this movie is really "natural.")Quite literally, I am going to stop there. I wrote that synopsis for roughly the first one eighth of the movie. There's just so much more to this movie I care not spoil. Such as a personality given to the rubber demon that would make a feel good Pixar-short. Or all the twists and turns the tire (PUN) takes.Sure, the movie does run out of steam and there is, ah-hem, no reason to drive that very point home in the closing, but it's entertaining, especially with the audio commentary from the "audience." The production value, score and the sci-fi/Twilight Zon'ish attitude is good and the concept is amusing for most of the movie. Much like Piranha 3D, which I also favored, they took themselves as unseriously as they ask the test group to. And they did it right. It's fun, unique and worth the short stint the film runs. For die-hard film fans only. Especially independent lovers and horror (spoof) fans abound.
Poor, poor Earth. It's met its doom countless times in the past several years. And recently, it's been more and more END OF TIMES stories hitting theatres.Soyou want to make yet another Armageddon film? Why not create one of the most original concepts for that genre with Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson (plus 20+ others) playing themselves in a send up mocking themselves?While This is the End isn't the best movie I've seen in the stated, now over-used plot, it's one of the most hilarious and entertaining. The concept, alone, of all those mentioned actors (plus, again, 20+ others) playing themselves in a party at the end of days, is worth at least a star or two more than the rest of the film.Said actors all party hard at James Franco's villa, and while the plot initially involves who likes who, who misses who and who just wants to party, the main theme happens when the mysterious blue light takes strangers up to the sky and earthquakes and sink holes swallows others. The remaining actors, and friends, must band together to ward off whatever is causing this massive destruction all around them.Right now, I am granting this movie 4/5 stars and I know whyfor now. While the movie isn't perfect, and has it's dry moments, it's still interesting enough and funny enough to be ranked higher than average.That saidin the future, this movie might improve with age. There are a ton of one-liners, inside jokes and hilarious scenes that I think this movie might grow on me with multiple viewings. It's a harmless film that never takes itself or the subject matter seriously and is only intention is to please.Seriously, that's it. Seth, James, Jonah, Jay, Danny and Craig they all wanted to have a good time and give us one, too. So with any potential "flaws," their intentions are pure enough that I know I will like this more with the second and (I guarantee) more viewings."Seth, that's some of the better acting than I've seen in your last six movies. Where the fvck was that in Green Hornet?" - Danny McBride Well, done, gentlemen.
I made a bad choice. I made myself choose between two experimental, independent and one-word titled 2014 "horror" movies for my Friday night pleasure and selected TUSK over HORNS despite HORNS's first IMDb Plot Keyword being "male frontal nudity" and I was hoping to see Daniel Radcliffe in the buff. TUSK ended up being bad, whereas, HORNS was fantastic. (Side note: it was just some bar dude who showed his willy.) Inventive, courageous, fun, funny and interesting, HORNS kept me involved through to the end. It never overstayed its odd concept and, instead, just plowed ahead with its mission. Probably in the minority here, but this was my ninth Radcliff film, though first non-Harry Potter Radcliffe role and it's my absolute favorite of his. This dude can act and he kept me engaged. I laughed out loud a bit, loved the use of the fantasy elements and truly can't wait to see this film again. I hope this movie gets recognized if not now, years from now, as a great vision of filmmaking. Cheers!
The wonderfully shot, but wildly predictable Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps shouldn't expect the same reaction when it comes to award season as its predecessor. Heck, even the first wasn't great, but it certainly had ten times a better script. And that's the saddest part of this update.It sure was great seeing Douglas reprise his Gordon "Greed" Gekko role, and I would certainly watch a Wall Street III: Rise of the Dollar Store, strictly for him, as I would jump at the chance to see Anthony Hopkins play Hannibal again in More Silence, Less Lambs. But, manmaybe it was, in fact, greed that caused him to say yes to this horrid script that contained not one, two, three, four, but about five endings. In fact, the highlight of the movie was around a half hour before it ended  Gordon in London, and it would've been an excellent way to finish the movie. But no.And not only did the film overstay its welcome, probably due to the fact they knew there wouldn't be another opportunity to revisit these characters  SEE: Lethal Weapon 4's four climaxes, it changed the "YES! FINALLY!" first climax into a Glee-fully uneven and uncharacteristic ending.Gekko (Douglas) is released from prison after serving years for a "victimless" crime and after a few more years, he writes a book. Why? Well, no reason that I could come up with, aside from getting himself back in the news so that his daughter, Winnie (Mulligan) and her boyfriend, Jake (LaBeouf) can see him. Immediately, we see fire and brimstone in her eyes and, yep, we know where this is going.In another predictable plot, let's refer to as PLOT B, Jake's an up'n'coming Wall Street junkie (SEE: Sheen in Wall Street) but after receiving a huge bonus from his faux-pas father (Langella) he helps the economy, badly. When (PLOT C) Jake's company starts a downward spiral, fails to get a government bailout (PLOT D) and is ruthlessly attempted to be taken over (PLOT E) by Bretton James (Brolin) said faux-pas father is pushed out. (PLOT F) Literally.PLOT F's main function, but goes almost nowhere, is to show the revenge Jake wants on Bretton and this blends in with PLOT G: Gekko. Sorry for a spoiler, but you know EXACTLY what Gekko is up to once he "strategically" places himself into Jake's life. (Side Note: that doesn't spoil the fun on watching Douglas work his charms once again, regardless.)Gekko is now a "recovered" human being and wants only to be back in his daughter's life (PLOT G meets PLOT A) and he partially uses Jake's vengeance, Bretton's ambitions and the current state of the economy and bailouts (PLOT G now collides with E, F and D) to get his daughter back in his life. PLOT H is too much of a spoiler, though easy to see coming, and that winds its way through the other PLOTs.Whoa, Douglas's The Game didn't have so many overlapping story lines. And I've actually left out another couple dozen side plots, mostly involving the timeframe this was set in: mostly 2008. But, the main plot line involves Gekko wants to redeem himself, get his daughter back and move onor does he?Even though the movie had splendid NYC views and Douglas was great, as usual, the over-stuffed and foreseen script, the unnecessary extra half-hour and the ho-hum acting sincerely ruined the experience it could've been. And leave it to Shia LaBeouf to enter into another franchise (Transformers, Indiana Jones) and bring virtually nothing to the table. He is quickly becoming the next Keanu Reeves in regards to luck in landing roles because, frankly, he isn't the best actor out there. Mediocre is being nice.The rest of the cast were either middle of the road, laughable, over-the-top or just plain boring. Mulligan her set couldn't hit a note if she slammed on piano keys. Langella had eyes as wide as the NYC skyline you'll see half a dozen times or more. And poor, poor Sarandon, one of my personal favorites, went back to first year acting school.The only other performance, other than Douglas's, that was noteworthy would be a cameo that I won't reveal, but you know he/she's coming. Just maybe not when.Overall, the movie's good enough for video, especially when you can stop the movie when Gekko Goes to Great Britain and to see the original character(s) again. Anyone that loved the first (sorry, not me) might feel a little nostalgia, but will probably be mostly disappointed. The rest of us will probably be mostly bored.
Mere hours before seeing the latest incarnation of the land of Oz (2013's Oz the Great and Powerful,) I got a chance to see, for the first time since I was a little tyke: the original great and powerful The Wizard of Oz. And, let me assure you: this isn't just a movie, it's an experience.Far before it's time, mostly being in color notwithstanding, the sets, costumes, dialogue and special effects were absolutely advanced far beyond its 1939 release date. With this viewing, and who knows how many there had been, I found myself laughing out loud, enjoying the musical numbers, almost crying due to the genuine heart displayed by the characters and the actual feel of being in this land of spectacular Oz.Since the story has been told dozens of times and pretty much everyone has seen it, it's almost irrelevant to give the synopsis, but here goes anyways: young Dorothy Gale is thrust into a mystical land when she fails to secure herself from a pending tornado (or "twister") attack. There, she immediately makes both allies and an enemy  the worst and, um, wicked kind, and she sets out to find her way home while meeting great friends along the way.For the three humans left alive that haven't seen this, there's more to the story and a lot of more iconic lines and characters than I probably could post in under a thousand words. Suffice to say, the number one was the world-famous Wicked Witch of the West, the pre-Darth Vader, decades before Anakin donned the mask.Keep in mind, while this does work for adults, this really is mainly for children and I am 100% pleased about this fact. That said, the almost too-scary-for-kids Witch from the West was so well played by Margaret Hamilton, so well done up from face to outfit to evil laugh, that she will  ah-hem, has  go(ne) down in cinema's hall-of-villain fame. Scratch that; she is one of the most iconic characters, good or bad, of all time, despite her short time on screen. And I loved every minute she was shown.Okay, she's not the only one that made this movie elevated from just "movie status." Judy Garland and her voice were excellent, the trio of Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley as The Scarecrow, The Cowardly Lion and The Tin Man, respectively, were also smartly written characters that I absolutely loved and respected.I wouldn't call this movie perfect, but dang, it's right there on the absolute edge of perfection. What they did with what resources they had back 74 years ago astonishes me today. While most sets did actually look like sets, it never bothered me. I always felt like I was a part of the action, the adventure and truly in the Land of Oz.Aside from Chicago  my favorite musical, this film and the great The Sound of Music, I've actually seen very few musicals and it's quite known in my circle of friends that I don't rush to see musicals. That said, I love the majority of songs in this film and who really couldn't? I mean, when Judy sings the best of the bunch, "Over the Rainbow," or you get the timeless variations of "Off to See the Wizard," or when the bell was rung with "Ding Dong The Witch is Dead," you can't help but remember your childhood and have your heart soar.There's very little to say more about this fantastic ride that hasn't been said before. So, to sum it up and suffice to say: SEE IT!** - Again, that is.
It would be too long of a list for actors who are severely typecast, so to be more topical, let's just narrow it down to the sad, melancholy, damaged, depressed and negative character Kristen Stewart is always playing.I've only seen a handful of her performances, and with EACH one, she nails that role, including this one in Adventureland. In her defense, she's awesome in this Goth-without-the-black role she's forcing on us. In opposition, it is, in fact, depressing to see her always bring down the house around her and the characters that have to spend 80% of the film attempting to bring her up.On the bright side, the snap-witted and always impressive Jesse Eisenberg was cast to be one of the oppositions whose job is to fruitlessly make Stewart's character feel good, even if just for a few seconds of screen time. 'Course, then she's back to her gloomy demeanor and her hand back through her hair.Adventureland, or more accurately, Dramaland, follows James (Eisenberg) through the 1987 summer of working at a local amusement park to earn enough to make it to the Big Apple. There he meets very few interesting characters, but nonetheless, falls in love, lust and develops both relationships and I'm guessing, himself. (I "guess" because I saw little difference in his character from the start of the summer to the final shot. A tad bit of elevated confidence, but other than that, nada.)At first, I questioned the not-so-coming-of-age story being set in 1987, but along the way, I tremendously enjoyed the soundtrack and mildly took pleasure in the tiny bit of other nostalgia: real video games and clothes. The soundtrack was great, because it didn't go full-force into the stereotypical 1980s tunes that these movies generally do. There was a wide section of known ones to "new to me" that I liked a lot.I suppose they were original with not having the normal "sidekicks" to our love-struck-story "hero." Sadly, they strayed so far away from the norm, 70% were established in their perspective acting ability, but just plain, well, plain. With the exception of the hilarious park owners, Bobby (Bill Hader) and even more outrageously funny, Paulette (Kristen Wiig), most of the pawns at the park might have been possibly realistic, but they weren't terribly interesting or funny. The poster that bragged "From the director of Superbad" might have drawn me in, but eventually would've disappointed me with his lack of attention to the supporting cast.Overall, despite the far-too-long running time, I marginally liked the course served: the cinematography was very decent and again the soundtrack awesome. But, those were incidental to another entertaining romp of absolutely hilarious Eisenberg one-liners. If you're a fan of his, or, ah-hem, a fan of Sad Stewart, you'll probably enjoy a ride at this amusement park.Side Note: Oh, and I hate horrible actions without consequences in films as this does nothing less than telling our youths it's okay to commit them. This is why I hated Project X so dearly. Here, drinking and driving seems to be the standard amongst the townsfolk, and only one scene seemed to give a character an all-but slap on the wrist and, of course, he felt zero remorse. I'm curious, did less people die back in 1987 from drunk drivers, or was it "funny" and just more widely accepted by society?
Yeah, I spent the good portion of the last three decades hating on football. It was an amusement I played and social media made it all the more easy.That saidI joined a fantasy football league this year because a good friend/coworker of mine was enormously enthused about it. After a day of useless and backless  albeit fun  smack-talk, I vowed to learn more about this game.Step one: Draft Day. And what a way to start. This movie had its issues and clichés. The predictability level was at an all-time high, and still, it was a ton of fun.Granted, I still don't know all I need to know to get "into the game," but I definitely got a good idea.Sonny Jr. (Kevin Costner) recently lost his Sr. and still must keep his job by drafting for his Cleveland Browns team. Meanwhile, his job's on the line, the fans despise him and a baby's on the way with his coworker. He's got a lot on his plate. Oh, and he's expected to pick the most obvious first round choice for his traded first decision.Audiences, even ones not as familiar with football as I am, know what the REAL choice should be and it takes the better part of two hours to come to that conclusion. While I like this Moneyball version of football film  a lot, actually  it was so foreseen, I just needed to spend my time keeping up with the trade aspects and the football technical terms. Honestly, this is a good movie for both football fans and casual fans, alike. It's well shot  and the overlapping scenes were actually pretty cool  and the acting dead on for real-life characters. I'd still recommend Moneyball tenfold over this, but hey, you could certainly do worse concerning a movie based on football that shows very little real-time plays.* * *Final thoughts: True, my friend's enthusiasm and request got me involved in a Fantasy Football league this 2014 season. Because I had little invested and I do love great looking bears, I made my initial picks based on looks. In my defense, I went to the top 300 ESPN player's list and selected from there so that I would have both good looking guys and ones in the elite.This did NOT fare well considering my projected points were in the 40s and everyone else's was in triple digits. On Monday, before the season opener, I added/dropped a bunch of players and basically rejoined the league in time for the 2014 opener with my favorite team, the Seahawks and the Packers  a team I should love. I now match them with about 122 points projected, but with a less good-looking team. Ha. Regardless, this movie did open my eyes to a lot of the behind the scenes and showed me more of the passion my peers and friends have for this game.So without being the superior Moneyball, it's still highly recommended for my friends and football fanatics.
I finally got it. After three real movies and an obscene attempt at extracting more money by splitting up Breaking Dawn into two parts, I understand what this series is all about. It was meant to introduce a new audience to soap operas since most of the daytime programs have been cancelled.There is no other explanation. Both the soaps on TV and the Twilight films have paper thin plots, terrible dialogue and acting so atrocious that even Michael "ahhh-oh-AHHH!" Sheen must've known when signing on he gave up any hopes of getting an Oscar in the future.But, I will give this movie some credit and make note of one scene that will make the entire nightmare worthy of a watch: in an incredible series of accidentally amusing segments, they actually taught Bella to become Kristen Stewart. I was already laughing so hard during the comical special effects to the creepy digitized demon baby to the close ups so near to the screen that I was glad that it wasn't in 3-D or their nose hairs would've been closer than desired, but when they literally tell Bella to be a stiff actor, emotionless, melancholy and slow, I lost it. Bella, meet Kristen Stewart.I'm not sure if they were acknowledging Stewart is one of the worst actresses of all time and the scene was tongue-in-cheek, but it was funny, nonetheless.What wasn't funny was the endless, sad and racist stereotypes portrayed throughout. It's almost as if the novel's writer was a Mormon. Oh, waitAnyways, everything reverts back to the original film with the amount of stares, the sometimes there and sometimes missing white faces, the terrible CGI including Bella running through what appears to be the Moon of Endor, but ends up looking more like in she's jogging in an awful 20 cent 1980s music video, the sickening jokes and the joyless, pale and blank looks between the actors. That last one was one of my favorite scenes as the camera panned from one dumbfounded face to the next. I found myself pointing off the screen as if directing the camera to film the next boorish and expressionless glare.Those were the similarities of the original Twilight. Since they just "had to" split the (oh, God, let it be the) final book into two, the screenplay, if there was one, appeared to be completed on one side of a toilet paper square. And if you are curious to see this film, much like that square, you'll know exactly where the final project ended up.Let's see if I can write the entire movie down on one toilet paper square:Bella and Edward are newlyweds. Bella's a "new born" who needs to feed on cartoon animals. Jacob now smells and put his stank on an infant, which never gets less disturbing. The supposedly strong, though never proved, high council is upset a half-breed might harm their "race." Different clichés from around the globe are summoned to negotiate. A "battle" ensures.Yep, it all fits and I still have room forAnd that's what this movie is. No two ways around it. People who like this crud will continue to defend it. More power to them  for liking what they like. Soaps were around for decades and though I didn't like them, I saw their appeal to desperate housewives.As everyone has a right to their opinions, no one should ever be dishonest to themselves and think these are well made movies. There is not a single scene  from the aren't-we-past stock footage shots to the panning from one endlessly shocked-expression face to the next to the blatant racial discrimination to the poor and immature dialogue and monologues  that constitutes a quality film.Despite how much fun it is to watch these unintentionally hilarious films, this series is just plain trash and I'm glad it's over.
1. In 1992, no one heard you screamin the theatre.2. They didn't learn from Alien³ with Terminator 3, which ruined the notion of "No fate but what we make" set forth in Terminator 2. Alien³ follows suit in just the first 10 minutes by tossing out all you cared about Aliens.3. Incredibly, I originally gave this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I was 18 then and 18 years later, I've grown up, opened my eyes and tried to remember what kinds of drugs I was inhaling back then.4. Mostly, I'll recommend the "Uncut/Unrated/Unclothed" Special Editions of movies. In Alien³, you must skip it at all costs. An additional 31 USELESS minutes were added and in this "special" edition, they mercilessly deleted the only thing the ending had going for it: the chest-burst.5. Speaking of useless minutes, in the so-called Special Edition there's a successful trap set for the alien. In one of the brainless ideas caught on screenplay paper, it's released. Thank God for editors for theatrical releases.6. While I thoroughly praised Aliens, I feel I was enormously harsh on the original Alien. After #3, I deserve to be shot for saying anything against the original.7. Ripley (Weaver) went from housewife to warrior with her G.I. Jane 'do...untilshe bellied over in what appears to be PMS cramps for the other 90% of the movie. Yeah. That's both tough and appealing.8. Who cares if your previous installment makes $131 million worldwide  which, by the way, was good for 1986the suits will always try and tear down the budget for a part III by turning the realistic alien creatures intocartoons?9. Alien³ had flat out hilarious alien scenes (when they're chomping away or in the distance.) Today we would call it CGI, in 1992, it was called animated. And poorly.10. Weaver only saw green ($$) for Alien³. She obviously decided she was in it for the money. Joke's on her: this was the lowest grossing of the first three. Hell, it barely reached $55 million, which, by the way, was still bad in 1992.11. The original premise of Alien³ was for it to be set on earth, and unbelievably, they released even teasers for that idea. Too bad they scrapped that better script for the "lovely" locale of a prison planet with zero-chemistry, zero-brains and zero-depth inmates. Talk about expendable characters (SEE: plot of #1 and #2.)12. And WTF was with the series first (and completely irrelevant) sex scene? You cannot tell me prisoners make Ripley hot.13. Charles Dutton's character "Dillon" was some kind of swearing, mean-spirited and rambling holy man. Sounds like someone had a Buddy Christ doll on his dashboard, hmmm?14. The poster reveals "3 times the suspense. 3 times the danger. 3 times the terror." Affirmativeif you're multiplying 3 by zero.15. Spoiler: while the character of Ripley was very good in Alien and excellent in Aliens, she certainly took a backseat to Charles Dance's "Clemens" who was the only redeeming character that had depth, one you rooted for, andwhat did they do? Kill him off abruptly and without thought.16. Admittedly, it did have good sets (for what it was) and it contained one of the best scenes in any movie: the alien all but attempting to kiss Ripley. It would be too much of a spoiler to report why, but suffice to say that was the only great 10 seconds of 8700 seconds of footage.17. "The Company" is trying to get their paws on what they think are the last two aliens of the species. They need to Netflix part one again to remind them: there's a shitload of eggs still hanging out in a UFO on the original planet.18. Think what you will of Alien: Resurrection. That was the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade of apologies for Alien³.19. When a character professes to be human, and that character stated he created androids in his image, they shouldn't label him in the credits as "Bishop II" or any "II" when he's supposedly the original.20. Spoiler: It still boggles my mind that they deleted the Ripley line "For the last time" from the final product, and even the bloated special edition. Obviously, they wanted to leave this open for yet another sequel, but in reality, for fans of the series, we all know, it was, in fact, Ripley's last time.21. Thank God, this was only Director Fincher's first outing. Someone must've forgave him for Alien³ to allow him to make the superior films: Se7en, The Game, The Social Network and Fight Club.22. I'm aware Great Britain pretty much had its run of the world at one time, but how they conquered other worlds, such as this boring prison planet, is beyond me. (Okay, not getting my point across? Just try and understand half the words the brits in the movie are saying.)23. Ripley's character is afraid people will think she's crazy if she tells them there might be an alien stalking them in the shadows. Seriously? People, you can breathe on other planets. Is it really that much of a stretch that other organisms can, as well?24. This movie should be viewed by only the curious of what happened after Part II. The series should've ended with Part II as Part III didn't add hardly anything fresh, interesting, topical or suspenseful.25. Allow me to amend that: Don't be curious. Just don't watch this movie. Would you be curious to see what it feels to get your hand snapped in a rat-trap, or your ankle in a bear-trap? It's just common sense to stay away from something that will cause such agony. Alien³ is that kind of pain. Just avoid it.
Yes, I'm aware Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (or SAFFTEOTW) isn't to be taken seriously. It's a comedy, love story and barely a drama, but it's not the Walking Dead version of Armageddon.That said, I found it so hard to relate to these incredibly rich, all white and lucky SOBs who venture from one great shelter to the next without barely a scratch and while quickly dismissing all the good fortune they had at each stop.I'm getting ahead of myself. I actually did like SAFFTEOTW. (Wow, that's about as long as the title itself.) I found the story of "What if Armageddon's plan backfired and a real, non-Mayan, last day was set" and its peek at a few individuals who knew their fate was sealed. Steve Carrell was, rightfully, toned down, and better, was free-spirit Keira Knightley who showed the most depth to the film.As stated, the end is nigh  for real, this time, people!  and Dodge (huh) has just been dumped by his wife with mere weeks to go (to the end of days.) Already depressed Dodge is befriended by English lady Penny and her records. When a riot expels them from their homes, they venture to find family, true love and a Friendly's.Spoiler Alert! They don't show the obligatory falling skies scene  hell, they barely show any peril  and I missed that. I'm a sucker for Mass-Destructive scenes in movies. But, that's not really what this movie is about. It's a cute, often hilarious and well-written story of two people, um, seeking friendship at the end of the world. Highly recommended.
Surprise, surprise. I gave 1988's remake of the classic B-Movie/Steve McQueen The Blob eight out of 10 stars. Why? It didn't lie to me. And that's one of the qualities I love most about movies  truth.Don't lie to me. Don't make this remake of a B-Movie into a serious drama of goo-attacks. I've heard that Rob Zombie  who had a good track record until Halloween II (2009), is remaking it and I'm sure he'll make it more serious. Make that, the only serious "Blob" movie from the three that I know of: The Original, Son of Blob and this remake. Laughing out loud, he said in a quote  at least this is what I read and I'm paraphrasing, that he is going to remake/reimagine The Blob without, well, "the Blob." He stated he doesn't think audiences would be scared anymore of a goo, or "Blob," that attacks people. Isn't that like remaking Jaws without the shark, inland and about a boy and his dog?Point is, sure, someone else could come in and make a "serious" horror flick. And I would still go see it. But, for this 1988 remake, I was very pleased with the results of making a "modern" (for 1988 and 1980s audiences) absolute-B-Movie. It had everything: bad acting, bad dialogue, big-bad government, bad boy (Dillon) with a bad cycle, pretty prom girl, inept cops, parked & horny kids ready for slaughter, tons of gore, suspense, Stephen King-like Minister who knows the end is NEAR!, small town, tongue-in-cheek horror movie references, crowds (well, extras) scrambling from a giant beast of sorts, a strange love story, a twist finale and a growing and indestructible monster with a weakness, if that makes any sense. For this type of movie, who seriously could ask for more?Let's set the scene: Small Town, USA. High School Football unites community. Players wooing the pretty cheerleaders. Kids want into the latest horror "slice and dice." Bad Seed returns on a motorcycle. Bum in the woods collects cans for money andsuddenly a strange meteorite lands and some "goo" attaches itself to the vagrant's hand with some painful results.Let the gore, barely featured in the movie's predecessors, begin! He attempts to chop off his arm with an axe to no avail; the BLOB simply leap-frogs over the new and obviously painful giant paper cut and continues its digestion of the man's arm.Really, from this moment on is Point A to B to C for anyone who's anyone who's seen a classic B movie. Enter the bad boy who shows some heart, the cheerleader who wants to save the world and the adults who wouldn't believe them if they wrote their experiences in blood. They try to make people believe in the Blob, all the while trying to survive until the inevitable explosive and obvious climax, with the equally predictable twist ("leave it open to a sequel!" says the producer) finale.It's a small wonder this movie basically made NOTHING at the box office. Perhaps people were expecting what Zombie would direct later. I really don't know why anyone at the time (1988) would have such a problem; this movie is quintessential 1980s horror and definitely a late 80's homage to scary movies of the decade past. It even had some true suspenseful moments and a great ending you would expect from a movie of such caliber.Okay, okay, I grew up on the Blob and it did scare me. For, if it happens to touch you  you're GONE. (As previously mentioned, they prove that theory of mine by the failed attempts to chop off the arm to separate the body from the section being devoured by the Blob.) That said, I wasn't impressed (or liked) the additions/alterations to the Blob, such as the "arms," the "groans" or the color pink. I think this is the direction Zombie wants to take it: more alien, less goo. Uh, it's a BLOB, for the love of Pete. It's supposed to be Jell-O from Hell-O.Also, most of the special effects worked, but the ones that didn'twell, they REALLY didn't. Sure, it's labeled as a B-Movie, but cartoons don't belong in an all-live action flick.Only recommended to those who read this review and said, "Oh, yeah, I loved those times!" Like me, you'll enjoy this throwback to the good ole pre-CGI days.Side Note: I saw the opening credits and I bypassed Kevin Dillon's name immediately since I already knew who he was and that he was the new anti-hero of the picture. But then, I recognized the name "Shawnee Smith" and knew I knew that name. Even watching the entire movie, I still didn't recognize her. Thank you, IMDbaw; she was a Saw III (or part 1 onward) favorite of mine. Man  she does NOT look like she aged much during the decade or so jump from this movie and her first Saw appearance.
Spoiler alert! The Scooby Gang, or as they refer to themselves as: the "Expendables," spend what feels like twenty meaningless minutes inside a pub towards the end. It was irrelevant, boring, dragging and made me comment to my movie buddy that I was expecting the end credits to show the inevitable After-Bar-Denny's trip and extend out the overly long movie even further.Yeah, I'm starting at the end of The Expendables 3, but that should give you a taste for what you are in for. The first two films were R-Rated and here, they the cut back the MPAA to PG-13 and yet, increased the running time 23 minutes more than both the first two. Even without that additional time, the movie was clearly 40 minutes too long.Please, someone fire that editor. Scenes were overly long  including many that just show the reaction shot of a character for at least 10-15 seconds when it was neither funny nor normal, additional plot points were introduced and neither explored or returned to and despite the franchise norm of adding as many iconic action/adventure heroes from past and present, there were far too many characters and actors that were completely irrelevant and mostly obnoxious. Antonio Banderas played the most annoying character in the series history and could've easily been cut.Basically, it's the same old "I'm getting too old for this sh|t" storyline  which, oddly, is never spoken in a movie featuring Mel Gibson and after the last movie full of Action Hero catchphrases. Sylvester Stallone plays leader Barney of a D-Team of mercenaries and spends most of the movie running around in circles while trying to protect his friends from death and leading young, able bodies into certain death. His loyalty is admirable until his questionable actions for the up and coming HUMAN BEINGS he cares little about isnever explored.Barney repeatedly ditches the best men for the job of eliminating the one bright spot of the film: Gibson's Stonebanks, and repeats the Ocean's Trilogy search for a (truly) Expendable crew and for an obscene amount of footage with Kelsey Grammar. How he's labeled as an "Action Hero from Days Past" is beyond me. My suggestion half-way through this was: Where's Danny Glover? I understand Jackie Chan refuses to be in the film series, but why not pair up Glover with the returning (and sadly, disgraced) Mel Gibson? Especially when the, again, "Getting too old for this sh|t" plot is relevant.Admittedly, some of the action works with the exception of the never- ending clichés of bad guys who are easily disposed of while the good guys are rarely scratched. In addition, SOME one-liners work and I'm being very generous there. (85% ARE NOT humorous and most fall flat.) And the countless cameos and appearances  an Expendables staple  are okay, but if this movie is any indication, Episode VII's Han Solo is gonna look as old as Yoda did when he passed in Episode VI.Sure, the humor, action, guns and kick-ass-action are supposed to be an homage to 80s Giants, but some of it gets a little more silly than I remembered it. For example, Good-Guy has chance to kill Bad-Guy (he's in a helicopter above the Expendables) and yet after the 1,516 rounds of ammo they fired off, they ceased fire on him  THEIR TARGET. Also, Good- Guy lets Bad-Guy explain whole plot to the freshmen Expendables and even lets him live in an obvious rip-off of the Mission: Impossible series. Further, a ton of time is spend on a third-rate character we barely even know, who was shot, hospitalized and we are supposed to care. I had to ask my friend, repeatedly, which one was he again? And finally, Bad-Guy not only can hear all of what that the Good-Guys are planning, he literally gives them 45 seconds to survive when he could've killed them on second one. He even complains and kills another later because he's so mad that, I guess, he dropped the ball?I didn't like the aimless and choppy first installment. That said, I gave the second one a chance, and loved it almost 10x more. It had more direction, plot, straightforwardness and perfectly aligned camp to make it passable. Kinda like what Piranha 3D was going for and was successful at. True, I didn't have high expectations for part 3, but I didn't expect a ton of wasted time on screen and so much talent dismissed. I mean, Jason Statham is one of my all-time favorites and he's just reduced to almost nothing on screen. And don't get me started on what they did to Jet Li. They didn't just waste him; they shortened his role to, ah-hem, "short jokes."Nope. This movie gets no recommendation even though it's definitely not the worst movie or action movie I've seen recently. It just doesn't work and is the overkill most Part 3s are.* * *Final thoughts: At very least, my movie-buddy and I had a blast while mocking this movie in the theatre. We kept air high-fiving each other because the characters  the, um, BIG, BUFF, BUTCH, ACTION HEROES  were acting like children when a tense situation was resolved. You'll hear them cheer their teammates on like they were on a Saved by the Bell episode. Despite the many curse words, I understand they were trying to tone it down to a PG-13, but in a ton of scenes  mostly in the last act  they all-but made it G-Rated. Finally, some entertainment: I couldn't help but laugh hard at the movie in the finale.
If I could write a screenplay with the quality of one tenth of the movie Wonder Boys, I'd be enormously happy. If I could write a novel with a smidgen of one hundredth of the source material, Wonder Boys by Michael Chabon, I'd have died and gone to literary Heaven.This movie is literally perfect and is directed by Curtis Hanson, director of another one of my all time favorite movies: L.A. Confidential. I love stories that take place in 24 (or less) hours, but willing to accept movies that span a life-altering weekend, in which this is.This movie is about growing, realizing, waking up, making choicesbut mostly about characters.I side mostly with Prof. Grady Tripp, played elegantly by Michael Douglas. NO ONE could have done better. He's the college professor who everyone wants, who I would want. Not perfect by any means: He smokes more pot than he eats munchies, he had a one-hit wonder (hence the title of the movie, a true wonder boy) but has hit a brick wall since and he's attempting just to make it through life without making a choice to make him think. Though it appears on the surface he doesn't care, he does have a dash of humanity left. There's something in him, some spark that's still alive, but barely.I see a lot of myself in him  even though I don't partake in the pot smoking. We both carry the empty shell of the person we were once. Only, this is fiction and in his life-changing weekend, as portrayed in the film, he grows and the spark gets brighter. If only we could imitate fiction.Then there's Terry Crabtree, the "sometimes" gay played beautifully by Robert Downey Jr. This is LONG before his career began, again that is. I admired him so much in this: his quick wit, his never-ending believability in his acting and that all shot Downey Jr. straight to the top ten of my Best Actors list. In addition, I began noticing another up'n'comer little closer: Tobey Maguire. Though he was really good in his James Leer role, he seemed like he wasn't quite there yet. Read the book and you'll experience the depth this character really had. In Wonder Boys, Maguire did add humor, humility and originality, but he eventually would show all of those qualities greater in later projects.The remaining crew were good but were always in the shadows of the above mentioned characters. Rip Torn was wonderful in his Great Writer Extraordinaire role. Frances McDormand was acceptable as the mistress, Sara, with issues of her own. The weakest link, but still watchable, was Katie Holmes as Hannah Green as the seductive student housemate of Tripp with blatantly obvious motivations, though she really set the tone and balanced the Leer character when they joined the screen or mentioned each other.Beyond the fantastic characters was the excellent script, the cinematography, the freeness and freshness of the characters, the great symbolism of the bridges  really notice how many there were, and why, the dialogue was pitch perfect, the humor makes me roll each time and the pacing absolutely dead on. It's slow, but it makes you really fit into these lives. They couldn't have sped it up a second more or slowed it down any further. You get enthralled in growing with them, experiencing and seeing what they endure and yearn for a better outcome for all involved.Let's jump back to Tripp. He's a middle-to-late aged male. He's got it together (prior to the weekend in the movie) but he's also VERY human. The movie begins as the Professor defends his student Leer in his dark tales of literature. Prior to this his wife has left him, for good, supposedly. His mistress is both pregnant and married to his boss and she disavows not only his pot smoking lifestyle but his aimless ambition. He tries to make the right decisions, but fails, then just acts like someone half his age to make up and continue what his younger self would've done. Have a fun adventure.His mission is to save James Leer from self destruction. It's painfully obvious; he's really in it to save himself, but nevertheless leaves a good enough impression on the boy (Leer) to do some good in the world while balancing his love (Sara,) the nagging of his failing publisher, keeping his job and his roommate at bay. Heck, I didn't even mention the dog or car. There really is a lot packed in to this movie and in reality, if he were to step back, this would not have been the weekend to change. Butthere we go.All this depth, all this wonderful filmmaking with heart and yet, it still manages to fit in a fantastic soundtrack which includes one of my all-time favorite songs, let alone one of my all-time favorite movie-songs: Things Have Changed by Bob Dylan. I didn't grow up Dylan, but this (like Johnny Cash's The Man Comes Around from Dawn of the Dead) opened my eyes wide.As I began this review, I pointed out I couldn't write anywhere near the quality of this film. In reality, I don't care. I write what I write. They write how they see fit. Stepping aside, I truly admire both this screenplay and performances. They captured enough of one of the greatest books I've ever read to truly capture what the essence of the original story portrayed. My advice: See the movie and then experience the book. Your life will be enhanced.
Let's get the positive out first, for a first. I LOVED the graphics in How to Train Your Dragon. In a lot of ways, even though it was animated, it was thoroughly more believable than the similar Avatar.Yep, I said positive, as in singular, not that the movie was bad, or was dragon (ha, uh, never mind) but the story was so incredibly basic, clichéd, predictable and overdone that even though it might have had "heart" at its core, I was so overwhelmed with the same'ole'same'old'stuff that I couldn't get into the characters. It probably doesn't help that I CANNOT STAND Jay Baruchel. Even his voice. And he's the main character, Hiccup.I've been told this is geared towards kids. Yeah, blah, blah, I know, but in the age of Pixar, or heck, the last of the great Disney Dynasty films: The Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast, Aladdin or The Lion King, there is NO excuse for not having a great, even mesmerizing script. And because of the weak screenplay, it shares more qualities with Avatar than just dragons(-like creatures.)Like I reported: the graphics were amazing and brought you into their fantasy world. But so did Wall-E, and tell me which one was better when it came to having both cool effects in conjunction with a great story?AnyhooHiccup is the weakest link in the village'o'vikings who battle dragons on a daily basis and being the son of the leader of the pack, Stoick (Butler) he has to prove himself. But, surprise, he can't when he does land one of the rarest of dragon breeds. Another surprise  if the title doesn't give it away  is that he both befriends and aids the recovery of the dragon when his tail was cut. Further surprise occurs when he learns they're not the threat his town folk fear and he becomes affectionate with Toothless, the dragon.I'm having trouble coming up with more words that would precede "surprise" so let's sum up the rest: a girl he likes becomes suspicious, he must lie to protect both himself and his "pet/friend" and the finale's seen a mile away if you already knew the above after pretty much just the first surprise/spoiler's revealed.I will say, the one "twist" they put on this century's old plot, was the dragon's motivations. I admit I liked that, but it wasn't enough to mask the other 95 minutes of predictability.The REAL story here, and why I am recommending this, is the cinematography. The movie's beautiful and extremely well crafted. I've suggested leave-your-brain-at-the-door movies before, so I will here because otherwise you'll miss out on the beauty of this film. That said, I won't be rushing to see the inevitable sequel, but I'm glad I experienced this cinematic experience.
Why can't Iron Man, Thor or Hulk be more like the Cap?Growing up, Captain America was so uninteresting to me, I barely looked at his covers as I collected and read dozens of other comics weekly. It wasn't until his "First Avenger" movie  which I had previously dreaded and waited to see  did I become a huge fan. That movie was fantastic and oodles better than Tony Stark's second and third films as well as both Thor movies.And so is Cap's follow-up "stand-alone" adventure: Captain America: The Winter Soldier.I truly liked this movie and strongly believe it will improve with each viewing. It was a much more adult comic book movie, but not overly serious, like the Dark Knight trilogy or Man of Steel. It also knew how to handle multiple agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. efficiently. (A lesson learned in The Avengers but lost on most comic book movies, i.e. Spider-Man 3 and the original Batman sequels.)The Captain continues to doubt anyone as patriotic and heroic as himself in this chapter, and with good reason. The age-old "trust no one," though annoying and overused, is this movie's tagline, or should be. But, with the help of his friends, the so-called "mystery" is unraveled and Cap, (a personal favorite) Black Widow and a new-comer agent fight all over the place, but mostly in (and above) the D.C./East Coast areas.I'm totally not giving away the synopsis as I normally would, but not to avoid spoilers. This movie isn't plot-heavy, and most of its been done before many, many times, so there's really not much to give away here and you can, and should, just sit back and enjoy the inside jokes, the sometime surprises, the other Marvel mentions, the action and the sly winks at the audience. I.E. make sure you read what's on a character's tombstone at the end of the movie.Definitely a high recommendation for this film: Great action, depth of the characters, another shot to see Black Widow in pretty much the whole movie, more great lines and action from Chris Evans's fantastic portrayal as the Cap and, of course, the never-ending and wonderful Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury (and attitude.)* * * Final thoughts: DO NOT wait to see the final TWO Marvel spots during the credits. But, if you do  again, don't, they're really blah  look for all the "Steve/Steven/Stephen/Stephan"s in the credits. Either I must be truly popular, it's homage to Steve Rogers or just an amazing coincidence. Yeah, probably the third one.
Oh. My, my, my. Why even bother watching/reviewing Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (or Part IV) other than my obsession in completing a franchise /series reviews for my site?* Part 2 was vile. Part 3 was worse. Part 4 fell even further. But I honestly don't see any real point in diving in on how bad and badly made this diseased series has become. A quick summary was it appeared to be completely improved, no script, no consistency and no reason for Leatherface (now with yet another new family  reason ??) to be a drag queen.Prom Night occurs and incredibly dumb kids get lost, blah blah, they're lead back to yet another creepy house and seated around another disgusting table, blah blah, they're terrorized. Only this time  spoiler! Actually in this case I don't mind spoiling, as it might save you more time to spend with loved ones than watching this crud  they introduce some dominatrix male in a suit who controls everything for whatever dumb reason. I believe this was to lead into a part 5 that (THANK GOD) never happened, much like the open ended plot holes that happened in both at the end of Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers and Aliens Vs. Predators.As much as I was angry at life after Texas Chainsaw 2 and 3, I think I just gave up during this viewing. Sure, as bad as the predecessor sequels were, this takes the absolute cake in horrible film making. It has wretched acting, intolerable dialogue and a pointless script.Despite the fact I wouldn't normally agree with actors attempting to halt film releases when they have already completed a film, I have to side, just for the extreme embarrassment defense, with both McConaughey and Zellweger's feeble attempts to stop Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation from being freed to the world. Unfortunately they lost. What kind of world do we live in when OJ (originally) walks and this movie is distributed. There is no justice after all.Does it go without saying: SKIP IT? * - Side Note: I did go out of order. I first rewatched TCM Remake, then the remake's prequel, followed by TCM 2, 3 and 4. I still have to go back to the absolute beginning to complete the series of reviews. I do pray they don't make any more.
Any movie that's title is the main character has a lot riding it. They need the perfect actor to live up to, well, the name. Julia Roberts did it wonderfully in Erin Brockovich. No coincidence, her friend and regular costar, George Clooney, is equally excellent as the title character of Michael Clayton.Despite my biased love for Attorneys/Courtroom Dramas, Gambling Addicts, Suspenseful Mysteries and Slowly, but Beautifully Paced Messages of Growth & Redemption, of which, this movie is all of those, I still have to step back and not only call this the #1 movie of 2007 but one of the best movies I've ever seen.Oh, lest I forget, I also have a lot in common with a Mr. Michael Clayton, who happens to be fictional, but still. We're both gamblers, both specializing in poker. We're both juggling a lot and both of us are tired, very tired. And we're both in "middle" men job positions, only mine pays more!  Again, he's fictional and my money's real.As that last paragraph was a failed attempt at humor, it still holds true. I saw a lot of myself in him. Even when I am tired, and I'm not talking drowsy, I am down, but when need be, the shell of the person I used to be wakes up and acts. Much like the superb acting of George Clooney, who was nominated for an Oscar, and should have won. As was his co-star, Tom Wilkinson, who played Arthur to the tee. That was the best performance I've ever seen from him.Who did win, also definitely deserved an Oscar, was Tilda Swinton as Karen the Kover-up girl. She showed true humanisms in her evilness. Perhaps she wasn't evil, per se, but felt she needed to make "choices" to both help her company and her career. More so, I think she was leaning on keeping up her lifestyle even though it was wearing her down.Everyone here, pretty much, was worn down. It could be the high stress jobs they had, or just that the little white evil pill they sold their soul for in decades past finally expanded in their gut like one of those animal sponge toys kids play with in baths. All key actors, including the late and great Sydney Pollack, were pitch-perfect. No one gave a bad performance or made any inkling of unbelievable behaviors.The script was also top notch. It was like a grown up (and more realistic) John Grisham film. Grisham films tend to be fun, exciting and suspenseful, but practical they're not. (All, except A Time To Kill, that is.) Here we have the usual suspects: Big Eco-(un)Friendly Firm who's inadvertently poisoning'n'profiting and is represented by Clayton's law firm. Only, Clayton's more of a "Janitor" to clean up the client or big wig's messes. He's assigned to take care of lawyer peer who went Looney and streaked naked after a client when his evil pill got too large. Or should we just say, his conscious became conscious, finally.Clayton's still playing the game, or just running through the motions of life around him. He's so depressed, or tired, that the juggling act he has going on doesn't even phase him anymore. Hmmm, there's his ex-wife who watches his good son who needs attention, he's a recovering gambling addict, he has a failed business in junction with a large amount due to the wrong people, his clients are yelling at him, there's a potential merger at his job that might risk his future, oh and I forgot, someone's trying to kill him, immediately after a friend "commits suicide." All the while, he needs to wake up and fast to solve a mystery or end up asleep for good. In naysayer's defense to Michael Clayton as a film, it's not that difficult as a mystery. I'm happy about that  I don't always like spending 1 hour 58 minutes of a two hour movie trying to figure things out and not just simply enjoying the film.So, this might sound simple and easy to decipher, but that's where the well-written script by Tony Gilroy (another Academy Award Nominee for both writing and directing, not to mention Best Picture) really shines on the simplicity of both evil and character depth and development. The pacing is a tad bit slow and every bit welcome. You get to enjoy the richness of these soulless wanderers while they strive for redemption or revenge. In either case, the ones who are trying to hold onto the emptiness in any aspect in life, should perish while the ones who just let go (Network's "I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!") at very least should try to do some good if they're on their way to hell.This movie was excellent. It's not spitting in your face GO GREEN, though that's part of the message. It's showing you, no matter what you've done; you can make the right choice. It's the hardest one when you're inches from rock bottom and you're getting tired from scratching your way to at least maintain that positionbut it's still possible to come back.Maybe I'm just looking too deep. I almost always have fun with Clooney and his quick wit and one-liners, whether funny or dead serious, are always a draw for me. Neither himself, nor anyone else lets you down in this character-driven classic. SEE IT!
Granted. I'm not a fan of long winded tales, and even less of the old West, but dang. Django Unchained was too damn long. It truly should've been his next Vol. 1 one year, and Vol. 2 the next; I would've loved, needed, the intermission.O.K. trying not to start off in the wrong cowboy bootI did like this movie, and especially loved Christoph Waltz and his amazing character, Dr. King (huh.) Schultz. Surprisingly, the star and title character, Django (and Jamie Fox's performance) was so incidental to Schultz, it's a wonder why he was cast.Oh, that's right; Samuel L. Jackson was too old and needed to play the "old black man/slave role."In normal Tarantino mode, the movie starts one way and even advertises that premise, and then switches gear even before the movie's half over. There are the typical long-winded dialogue scenes that, mercifully, don't go on as long as his Inglourious Basterds or Death Proof shots did. There is the excessive gore and (way too loud) soundtrack  which happens to be his worst one, to date. And there is the quick zoom-ins that remind people that Tarantino loves those old Grindhouse films.Get past all that, like I did, and I did enjoy the journey of the enormously smart and quick-witted bounty hunter, Schultz. Oh, I guess, and his "the 'D' is silent" sidekick, Django.Picture it: the old West. Slaves haven't been freed and what is the deal with Lincoln-era films this year? Sorry. Where was I? Slave Django is acquired by Dr. Schultz in order to find three unwise men and after becoming fond of each other, the movie switches to the retrieval of Django's wife.Blood, tears, gore, comedy, revenge and bullets are all Tarantino Trademarks and you'll get an abundance here. Watch this for some quick wit, some slave owner's just deserts and overall, the awesome Christoph Waltz.
So, Flight is another movie that made me kinda mad prior to seeing it, thanks to the trailers.From what I remembered  and now, rewatching it, the preview promised action, comedy, suspense, courtroom thrillingand when you see it, you will, indeed, get all thatfor about 10 minutes out of 138. Unfortunately, I was told this fact prior to seeing it, even though I try not to listen or read anything about films I see beforehand, and they were dead on.That said, at least I was prepared. This movie is a big-screen Lifetime Film about addiction first and foremost and the slight background is that action-packed plane tipping scene in the trailer. Oh, and that "courtroom scene"? Well, it's really not a courtroom and that disappoints me since I do love the very few courtroom movies produced since the birth of cinema.And after I've already wrote, I actually kinda liked the finished product. Perhaps, because I was prepared? Or perhaps, I understand addictionfartoowell.Drunk pilot Whip Whitaker  really, that's his name, and with the star's name, (Denzel) Washington playing him, we got the WWW  takes the pilot's seat to what could be a dysfunctional plane. Sort of like him, I suppose. In order to save the "102 souls onboard," Whitaker inverts the plane and lands the best anyone could've done.Unfortunately for him, his life gets a lot worse following the crash landing as his defense team (including friends, relatives and attorneys) scramble to keep the alcoholic out of jail for flying intoxicated. Only, Whitaker's not helping at all.Will Whip Whitaker wind up winning or wosing? (Sorry, that was bad. So what if I'm drinking right now while writing this? Ha.)At any rate, I can see why Washington was nominated: he was, in fact, good, but not great enough to win. So that, Oscars, I agree with. And the movie, itself, was a tad bit confused on what it really wanted to be  and I am excluding the misleading trailer. At times, and even leading up to the climax, it threw in unusual humor that really didn't fit the scene or mood. It was almost as if they were trying to get us to side with the fact he might be able to get away with flying "102 souls" while drunk.The movie's a tad bit long with his journey of alcoholism and only really perks in the finale scene that I really liked. Bookmarked, in reverse, that is, I liked the opening and exciting flight inverting. It's the middle part that's not necessarily bad, but doesn't even remotely hold up a second viewing ever.Recommended? Eh. Sure, why not. Have a few drinks, thoughIt is a long film and I do love irony.
Brokeback Mountain *****/5 stars 10/21/09This review of 'Brokeback Mountain' is long overdue. I first saw this in 2005, the night before it opened as a sneak-preview. I feel in love with it then, and now, and 4-5 viewings, I consider it a masterpiece. And I do so, from personal experience. I can certainly relate to what the main characters are going through, and watching their facial expressions, eyes and motions; they are truly real. I've gone through what they did (for the most part.) What society teaches us, at a very young age, is: grow, get married, have offspring. There is no room for people that think outside the box. And so these two lead cowboys did just that. Sad. Tragedy ensured, of course. They were the square pegs in round holes that tried what society taught them and they cheated to their one true love: each other. If there were no other evidence, there's the Academy Awards that ignored this masterpiece due to homophobia. Tragic that they missed out on a perfect film in all categories: music, score, beautiful cinematography, acting, script/dialogue, originality. I mean, this movie worked on every level. But, what I focused in on was, very simply, these two heterosexual actors showing true love for each other on screen. I truly believed that from the get-go. I would've rated the movie the same if it were cowboy and girl, as long as they led me to believe in their need of each other. Two cowboys meet and fall in love, but (as previously mentioned) society taught them the breeder way and they part company only to meet up several times a year for 20 years. Trust me, for people that object to this kind of love, you see this as black/white but the heart bleeds/cries when it can't be whole.Side Note: I hope this movie serves as a message for young viewers (of age to see it, that is): Please don't waste your time, 20 years in this film's timeline, listening to others. If you find true love like this and even if it only lasts but a moment, cherish it. Nurture it. I don't condone adultery. So don't let it get to that. I felt for the women (well, not so much for Hathaway character  she was married for convenience) and I would dump someone cheating on me. Know who you are before getting into a committed relationship. Definitively know who and what you are prior to having children. Too many of my gay friends had children and they, their ex's and absolutely the children, pay for the inevitable break up when they finally realized who they were. Spend time finding yourself before diving right into a so-called committed relationship.Side Note 2: I am sad this movie fell amongst the curse of a lot of movies. It's great, excellent even, until it gets too much press. I loved (and still do) 'Titanic' and 'The Blair Witch Project.' I saw them both opening weekends. My opinion never changed as the weeks/months/years passed. I know what I like or what makes a great film. No public opinion will change that. But the curse is, the more exposure a film gets, the more criticism it gets, i.e. "Oh, I heard it was the best ever! But it sucked!" You should judge on the qualities, not what your neighbor says.Side Note 3: I was still recently very bitter on the good (but not great) 'Crash' winning the best picture Oscar. I liked 'Crash.' But it was highly unoriginal (even for its time) and 10x less of the movie 'Brokeback' is. Years later, it was reported that the main reason 'Brokeback' lost, was due to the fact that more than half of the Academy voters refused to watch the movie based on the homosexual content. If I hated them before, this was the final nail in the coffin. Each year, I watch all 5 movies (soon to be 10) that are nominated before making my own conclusion of the choices given. If I am unable to do so, I will not make my pick. This is blasphemy, bigotry and phobia at its worst. Though I am saddened, ashamed and disgusted at their inactivity, I finally came to believe that one of the most honored films in history (from all the other awards it won,) it doesn't matter. We'll always have homophobia, as we do racists. Does it make this film any less perfect? No. If anything, it makes me want to find my own soul mate, my own "Brokeback Mountain" and disown the select bigots that inhabit society.
Though Insomnia wasn't Robin Williams's first trip to the dark side, nor was it Al Pacino's first cop drama, it was, in fact, their best performances in their respectable roles as such.I truly liked this movie a lot. It had elements of The Silence of the Lambs and the beauty of Alaska. No one could've played a sleep-deprived cop like Pacino. He already looks 80% asleep in most of his roles. Williams was superb as the incredibly un-clichéd antagonist. His character, writer Walter Finch, was smart, but not brilliant. He actually seemed like how normal people would react if they were, in fact, in his predicament. And Hilary Swank, well, she's been better in other movies, and she's no Marge Gunderson (played by Frances McDormand in Fargo.) Yet, she did what she could and was still entertaining.That all said, the real stars of the movie were the fantastic script and scenery. Gorgeous locales that make you walk in their sleepwalking shoes. Thanks to the screenplay and backdrops, you could feel every ounce of pain that the Detective Will Dormer (Pacino) was feeling. Now, knowing his background and if he's really a good person, that'll take you a bit.A young girl is killed in the town of no sundown in Alaska (this period of the year, that is) and L.A. Detectives Dormer and Eckhart (Donovan) are called up North to assist the wet-behind-the-ears Ellie Burr (Swank) in solving it. Ellie's ecstatic: Dormer's her hero; she's written papers on him and memorized some of his statements. She's also naïve, but not entirely stupid.Apparently both Dormer & Eckhart had left L.A. in the nick of time as they were being investigated by Internal Affairs for some "wrong doing" in one of Dormer's cases. Up there, it's not necessarily smooth sailing as Dormer cannot sleep for more reasons than the sun won't go down. As they close in on the killer, mistakes are made, including a fatal one in which the real killer attaches onto.This movie is not perfect, but it's a definite homage to the suspenseful mysteries of the past. Only, this time, it's directed masterfully by one of the greatest directors of all time, Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Memento.) It does have powerful performances, crisp cinematography, daring dialogue and really human characters that make this one of the most believable cat 'n mouse films to watch. SEE IT!
Talk about being almost completely snubbed at the Oscars in 1998The Horse Whisperer is a near-masterpiece of filmmaking. Beautiful cinematography, gorgeous score, excellent acting, deep messages, perfect mix of humor and tragedy and deliberately slow-paced to absorb it all the more.I tear up every time I see the daughter breaking down, I've listened to the score 10x more than I've seen the movie and my this is one of my favorite movie stories:One of my many, many Vegas trips caught me tiring tremendously on day four of four. While my friends wanted to walk the strip and window shop, I was hot, tired and all-but broke. I decided on my first (of just a few) movie(s) I'll see in Las Vegas. It was a cool theatre, no one hardly was in there and it was a very long and slow movie I absolutely needed at that time. This experience was one of my favorites because it fit my mood, lifted my spirits (again, broke) and it was a great movie, to boot.
and frightless, as well.Evil Dead (2013,) the second remake of the 1981 original did have its moments and it sure as hell was creepy and bloody, but did it hold up to the original? No. Did it even come close to the lesser, though still very good Army of Darkness? Nope. But, at least it trumped the first remake, Evil Dead II.It might be best to start over and not compare it to the source material(s), and let it stand on its own. Of course, even then, it was just the run-of-the-mill horror fare as of late running amok with clichés, the stereotypical young and dumb adults proving their idiocracy with every single turn and contained more gore than frights  a sign of incompetent writing in regards to horror.Of course, what's scary is subjective, but I found nothing terrifying. Just a handful of bloody and gross shots and completely unrealistic endurances and actions from the living.If this movie wasn't so bent on being serious  yeah, going back to the source material for a moment  and shedding its established campiness from the first three installments, I would've given it a pass. But, since it does provide us with rules for the evil spirits and "normal ones" for the still breathing, I had the hardest time suspending any disbelief from what these buffoons could physically do to themselves and not just survive, but thrive. And those plot holes and inconsistenciesthose were a pain to ignore as well.Following an actually decent opening scene, where veteran Evil Dead fans knew how it would play out, five young adults venture to the absolute creepiest cabin this side of Jason Voorhees's shack in Friday the 13th Part 2. Naturally, no one questions this, and decide this is the best place to detox one of the fivesome.Pausing a minute for character depth and who's whoOh, wait, they never did, so I don't have anything to report other than one female is another male's girlfriend and the druggie was that male's sister. Whew, by saving time to never completely introduce the main stars or establishing eventual empathy for them, it gives the writers time to get to the only reason to make this movie: gore.Anyhoo, one of our "heroes," a blatant (albeit terrible copy) "Marty Mikalski" rip off character from The Cabin in the Woods and Eric Stoltz-look alike actually named, ah-hem, Eric in the movie, reads from a book found in the cellar and our strung out female gets the Evil Dead bug. How she did, which was homage to the original The Evil Dead, was far less inventive, although it did cause a couple to get up and leave my movie theater.Stopping therethe title alone should NOT fool anyone. They weren't trying to be comical, though deceiving, by naming it: A Family Fun Cabin in the Woods. What would someone possibly expect by buying a ticket to: EVIL DEAD and then getting offended by gore?At any rate, you know the story, even if you hadn't seen any of the four (so far) Evil Dead films: she gets possessed, confusion ensues and death becomes them.Admittedly, some of the later scenes in the movie, when the heat finally picks up, were effective and gross; even I had to turn away once. But, if you added up every scene that I thought was successful to a film in this genre, you could fit those in the final third of the trailer and save us all some time. And the lack of more original ideas pales in comparison to something (or one) else the film omitted.Sadly, Bruce Campbell was not in this. Reasons of, to the date and time of this writing, are unknown to me on why not. Perhaps, again, they wanted to shift away from the camp, or he was too busy on another project or, maybe, he read the script co-written from the gal who brought usJennifer's Body. I doubt he would've been able to save this movie, but at least he would've been the highlight.Final thoughts: I didn't hate this movie, nor really disliked it. Blah, yeah. Despite it being a remake, unoriginal, uh-huh. Would I want to see it again? Nope. Buteven though I would recommend any Evil Dead newbie to watch just Part 1 (1981) and Part 3 (Army of Darkness), you could do worse than this mindless splatterfest.
What hasn't been said before? Well, nothing from me, that is, until now.I was much too young, or so my parents were to tell me later, to see 1977's Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope.) Granted, I was three at the time of release, but I'm sure I would remember at least some of it.Most of my childhood memories of the Star Wars franchise came from the follow-up, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. So, basically, my earliest memories would be of my love of Yoda, the main "spoiler" of father/son and the big walking dogs at the beginning in the snow.Not those weren't great memories  they were, but I was envious of all the other boys (and some girls) around my age that experienced the absolute joy the original Star Wars film gave them.This movie had everything for almost everyone: young/old, adventurous/romantic, Sci-Fi/grounded. So, any boy or girl who got a chance to see this must've absolutely loved it when it was released.Unfortunately, since I was not part of that bracket of "younglings," I can only admire it from an older kid/adult point of view.This movie, no matter when you watch it  meaning now, in 2014, or back when it opened, is an incredible landmark in filmmaking.There are movies that change the course of all film history and this one is absolutely in the top five of that list. Jaws, The Blair Witch Project/Paranormal Activity, Toy Story, The Matrix, Airplane! and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs also appear on that list, but Star Wars (Ep. IV) should be on the top or near it. I truly believe this carved a huge section of my generation.I understand this wouldn't have had the biggest of budgets, and in this case, it is a benefit. Case in point: Watch the "new" trilogy, i.e. Episodes I-III and then this "follow-up" and see the difference. There are a thousand things/objects/mostly CGI in I-III in each shot and far, far less here. I did just watch I-IV and let me assure you: the simplicity of A New Hope was not only refreshing, but exhilarating. It was this minimalism, whether intentional or not, that made me cheer this one far and above I-III.The story is an age-old one of good vs. evil, heroism, get-the-girl, underdog and David and Goliath. Despite its "unoriginality," it all fit perfectly and was understandable for both the very young and reminiscing elders. I don't generally forgive movies that have bad dialogue or poor acting, but when it's called for and it is what the movie needs, it's a necessity. Here it is. Of course, they, or more specifically Georgie Lucas, tried to recapture that for the prequels and failed miserably. It was welcomed here with this story and it shouldn't have gone further into the late 90s and into mid-2000s.At any rate, have you not seen this movie? SEE IT. If you're privileged and lucky enough, do NOT see the Special Edition which throws unnecessary and some horrible shots in  i.e. the unintentionally laugh-out-loud scene with Jabba the Hut. If you can find the original cut, see that. I, and I know I am NOT ALONE, wish that edition would come on BluRay.Until it does, may the force be with you. Always.* * * Final thoughts: Following this (#??) viewing, I just had to revisit my two personal favorite spoofs of this movie: Family Guy's Blue Harvest and the everlasting classic: Hardware Wars. Now, there has been dozens, if not hundreds of spoofs, spin-offs, imitations and homage's to Star Wars (Episode IV,) but those two were absolutely the best  yeah, even better than that mostly unfunny and tedious Spaceballs.I have been known to quote Hardware Wars 10x more in my life than the actual Star Wars. And I am proud of that.
Fargo II: The Country of Old Man could've been the title and that would be cool since it had no continuity with the Cohen's other film.I loved, LOVED, No Country for Old Men. And I'm not even a western kind of guy. Before you squint, this is truly a western.The movie is not modern day. The film deals with multiples of outlaws and firearms. And it's even set in Texas. It contains all an old-west feel with twists of many story lines.This Best Picture winner has so many story lines, in fact, that it's hard to nail a synopsis on it. Suffice to say, it's about a drug deal that went wrong, a man who takes advantage of it, a psycho who's smarter than the average robber, a cop on the way out and so much more. I've already given too much away. But, I will say, this is a gem that appreciates in value and cinematography.Some might have a problem with the finale. Or even all the events leading up to the closing. I am not one of those people. And I will not ruin the "big surprise" of someone leaving the movie abruptly, but I actually loved that making this movie all the more original and fun.Highly recommended. Just know, beforehand, you're headed into old country. When real stories were real.
Never have I wished so hard for the little devil fish to show up and chop on the spring break characters, like in 2010's Piranha 3D, as I did during Spring Breakers.This movie, that's easily categorized as: zero redeemable characters, almost zero plot and zero focus, makes up a 45-minute depressing music video stretched twice as long. All the way through it, it reminded me of the 2001 Bully movie, but without the interesting characters, depth, good dialogue, plot and believable and satisfying ending.Granted, James Franco actually had a good performance here, pending he was attempting to channel a 2003 MTV gangsta character. Sadly, for the performances of the rest of the film, that was it. That was not just the stand-out acting job, it was the only one. When the movie contains mostly blonde, distastefully inhuman and interchangeable skanks, it fails by establishing who's who.The three main actresses here aren't just cardboard characters, they're completely identical. It's bad enough we don't care a lick of any of their futures  or present or where they came from, but we can't even tell each other apart. No matter; there's nothing to cling to.Unless all you want to do is look at soft-porn for a feature-length film. And if so, you've come to the right place.Spring Breakers is just that: soft-porn with a slightly higher budget and multiple gun cocking. Repeatedly. Annoyingly. Over and over, you'll either hear guns cocking or the same scene and set of dialogue recurring. As stated, this movie probably would've worked best as a 45-minute film, something MTV would've broadcast 10 years ago.The incredibly basic rundown of the movie, is four selfish, bored and terribly annoying college chicks with not enough money to fulfill their spring break appetites decide it would be a good idea to rob a place for their missing funds and in the process, cause as much damage and terror just for the thrill of it, I guess.Well, they get away with it  and get used to that, and off to party they go. A deserved, albeit way too short jail stint, matches them up with the thug and appropriately named: Alien. Together, they all make a terrible team of sadistic nobodies in search ofnothing. At least, they don't see it that way.Things get progressively worse, as did the movie and the repeated scenes and sounds  the ones that might have worked fine for effect the first time, but not the twentieth, continue to the absurd and unbelievable finale.Admittedly, I didn't have too much of a problem with this feature as it began and throughout the first act. It just felt like this was just a 49-year-old horny male's fantasy project and I wasn't too far off: the male writer/director's 40. And I've become immune to watching greedy, narcissistic and self-centered young adults on screen since (the even more miserable) Project X, but as the movie continued, my loathing escalated.Part was due to the already noted repetition. Part was because spending any more time with these disgusting, immoral and remorseless characters that I could never distinguish between  nor cared to. And part was due to missing that incredible scene at the end of 2001's Bully where sane people in the courtroom showed a glimmer of conscience with a simple glance.My friend at work stated my (then, verbal) review of Spring Breakers  a movie he liked, was too biased and only my opinion. I could only give him the same blank stare as those adults at the end of 2001's Bully.
I rarely listen to my own advice when I am in Vegas and generally I lose because of it. (Side note: I am in Vegas right now, on the 29th floor of the Palazzo and I didn't listen to my own wise gambling advice. I've been broke for 2 days now.)Well, the same comes to movies. I keep stating, writing and promising to give up on bad films/series and especially stop supporting them (financially, that is,) so Hollywood finally gets back on track with better made films. (The more people see trash like 2012, for example, the more cr*p we'll be subjected to.)That all being said, surprisingly enough, 'Saw VI' was better than the previous entry. Of course, that's not saying much. This latest installment was trash, of course, with horrid acting, a zillion flashbacks, and as a series trend, flashbacks within flashbacks and a million crossovers from previous chapters. When I finished watching this, knowing this is probably geared towards the young male audience, I laughed thinking they've been duped into watching a soap opera.Yep, the Saw series is now a soap opera, albeit an extremely gory one  probably what Dark Shadows wanted to be, but in no way could attempt decades ago. I haven't even seen too many soaps in my time to know the transition scenes from one flashback or plot twist to the next is the exact techniques they use in the daytime dramas. They even have (spoiler) the blond be the back-stabbing b*tch in one of probably 37 subplots.Though it's old-school now (by part VI,) they bring back Jigsaw again, through, yep you guessed it, more flashbacks and videos he made prior to death. (Side Note: I guess by using this method, they think they're clever on spinning the old Friday the 13th or Halloween psycho "rebirths" in their opening segments, but in reality, it's just stale by now.)Does this guy have more recorded videos than Blockbuster? Does this guy have about $1 billion dollars and enough real estate to pull off about 16 dozen "traps"? I'm guessing they "explain" everything, but you begin to wonder by now if this guy owned half the city and no one ever wondered why he was always converting old, disgusting warehouses into death traps.It's really irrelevant to describe the plot this time, but here goes: the "new" ideas they came up with: two companies, one financial, one insurance apparently p*ssed off Jigsaw when he was alive and from the grave, Jigsaw uses his newest accomplice (one of many in the series) to set the traps of the employees in motion. Only this time a lot of people need to decide on who lives and who dies. This is a change from the original traps where people only had their own fate to worry about.While the previous two Saw movies toned down the gore, mercifully (what originally made the movies good in the beginning was them focusing on the story over gore,) again, they stepped it back up again, almost from minute one. Now, Saw III still is the leader in gore in the series, and the #1 goriest movie I have ever seen, this one breaks in the top 5. Sincerely, I've got to listen to myself and avoid the next two in the franchise, supposedly the final two.Honestly, by this point, I just don't care how the series pans out. I've said this before: they should've ended with #3 with the death of Jigsaw. What possible conclusion could there be? Jigsaw never died, it was his slightly less evil twin? It was all a dream but when Jigsaw wakes up he smiles indicating the series is getting a reboot? Or best yet, no one truly died, a la April Fool's Day, and everyone turns to the audience, says "Thank you all for coming, and remember to appreciate life!" while holding hands and bowing?I see the torture p*rn movies are finally dying out (while the reboots of the 1980/70s slashers increase) and hopefully, this series will as well.
Well, at least The Double fulfilled my need for wanting to watch an international spy/suspense/thriller last night. Too bad it wasn't really that good of a one.It's one of those movies that screams: "Wait for itwait for itwaaaaait.BAM! There's our surprise! Not satisfied? We're gonna throw in another shockerwait for it" Mercifully, the most obvious revelation is revealed 20 minutes in, because nothing tips my chair like knowing what's coming in the first five minutes (like this movie) and having to wade through almost two hours of "twists/turns" to get to what we knew all along.Believe it or not, this wasn't a direct to video release. Someone had enough faith in this film to release it to theatres in 2011, albeit limited, and someone further believed in it enough to market it hard on DVD. But, here's the problem: it's trying hard to be similar to Red Dragon. Only, that's not a movie I would like to imitate.Let's see if the synopsis sounds vaguely familiar: Yet another EX-CIA agent  why is it always "This is my last job before retirement" or "You know I quit, I can't go back, I won't go back, well okay, here I come"?  is called back into the line of duty once a Senator gets killed with the same MO as a previously-thought-dead Soviet Super-Assassin Spy. Yet another pairing has to take place between that Ex-CIA agent and a yet another younger book-smart unwanted partner. Together, the yet another good-cop/bad-cop pair track the assassin known as "Cassius" when he could be closer than they think.In all seriousness, it wasn't a downright terrible film. It was well shot, the acting wasn't great, but not atrocious and if you leave your brain at the door and forget about the 30+ movies this mimics, you might have a good time.
I think they took a chance on Tim Burton developing his own vision of The Caped Crusader in 1989's Batman, much like they did with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy. All gambles paid off in dividends.Batman was a phenomenal movie, in all aspects. Michael Keaton was perfect in both roles as Batman and Bruce Wayne. Jack Nicholson was also wonderful in his dual performance as the Joker and crime lord Jack Napier. The action was intense, original, exciting and inventive. The sets were masterful, the atmosphere and cinematography excellent and the mood ideal for the adaptation. Danny Elfman created and preformed his absolute best score and did to Batman as John Williams did to Superman; for the first time, both composers brought the heroes to life with a remarkable, rememberable and stunning score. The story, set-up and execution was exactly how real origin stories are supposed to be made. (On a personal note, I have little patience with movies based on characters I favor. I want to see them, and quick. I loved that they decided to show Batman up front, immediately and saved the origin story until much later as part of the mystery of Wayne. In my opinion, this was a brilliant and original move.) And Burton's vision beautifully blended in present day to the 1940's era when Batman gained popularity (yeah, I know he was originally produced in 1939.) Very little didn't work in this comic book adaptation. Namely Vicky Vale's consistent need to scream (count 'em, I believe the total number of screeching is 50+) Prince's so-so tracks and (SPOILER) I'm told that Joker didn't kill Wayne's parents in the original source. Obviously everything cannot be displayed from the comics  we're talking 70+ years of material, and somethings have to be altered for dramatic purposes (see the enormously altered The Blind Side.) Also, only a very minute number or effects didn't work  the only one that comes to mind is the first appearance of The Dark Knight from an above shot. It looked way too cartoonish.None of these minor complaints constitute anything less than 5 out of 5 stars. This movie was as near perfect as either a Batman movie, adventure, comic book adaptation or good vs. evil story could be. And, personally, it meant a lot to me back in the summer of 1989 when my father took me for the first (of three) time(s) to AMC Town & Country on the Saturday after it opened in June 1989. This was a first for me  the line was extraordinarily long and I was used to just going in and sitting down. It was also when I really started paying attention to the Box Office Reports as this was one of the biggest movies of all time, at the time. In addition, as much as I thoroughly liked the finished product, I wouldn't even appreciate it until years later when other lesser directors took their own visions on different comic book heroes. (Too many to list, but Daredevil, Hulk and any of the Punisher or Fantastic Four movies come to mind.) The plot/story was very well know, even back in 1989, but here goes: Mr. & Mrs. Zillionaire Wayne die in front of their child in an alley leaving the heir in the care of family/friend/servant Alfred. Revenge (he calls it differently, but yeah, right) fills his blood throughout his life and when able, he becomes the masked avenger bent on ridding the streets of Gotham, USA of scum.Meanwhile, mobster (#2) Jack (Nicholson) is set up by his boss, Grissom (Palance) and after inadvertently being dropped in chemicals (Batman actually did try and save him) he becomes the self-titled Joker. Revenge and power is on his mind. His short list includes: Gang takeover from Grissom, the destruction of Gotham and demise of Batman, for obvious reasons.All at the same time, Wayne is conflicted with his vigilante's role and his new found love with Vicky Vale (Basinger.) He wants to tell her he's Batman so he can finally open up to someone other than co-conspirer Alfred, and speaking of which, in what many complain about, Alfred eventually does the deed for Wayne.Joker's also bent on romancing the lovely (and screaming) Vale, and when it's discovered she is a sore spot for Wayne/Batman, she's all the more enticing to Joker.Yada, yada, yada, there's mystery, suspense, action, rescues and finally, there's the big finale and revolutions that provide an exciting finale to one of the best comic book movies ever made.This movie hits so many demographics, including romance, comedy, action, adventure, heroism, good vs. bad, redemption that is highly recommended for all audiences. It wasn't until another visionary, Christopher Nolan's fantastic Batman Begins and the superior The Dark Knight, did anything come close to this masterpiece. And even then, neither Batman nor Batman Begins can easily be compared since they are far different takes on the classic tales. I.E. Batman was more of a fun, comic book movie whereas Batman Begins is a serious adaptation leaving the fun out the window. Both are great movies and both belong in any fan's collection. SEE IT.
Scott decided to come out to the world during the worst possible year. The general public, rightfully so, was so put off by such idiocy thrown at us this year, that many stayed away from the little films that, in the creativity field, dominated the large pieces of crap. Too bad.First they missed the great Kick-Ass, followed by Michael Cera's other wonderful release: Youth in Revolt. Come to think of it, one of the best comedic talents we have out there barely has a hit to his name (aside from, maybe Superbad) and that's regrettable. Just as nowadays we not only hardly have any music group that has multiple #1 albums, like in the 1990s and before, we have too few great and talented stars, like Cera.I could say SEE: Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World a hundred times, and just about no one will listen. And no, it's not because I'm not a respected critic  who really is? It's probably more to the skeptic viewer who's been burned for far too long.But, at any rate: SEE THIS MOVIE. It was funny, wildly original, fantastically shot, had an awesome soundtrack and deep acting. Nicely, it took what worked with Zombieland and Kick-Ass to the next level. Heck, throw in a little of the original 1960s Batman series to boot.Scott, 22 (Cera) is a nerd and is dating a high school student until he dreams up his dream girl, Ramona V. Flowers. As always, she's got baggage: seven ex's he has to defeat to keep the girl.Okay, that's the (very) basic premise. In between, he comic-book-ish fights them with powers that no one seems to question. The bad guys fly and sling video-game flame balls and Scott equally rises to the occasion with an air knock out. While all this is going on, there's a stalking ex-girlfriend, a battle of a different sort involving a band that Scott's attached to and a gay roommate played perfectly with excellent timing and comedic lines from no other than a Culkin (Kieran.)In fact, Wallace (Culkin) was one of the best characters of the story. It's refreshing to see not only two best friends/roommates be gay and straight and even non-sexually sleep in the same bed  but also of the two, the gay friend is the dominate one. In 99.775% of all films involving the "gay-sidekick/friend/comic relief" they're played small, weak  though sometimes all-knowing, but at the same time, it's the straight that has everything together. It's the opposite here. The only other film I can reference here was the relationship in My Best Friend's Wedding, but that, like Will & Grace, was, like always, a homosexual male and BFF female. Here we have a perfect male-male-non-sexual gay/straight friendship.But, I digress; this isn't necessarily a gay-themed movie. This is about action, romance, fantasy, a whole lotta fun and great special effects. In between, you'll meet and love Ramona who has more depth than her hair colors. You'll get inventive ways to fight each of the seven nemesis ex's. Butthat's also a complaint of the movie.Despite the comic book it's based upon, why couldn't it have been 3 or 4 ex's max? The movie dragged a bit, and though each challenge (or battle) was exciting to watch for superbly choreographed action sequences, it just kept going on a little too long after awhile.Eh, just sit through it. Have a great time. It's not for the mainstream  WAY unfortunately  but it's for those who just want pure fantasy, it's for those who grew up on both comics and video games and it's for those who truly believe the geek can get the girl. Doesn't Cera always? SEE THIS MOVIE.
How can a movie with one of the best soundtracks of all time be one of the laziest, least exciting and most incomprehensible Marvel misses since (AND AFTER) Howard the Duck?Ben Affleck's Daredevil, the discount Batman, was so blah and so all over the place it probably should've been a Crank sequel than a Marvel Superhero movie. The editing was shotty, the powers unexplained, the acting bad, the real humor nonexistent and the unintentional humor was the only thing that would get us to the ending.When this movie first came out in February 2003, my initial reaction before I saw it was: Oh, this is not good. If this Superhero movie had any quality, it would be in the summer and notValentine's Day weekend. Nevertheless, I went to go see it for the first and last time that opening weekend.Note: that was my intention, 11 years ago. Until a fantastic podcast, How Did This Get Made, came on my radar, that is. That internet show which ridicules (for the most part) bad movies for about an hour is so hilarious, I vowed to watch/re-watch all of the movies they cover. Sadly, this was on their list.Actually, let me back up. I said "sadly," but I have wanted to give it a second chance since it originally disappointed me in the theatre. I mean, people seem to go gaga for Benny Affleck and so much so, my dislike for him (from the first moment I saw him) made me doubt myself.Well, doubt no further. He was, as always, horrible in this and the movie was even worse than I remembered. In fact, the much-lower budget, Made-For-TV movie, The Trial of the Incredible Hulk that featured both Daredevil and Hulk was much more entertaining.Basically, we have murderer Daredevil taking many blows while taking justice into his own hands. Eventually, he meets and stalks the unexplained Elektra who can fly all over the place, runs into Bullseye who can toss things with extreme accuracy even though the reasons behind that are nonexistent and finally, he bumps into The Kingpin who is eeeeevil, but only because he tells us so.Oh, and spoiler, Daredevil has no problem killing whomever he pleases, as long as he judged them right in his mind. Why he doesn't kill the most evil of all  again, because they tell us so and not really show us so, the Kingpin, is beyond me.If you are not laughing by or at the Elektra/Daredevil waltz in the playground, you will absolutely be busting a gut with the terrible CGI, the laugh-out-loud ripped-off Matrix climax or when the characters inexplicitly hover/fly all over the place with absolutely no rhyme or reason whatsoever. Again, this movie is VERY LAZY.Not since Student Bodies have I seen a "Death by Paperclip" scene. Only, in Student Bodies, it was intentionally hilarious.* * * Final thoughts: Two positives emerged from this movie. One: my love for the soundtrack. It is great and you should buy it. Stay away from the movie, but get the soundtrack. And two: I am a huge Hell's Kitchen fan. The Gordon Ramsey edition, that is and not when they refer to a piece of "rough neighborhood" in this movie. At least, I got a smile every time those two words: Hell's Kitchen were spoken.
The mere title of Cruise's latest feature pretty much explains movie star Cruise and what people think they know of his private life: Knight and Day.When Mission: Impossible III came out in 2006, it immediately followed his so-called "media meltdown" and people had really rough opinions about him and voiced them with the low box-office returns. I could seriously care less about his couch jumping/pill opinions and went to see not only the best Mission: Impossible of the series (so far,) but a very good movie.It wasn't his politics that kept me away from his follow-up (unfortunate bomb/) movies: Lion for Lambs and Valkyrie, it was simply that I had no interest in the subject matter. I'm open to watch them some day, but not at the top of my list. I did, however see him in Tropic Thunder and applaud him for a fantastic break-away from the norm, though it was a short stint in the movie.Who gives a sh#t what happened four years ago on the show, Oprah, that should've ended 10 years prior? So, he has an opinion about prescription drugs? Please tell me your opinions are not only rational, but the great majority of the world agrees with you  and that's not saying they're right if anyone agrees. I don't. His movies have almost always entertained me  the majority was when he finally broke free of the typecast he acted his way in, in A Few Good Men, even though there were a few I liked prior.Cruise is a talented and gifted performer, and in Knight and Day he shinedin spades. He had a quick wit and floated/acted his way through this movie with the confidence I love to see in him, i.e. who cares what people think  this is what I do best. And believe me, he was awesome to watch.He cracked me up, made his "lucky" spy shots actually believable and was just as suave as any James Bond or, even, Ethan Hunt. Further, he had wonderful chemistry with the lead lady, Diaz, who had her turn at making us laugh and root for her  despite all her imperfections. That said, who probably wouldn't act like she did, given the circumstances a normal person was through into. Diaz was beautiful as ever and could match Cruise step by step, though you could tell Cruise was leading their tango both on and off the screen.Knight and Day follows the traditional Scarecrow & Mrs. King route where a super-spy uses and rescues a civilian who ends up getting just as tangled in the web of the espionage as the agent, himself. Nothing is coincidental for rogue spy Roy (Cruise); he's always in control and always adapts to his surroundings with the ease of a soaring eagle.Unfortunately for June (Diaz,) she's instantly smitten with a "chance encounter" (like I said) at the airport with Roy. Yada, yada, yadathey both go down in a plane crash and the impossible mission begins involving a Duracell the size of a cricket and the power of Godzilla.Obviously, it's not shocker that some people want this device and are, gasp!, willing to kill for it. Nor is it a spoiler that states there's gotta be a mole who our hero is trying to expose  oh, no! Lovable (very true, when it comes to his charismatic character  thanks Cruise) and undeniably patient Roy is the movie's Superman to June's Lois. She's always in peril, and he's always there to literally scoop her up, save the day and do best for her and his mission.This movie, for the most part is silly, unrealistic and contains a few too many noticeable CGI segments. In addition, it gets a little slow when it goes off the beaten path when the plot (needs) calls for June to get jealous.That said, I could forgive all that becauseit was just too much fun. I laughed out loud and thoroughly enjoyed myself with the banter, excellently paced quick jabs and one-liners and the secondary characters that will through you for a loop. (No, not the spies, I'm referring to a couple from Roy's past.)Aside from the aforementioned one scene of jealous  and again, it was a needed element, the movie never ever goes off track. It's silly in moment one through to the (unfortunately) predictable, though satisfying, closing. I have NO problem with a movie that's complete off its rocker, as long as it doesn't pretend or yearn to be something else. A perfect example was a definite lesser movie than Knight and Day, but it was what it was throughout: Ninja Assassin. Stay true Hollywood and you will gain more confidence (Cruise doesn't need that advice, he's as good as he ever was) and will gain praise for it, given people opening their minds.So, you have to know what you're getting into; this spy movie is unlike the Bourne Movies, James Bond films or any serious espionage genre. It's played as a fun summer ride, an obvious romance story with thrills, close calls that couldn't possible happen outside the desire for entertaining the audience.And sh#t. Me and the audience were thoroughly wowed. SEE IT!Disclaimer: Yeah, I swore. Sue me. It was to exclaim my love for this adventurous roller coaster fun ride. At least, I didn't jump up and down on a couchoops, sorry about that one. Cruise: I still love yah. Please keep making movies. Please continue to entertain.
I used to watch Weird Science, and a lot of John Hughes movies as a kid, but I don't recall a "Robert Downey" in the mix.With this 8/9/13 viewing, probably the first in 20 years, the focus from me was twofold: the fact that Robert Downy (no Jr.) was so young and he probably had no idea how incredible his stardom would take him once he donned the IRON MAN outfit and that I had an incredible crush on Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) when I was young. So, basically, with this revisit, I focused on those two.Okay, fine, I also wanted to see the gorgeous Kelly LeBrock before she became, well, what she is today. She is such a wonderwoman. What happened to her that she didn't growmore? No, I don't mean her, well, two attributes.I digress. This totally 80s flair film takes virtually no realism and is a ton of fun when you suspend your disbelief. It's a coming of age story in a period of one weekend. It's wildly random at times, and inconsistent, but a lot of fun due to the music, comedy and namely performances from LeBrock and (yeah, being honestly unbiased here) Mitchell-Smith.When watching the wretched 2012's Project X, I always think back to this party movie. While neither is realistic, I would prefer, any day of the week, to watch these "party animals" have a good time, than the kids of 2012 destroy their souls.I digress.again. Best buds and nerds, Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt "create" their perfect woman from a 1985 com-pu-ter and their dreams are set to come true. Of course, there's a little learning to commence during this and some more comedy when they come out of their shells and get the girl(s.) Real girls, that is.It is interesting with what they could get away with back then, i.e. PG-13 rating. Honestly, it would surely be an R in today's time.Nevertheless, not the best John Hughes movie, but a whole lot of fun for those who grew up with this movie. I look forward to the remake and see what they can come up with. Especially, with the technology of 2013-14or 2015?
Listen: No spoiler alert coming. You would have to be Helen Keller and never find out what happened to "Jack & Jill" to not see from frame one what will "happen" in 'What Happens in Vegas.' It's easy to call this horrid, retched movie predictable, so I will quickly move on. All jokes fall flat, all acting is amateur and all chemistry is as unbelievable as Mike and Carol Brady's true love. And the premise? Well all movies have flaws, this one is built on one major mistake: lost souls Diaz and (the laugh-out-loud horrible) Kutcher visit Vegas at the same time their lives are crumbling and after a very unoriginal/stock-footage wild-night-in-Vegas, they marry, fight and win a progressive slot on *ONE* quarter. Uh, you can't even enter a bonus-round on a single coin, much less win a progressive prize. Let's see, they don't want to be married, so an extremely un-funny Dennis Miller sentences them to 6-months counseling with an equally uninteresting (Oscar nominee, really?) Queen Latifah as their marriage counselor to judge whether or not they win the Vegas prize money. I hated, hated, and hated this movie. No one involved seemed interested in making an original movie, plot or idea. They simply relied on large smiles, horribly executed revenge schemes and falling down for effect. The only thing that would have surprised me, and make me like the movie a tiny bit, was if the this so-called love/hate couple kill each other in the ending with spoons. I certainly tried that on myself while watching it. I love watching Vegas-themed movies. This was one of the exceptions. Aside from the countless stock-footage, the only thing they got right was the view from the Planet Hollywood Casino, which was the major blunder from the movie '21.' SKIP!
It shouldn't be a surprise there wasn't enough spit in the box office to even dampen this remake's grave.There's virtually no reason to see 2010's I Spit on Your Grave. Even with a teen boy's (actually sick) fantasy of a gang bang rape scene that goes on longer than the typical internet's entry, it's not as graphic as one might think. Sure, it's bad, horrifying perhaps, but only for those who haven't either seen the original or any other rape scene in a horror/suspense flick.Personally, I have seen the buck-fifty-budgeted 1978 revenge film, and not for the same reasons mentioned above  of course, those who know me, know that's a given. I just remember Roger Ebert's vile attack on the movie provoking me to see it.It was eh  again, it had less of a budget than the main star had clothes following her attack. This 2010 "update" only followed the same pattern/guidelines and increased the budget.That "same pattern/guidelines" I speak of? Well, Jennifer (Butler) aka woman (hence the original, original title: Day of the Woman) goes it alone in isolated lake cabin and all but immediately gets sexually attacked and taunted by the local back-wooded gang. Is she to blame since she did the stereotypical no-no's, i.e. alcohol, marijuana and inadvertently mocking her soon-to-be captives? Well, duh, no  watch the 1,000 times better The Accused for proof.Supposedly, she spends some time in the woods when she's able to escape the rapists and in this short time, she's managed to gather herself, obtain money (to ship a video they took of the attack), new clothes, a shower and if those aren't all unbelievable enoughshe also devises extensive Saw-like torture plans for the bad men that caused her indescribable pain.Absolutely, I can state that nothing of this magnitude has happened to me  as probably 96%+ of the population can safely agree, but in my untarnished view  she went far beyond retribution. Granted she couldn't go to the cop (yeah, singular) of this them partsfor spoiler reasons, I'll leave it at that. But there's a line where you not only match your adversary's sins, you become far more evil than what they could've done. This woman, Jennifer, goes so far in this movie that even if you wanted to see a woman scorned get her just deserts, I would think most people would actually start to feel sorry for the men.The only, and again  SICK, example of how anyone could've gone any further than the torture Jennifer caused on the hillbillies following her Inspector Gadget phase, was someone raping an innocent victim and the first objective is for that victim to go and kill the attacker's children.There's nothing here to see but woman attacked and woman attacking back. Unfortunately, it was further torture for them to make this 70-80 minute concept into a spitting 107 minutes. Skip it, like everyone else in 2010 when it came and went faster than you can, well, spit.
I would call The Love Guru the worst comedy on record if there weren't so many Adam Sandler films competing for that same recognition.Mike Myers should've seen this coming. He made the glorious Austin Powers. He voiced the everlasting Shrek. He made me laugh for decades with Wayne's World. I know he was trying something new here, but he should've put a stop to it before it started rolling.I'm not even going to get into the "offensive" category he set up. If anything, I'm offended that he thought ANY of this was humorous.Admittedly, and I will not lie, I did laugh when the title character fights a chicken  sorry, I mean COCK. That was funny, believe it or not. Wait, that and the "Gamblers Anonymous Casino Night" line. Okay, those two scenes that took up 15 second of the 87 minutes were hilarious.The rest should be avoided at all costs. I watched this ONLY because it was featured in the How Did This Get Made podcast lineup. IF you must, watch this first, then listen to their hilarious take on it.Otherwise, ONE HUNDRED PERCENTstay away. This is an awful movie with so many things wrong with it that I don't want to spend another second on* * *Final thoughts: A coworker continuously states: What CAN'T Justin (Timberlake) do? I responded: Not save this movie.
Why are all movies, to my knowledge, that contain the word "candy" so hard? Yeah, it's apples/oranges to compare Candy to Hard Candy, yet both deal with both extreme and adult topics. And both are very good films.Romantic couple Candy (Cornish) and Dan (Ledger) are, for lack of a better term, degenerate druggies. They will do anything, including prostitution and deception of family, parents and friends to get their hands on their next injection. Candy shows signs of wanting to change and better herself while Dan just wants what Candy wants as he deeply loves her.Though a pregnancy wouldn't normally help these addicts, it shows signs of change. But, (SPOILER) due to a highly realistic, albeit incredibly disturbing, miscarriage, they're back to their old ways. Something's gotta give and we, the audience hopes/yearns for just that. Which of the drug duo will make that choice? The choice for the clean generation? Although this movie can be extremely hard to watch at times, it's a beautifully shot and great experience for anyone wanting to produce, direct or write an independent film. The cinematography was wonderful, music mesmerizing, the acting top notch, the poetry was beautiful, even the dialogue can be funny at the most unexpected times (SEE: the doctor.) In addition, it sealed my belief that Ledger will go down in history of the late greats that died WAAY before their time, such as James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and River Phoenix. All of them, including Ledger, were improving with each and every role until their untimely deaths. (For example, Ledger's role in Candy was good, his acting in Brokeback Mountain was great and he was absolutely excellent in The Dark Knight.) These are the normal heroes you'd root for. Antiheroes, in fact. But, you do yearn for a better tomorrow. You want them to succeed and in turn, you'll want to continue watching to make sure they (or the situation) improve. Not to give anything away, but the singular word you see in the opening, then middle and then followed in the third act pretty much shows you what you're in for. So, sit back, and enjoy what real "Artsy" or "Independent" cinema's all about.It's about heart. It's about character depth, originality and believability. It's about movement and a statement. This movie has all those qualities and more. Despite the harsh subject matter  not for the weak hearted, yet it deserves a recommendation. See this movie.Side Note (Spoilers Ahead): One of the best aspects of the movie was that we're introduced to Dan as a straight, but accepting, individual. In one scene, Candy wants Dan to sell his own body, namely to other males, as a way of him contributing to their drug habit and so that Candy doesn't have to do all the work (no pun, but really, she's the only real source of income and that's by prostitution.) He has a problem with it up front, as he's, duh, straight, but eventually gets himself enough high to ask his druggie and gay friend (a wonderful performance by Geoffrey Rush) on what to expect and/or do during a "gay experience." His reactions are sincere, and believable and it was refreshing to see someone on screen that's portrayed as heterosexual actually be that way. (Eventually, he chickens out on his first attempt.) Too many times I see someone "tell" me they're not gay on screen, but within minutes, they're banging some dude. And even more unbelievably wonderful about Ledger in this role, is his ability to play on either side of the fence, i.e. Brokeback Mountain, where he played a convincingly confused gay male to a 100% straight male in Candy. And he did both with two completely different points of view.This made me respect him all the more. As well as mourn his passing, once again.
It's not easy to separate the adventures of the blandly named "Rick" and the true movie adventurer Indiana Jones, but since Indy hadn't an excellent adventure since 1989 (and probably never will again,) this will do.The Mummy was actually a really fun ride. And that's all it is. Don't look for depth, for any amount of seriousness or even memorable characters  aside from the mostly absent title character, that is. Despite my first paragraph, it's best to avoid thinking of the superior Dr. Jones serials and just have fun. And, sure, it's silly  sometimes overly inane and the movie was way too convoluted; SEE: the opening novel-sized narration shots to set-up the background story. Oh, and some of the special effects not only don't hold up today, but were questionable back in 1999.AGAIN it's just a thrill adventure that requires you to leave your brain at the door. For, it has all the elements of old westerns, romantic slapstick of decades past and the horror elements of the original Mummy films of the 1930s.Adventurer Rick stumbles upon the city of the dead and years following, is taken in by a librarian and her brother to retrieve old books and other artifacts. None of them truly believe the old Egyptian myths of the undead being able to be resurrected and, of course, that's what's about to happen."The Mummy," or High Priest Imhotep, does come back (eeeeventually  it really does take the movie a long time to (re)introduce the title character) and besides completely restoring his body to flesh and inadvertently causing Biblical plagues, his main mission is to also bring back his lovely adulteress.Reluctantly, Rick and the Gang vow to stop him because of some "legend" that hell would be on Earth. Actually, I think that was just to cause more tension in the film because other than words, that didn't seem like it would happen.Nevertheless, park your brain, let loose, laugh a lot, avoid the normal criticism people like me would normally write about and you'll have a good time. Rick is absolutely no Indy and the movie is certainly no Raiders, but since there were only two (out of four) solid Indiana Jones flicks, this is a good companion piece.
'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole "Yes!" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI  even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade.' At any rate, it's a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: Comic Book geeks, action fanatics and horror/vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half-man/half-vampire, or "day-walker" and his accomplish, Whisler (a la "Batman and Alfred") battling the undead who, apparently almost out number humans. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade's more of an antihero) our sword ninja/vamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialist/doctor. Meanwhile, trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs Blade somehow to obtain it. It's not the most original concept, if you read what I just wrote, but still highly enjoyable. You will want to see Blade succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. And you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie. Still, watch this without trying to go too deep. Such as Vampire SPF-1000 "suntan lotion"? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldn't that still burn? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Uh, okay, I am going too deep. Once again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride.
For most folks, it's been an 18-year journey. For me, it was a Sunday.I recently sat down, and travelled, to see all three BEFORE movies, which ended with Before Midnight in theatres. It was extremely nice to be able to see Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight all consecutively verses over almost two-decades of filmmaking.Maybe this gave me a different perspective. I loved the first movie, admired the follow-up and felt Before Midnight, while a nice send up to the two decade journey of two characters, kind of, hard to watch.That's not to say it wasn't good and nice to see these two lovebird's conclusions. And it ended (spoiler, sorry) just as they predicted throughout the franchise. I, too, saw the signs and learned a lot about how these two soul mates would view life in the future. But, the fantasy was gone. The reality really hit hard.Following the wonderfully ambiguous finale of the second chapter, Before Sunset, you learn that these two humans have, in fact, finally got together and stayed that way. In fact, they now have children of their own. The movie follows the same staple pattern of the first two, whereas the camera follows the couple, Jesse and Celine, around as they converse in under 24-hours. Only, now they're dealing with the consequences of making sure they are together.This movie relies less on romantic love and more on realistic situations for couples. It's a reality check for those who fantasize about romantic encounters. While it's still rich in great dialogue, it's such a culture shock for the hope of the first two movies.Yeah, I guess, at times, the sh|t's gotta get real, but maybe I loved the love story of the first two more and found myself engulfed in the fantasy of true love. Still, it's worth a watch, if you want to see how these two turn outafter 18-real-years of both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy's lives.
With the bombardment of horrid spoofs, I didn't think it possible to get even close to the two best classics of spoof: 'Airplane!' and 'Naked Gun' and then came the genius 'Scary Movie.' I just recently watched the 'Scream' trilogy again, and it was so hard to watch parts 1-2 due to remembering all the lines/scenes from 'Scary Movie;' it made me laugh out loud when I suppose 'Scream' was supposed to be frightening, even for a bit. After now watching 'Scary Movie' for probably the 12th time, I still laugh hard. And though it was not perfect, only a slight few of the gags were silly/bad ('Dawson's Creek' bleah). The rest were ingenious. Plot line: it didn't just follow the events of 'Scream' (and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and others) it completely mimicked the sets, scenes and even dialogue. They even point that out. And as much as I liked 'Scream,' when they point out major plot-holes and corny dialogue, I have to actually rethink my review of 'Scream.' (All the way through 'Scary Movie,' I kept thinking, "Oh, yeah, they're right, that part was bad.") And even though they were set out just to make a spoof, the acting, the spirit and depth was actually performed by these actors. Farris, both Wayans, Elizabeth, everyone, actually were excellent in their roles and really gave it their 100%. The lines were fantastic, and quoted by me and my friends for the longest time following. The creativity of the set-ups and even the background gags were hilarious. (Heck, even their names.) I don't want to ruin too much of the movie, it's clear that I highly recommend this movie for horror/comedy/spoof buffs. Honestly, 'Airplane!' still ranks as my favorite comedy, but this comes in close, at least in the top-5.
I love it when a movie surprises me. When it creates original twists and turns and does it in a relatively short amount of time. When it avoids all clichés, skips any amount of melodrama and strikes at the heart with pure and deep dialogue. And after watching Safe Haven, I kid you not: I was crying and cryingfor a movie that fits the ANY of the aforementioned desires.Why do the most A-B-C movies have to be just shy of two hours? This Sleeping With Enemy rip-off brings nothing new to the table and every shot is so foreseen, you'd have to be from Mars patiently waiting for us to get there and pick up you so you can come back here and see your very first movie. Or soap opera, for that matter.Surprisingly, I didn't actually hate it. It's like an ugly, but mellow dog. It's just there, nothing special or unique and since it's not harming anyone, you just want it to pass you by and never remember you saw it.Woman escapes abruptly, yada yada, she's being pursued by two men, yada, yada, rain, fire, yellow, lies, new hair color, yada, yada, message from the grave.Seriously, I just summed up 2 hours in a manner I feel that was more entertaining than the time I'll never get back.Hate to stereotype, but the ladies who love sap, little depth and Twilight, will probably eat this up. Best to leave the thinking to someone else for a couple of hours.* * *Final thoughts: This was only my second Nicolas Sparks adaptation and years after I saw The Notebook. Wasn't the biggest fan of The Notebook, but it was oodles better than this mush. And I probably wouldn't have ever seen another of his films had it not been one of my favorite podcasts, How Did This Get Made?, that recently covered it. Now, let the fun begin when I listen to their (always hilarious) take on it.
If I could only rate this movie 5/5 stars on the soundtrack alone, I would. But, not only would that be inconsiderate to all else that went into making Juno an instant classic, it would cause people to only go out and buy the album vs. watching such a fantastic film.Admittedly, I only saw this movie once, when trying to catch up on all the Best Picture nominees from 2007. I loved it, absolutely, but never got around to viewing it again until last night. AndI had previously purchased it on BluRay months ago!I loved it just as much now as I did back then. The writing, from soon-to-be mediocre Diablo Cody, was excellent for this project. The normal dialect from teens would normally turn me off  and would get worse as Facebook grew in popularity, but I absolutely adored it here. This is all due to the once in a lifetime, perfect performance by Ellen Page as the title character.She was so great, so real, so believable, she doesn't just carry the child, er, movie, she keeps us highly entertained even when a lot of other great filmmaking techniques and performances might go unnoticed from beginning to end.Best high school buds, Juno and Paulie (the always wonderful, Michael Cera) "decide" to have sex one night and in "a chair that started it all." Lo, behold, she's now with child and after an abortion debate within herself, she decides on making a obviously unhappy couple happy again. But, will a child complete the Pennysaver advertising's couple's family? Will Juno find who she's always been searching for? Will she ever light that pipe she incessantly sucking on, even though she's pregnant? The supporting cast is excellent  including great scenes with the always wonderful J.K. Simmons, Allison Janney and (definitely not the normal role for) Jason Bateman. The score is good, the cinematography is surprisingly great and, as mentioned, the soundtrack that started the movie with a bang, is absolutely and breathtakingly marvelous.While still giving the enormously hilarious movie 5/5 stars, I'm surprised on how toned down Cera was in this. As a big fan of his, and how he normally steals every scene he's involved in and usually has the best dialogue, it was amazing on how reserved he was in this while letting Page command the screen. Probably that was the intention, but it was freaky not seeing Cera dominate the screen.Nevertheless, coming from a fan of just a handful of teen-related movies, such as Clueless, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Election and, of course, the John Hughes collection, I add this almost masterpiece of a teen angst film to the list. It was so real, so involving and so funny, I can't wait to finally see it a third time.Now, you must buy this movie and following its closing credits, search and purchase the soundtrack. If you loved the movie, you should already have a crush on the music.
This movie was a cartoon. Pain & Gain, though supposedly based on a true story, was a comedy on life. Andnot a good one.Sure, it had all the elements, namely the stylistic surroundings and the stars involved, but the substance was what one would expect from the director: Michael Bay  very little to nothing.Admittedly, it's been over a month since I've seen this movie and I've practically forgotten everything about it. That's typical for any movie-watching person, but not so good for a movie so unmemorable, it's a waste of time in the first place.Basically, a trio of dumb bodybuilders go bad to gain big and as always, things don't go as planned. In fact, these amateurs fvck it up as bad as it can go. Reminds me of a grown-up version of 2001's Bully.Mercifully, I know I gave this a "glowing" 1½/5 star review when I initially saw it. The ½ star for filmmakers who knew how to make a movie, but the lack of any more is because they couldn't understand how a script fit in.NOT recommended.
How in the hell of war was Katherine Heigl not the lead here? This was HER movie!Wow it's been a very long time since I've seen such a train wreck on screen. Okay, sure, my track record for higher star'red films isn't great as of late, but damn, Director McG's This Means War has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time.Everything was wrong here. One can even go back, before the feature was released to the false advertising of the "ACTION-PACKED, romantic love-triangle" angle. There was more action in the 2-minute trailer than the entire movie. Fine. Was it at least a romantic comedy? Not really, since romantic involves chemistry and comedy ensures laughter.But I don't judge a movie on the advertiser who should be on trial for perjury. While watching, it became clear that the intent was 99.9995% slapstick comedy and the remainder involved action.Oh, I said everything was wrong, and only established the genre. Here were some of my thoughts:- While the concept is far from original  they weren't trying for Oscars  this "LIE" movie offered zero freshness in the 20,000-year-old plot of "boy(s) lies to get girl during contest boy(s) fall for girl girl learns of lie(s) & leaves boy(s?) get girl to live happily ever after."- Reese, a soon-to-be-former favorite of mine was lost, distracted, shallow and phoned everything in. Sad.- The dialogue was horrendous, the attempts at humor sad and the connection between the leads lost.- The film lacked conviction in the fact it wanted to be raunchy, and even included some(gasp) harsh language!, but it never ever pulled the trigger.- One couple thought a 2-minute first date was sufficient and seconds later, the other couple met at a video store? In the present?- All characters were despicable, even the secondary ones, leaving NO ONE to root for.- The minuscule amount of action was inane, but then again McG.- When the better (and that's saying a lot in this mess) scene of a finger-painting sabotage is followed up by an attacking puppet dog, you know the mentality of the writers.- The villain has a piece of cloth and uses that to track his new nemesis(s). REALLY?- And above all else, the finale was silly, poorly constructed, absurd, incredibly, yet mercifully, short and all-but stolen (from Lethal Weapon 3's PRE-climactic scene. They didn't need to use that scene as their finale, but This Means War ran so far out of steam by that point, they had no other roads to travel, literally.)Do I have time, or do you care for the synopsis? Two heterosexual males in love with both each other and themselves find time to love the same female and use their CIA jobs to illegally and unethically spy on her while they bet one will land her first without breaking their own non-gay bond.While I do applaud the men and characters showing that two men, can, in fact, be enormously close without being lovers, they kinda went overboard. I got it: they weren't gay or in sexual love for each other, but move on once established.This movie was a mess from beginning to end and not funny or original enough to give any kind of recommendation. Skip it.
Finally! The untold story of Freddy Kruger's "slow" brother, Frankie. I know they don't make a big deal about this revolution, but since this is NOT the real Freddy, it must be his mentally retarded sibling, Frankie.2010's A Nightmare on Elm Street was 99% a complete waste of film. I'll give it that 1% for maybe one jump (of dozens planned) and a lot of great laughs. And no, I'm not referring to Freddy's sense of humor.Where to begin? Ah, at the beginning. Such as, let's change the whole premise on why Freddy's stalking these kids in their dreams. Let's change the house. Let's change Freddy's voice and look, a la Frankie. Let's keep the first name of Nancy and change her last. (Why?? Ah, never mind.) Let's change the fact the original and throughout the series, the idea was to show a heroine with some depth.Okay, fine, they wanted a newer version of the 26-year-old story. Did they need to? Nope. Could they have done a fantastic job. Absolutely. They made the same mistake with 1998's Godzilla. If you combined the budget of both series' original features, you could probably just pay for the posters of the updates and still the remakes couldn't come within 3,000 miles of the talent of their predecessors.Overshadowing the weak story were the horribly thin characters and even worse acting. All around bad acting, but the winner of the Keanu Reeves Protégé Award is Rooney Mara, "Nancy (why the new last name) Holbrook." She had two emotions: One with her eyes open, awake and one with her eyes closed, asleep. She literally made me laugh out loud throughout the entire feature. And why they even bothered to call her "Nancy" is beyond me. Aside from changing her last name, the only other similarity was she had a single mom. And even Mom changed from being an alcoholic to being a doctor. Why? What the fudge does anyone care? Back to the other characters. Bleah. In the original, and for most of the original series' sequels, you actually cared about the obvious victims. You got to know them and learned of their personalities. Here, they might as well been in a Friday the 13th sequel where the kids were literal cardboard waiting to be sliced by Jason. I mean, you learn one used to date another, and another has a crush on Nancy  again, I can't help but laugh on how bad she was. Seriously, Heather Langenkamp can't act too well, but you still cared for her and her plight.I admit I grew up on the original series, and watch them from #1 to Freddy Vs. Jason all the time, yet, I never really found them scary. Campy, funny, interesting, had a great score and sometimes had equally great soundtrack. This had the opportunity to be scary. To be dark. To improve on the score, or at least mirror it. This accomplished none of those. I did the inevitable countdown, 3-2-1 and poof!, there's Freddy. (Okay, I missed it by 2 counts ONE time in the movie, but got all the other 15 predictable "frights" down pat.) The score was terrible and there were no real songs that I could remember.In addition, it was not interesting; I found myself caring even less as more of the "new" myth on Freddy came to light. It had some regurgitated lines/scenes from the series that seemed like they were added only for fans and not for the plot. Also, I understand Freddy really wasn't meant to be funny as he became as the original series progressed. But this one was downright depressing on how bland he was. Word to the director: While just about anyone could wear a hockey mask, there can be only one Freddy. Heck, why not remake The Silence of the Lambs with Ben Stein as Hannibal Lecter? (Actually, PLEASE don't.) Generally by this part of my review I've already given the synopsis. Honestly, it would be a spoiler to reveal it, but suffice to say, it's a 180 from the original and it just doesn't work. I even had problems with the 2009 remake of Friday the 13th (2009), but still rated it oodles of degrees higher than this piece of crap. They need to pull a Hulk and reboot this again, but this time hire writers.Final thoughts: Ironically, they include the original's line "Don't fall asleep" because you'll have a very hard time staying awake in this boring film. Waitmaybe that's Freddy's plan. So, I guess I'll say: SKIP IT!!
Some sequels should not be made. Sure, it's all about the money  and this is no exception.The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor had no reason to be made other than money. Sure, they finally increased the budget (or talent) on special effects  the previous installments were jokes in regards to FX. But, this one was just overkill.And, like the other unnecessary Lethal Weapon 4, Jet Li appears in both movies for about two minutes and yet, gets top billing. Now, I like Li. Love his action, frame and composure. It's just too bad he's so underused here. I guess, they thought the general public loved how The Rock was CGI'd for roughly 2 minutes in Mummy 2 and the audience  stupidly  wanted more of that.By now, it appears I hated this movie. Not at all. In fact, it's mucho better than #2, even without the title character (the ACTUAL Mummy from #s 1-2) making an appearance. But, it's so incredibly excessive in the series, that I just don't care where this movie lands when it reaches its conclusion.Basically, series headliner, Brendan Fraser's Rick and (newly  and poorly casted Maria Bello as) Evy are retired, but their dumb son, Alex, is trying to mimic Indiana Jones and find the lost Chinese dictator. Naturally, the monster comes back alive and it's up to Rick, Evy, Alex and some pitiful-CGI Yeti to thwart (another poor CGI creation in the form of) Jet Li's Emperor.If you liked the first two, this might make you feel all nostalgic, especially with the silly humor and sometimes terrible graphics. But, new comers, please just revisit the fantastic Indiana Jones chapters that this one mocks. Hell, even National Treasure films were better. Watch those instead.Even when not a complete waste, it's not recommended.
Well, so much for "No fate but what we make." 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' proved that we're not up to our own destiny as 'T2' proved otherwise. Be prepared for all the events in the previous installment to be thrown out the window in 'T3.' The perfect comparison is the transition from 'Aliens' to 'Alien 3.' (By the way, I don't think there's much of a coincidence that both 'T3' and 'Alien 3' are bad movies that followed part 2's directed by James Cameron; apparently no one knows how to follow him up, or even if they should.) (Spoiler following) In 'Aliens' Ripley spends the entire movie protecting Newt, Hicks and Bishop and stopping once and for all the alien race only to have 'Alien 3' open with Newt & Hicks dead, Bishop to die later and the aliens breeding again like nothing happened. 'T2' taught us, we are in charge of our future, and 'T3' says, "nope, the set future is 'inevitable.'" And I haven't gotten to the worst aspect (even worse than the dialogue, 'Talk to the hand!'): this is one of the most pointless sequels of all time. It's almost a line-by-line, shot-by-shot remake of 'T2.' Schwarzenegger is a good T-101 sent back to protect Connor, and a liquid metal Terminator sent back to kill him. There's the daylight street chase. There's the gun round-up. The one-liners (only, in 'T3' they were extremely painful to listen to.) Etc, etc. I give it an extra ½ star for the special effects. Unfortunately everything else  the acting, dialogue, originality, inconsistencies, plot holes, laughable characters (that were supposed to be taken seriously), was so far under par, it was unbelievable Cameron even let this get green-lit. And trust me: you'll feel every bit of Hamilton's absence.
As a fan of 1941's Wolf Man, Wolf, Ginger Snaps films and (my #1 all time pick) The Howling (ORIGINAL only) I am very, very sad there's only a handful of good werewolf movies out there.I know it's an unpopular opinion, and that never bothers me, but I either strongly disliked or hated the following werewolf attempts: any/all of the Howling sequels, the Underworld films, Cursed, Van Helsing, both An American Werewolf in London and Paris, Silver Bullet, and Bad Moon, just to name a few. Also, I cannot stand to see a human morphing into a dog (they call it a wolf, I say dog because it looks like it and it's absolutely no "Wolf-MAN") with one exception: Wolf. Otherwise, that's not scary to me and it doesn't look like a man that turned into a wolf  it just looks like a nature show. Since the great majority of the so-called "werewolf" movies, Twilight: New Moon, Wolfen, An American Werewolf in London, etc, has a man turning into a dog, I simply look elsewhere. And finally, CGI has NOT been a blessing for one of my favorite movie monsters. Underworld not only did it almost 100% CGI, they decided, rightfully so, that it still looked fake. So what did they do? Sped up the action so fast, that you have barely 3 seconds in the entire movie to see any sort of werewolf. When you get "privileged" with those 3 seconds, you're disappointed in how fake and funny they look. On the flipside, Van Helsing also used CGI but slowed it down. Unfortunately for them, it was so hilariously bad looking, it seemed like everyone was afraid of a big teddy bear.So, it was refreshing to see Hollywood get back on track with an actual WOLF-MAN in 2010's latest remake of Wolf Man. I'm sure they used CGI, but it looks more like to me like they simply did old-school make up (and in my opinion the ONLY way to do this kind of creature. Sorry CGI buffs and people in love with the blue people of Avatar. Cameron might think this is the future, but I feel strongly CGI is beginning of the end.) While in some scenes, the werewolf is fast and vicious, in most he's (or they're) just standing there. Finally, we get to see a real-looking werewolf.In addition, the sets, the cinematography, the feel, the look of the late 19th Century England was beautiful. At first, I was opposed to making this film as a period piece, but the end result made it more creepy and more of a genuine remake of the 1941 classic vs. just another "modern" film.That all said, the rest of the movie was, well, just okay. There were far too many attempts at frights, most of which were so far in advance set up, you just sat and waited for them. A great majority didn't work, though admittedly one or two did make me jump. But that resulted in approximately 1-2% of the entire movie. This movie should frighten probably anyone who gets scared at simple stuff, like Paranormal Activity or any of the 1930-1940s original monster movies. Or any young kids.This brings me to another point: this is NOT for kids. Or even most teens. It might have been suitable for even younger teens, but they poured on the gore. This is NOT your grandfather's wolf-man. This is the Saw-Gen-Wolfman. Now, I didn't really have a problem at all with this. At least they had the balls enough to make an adult version of the classic, vs. making the idiotic PG-13 cut to make more money at the box office.Lawrence Talbot returns from USA to England when the search for his missing brother is just winding down. It turns out the entire town not only believed they're cursed with a man-beast on the loose, but fear that after a soon-to-be attack on a gypsy village and a bite on Talbot's neck, he'll be stalking/killing them too.Keeping in tradition, he can only change during a full moon, and the townie's attempts to thwart another series of murders by capturing/killing Talbot are moot as father Talbot protects his remaining child. There's some mystery on the other wolf-man on the loose and that's seen a mile away. When that's finally revealed, the scenes lead up to the eventual battle of the beasts.Throw in a fantastic London transformation scene and rooftop chase and a so-called love story from Talbot's sister-in-law and you have the entire movie.What worked: Great sets and feel. Wonderful transformation scenes. Great viewings of the werewolves. Old school techniques used right.What didn't work, unfortunately, is a longer list starting with: bad to mediocre acting. Both Hopkins and Del Toro all but looked bored and never before had I seen a tremendously bland job by either great actor. (Weaving just played/copied his "Agent Smith" role from Matrix.) Since they kept to "the full moon" predicament, they limited the number of wolf-man changes. The problem arises with believability in time frames, i.e. he's running from London back home and when he shows up, another full month had passed. Really? Also, predictable scenes, dialogue and twists. A "love" story that fell flat and was completely unconvincing. It was a tad bit slow at times. It suffered a somewhat confusing script when it could've been more straightforward. In addition, the dialogue was poor, bland and not one line stood out.This movie is for die-hard werewolf fans only. It has just enough morphing scenes and full-on wolf-man shots to keep me interested, though I would've preferred at least one more scene. I'm still awarding it 3/5 stars with strong reservations. It's not a horrible movie and it did a great job of giving you that 1940s feel all over again, aside from the gore. Worth a shot.
Okay, I did avoid this movie at all costswrongfully.21 & Over & its advertising & almost exact release date  within 1 day, one year apart & same actor & themes reminded me way too much of last year's incredibly wretched and absolute abomination, Project X. I couldn't bear to put myself through that hell of an experience again.While I will admit I was wrong  so incredibly wrong with this movie, some of the credit of my bad decision was, in fact: its advertising & almost exact release date  within 1 day, one year apart & same actor & themes. It seems like they  the marketing behind this, wanted to grab that audience. And perhaps they did. But, this movie was ten times the movie Project X was.For starters, it's not that idiotic idea of filmmaking: found footage/shaky cam. That's a huge plus. Secondly, they used real and somewhat established actors. I'm been a fan of Miles Teller since Rabbit Hole and really hope the best for him. It was ironic that as much as I want him to succeed and break through  I do think he has talent and is worth it, he did have a bit part in the movie I'm comparing this to. Mercifully, he only briefly made a cameo and his scene was the only few seconds I enjoyed of all of Project X.Thirdly, it's well written  backing up, it's written. Funny, intelligent at spots and Teller does steal every scene he's in as he, basically, channels all previous young adult smartasses in movies like this. But, while he may not completely make his role his own, he absolutely captures the screen and makes me root for a sleaze like him. And fourthly and finally, it has direction. Not, as in, a director  this actually had two: Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, but the script kept us going through to the end. Call me old fashioned, but movies, for the most part, as in 98%, need some line from beginning to end for me to like them. Where Project X was as random as its title, this one kept me engaged.Nowthis isn't all praise I have for this movie. I still deemed it three out of five stars, but it was a fun, and funny, ride held up mostly on the shoulders of the lead's charisma.The thin, albeit enjoyable plot, involves two old, reconnecting buddies who want to take out their third friend out on both his 21st birthday and incidentally, the eve of his future-career interview. Only, things go bad when said third friend gets too wasted to let the other two know where his lives. Shenanigans happen, as expected, in their quest to bring (the name mostly spoken) Jeff Chang home.Granted, I'm a little biased here. The movie begins with a bang, or a close up of the two lead's bare bottoms, and shows more following and later in the movie. But, that's all secondary to the fun I had. Again, it's not the most original movie, but on its own, it's a fun ride. Just too bad it had a few moments of poor editing and completely incoherent incidents.Overall, it's recommended for those who want to remember the 80s/90s party movies with a flare of today.
Not my type of movie, or genre for that matter - still haven't seen a John Wayne western, but I figured I'd give the BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III inspired No-Name-Man trilogy a shot for my first time. And, yeah, it was good. I loved the manipulating, but somewhat heart of, ah-hem, gold character of "Joe" and he's really the only reason the movie worked. Granted I wasn't alive in 1964, but I guess this might have been before it's time and I have to admit, it was well written. Worth a watch if you're into westerns, or specifically Spaghetti Westerns (the dubbing, oh, God, the dubbing,) or very young Clint Eastwood films with a very smart, anti-hero gunslinger. Yee-haw, er, I mean, Cheers!
By far the worst Bond and Bond-film (to 1969 date), On Her Majesty's Secret Service didn't just suffer from the super-spy's replacement: it was incompetent, too long, lazy and relied too heavily on altering course.Now, I am unfamiliar with the reasons of said change of roles (from 5-time Bond, Sean Connery to 1-timer Bond, George Lazenby) but I have heard it was because Connery didn't wish to be typecast. Uh, yeah, right  5 movies in as many years as the same character and he just THEN didn't want to be labeled as Bond for the rest of his career.In any case, the new Bond was even duller than when smirking Connery held the position. And the movie wasn't there to get his back, either.A chance meeting of suicidal, yet strong, Tracy, leads Bond to both love and a mission to find his long-time nemesis, Blofeld  another change of actor, this time: Telly Savalas. He does, indeed, find him on top of a Swiss Alps mountain where another evil SPECTRE plot emerges.I will give the movie some credit for actually starting off horribly and slowly getting slightly better  including an absolute punch-in-the-gut of a dark but original ending. However, overall, it was a mess of filmmaking: horrible camera angles, terrible lines, laugh-out-loud and cartoonish action scenes and they took the biggest risk turning 40% of the film into a romance. It did not pay off. It would be the equivalent of giving Jason Voorhees a friend out in the woods he can get some of his guilt off his chest each Saturday the 14th.At least they made it a little more  and shockingly  adult. James doesn't just admire a Playboy spread; he steals the pin up gal's pages for later.It's a miss and I believe the world was enough for one Lazenby Bond.(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the "odd one out": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)
1. It never rains in Washington State. Ever.2. While it may seem like a good idea at the time to challenge someone older, double your size and obviously a marine, you might want to think twice when that someone has also played the god, Thor.3. North Korea certainly picked the most opportune time to invade: every single United States Military Member was either on vacation or retired.4. Hemsworth seems to like visiting cabins in the woods in 2012. Sadly, this one didn't pan out for him like the last one.5. While escaping a North Korean concentration camp bent on converting Americans to their lifestyle, it is necessary to run with a randomly and implausibly available American flag to show patriotism in a film that states America abandons its citizens at the first sign of trouble.6. One U.S. missile is used to shoot down just one of the thousands of invading planes and a solitary cop car is on the rescue. Why am I paying taxes again? 7. Planes flying overhead and troops parachuting down somehow, and miraculously, simulate earthquake tremors that wake our heroes.8. Incredibly, rabbit ears still work. And, if you believe that lie, listen to the news.9. Daryl, played by Conner "Tom" Cruise, has a black father. That's gotta raise some questions.10. An Independence Day speech about "home" does not hold up today.11. One "asshole and his buddy" can easily take off with all the food that would feed a dozen kids, indefinitely, while the North Koreans set up shop.12. After ruthlessly invading another country and telling its citizens they are there to install morals, somehow people listen. If only it weren't for those meddling kids 13. When in seclusion in a mine shaft, cellphone batteries last for weeks, while my own needs charging every couple of hours.14. Silently leaving to go grab a beer can be as deadly as crying out: "I'll be riiiiight back." 15. When one resistance member causes the death of another to save his ungrateful, useless and blonde girlfriend he calls "family," all is forgiven by the fallen's girlfriend with a simple, two-finger peace sign.16. And, it's socially acceptable to abandon and endanger the rest of the victims on a makeshift prison bus to rescue said dumb blonde, as long as it's all about "true love." 17. Cramming an entire season of Walking Dead and Falling Skies into one 90-minute movie makes you wish for an invasionof any kind.18. Getting shot in the stomach and leaving the bullet intact can't possibly lead to anything bad.19. Hotwiring cars is a snap in movies.20. Tossing trash cans blindly over a fence will always produce the desired car alarm distraction.21. When no one notices two "terrorists" leaving a business, it's reasonable to assume the invaders will automatically find the culprit who aided their escape 22. And when the bad guys do locate that person and stage a public execution, it's further plausible that our heroes will know the exact location of the killing and thwart the assassination in perfect harmony.23. Subway® restaurants stay fresh while America is invaded.24. When robbing said Subway® restaurant, combining all fountain drinks into one bucket that's probably used to either mop the floor or gather the puke of unsatisfied Subway® customers, makes soldiers smile instead of puke, themselves.25. Thinking of luring those North Korean soldiers into an alleyway for an amateur ambush? Fear not: no one for a mile will hear you discharge multiple machine guns. In an echoing alley. With more guards nearby.26. Trying to remove a truck out of mud? It's always best to have the strongest behind the wheel while the weaklings push.27. Hating kids that are able to blindly leap down three stories and not die by either the fall or two armed guards at their descent is supposed to be funny. I guess.28. Aimlessly wandering and retired military men fill the damnedest of plot holes. Unsuccessfully, but still.29. If Tom Cruise believes "it worked for Will Smith" when he also attempted to make his own son a star in Red Dawn, he's probably just jumping on another couch.30. An EMP can apparently shut down not only the country's entire electrical system, but also the whole U.S. government, armed forces, police, firemen, ambulances, backup systems, 911, missiles, defenses and satellites over a thousand miles up. But, it has no effect on cars, radios or radio stations.31. Also, in time, electronics come back online, but all the satellites seem to have drifted off to some neighboring galaxy. I suppose.32. Without explanation, other than to hurry up the movie, a villain can produce the exact location of the heroes' hideout without satellites, scouts, intel or previous plot-hole characters directing them.33. Remaking a cult-hit takes balls. Admitting defeat = iron balls.34. North Korean's fully gassed military vehicles can be folded nicely into soldier's backpacks and used, instantaneously, when they land.35. Adding Shia LaBeouf's signature line, "Go!Go!Go!" to your script makes one almost want to press stop and plug in Transformers. Almost.36. When selecting a rebellion name, one shouldn't pick their own obvious school mascot when trying to avoid detection. Especially when it takes 15 minutes to spray-paint the name on a wall.37. "Killing the lights" in an isolated cabin in no way makes the place suspicious to the enemy.38. Ending a chaotic and clichéd climax inside the very work cubicle of the two main character's murdered father, isn't just lazy and predictable, it's sad and inadvertently, hilarious.39. Hawkeye Pierce would've solved this crisis in less than a 2-parter episode. After a few martinis, of course.
Go green somewhere else.Epic is anything but. It made Honey, I Shrunk the Kids look like a good movie to revisit.It's been a couple of weeks since I've seen this and I probably didn't need that much time for it to begin leaving my brain. In fact, I all-but immediately began forgetting all about this "adventure."What I do recall was that I didn't care one bit for the poor characters  both their insides and appearances, I hated the story and it all felt like this movie was under contract to be made so it felt rushed, the jokes stale and settled for and the "message" was as lost as the audience for this. This reminded me a lot of those old, boring and poorly animated Don Bluth films.Basically a girl gets zapped down to pea size and without much shock of that incredible and unrealistic action, she quickly joins forces of good leaf people vs. people of rotten ideas in the forest.The movie is actually boring, has little heart  especially when it attempts to and is a chore to get through. It's a complete skip.
Part one took me awhile to watch and I was blown away on how great it was. I was sad that I missed it in the theatre. Unfortunately, it also took me a long time to finally see part two, for I just watched it now exactly, to the day, 4 months following its release.Despicable Me 2 was an enormously fun ride and I found myself laughing and enjoying the ride for the most part. While it was prime entertainment for a very disappointing movie summer season, it truly felt like a sequel and ended up below the magic of the first film.Retired from the bad-man game, Gru's recruited to catch a live-criminal who wants toTAKE OVER THE WORLD. Meanwhile, he's dealing with his girls, more girls and his wonderful minions who never cease to wonderfully though never overbearingly steal each scene they're in.This summer produced several sequels (or in one case, a prequel) to big-named animated features. This one tops the Monsters University prequel but I cannot comment on the Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs sequel since I have seen neither the original nor the follow-up.Despicable Me 2 does drag in spots and tries too hard to place too many and unnecessary subplots, but for the grand majority of it, it's hilarious, inventive and just plain fun.* * * Final thoughts: Okay, fine, I'm sold on the Minions Movieif only it's not overkill. Ha, yeah, right.
Though I like movies that involve catchy and opportune timely dialogue with "all the answers," in reality, hardly anyone has all the right answers at the right times. Rabbit Hole is certainly the movie to prove that.Unfortunately, it's the typical "Oscar-bait" film, released immediately before the end of the year to be considered. I will agree with it being nominated for best actress for Kidman in a powerful role of a powerless woman. Her performance was amazing because it was so real and contained zero clichés of a woman mourning the recent death of her infant son.For Aaron Eckhart, whom I've admired for many years since In the Company of Men, could get nominated and he was goodbut let's face it, he walked solely in Kidman's shadow and his was, in fact, a tad bit more clichéd. The stand out and scene-stealer, was newcomer Miles Teller as Jason  the mysterious boy, Jason, who Kidman's character, Becca, follows around in her spare time. I doubt he'll be nominated, but I would write him in, if I were part of the Academy. He was very good in his few scenes.The remaining cast, including the always lovely Sandra Oh, and the movie itself was pretty decent, but nothing you can't see on that Oprah channel. In fact, like The Devil Wears Prada, I'm surprised this was released in the theatres.At any rate, as mentioned, this is a story of two parents coping with the loss of their young son who followed their dog into the street and was struck down by a car. For those squeamish of seeing a young child die, even in a fictional film, mercifully, this movie shows very little of that scene and only in flashbacks.As the couple goes to group and attempts to continue on with their lives, Becca does, coincidentally finds the teenager, Jason and follows him a few days which leads to an unexpected meeting and eventual friendship.The movie is shot as real life, though not like a reality show or film, and the writer was clever enough to put comedic moments in at the right moment to relieve some of the tension. It should be scene for anyone who needs help with the grieving process but mostly for an award-deserving role from Kidman.
While I found Man on a Ledge fairly exciting and fun and I can see it's taking itself pretty seriously  for the most part, it just boils down to the Wal-Mart of smart and similar thrillers, such as The Negotiator or (the also starring Elizabeth Banks film) The Next Three Days.And dang, as cute as Sam Worthington is, he's quickly becoming worthless instead. Sure, he's not necessarily a bad actor, but he's about as plain, wooden and depthless as Mitt Romney is in every single movie I've seen him in  Man on a Ledge, Avatar, Clash of the Titans (1 & 2) and Terminator: Salvation.Here, Sammy will yell and do everything in his power to convince the actors in the films, the audience and most of all, himself, that he was so wrongly accused, we should feel something for him. His co-stars did their best to react to his verbal pleas, he never once convinced me to feel for his plight and he was just there for the paycheck and exposure. So, I guess: Mission: Failed.That all said, it's still a fun little, leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature that mercifully wasn't that long  although, at times it did seem it wasn't greatly paced.Good cop Nick (Worthington) was set up by wealthy and entrepreneur David Englander (played by way-too-old-for-this-sh|t Ed Harris) in regards to a stolen $40-mil diamond. 25 years in the pen for Nicky won't do, so his plan involves the quickest and easiest prison escape in film history and then prop himself on a ledge (duh) so people will listen to him.Obviously, we have some time to kill, so there's an incredibly unfunny sub-plot/plot of his bickering and amateurish brother & his girlfriend, a.k.a. Ren & Stimpy breaking in, not coincidentally, across the street to prove Nick's innocence.There you go. That's pretty much it. Eh, throw in a pretty and (for a reason) hung-over negotiator and some side chess pieces and you have it.Despite all its flaws and cringing moments  such as the tense couple of squabbling lay-burglars and Sam's soulless performance, it's a straight-forward and surprisingly tense at times film. Perfect for just a relaxing Redbox night. During the week. When reruns cloud your DVR.
In what I considered one of the worst years on movie record, 2010, comes the (ONLY) second five-star feature: The King's Speechand I'm not even into period-piece dramas.Beyond the luscious landscapes, sets and overall cinematography, was the originality and comradeship of the two leads: King George VI (the ever-brilliant Colin Firth) and Lionel Logue (the even-better Geoffrey Rush.) Not only did they drive the movie, but I couldn't get enough of (the) Rush.Maybe I see myself in secondary actorsin real life. Though everyone's focusing on Natalie Portman in Black Swan, I was drawn, almost exclusively to Mila Kunis  who I strongly feel she should win for best supporting actress, regardless of Portman winning. Same here: people are all up in ARMS for the King (Firth) while I absolutely loved every minute of screen time for Rush.I hope I'm not short-selling this movie. It's a beautiful, nearly masterpiece of filmmaking, tale of a stuttering soon-to-be King who must align the UK when Hitler's setting the stage for his eventual downfall.Regrettably, it took me awhile to see this. Again, I'm not into costume-dramas and I initially thought this was too simple of a story of a man who has trouble speaking, but must overcome the handicap in order to be the, well, voice of his country.My bad. This movie lifted me. It made the 1930s as real as if Doc Brown had me ride shotgun there. Full circle: thanks to the unorthodox methods of Lionel the speechmaker.His methods obviously works, as in, getting speech-impediments curbed, but his "let's keep it on the same playing field" was what perked my interest. For an example, just listen and love the name he uses for the king.The movie is very simple, as the plot's already stated in my review. But it's character-driven, which I love, it's moving and definitely sparked more interest in me about the ins/outs of the kingdom in England than another movie I cherished: The Queen.I feel I'm really simplifying this film, and even then, I strongly suggest you watch this. It won't move mountains, but it might uplift you. Rekindle the hope in powerful movies (and performances.) And it might give you (yet another, but very nicely) point of WWII-view you might not have considered, like the direct combat Saving Private Ryan or Atonement did.It's rated Ronly for languagethink of it as therapy. And it's funny, thanks again to Rush. He had me rolling in parts. Maybe I see myself in himyeah, I have no tolerance for "political" or "authoritative" figures or heads of states. We're all humans and if we must respect each other and coexist, we must stand one by one, I believe. Thankfully Lionel teaches/preaches that. He's my English Idol.
I am awaiting the day one of the greatest and under-the-radar directors of all time, Wes Anderson, finally gets his honors.Admittedly, I've had to revisit most of his previous works more than once in order to appreciate or even understand him. I still have Rushmore to explore once again.Well, with Moonrise Kingdom, a movie I'll undoubtedly see again, I wouldn't need a second viewing forI loved it from frame one.Months from now, when the Oscars are revealed, it's sad that I highly doubt this will win the top prize. Granted, I haven't seen the other obvious nominees, such as Zero Dark Thirty or Argo, but I absolutely loved this wildly and unabashedly original distant twist of Romeo & Juliet and hope it surprises everyone and wins Best Picture.Back to Anderson and his genius for a moment. This movie is filled with kids: bright, young, full of energy and potential, and yet, this is probably one of the few times in my life have I seen spirits flow through their faces and knew it was the director that pulled that special talent out from their tiny depths to the open. You could see it in the boys faces, it was written all over them. They might turn their futures into the next Joseph Gordon-Levitt or Leonardo DiCaprio, but it was Anderson that helped them shine here.The wacky  and believe me, all Anderson fairy tales are  story revolves around nutso islanders of the 1960s trying to keep a small and disfavored orphan, Sam (played wonderfully by Jared Gilman) and an equally disliked young female, Suzy (also played without a flaw by Kara Hayward) from loving each other. Reasons: unknown. Selfish adults.Part of the beauty of this odd fairy tale is the adventures of Sam and Suzy, with the backdrop of a pending monster storm foretold almost immediately in the story, and the diverse directions the landscape and mood takes and never sways from the heart, humor or straight line the story promises it will take us.During that, characters grow, reveal themselves, realism strikes and we genuinely care for the people's outcome even when they don't mesh with how we feel they should act or what they should say.I know I said I wouldn't "have to" watch it a second time, but sure as shuck, I will. I know there is more depth here that I might have missed, more humor and more realizations I might have overlooked while trying to take in all the beauty of this filmmaking.In fact, I look forward to my revisiting the Moonrise Kingdom. It's an adult kid story that as an adult kid, I want to experience this again and again. Well done, Mr. Anderson. I look forward to you getting the absolute acknowledgment you deserve as of one of the best filmmakers, or storytellers, of any time.--Side Note: As I prepared to create the film review page for my website, I glanced over many film stills for Moonrise Kingdom and I smiled with fondness and felt remorse for neglecting some key aspects. I didn't even touch on the secondary characters  played by the wonderful Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Bruce Willis. They all did awesome, as did the cinematographer and both the film's score and soundtrack are to die for. I just had to throw these acknowledgements in because they all made the film well-rounded and I neither forgot them, nor the art created.
This does not star Kurt Russell, but rather allows him what amounts to an extended cameo. This work is more centered around the "son of" story line than it is the actual super heroes themselves, thereby failing to deliver the appropriate level of entertainment, and contributing instead, that enigmatic substance known as "kid appeal." I expected more. But having said that, there is more to this work than meets the eye. The story is modeled after the old classic "B" science fiction movies we hate to love, but do. The effects are nothing spectacular, but are still above what you would expect, all things considering. And beneath the camp, lies a stronger feeling, reminiscent of a classic superhero story, yet it still fails to achieve the desired affect; if only marginally.It was entertaining and I still had great fun in watching it.This rates an 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.
Previously, like four weeks ago, I had to revisit one of my all-time favorite comedies, because, well, it felt so relevant all over again. So much so, that the term  and thank God for this  "World Police" was thrown around the media relentlessly in regards toSyria.Just as that  also, thank God it didn't pan out  was all heating up, the words "World Police" popped in my head and so I popped in Team America: World Police.This was probably only my third or fourth time seeing it and the first since probably 2006. It has not aged. In fact, if anything, it felt like it was made today. Sure, the target of the Parker/Stone boys was George Bush Jr. (amongst many others,) but our government seems to continue to think we are the "World Police." So sad.I'd say that was my final word on politics, but that's what this whole movie is about. And it was a damn near perfect satire. Over-the-top hilarious, deadpanned responses from, ah-hem, puppets and the so much detail was put in, including the backgrounds, it was absolutely genius. Hell, even the facial expressions  if you could get those from puppets, and they did  were priceless.After inadvertently, though this appears like it happens a lot, destroying Paris in order to protect it, the special unit force: Team America (Fvck Yeah!) loses one member and this leads them to recruit an actor to find/fight more terrorists.Reluctantly and with side-splitting results, he agrees and the story centers on him and thwarting an attack by the North Koreans.I totally only gave you the very basic premise there, leaving out the hundreds, if not over a thousand gags throughout. The (South Park) writers/creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, go after everyone: left, right, moderates, activists, the media, the enemy, the allies, gays, Matt Day-mon and even people with AIDS, just to name a minute few.If you're the slightest bit uncomfortable with just one of those mentioned parties above, PLEASE don't watch this movie. Well, I guess you could, but it's doubtful any of this would open your mind to the Parker/Stone sense of humor. You might want to start soft, such as The Simpsons, then maybe work your way towards Family Guy and American Dad, with one stop at South Park before entering Team America: World Police.Beyond the humor, and believe me, I don't have room in this review to name all my favorite gags and lines, there's outrageously hilarious songs and a sad, sad message on how true the bulk of this is, hence the term: satire. But, they nail America's policies and attitudes perfectly in 2004and I guess, since then.One of my all-time favorite comedies, Team America: World Police, is recommended (again to only open-minded folk) and is perfect for those trying to see how the rest of the world views us.They nailed it. So to speak.Side Note: Just as this movie came out, a coworker and I had seen this movie  separately, but right before we were going to go into another mindless, stressful, boring, and irritating meeting with a boss that hadn't the slightest clue on what our job was or how to handle a meeting, I slid a hammer, I had specifically brought in for this sight gag, across his desk and said: "Here, you might need this." He literally could not stop laughing. Rightfully so; it fit in the movie as it did with the meeting we were about to head into. (Many days later, I had forgotten to take it home and my boss casually saw it in my drawer. She asked me what it was for, and I laughed it off with some lame story she seemed to buy or didn't care.)
Whereas #1 was fun, adventurous, original (to a point) and scary, 'Child's Play 2' plays out like a 'Friday the 13th' sequel. One of the bad chapters. It's almost half-believable how Jason kept coming back, if you suspend your disbelief to the max, but how Chucky is resurrected from the definite end in #1 is downright hilariously bad. But if you can overlook that, you get horrible camera wide-angles that are annoying, clichéd characters, predictable kills and props and literal overkill. And Andy? The actor, Vincent, though probably pleased to return, seems like he slept-walked through this movie, especially the closing. Here's the so-called synopsis: Chucky's Back as some of the titles indicate. He's back to transfer his soul into little Andy so he doesn't have to stay a doll, a position he put himself in, in #1. But will anyone believe Andy, now in foster care since his mother in #1, Hicks, refused to return? Probably not. This movie is seriously a no-brainer, or the writers were. Either way, it should be skipped. Thankfully, it's a short release, but the little substance it has hardly make up the 84 minute running time. Honestly, I can't say much nice, but maybe the girl, Kyle (who seemed like a character pulled from 'Friday the 13th part V') was a tiny bit interesting, but unfortunately, the foster dad (who seemed like a character pulled from 'Friday the 13th part VII') was anything but. Yes, Chucky is fun to watch, but not young kids smoking, which seemed real. Skip. In fact, watch part 1, jump to 'Bride of Chucky' and quit the series. Of all 5, so far, those are the only valuable ones.
Whew. What a week. Just spent the last few nights watching the Dollars "Trilogy" for the first time and only because they're deemed classics. Not my brand of movies, but for the most part they were good, with my absolute favorite, by a landslide, A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, or "Part 1." Not to say this wasn't good. It certainly was and tremendously better than "Part 2," FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. Interesting story, some unexpected humor, a fantastic score and real good characters portrayed by both Eastwood and Wallach. Definitely went on too long, as each movie in the sorta trilogy got progressively, and unnecessarily, longer. Probably by minor opinions, UNFORGIVEN was my first Clint Eastwood western and remains my favorite of his. On a side note, it sometimes makes for unintentional hilarity, when your first introduction to either a theme or cliché in a spoof or homage. Much like: I watched the AUSTIN POWERS movies first and repeatedly long before I watched all of the James Bond movies they mimicked and unfortunately, that made the Bond movies often hilarious when they weren't meant to be. Here, I saw and heard a lot I've already experienced many times in Quentin Tarantino films. I was like, "OH! That's where that's from." Haha. I digressYeah, I liked it, but none of these movies will I ever see again. If you're into westerns, specifically Spaghetti Westerns, you might enjoy these. But, only then.
High Tension is a great movieto watch once. And because of which, I'm so sorry I bought this on BluRay.When I first watched this, several years ago, I loved itup to the ending. I will not spoil anything in this review, but that ending completely disturbed me. Yeah, I get it; there's a huge revelation in the finale, but I thought it was completely unnecessary. It was such a FUN ride up to the end "trick." The movie is the basic, albeit wonderful, slasher tale that I love and grew up on focusing on two female friends that head to one of the girl's estate and family's isolated home tostudy. Well, no studying takes place when a dirty, old, fat male comes to visit with his equally repulsive van.After slaughtering anyone in his way  including a CHILD  he takes his live bait, one of the young college students and leaves her friend to attempt to get her free.There really is no depth to the story here, but it's great for those, like me, who loved the stalking killer, much like Michael Myers in the Halloween series or Jason Voorhees in the Friday the 13th franchise. It's bloody, grotesque, obscene and thankfully, while in subtitles, barely anyone talks for the second half. ButOnce you hit that "secret" that you *may* not know yet, the rest of the fun carnage is fruitless. In fact, with this second viewing, not only did I remember the twist, it was the only thing on my mind throughout this second, and probably last, viewing.Too bad. I thoroughly enjoyed director Alexandre Aja's 2010 update of Piranha and some of the movies he's written without directing. But this one, like The Sixth Sense, has one core secret that the whole movie is based on. Once learned, it can't be unlearned and makes a second viewing considerably less enjoyable.Recommended for rental.. Don't buy it, folks.
I so wanted to give The Darkest Hour a ton of passes, because it became clear in certain scenes that this was a B-Movie. But, what made me want to reduce the rating and increase the hatred was that they played this allsoserious.I've heard the bad reviews, the bad thoughts and the death threats against this Christmas release last year, and admittedly, during the beginning and most of the second act, I really didn't think it was too bad. Again, I gave it pass after pass for being a B-Movie in the same lines as Skyline and Battle Los Angeles. Unfortunately, following the viewing, it got progressively worse as I thought about it.That said, "the WORST movie EVER made!" will not cross my mind. Hell, the aforementioned Skyline was 10x worse. And The Darkest Hour was bad, yes  terrible acting, mostly bad special effects, laughable dialogue and a premise that falls apart faster than the characters that were reduced to dust. But, THEE WORST MOVIE? You haven't seen enough movies. Seriously.Despite the "twists" of setting this alien invasion retread in Russia and two dudes failing at a web service that would've felt more fresh 5 years ago, it's a typical, albeit pretty (as in cinematography/filmed) set up in Russia untilthe "Night of the Comet"s take place. Then it's still typical whereas the lucky 5 youngling survivors are trying to make it through the empty city.Of course, they're gonna meet someone who "knows" something about alien invaders and they learn about a safe house. And obviously, they'll be picked off one by one long after they've given their terrible signature lines that make the audience laugh out loud.Somewhat of a spoiler, but stillThey did discover a weapon to use against the aliens, and thanks to plot holes, they can reproduce this weapon rapidly, albeit they break down a lot.It's a silly movie and, again, not the worst movie, but it's also not worth a recommendation. There are 100s of movies just like this one and the vast majority were better.
1. The only thing this White House and the real one had in common was the color. Sorry...colors.2. Suspending one's suspension of disbelief must be a talent I don't have, but apparently, Director Roland Emmerich's very familiar with the 2012 concept.3. It's been almost 20 years since I've walked out on a movie. One hour into White House Down, I almost broke that streak.4. But, thank goodness I didn't. The climax was a triple-threat of absolute, albeit unintentional, hilarity.5. And, gee, I knew the boring, flag twirling subplot would come in handy.6. The President might be captured, used for ransom or assassinatedso why not worry about the absolute improbability of the stock market crashing in less than 30-minutes following a DC attack?7. Terrorist take note: Janitors never get screened when working high profile government jobs.8. It's gotta be a tad bit racist for an African-American to shout "Code Black! Code Black!" when the White House is under attack. Especially for someone imitating Forest Whitaker.9. Do all White House guides resemble Alan Ruck from Speed or Jason Schwartzman from any Wes Anderson film?10. Screaming to a terrorist: "You're gonna go to jail for that!" after he shoots a hostage might seem like an empty threat. Because it is.11. Ripping off the other White House-attacked 2013 release? Forget Olympus Has Fallen. Focus on who'll sue you for copyright infringement when White House Down names its tank-topped hero "John" and blatantly rips off even the worst Die Hard sequel.12. Oh, and A Good Day to Die Hardnot so bad any more.13. An entire scene of an action movie spend on: Squirrel vs. Bird Feeder feels more like a Rocky & Bullwinkle short. 30-seconds of that is certainly more entertaining than any of the 131 minutes of this.14. Characters like John Cale shouldn't have to tell the audience "This is so stupid!" but, he did anyways.15. First day visiting the White House? Fear not, every character in this movie is also serving their initial day. Including the President who clearly has no idea how or where to secure himself.16. Making 1993's Dave seem realistic must be an accomplishment. But, creating a less secure White House than the Dulles International Airport of Die Hard 2 should win some awards.17. Beepers should never be a key plot twist. Ever. Well, okay, at least, not in the last 20 years.18. When Sharknado appears to be more realistic and the WORLD-WIDE box-office receipts back me up, it's time to think twice before releasing a B-Movie in the theatres.19. Poor White House Down. They made a movie centering around White House tours that were outdated months before release. At least the original Spider-Man had the common Spidey-sense to delete the Twin Towers scene.20. Butif they ever reinstate the White House tours, and you happen to see a door ajar that you can peer into and see the bad guys getting ready for an assaultplease say something. Anything. To anyone.21. Calling the White House "the safest house in the world" and then immediately following that with another character hoping his inexperienced daughter got out is really wishing too much.22. White House windows are easy to open with knives and the rooms are even easier to set on fire to thwart terrorists.23. Spitting on President Abraham Lincoln's grave should be considered treason.24. Try not saying: "Whatthehell?" and following that up with extreme laughter every few moments in White House Down. I dare you.25. Jack Bauer would literally take a few seconds to analyze this situation and take less time to solve itif he wasn't already bored one second into this day.
There's something special, in 2013, about going back 26 years to the past 80s horror that brings a joy to a current and ridged heart. It's almost calming and yet unnerving, as this is when horror was horror.When I was a kid, my parents would take me to the Fry's Food & Drug store (an Arizona-staple grocery store since before I can remember and still to this day) and while they shopped, I stayed glued to the VHS video rental department, most specifically, the horror section. I would spend hours just gazing at the foam-filled empty VHS covers at the movie selections, especially the rated-R, horror fare I wasn't allowed to see.One, in particular, was April Fool's Day. While, I don't remember the time or place I actually saw it, but dang, I loved it when I did. And I'll never forget the cover of the box, i.e. the poster with the woman hosting a dinner party, raising a glass, her hair braided as a noose and a butcher knife behind her back.Back then and I would estimate I was probably 14ish, I didn't just like the slasher horror aspect, but the creativity of the events surrounding the unofficial holiday of "April Fool's Day."Today, it was a joy to revisit a movie I haven't seen since I was a kid. It was pure 80s. From styles, to direction, to cinematographyall the way to the cat jumping from the darkness. Did it hold up? Sure. Even with the "secret" that the movie doesn't reveal to those who have not seen it, orbeen spoiled by it.So, if you've never seen this movie, or heard any of the spoilers, please do not subject yourself to someone ruining it for you.For, there is a statue of limitations when it comes to films. Such as: Who was Luke's father in the original Star Wars fantasies? Or what was Rosebud? These kinds of spoilers, if not already known, easily can be told because the audience has already had enough time to watch the movie on their own. But, with April Fool's Day, even after 26 years, I implore you: do not let yourself be spoiled.(This all said, I will reveal my personal story at the end of this article, and like the warning above, I urge you not to read my final segment if you have not seen this.)The movie centers around some well-to-do young college aged kids spending a holiday on a remote island with a friend, or to some: sorta friend, and while gags are common as, it is April Fool's Day (and weekend,) the fun soon turns to tragedy. One-by-one, the cast gets hacked and it's an 80s mystery of whodunit and why. Oh and howdo you escape when there's no way off the island?Most of the movie was common 80s horror fare, down to the movie based around a calendar "holiday." Only this one cleverly switches things up with the motives and reasoning. Not to mention the humor; I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes and dialogue  even today. Oh, and I wanna provide my love for the ending, but that would be too much a spoiler. Suffice to say, it's well worth sticking through to the ending.On a side note, and something I probably didn't pick up on when I was a kid: there was a lot of homoerotic behavior in this movie. Sure, the guys (and some scenes with girls) were just messing around with each other when they had been put into places where they would "be with" each other verses the "hot" girls around. To me, today, that is, they looked a little more comfortable hugging and kissing, than most guys I know in these modern times. And that was refreshing with this viewing: these guys weren't gay, they never crossed the line into homophobia and they could still have fun with each other.I digress. I don't care if this movie is dated per today's standards, it's still clever enough to hold up today and I highly recommend this to both newcomers to 1980s horror but also to those who love suspense. SEE IT!*** Extreme Spoilers ***DO NOT CONTINUEif you have NOT seen this classic.After I had initially seen this movie, I wanted to see it again. This was a staple of my (and probably anyone's) youth: multiple viewings of the same ole films. Well, I convinced my dad to rent this, despite its obvious "horror" stigma and R-Rating, both of which, my parents were against. How did I talk him into it? I told him: "No one dies in this movie."He gave me a look like he didn't believe me. Who could blame him with the cover and whatever description he read on the back of the box? Nevertheless, with careful consideration and mild trust in his son, my father rented it so we could watch it together at home. (Yeah, if I wanted to see a Rated-R horror movie that he knew I was going to view, i.e. not a movie I snuck into see, or at a friend's house, we had to watch it together.)At any rate, his anger grew throughout the viewing as more and more people died. Knowing the "twist ending," I kept playing dumb while stating I thought I remembered differently. Finally, when the end came, and that was only about 90 minutes, his anger barely let up, despite the finale. I don't think he liked it, despite my ruse.Ironically, I remembered the final shot where someone actually did die. I was incorrect, but then again, we're talking 24-26 years ago. Age will help you forget the smallest of detailsBut, it didn't help me forget the quality time I had with my dad. Horror brings us together, people! Cheers!
You know the worse part of Chicago? When you finish, and I mean through the end of the credits, you will want to watch it again.This movie is AMAZING. And I am not into musicals. Back in 2003, my boyfriend made me see this movie a few weeks after its release at Arrowhead AMC. I resisted  again, I don't favor musicals, but the minuteyes, I mean MINUTEit stared I was hooked. For life.Dare I say this is my favorite musical? Well, it's not that easy. I absolutely loved The Sound of Music. But beyond that wonderful Julie Andrews Nazi film, this one had so much energy, originality, spunk, great songs, characters with soul-depth, score, suspense, fun and wonderful acting; I will NEVER forget this movie. It's got a permanent place on my measly 4-gig (12 with an almost useless 8-gig add-on card) MP3 player.Chicago starts off with a BANG  literally. Velma Kelly (Jones) enters the 1920's Chicago stage  with a little bloody journey, that is  alone when she is to be perform with her sister. She performs: "All that Jazz" (PERFECTLY, I must add) with on-looker, and main character, Roxie Hart (Zellweger) who's envious and star-struck. She's rushed away by her extramarital-affair boyfriend who promises her the world. When he can't deliver, he's carried away horizontally and she's hauled off to prison.There, she meets life and the characters who will influence the remainder of her life: namely Mama (Latifah) and Kelly  who got arrested for "murdering" her sister. She will also become the star she wanted to be, acting like the innocent little blonde with the help of the expensive attorney, Billy (Gere) who uses "Razzle Dazzle" to lead the jurors.There's a lot more to thisobviously with the fantastic soundtrack that, in itself, tells the fall and rise of the central character of Roxie Hart. But, I ask that you discover this gem on your own. I do each time I watch it.That's what makes this piece of history worthy of its Best Picture win (sorry, Lord of the Rings Part Two): they didn't stop at the excellent acting (ALL actors did their absolute best, despite only one winning a best actor Oscar (Jones),) or the wonderful and powerful songs that come one after another leaving you wanting even more. No, the screenplay and characters were filled with so many layers, you'd think this fantastic piece of work should win a Pulitzer.One of the most magical parts of this work of art: they went beyond the obvious. I appreciate that in any film, but I would've loved this movie anyways due to the energy and fantastic music. Why stop there? In this duel viewing, I picked up on "I can do it on my own" from Velma and the transition of Roxie's reality into fantasy. (In all honesty, I might have realized this earlier, so, to add to the magic, I guess I re-imagined the movie as if it was the first time watching it.) These two "minor" scenes/pieces made me appreciate/escalate the movie to the nth degree  and they were in the first 10 minutes.There's so much more I want to say about this movie and since I'm doing this for free, I'll continue. Gere deserved an honor for Pretty Woman, but this was a role of the lifetime for him, much like Julia Roberts's number one role was for that "pretty" prostitute. Latifah was absolutely fabulous. Sure she played herself, but no one, NO ONE, could've done it better. Zones was an absolute excellent 1920's flapper. Say what you will about Zones, herself, but, again, NO ONE could have been Velma Kelly. While Reilly was great in his role, and only one of two (Hunyak, played by Ekaterina Chtchelkanova  see below for translation, if you want. Watch the movie if want to know what she said) that was truly innocent, he played his normal sad-sack role. That's not saying he was bad  he was still wonderful.Now, beyond the person that actually won the Oscar  Jones, who thoroughly deserved the award, was Zellweger as Roxie Hart. She (Renee) is not my favorite actress, though I really liked her in Jerry Maguire, but in Chicago as Roxie Hart, she was perfect. Watch the absolute levels of depth she shows as a "human being": naïve, contriving, selfish and perkiness, all in one. Her character is truly the center of this movie; no matter what happens around her, no matter the character they introduce or shine, it's all about her. Zellweger, despite not winning the deserved Oscar, preformed the role of a lifetime.How great is it that everyone performed their own songs? Each one is excellent  sung in the movie, that is. (SKIP: "Class" from the extras from both DVD and Soundtrack. There was a reason it was cut.) My personal favoriteis a TIE. Originally, I loved "We Both Reached for the Gun," including the WONDERFUL puppet scene from the movie. Later, I loved "All That Jazz," the opening segment more. But, now, I can't decide between the two. My boyfriend, I mentioned, loved "Cell Block Tango" which I only liked a bit at the time, but now like a lot. As I listen to the whole soundtrack as I write this  the whole CD/Soundtrack is as great as the movie is. Buy the movie. Then buy the soundtrack. You won't regret either purchase.Isn't is grand? Isn't it great? 50 years later, or 2052, I think this movie will be considered what it should've on opening day: a classic. A masterpiece.
I am not sure if I want to start with the positives or negatives for The Proposal. Okay, I will start with the negatives to get them out of the way, but please stay with me for the silver lining.I'm sure myself and (even without reading the obvious countless other reviews from) the many other critics, will agree with the following words to describe The Proposal: unoriginal, obvious/predictable, practically minimal chemistry and virtually plot less. This story is a hundred years old, and each time I see it, I just sit back and wait and wait and wait for the obligatory "Oh, we really do like each other!" scene. I mean, do they even try anymore?Whew, now that typical (especially for me) negative review's out of the way, I can say this wasn't really that bad. Well, yeah, it was low brow, but not as much as it could've been. I want to say, first off, that I see that it made an astonishing $314+ million worldwide and $164 million stateside in its theatrical run. Normally, that would anger me due to the quality of entertainment. Strangely, it made me happy here.America (and a lot of the world) has spoken. They were entertained. I am glad they make movies like this. Not all films can be perfect 5 star and thoughtful films; not all can be trashy 1 star films. There has to be a group of no-brain movies like The Proposal to please the average movie-goer. And since it wasn't the worst movie, barely did it make me cringe, I'm glad they make these, fine, I'll say "light-hearted" romances.Bitchy-career woman Margaret (Bullock) is about to be deported to, ah-hem, Canada, unless she gets hitched. She immediately pulls 3-year "Smithers" assistant Andrew (Reynolds) in as her finance. No one, except his family, believes them  and this is one of the best aspects I liked of the movie: they didn't dance around the "secret" from her staff, bosses or the INS guy.The "new" couple go to Alaska to visit Andrew's family, namely for Grandma's (White) 90th birthday bash. Here City Slicker Margaret has to obviously and predictably adjust to small town/island/strong family values, including an average guy stripper, the longer-sunlit days and a dog even just for a weekend until she gets back to NYC to have the green-card interviews. Hopefully, they'll pass so Andrew doesn't go to jail or her to Canada!Lovely Alaskan scenery, Betty White being fun (aside from the fire-dance,) some nice revelations from Bullock in the closing and 1 (ONE) scene that made me laugh  Bullock & Reynolds coming up with their proposal story, made this movie worth one viewing. If you're in the mood for light-entertainment and a movie to completely dull your senses, you might like it.
Finally, I saw the "You Talking' To Me" movie.Was I impressed? Did I need to see it back in 1976 (uh, when I was two) to appreciate it? I think I just answered the first question.Taxi Driver was so random and bland and yet, it was watchable. It wasn't the startling film I expected. It wasn't the dark, deep and moving picture I imagined. Perhaps, yeah, I would have needed to see it back in the 1970s to understand where it was coming from because it sure as Hades didn't hold up for me in today's standards.Travis Bickle is not fickle about structure and what both New York City and women should be. So, with his insomnia, he opts to drive a taxi and stalk a woman who's volunteering to aid the "next" President of the United States. When that doesn't work out, why not try and rescue a preteen prostitute he's seen a few times?Let's throw in some odd friends, a guns purchase, politics, a rescue and revenge. Suffice to say, this movie, while extremely well directed and Jodie Foster does a decent job, is so incredibly random aside from the fact that Bickle's not getting better. He's getting worse and watch out.Supposedly, he's a hero, but I'm not sure who would ever call him one in today's times. Perhaps 37 years ago, ignorance would proclaim him one. Such unaware times.For original fans only.
I remember seeing In the Company of Men a very long time agonot sure exactly when, but it was when I began noticing independent films verses big budgeted all-name films. And I loved it. It was a refreshing change from explosions every few minutes.Unfortunately, times have changed.Yeah, I still like the film  I am a sucker for "super-human" characters, and Chad (Eckhart) certainly is. But, now my eyes opened, recently, to pacing and movies that overstay their welcomes.Don't give up on this movie, however. It's a somewhat original idea with excellent acting from Eckhart as an, excuse my English, asshole whose main purpose is to see people suffer for mere amusement.Here we have two "gentlemen," Howard (Malloy) and Chad who work together  one being the boss, though they graduated close to each other, and are sent for six weeks to an undisclosed city to set up their sales business. In a little down time  as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie: revenge against women.Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeahthere's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf.They do what they set out to. But, unfortunately for the movie's sake: they make it painfully obvious that one will fall (for her,) one will rise and the end result is what you expect.What holds the movie together and makes it worth a viewing is Eckhart as Chad. He's evil. He's borderline Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct) but he's somewhat more despicable than Stone, because he makes this all the more real. Also, they both smoke like a chimneynot that it's relevant  it's just probably thrown in as "you simply can't trust a smoker" I'm assuming.In addition, the end revolutions, when both Chad  who explains his motivations, and Howard who, well, shouts his, also make it worthy of a complete viewing.And finally: Edwards who plays Christine, is really NOT deaf in real life, so her acting and "speech" is truly impressive. Listen to the audio commentary. This is real acting.It's not fast paced and it's based on the stereotypical movie "lie" approach that always leads to the cliché revolutionary scene, but it's interesting as a "yeah, this could really happen" story and the actual climax is quite fulfilling. Eckhart is so good in this role; you almost root for him, despite his evil intentions. The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors.I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns. Stone did it brilliantly in Basic Instinct and Eckhart proved he could almost (give it about 80%) match her. Only, some of his scenes  such as, show me your balls  were a little off-kilter. As was his character.
Ah. The movie that introduced me to Jason Statham. Unfortunately, it took me a long time to get to this film.I was very hesitant to see The Transporter, much as I was to watch my first Jackie Chan film (Supercop.) So it was years after release, and instantly I took to Statham's charm, acting, charisma and fighting ability. By the time I watched this, part 2 was already headed to theaters (which I did see on the big screen) and part 3 was planned.But, I digress. This one involves an ex-super soldier who, well, "transports" items/people from one locale to another using basic and fundamental rules to make a living. And he's good at it, despite a noisy French officer. The transporter, Frank (Statham) gets inadvertently caught up in a human-smuggling ring and though he likes anonymity (obviously) he regains somewhat a heart and helps a victim and tries to stop the bad guys.Really. If you cherish the Jackie Chan movies, you'll like this one. You know what I'm talking about. Barely a plot. Barely good acting. Less plot, more kick-butt. You'll then like this action vehicle.I don't really like comparing Statham to Chan, as they are 100% different, but they do produce similar movies. While Chan has a certain charm for his fan base, Statham also has his own way of producing charisma for the audience. And he got me hooked.Best scenes involve NO CGI or any special effects (something part two of this series should've taken note of but failed) and just having Statham driving or hand-to-hand combat. Just his character's depth and fighting technique is worth the time, money and effort into watching what would've actually been a run-of-the-mill average foreign action flick. Recommended!
People dog remakes all the time. Hell, to begin with, they have little respect for the Horror, Creature-Feature Bmovies of the 40s and 50s. What David Cronenberg did here, with 1986's The Fly wasabsolutely amazing.The original The Fly, the Vincent Price, 1958 movie, of which I haven't seen since I was wee little tyke, had a good-enough idea, but they had to settle for the stated "Horror, Creature-Feature Bmovies of the 40s and 50s" standards and low-budgetshence, the giant fly-head prop.To a kid, that can, and was to me, be scary. As an adult, or young adult, even, this updated version was just shy of being a horror/suspense/psychological masterpiece in filmmaking and should rank high on anyone's "Favorite Remakes" list, if not just "Favorite Horror" tally.The movie wastes no time setting up what seems like a deliciously and wonderful claustrophobic Broadway play with only a trio of main characters and a few minor extras. In the beginning, (the excellently cast) Jeff Goldblum's brilliant scientist, Seth Brundle entices reporter, (also wonderfully cast, Geena Davis's) Veronica back to his "secret lair" to witness what he refers to: "something that will change the world, and human life as we know it." And he's right. Kinda.Even though the original movie predated the Star Trek TV show, the concept Seth's been working on is teleportation; the ability to transport objects, inanimate or not, from one pod/space to another. But, with this technology, it could also help with medical surgeries amongst other fantastic uses.At first, Veronica's skeptical, but eventually she both warms to the idea, the "story" and, eventually, to Seth. (Side note: they had wonderful chemistry on screen, which is no wonder since they did become a couple for awhile in real life.)But, as all Sci-Fi, Horror stories go, there's the "but, what if" scene. In a jealous and drunk rage, Seth decides not to wait on tests and becomes the first human teleported. It would've been all okay, if not for that pod swallowing that fly. I guess he'lldie.You (should) know the rest, but not this gruesome and inventive. Director Cronenberg was so incredibly creative and smart, it's a wonder this movie doesn't rank even higher. I am not a prude to when it comes to gross scenes, but some of these scenes when Seth becomes (the fantastically named) BrundleFly, I have to look away.That's not to put a blemish on this great work of art. If anything, it's Cronenberg's way of saying: Hey, this is real lifeif this were to ever happen.And remember, this is 1986 and probably was worked on in 1985. The SMART computers of those days were, well, house-size, almost. It was cool to see such an intelligent computer even way back then.This movie had so many things going for it including, but not limited to: excellent acting, originality even in an old story, chemistry, snappy, believable, rich and often, hilarious dialogue, suspense, horror, drama and a truly satisfying ending. There are a lot of Cronenberg fans out there, but this is BY FAR, my favorite of his tremendous résumé.* * * Final thoughts: "Be afraid. Be very afraid," says Geena Davis. You know how many years I took to track down that quote, pre-internet? I had forgotten where it came from and loved it. Well, look no further
When I first saw Planes, Trains & Automobiles probably a decade back, I wasn't a big fan. I did like Steve Martin and John Hughes, but was never into John Candy. Well, after not 1 or 2, but 3 recommendations within the past 24 hours to watch the "Best Thanksgiving Movie Ever," I decided to revisit this original road trip flick.I told my friends my personal favorite of the Thanksgiving genre is Scent of a Woman. And after rewatching Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Scent of a Woman remains the champion.What am I talking about? How many Thanksgiving movies are there? Are there enough to make top 25 favorite and bottom 10 worse lists? Heck, is there enough to fill a 5-spot list?I digress. I did laugh out loud in this a few times with Planes, Trains & Automobiles. It was funny and definitely touching, especially towards the ending. Also, some of the lines were priceless, such as: "You know, I was thinking, when we put our heads togetherwe've really gotten nowhere."  Neal.What we have here, is Neal (Steve Martin) trying to get back to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving, but every obstacle has been thrown in his way, including traveling buddy, the good-natured but dufus Del (John Candy.) They develop a needy relationship by using, obviously, many methods of travel and of course, hilarity ensues.Okay, here's the problem. I've driven from St. Louis to Chicago  the duo's last leg of their journey. It's just a smidgen above 300 miles. That's not that far! Okay, maybe for Little House on any Prairie-times, but not for those using modern transportation devices, such as, I dunno, planes, trains and/or automobiles. Neal's wife desperately wants him to come home, but I guess the thought of her driving a mere 600 miles round trip is too much for her?But, wait, it gets better! (Or worse?) In one of the comedic scenes, the odd couple manages to set their car on fire next to a sign that reads: Chicago 102 miles. (The car is, spoiler  sorry, salvable and drivable. How? We don't know, but we have to assume they put it out withuhsnow?) First instinct for them is to get yet another run-down motel room. Now that lonely wife can't drive 204 miles roundtrip to be reunited with her loved one.And further (!) they travel some more the next day, get pulled over and have to hitchhike in a semi. John Candy, er, Del, gleefully says it's just under three hours. Let's not even estimate here. Even though they've moved closer to Chicago since that sign that read: 102 miles to go, let's just say that's how far they'd have to go. That means, way back in 1987, the highway's speed limit has to be roughly 35 mph?Okay. No movie's perfect, but this is quite the major flaw here. We're supposed to sympathize with Neal's wife and Neal, himself, but the old lady's not willing to hop in the car to solve this problem? Oh, I live in the metro-Phoenix, AZ. From one point of the edge of town to the opposite end is just about 96 miles. I would take that journey to get someone home for Thanksgiving, let alone safe.This is not to mention the countless other inconsistencies regarding all the "free" stuff they got on either their con-artistry or other people's credit cards.AgainI digress. Skip the plot holes, and enjoy the ride. Although, since we're no longer slave to this buddy-road movie, might I suggest the 10x more hilarious, albeit extremely similar 2010 version of Robert Downey Jr./Zach Galifianakis's Due Date? I'd really rather watch that one again than this one.
With the sequel, 5-years late and quite obviously just another paycheck-grab for broke Nicolas Cage, heading to theatres in a few weeks, I thought I would see the original 'Ghost Rider' (2/10 Stars) for the very first time. I never wanted to before, based solely on my distaste of Cage and the movie looked downright silly. I was right: the flaming head of Hellboy on Wheels was outrageously cornybut let's look beyond that, shall we? Incredibly misconstrued and too complex script, laughable acting  especially the fake looking Cage (namely, when he wasn't CGI'd to death and still human), terrible dialogue, bad guys that look so hilarious when demonized that you want to develop a drinking game bases solely on them and awful and uninspired camera shots. I never thought many super-hero movies would come close to the travesty 'Daredevil' was, but this one seemed to ride all over it. Did I mention it was just shy of two hours, a full half-hour longer than it needed to be? I'll admit, I was confused throughout with about six characters and their separate motivations, but it was the writer's job in what's supposed to be a simple comic-book character to make it accessible by the end. I guess you can say no to the Devil per YOUR OWN CONTRACT with him and then use the same powers he gave you to "fight" the wrong-doers? Or why would he want to? Or why does the "curse" come out only at night, but then shadows work too? And when did certain people become "innocent"  everyone's guilty of some sin  if we're supposed to go with the Bible like this is preaching? When the credits rolled I had multiple questions unanswered but the biggest was: why didn't I listen to my initial gut reaction and never see this?
Those who state X-Men: First Class is the best of the five X-men movies apparently haven't seen any of the first four.Admittedly, it's better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and everyone has a right to their own opinion, but come on. This movie suffers from being too long, too much story  for a superhero film, too little relevance and not enough of the exciting X-Men we've become accustomed to.Yeah, I'm aware it's an origin storyyet ANOTHER X-Men origin story (boy, do they like to tell origin stories verses just continuing onward, which I would prefer)but this came off way too much like another unnecessary prequel: Hannibal Rising.I don't want to sound too harsh, because First Class is superior to similarly scripted Hannibal's "Fun with the Nazis" Early Years. I'm just getting kinda sick of the back stories. In the previous four X-Men films we had bits and pieces of the history of the characters, but none as the exploited and blatant as Wolverine's. While I loved the character of Wolverine, it was refreshing that First Class chose NOT to explore, once again, how he got that adamantium or who created him or why he lost his memory orPLEASE tell me there isn't gonna be a Second Class film. Can you please do present tense? Do you have so little faith in the X-Men that they always have to go backwards and never forward? As much of a Superman fan I am, I would be thoroughly upset if the next four Supe movies deal with life on Krypton and/or yet another Smallville retelling. Move on!Further, in what is beginning to look like the George Lucas Space Saga, we keep going backwards after it began forwards with the original trilogy. 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine is set before the first three and this one, before that. Where are we headed? The "evolved" fish that leaves the sea and supposedly and eventually becomes man? (Ironically, there is, in fact, a mutant named "Darwin" in First Class.)That all said, the movie isn't exactly terrible. It absolutely could've been cut by a half hour or any editing: the movie also suffered from poor editing. But the performances were decent, the "surprise" visits and homage was cute at points and the CGI/special effects were good.The basic plot revolves around the rise of (the soon-to-be Professor) Charles Xavier (James McAvoy  who, while good, is NOWHERE near the talent or charisma of Patrick Stewart), the revenge-filled Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender, who, AGAIN, isn't close to the performance of Ian McKellen and channeled a bit too much of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine) and the Cuban Missile Backdrop. Meanwhile, good/bad/indifferent/boring  especially the bad  mutants band together to come up with neat nicknames and explore their powers. Somewhat.While I did have fun when Charlie and his pal Erik find other similar mutants and further, when they're being "trained" while the two leads bicker, the rest of the movie was like a "based on the series" direct-to-DVD that is for fans-only and could easily only be watched once. I might watch again, but it would have to be a TV-edited version.As for the whole series, I vote for true believers to stick with the originals. X2: X-Men United is still the best, followed closely by the original X-Men. Even though, at first, I didn't care for the third installment, X-Men: The Last Stand, upon re-watching, I actually had a lot of fun during that. (If I had known what was coming, I would've appreciated it even more.)Skip X-Men Origins: Wolverine, for you see his "origins" in the previously mentioned films multiple times, anyways. And finally, for X-Men: First Class: it's worth a viewing, but it can certainly wait for it to hit home videoand for die-hard fans only.
Almost immediately in the pitch-dark comedy God Bless America, the fantasies of angry Frank take such a sinister turn, or blast, that there's zero hope for siding with our antihero.So, why did writer/director  ah, hem  Bobcat Goldthwait, want us to listen to him, to empathize his plight or agree with him, even when we should since he does, in fact, stand against the absolute downfalls of America? I'm not sure, and I did try to block out what he did, even though it was just his delusion, so I can get back into the picture. Believe me: that was not an easy image to erase.At any rate, after Frank gets fired from his job, and is given only so much time left after a brain tumor's discovered, his built up anger against "uncivilized" individuals blows up and he begins a killing spree.At first alone, and then he reluctantly allows Roxy, a young, Mallory Knox (Juliette Lewis from Natural Born Killers) type, to accompany him.Again, remember this is a comedy, albeit dark and disguised as a satire, so you'll have to suspend 89% of your disbelief on the events that follow. And believe me: what I just described is about the first 20 of 100 minutes.Okay, here's the problem: throughout the movie, we have Frank and Roxy spew hatred towards "pretentious" people while being nothing but, themselves. Repeatedly, they give examples of clichés, phrases and types of people they dislike while being all of the above themselves. It would've been more accepting, by me, at least, for them to just say: "I just don't agree with so and so's views and character(s)" and not attempt to act above them.Goldthwait is obviously making a statement against pop culture and entitlement of Americans these days, namely against American Idol, soulless reality stars and right-winged FOX News personalities. And trust me: I hate all of that too. So much so, I've never seen one Kardashian-type show, not one single minute of American Idol and absolutely have I avoided at all cost every ounce of Jersey Shore. All of those, in addition to the FOX News racists, liars and bigots, disgust me beyond belief and make me want to shout out to the world: I'm so ashamed for these people who are supposed to be Americans.BUTthe hypocritical views of the main characters, the outrageously easy path they're on and the obviously WRONG way of handling such loathing dampens the compassion I would've had for them. Oh and there's that one scene in the opening that there really was no coming back from.Mercifully, Frank does have a lot of excellent points and part of the moral of the story is heard by me by closing. So, it's not entirely a wasteit just should not be taken seriously, not one bit and let's keep fighting these terrible and immoral pop phenomenons (or are they just phedemons?).Let's just find a more productive way of handling it or broadcasting it.
Why do we hold onto the 1980s music? (Or for you, yutes, the 1990s.) We think of a "better time" and hold onto that, squeezing tight. I do. Depeche Mode, Roxette, The Cure, Big-Hair-Bands, etc.I tell you: It's happening now. Enjoy life now. For, in 20 years, we'll look back and say this was a great time. Why wait that long?I admit: until tonight, December 23rd 2010, I had yet to see Say Anything Sure, I've been cited as a "non-movie critic" for not watching certain movies, such as this John Cusack-boombox-wielding 1980s iconic film. I've been told I'm "not in the industry" for missing such "classics." And yetI took it three whole steps further: I've never read any of the reviews of this movie. I've completely and purposely skipped over the synopsis. And, incredibly, I ignored learning what song was played when Mr. Cusack held the boombox over his head in one of the most recognized scenes/posters in film history.I wanted to be surprised when I finally saw Say AnythingAnd I was. I was blown away at what I thought would be a VERY dated movie. It was not, indeed.What a smart and timeless movie this was. Writer/Director Crowe (Almost Famous, Jerry Maguire) is certainly known for his soundtracks and incorporating his music into the storyline. While he doesn't make the most memorable album here, it's certainly noteworthy, especially during the sex and later-boombox scenes.Beyond the tracks, Crowe writes an intelligent and post-high school movie when most filmmakers make films of that time that involve just high school'ers and their ailments. His characters aren't brilliant, but human. His dialogue is noteworthy and sharp. And he made people who watch this for the first time, 21 years later, appreciate his work for the first time. That's talent.Lloyd (John Cusack) falls hard (in the eleventh hour of high school) for Diane (Skye) who's headed to Europe for college from her divorced dad's (Mahoney) hard work. She shares everything with her dad, even when Lloyd starts dating herand more.He's concerned about her "throwing her life away" on just a boy, who happens to have a self-proclaimed aimless future. All Lloyd knows is his deep fascination and love for this very pretty and extremely smart dame.Here comes the (now  2010) clichéd courtship, eventual downfall and (possible) reconciliation of the budding relationship and the victims along the way. Well, watch it, as I did  for the first time and see if there are really any "victims."Back then, or 1989, it wasn't so much a "cliché" so they can't be held accountable. Take away what might seem that way today, and you'll have a great script with Cusack (both him and his sister, as usual) carrying the movie. What a model actor he is? He's surrounded by multiple, already-established talent and future talent (SEE: Piven) and yet, he's the driving force of this movie. He's the one that shows true love on screen.Whether you've seen this movie a while back or considering for a first time  like me, tonight, it's thoroughly recommended. Allow yourself to remember the 80s, its wonderful tracks and what it feels like to fall in love again.Always hold onto what we cherished in the past. And always remember, we're living in memories. As we speak.
"Sooo cool" Teen-Charley Brewster is delaying hetro-sex to spy on his male neighbor and the neighbor's male roommate. Sounds like me growing up.Actually, I did grow up with this classic, this original Fright Night, released in 1985. So much so, I'd forgotten about all the classic lines I could quote verbatim this time around. Also, the two classic horror/comedy characters: Peter Vincent, TV host and Vampire Killer, extraordinaire and "Evil" Ed. And it helped that Charley was waaay cute when I first watched this  and he's still adorable when I rewatch this.I loved this movie growing up and I can appreciate it more now with the likes of the wretched Twilight series that stomps all over the vampire legends. It's nice to revisit this and see real rules applying to "real movie vampires."Everyone in this movie was having a blast making this. Everyone chewed their scenery and we can join in with the fun. As mentioned, the one that stood out, overall, was the everlasting Peter Vincent, played wonderfully by Roddy McDowall. I loved those cheesy horror movies growing up and namely the last-night hosted programs, such as the one here. I could definitely relate to Charley who shared the same passion and idolized Peter.Basic synopsis: Geeky Charley thinks new neighbor as a vampire, and (surprise) no one believes him  not his best friend, gal, mom or eventual pal, the Vampire Killer/Bmovie TV Host, Peter Vincent. The fun here, in this own spoof/comedy on the horror legend  the Vampire  is getting the goofy Peter to not only believe but aid Charley destroy the vampire neighbor and save his girl.This is a real fun movie. Sure, it's dated  just listen to the soundtrack  but for those who may not have even seen this, it's still great to check out for those who loved the old monster movies of yesteryears. Highly recommended.
1. If you're wondering if you need to see the first one first, stop while you're ahead.2. I haven't seen this much snow in New York City since The Wolf of Wall Street.3. Keep in mind: Birdemic's excuse was lack of funds.4. Dear God, let this tragedy take New Yorker's minds off that other, even worse attack on their city: 1998's Godzilla.5. Just because your script is fully aware of how stupid this concept is, doesn't mean the writer was brilliant. It just means he was awake when he wrote it.6. It can't be that insulting to mistake a female author named April with a male. After all, she might invite you to a signing within seconds of signing the book she'll eventually sign again for you at the signing.7. Then, again, when she signs your book with penmanship of a three- year-old and can't blame it on the mild turbulence of the plane you're on, you might want to reconsider that book signing invitation.8. Why was I always waiting for Tara Reid to meow like her cat children and bark at Gordon Ramsay at Amy's Baking Company?9. "I was famous when I was a surfer. It cost me my family," says Fin. Yes. If you were to surf with your entire family in tow on the wave in Deep Impact.10. I guess I missed the Mythbusters episode where they proved that movie bicycles can, in fact, outrace tornadoes.11. Mets fans leaving the stadium in droves before the game ends finally, some realism.12. The scariest thing about the Sharknadoes is that they make the Twilight series watchable.13. "Jump the shark" you say? Hahahaha, thank you 1990.14. "If you don't come back (alive,) I'm going to kill you" is one of the heartfelt lines in this movie. It's also the logic, but I gave up believing in that long before the opening credits began.15. Not since Ghostbusters II did New York City get associated with a bad movie involving an overextended Lady Liberty scene.16. Great. Now, I just wanna watch Cloverfield again.17. Did Tara Reid say her prediction of a real Sharknado would happen The Day After Tomorrow? Because that would make more sense.18. "This is your Captain speaking. Please do not mind the large gaping holes in the side of the plane. Feel free to roam around the plane as you please as if they were the same large gaping holes in our storyline. Enjoy your flight!"19. Breaking a bat across your thigh doesn't make you a badass. It makes you seventeen times stronger than Supergirl.20. No, I am not hungry for Subway, Jared.21. Okay, maybe for one of those flatbread pizzas. And it's not for your shameless product placementsThey are really that damn good.22. "(The sharknado) is a twisterwith teeth," says Al Roker. Miley Cyrus would also be a correct substitute for that line.23. Yeah, it's so hard to remember where you're sitting at a ballgame. Especially when your ticket sarcastically reminds you.24. For only being 86 minutes, taking time out for a ridiculously irrelevant flashback set up by an annoying baseball fan spouting ESPN trivia to a player who should already know his own history and ending with no payoff on why he was not in the VIP sectionpretty much sums up the rest of the film.25. There is more running in this movie than The Running Man.26. There is more running in this movie than Republicans for President in the last election.27. There is more running in this movie than the Boston marathon. (And I'm not even a Yankee fan.)28. The Second One isn't that clever of a title 32 years after Airplane! came out with "The Sequel."29. Perhaps a better subtitle would've been Number Two.30. I guess if you can safely navigate a helicopter into a tornado in the first movie, flying an airplane into one should be a piece of cake.31. Ripping off The Twilight Zone with the "There's something on the wing!" bit or mocking names and scenes from Airplane! isn't an homage. It's insulting in a Sharknado sequel.32. Although, mimicking Jaws: The Revenge is just perfect.33. I am uncertain why the references to the Evil Dead series were needed especially within minutes of a slap across Doc Brown's face.34. Of the 602 cameos, Judd Hirsch reprising his Independence Day role was my favorite.35. Oh, and Andy Dickyou look terrible.36. No. The stupid climax was not hilariously bad, intentionally or not. Nothing about this movie was hilarious.37. Piranha 3D was fresh, hilarious and spot-on with their Richard Dryfuss/Jaws reference. AndFuvk you, Sharknado 2, with your characters named Martin and Ellen Brody. "Fin" was bad enough; you had to spit on a masterpiece with your unimaginative humor?38. Don't believe in evolution? Well, the evidence is clear when sharks learn to roar and aim when faced with a tornado lift.39. By no means, this movie was not meant to be taken seriously, but when a severed hand amazingly finds its way back to its owner in the climax, I hated life when they gave less than a fvck on the fact it somehow regenerated most of the arm with inside the mouth of the shark who never bothered to swallow it.40. If not for my loyal devotion to the fantastic How Did This Get Made? podcast, I would've never seen this. Here's (raising my Bud Light) to them putting on an entertaining discussion on how incredibly worthless this experience was.
Originally, when I watched Jurassic Park upon opening weekend, I wasn't too fond of it. Despite its shortcomings: an unoriginal script that relied heavy on what they could do with special effects  damn, those dinos still look real!  it has grown on me over the years, especially due to those realistic dinos and the excellent character of Ian Malcolm (Goldblum.)Unfortunately, as the tagline goes, something has survived, but it wasn't Ian who's been reduced to "Action Figure" in the follow-up: The Lost World: Jurassic Park.And as uneven as the movie is, boy it wants to be several different flicks, the movie is a very nice, updated and darker tale than the original. That's not saying it's better, but it's a good sequel, nonetheless.One of the flicks it wanted to be, and heavily advertised, was a truer version of the 60-year-old Godzilla tale of a dinosaur running amok in the city. This: I could not wait to see and alas, was thoroughly disappointed that it was only the final act with roughly 15 minutes (of 129) of city terror. Too bad. In addition, one of my complaints of the first, were the wooden and boring children Spielberg so loves to shine on (E.T.) Here, I'm only guessing he was trying to make a statement of acceptance with the new "kid star" of the feature: Vanessa Lee Chester, who plays Ian's daughter, Kelly. She's black, he's white, I get it  this is more of a shove-down-the-throat statement more relevant in the Lethal Weapon franchise  but I could care less about that. What I cared most about, was not only how dull she was, but she actually made the kids in the first one more lovable. I really need to tone down my criticisms as it could always be worse (SEE: Jurassic Park III.)The series did take a good turn with the direction the series took with an "Aliens" approach and a great new character of the hunter, Roland Tembo (Postlethwaite.) Yeah, I know, it's again (mostly) on the island, and yeah, I know, it's another rescue mission, but it's fun to watch. Even with the other (again, Lethal Weapon) subliminal message of animal cruelty  thanks mostly to Vince Vaughn in his break-through role of PETA-type photographer, Nick.I'm not an activist, but I definitely don't condone the cruelty to animals. That said, whenever a movie "sides" with the PETA soldiers, I laugh my ass off when they get bit, themselves, from the very beings they're trying to save. SEE: 28 Days Later.What we have here isThe return of John Hammond (Attenborough) who, by the way died at the end of Jurassic Park (the book) soI guess somethings have survived, indeed. Anyways, in a flimsy way of getting Dr. Ian Malcolm back onto an island full of giant (and small) monsters, Hammond uses Ian's girlfriend, Dr. Sarah Harding (Moore) as bait. She's been on the island for some time, studying the animals. Ian accepts, making this more of a rescue mission (hence, the action star who checks his chaos at the door.)Undeniably, it quickly turns into "how do we get off the island in one piece" again, when daughter Kelly stows away and Nick's constantly trying to sabotage the other human inhabitants of the island from bringing the dinos to the mainland  San Diego. Nick's feisty efforts of saving the genetically, shouldn't-be-here-anyways, engineered dinosaurs does lead to chaos (full circle) and to people's deaths. Oh, well, at least he saved a few animal lives.The two groups merge with the common goal of escape since Nick's animal-lovin' ways caused enough disturbance, they're all vulnerable and at the same time, lunch for the dinos.Obviously, they're gonna get off the island, just so they can get to what the advertisements promised: a T-Rex in San Diego.It's a satisfying conclusion to part one and contains a lot of action and great cinematography. Also, they step up what they've already accomplished in part one: two T-rexes fighting for their young, this time in my favorite scene in the movie  when the trailer goes over the edge.It's worth a watch and like I said, it's a good conclusion: stop watching the Jurassic Park series here. Trust meyou don't want to waste your precious life on the irrelevant, franchise-killer: Jurassic Park III.
"It can't rain all the time," says Eric "The Crow" Draven.Obviously, he's not visited Seattle.Picture it, Phoenix, AZ, Black Friday, 2012. I ventured through the Fry's Electronics for BluRays when all of a sudden, I notice The Crow's on sale for $5. It's a steal for a movie I've only seen once in the mid-1990s that I recall liking. I'm so glad I picked up this film.With just a few obstacles, this movie is fantastic. Great action, good story, genuine heart, special effects well-done and one of the best cinematic soundtracks that came from the 1990s, The Crow makes for a great ride from beginning to end. And magically, it holds up solidly today.Rocker  though that's completely incidental  Eric Draven is resurrected from a thug-life death to avenge his sweetheart's brutal murder by means of a crow's guidance, no less.Seriously, that is the entire synopsis of this story, even though there's a little more.Now, that "more" is sometimes meh, mostly clichéd, even for 1990s standards, but it's interesting nonetheless. Especially, secondary character, Sarah (played wonderfully by Rochelle Davis,) who's yearning for a real role model, or the fantastic Michael Wincott as, ah-hem, "Top Dollar." You could also include the great graphics and at times fun dialogue.Nowhere goes: I understand making this dark. The 1990s were all about the dark, but this was, for about 50%, too dark. And I'm even talking about on BluRay. I get mood and I get they were trying to cover-up the stand-in for the unfortunate incident that took Brandon Lee's life (during filming) way too short, but at times, I felt like I rolled over on the remote and turned off the TV and let the speakers guide me through the scene.In addition, the movie kinda started off a little silly, with how quickly a completely disoriented newly reanimated Draven learns to be a super-hero. And don't get me started on why (the HELL) he would quote "The Raven" as an introduction at one point. If I were his victim, I wouldn't be able to get past that when Draven asked for what he wanted.Anyhoo, it's an extremely fun movie that, despite its clichés and shortcomings, is a thrill ride with an abundance of great action sequences, an absolute killer soundtrack and one of the best movie lines of all time: "It can't rain all the time."After only seeing this once before, I still use that line to date. It sums up a lot of situations we feel are too heavy with our daily lives.And don't ask me about the Lee-less sequelsI dunno  I haven't seen them, nor have any definite plans to watch them. I just know this was a treasure, I'm glad I got it and I can't wait to see it again.
My suspicion is the tagline "Panic Room meets The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3!" didn't make the cut.I was in Vegas recently  thank you all for reading my embarrassing WSOP blog  and with a little time to spare (again, if you read the blog on my site, My 2010 WSOP Experience you'd understand) I watched roughly seven movies. Probably the least of the movies was Armored, even after previously watching Dead Snow.It won't end up on any "worst lists" (of mine, that is) but it wasn't great enough to crack any list I create past the top 600. It's yet another movie that wants to be sooo much more than what it really is. And that's: HEAVY FAMILY DRAMA in this HEAVY ECONOMIC TIMES involving bad guys with HEAVY ACTION SCENES.The results involve the most inept guards/bank robbers that are so incredibly stale and horribly written and are filled to the brim without thought, originality or any sort of depth. Thankfully the movie's short, yet feels 3-hours long.Tough times have weighed heavily (hmmm "There's that word again; 'heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?") on family members of the Hackett family. Yet, "Father" figure Ty won't give into advances from his scheming peer's plans of stealing a boatload of money. Okay, maybe a little bit, but, he has a heart! He can't hurt a soul and you know when you're trying to steal millions, no one ever, ever, gets hurt in the process.Anyways, he bends when presented with the idea of easy money. Unfortunately for all involved, all hell breaks loose when the "perfect crime" of creating a fake robbery debauchery goes wrong the minute the plan comes to light in the plot. Goody-two-shoes Hackett attempts to balance conscious with his "loyalty" to the brotherhood of thieves. I'm guessing when someone actually does get hurt, and then another, we're supposed to feel sorry for him and root him on.Even when Jack Bauer, a character I love, in the final hours of the 24 series, breaks unredeemable sins, it was hard for me to side with him. He's a blatant criminal. And here comes my favorite (facetious) part: the out-of-this-world, out-of-left-field finale as if they were running out of time or budget to conclude the movie. I seriously had to laugh out loud. (Spoiler, sort of.) Even O.J. Simpson, if he watched this movie in his (I'm sure, wonderfully above-average) cell, would say he was envious of the outcome.Skip this movie. It has wonderful actors, all of which, however, seemed like they were looking to take a holiday with the money (legitimately, though questionably) made from making this turd. It has boring acting, predictable plot lines, cries for help for its characters and contains an unoriginal and lazy plot with no redeemable qualities.
I'm a sucker for Disaster Flicks, like the previous volcano movie in 1997, Dante's Peak or 1996's Twister. But, when the idea doesn't come from the Syfy Channel and yet, it sure as heck feels like it did, it's kinda hard to swallow.Volcano, still, is enjoyable. Thanks to the never-stopping charisma of Tommy Lee Jones and adorable (at the time) Anne Heche. It's not great and it's not terrible. It's not plausible and certainly improbable at times. It's really in the middle and for 104 minutes, it's action packed enough to enjoy for a Disaster Flick kind of mood.Basically, devoted father and director of the city's emergency management, Mike (Jones) is trying to comprehend what he sees, but doesn't believe: a volcano under the L.A. city erupts into the city. With help from geologist Amy (Heche,) they attempt to divert lava from homes, buildings and oddly-thrown-in racial conflicts. I'm guessing they were trying hard to be the next Lethal Weapon that had a never-ending supply of "positive messages" and subliminal causes.Their plan? To get the lava to the ocean and save property and art. Oh, lives, too, but mainly real estate and possessions. Will it would? Would it work? No and no. But, then, again you're dealing with a prime Syfy movie-of-the-weekwith a budget.That said, it's fun, it's fluff, it can't possibly be taken seriously  so don't try and if you like Jones, even the slightest, you'll love him here.
Ah, yet another collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio. You would think they were father and son, by now. But, is Shutter Island one of their best? Well, since I've never seen Gangs of New York (yet,) I can't honestly say. But, I will say it was much better than The Aviator and The Departed, despite the fact I'm certain to get backlash on that comment. (For the record, I thought Aviator and Departed were good, but I enjoyed Shutter much more.) Was it great? By no means, but it was interesting and visually stimulating. So much so, I do hope for a Best Cinematography Oscar nom next year. And though predictable  the ads gave away too much, but even without the trailers, you would still know who "number 67" is  it's still a fun ride through to the end.Federal Marshall Daniels (DiCaprio) meets with fellow new-partner Aule (Ruffalo) on a boat, and what I saw as a spoof/joke against Titanic, Daniels is seasick and doesn't like boat rides. They land on "Shutter Island" to investigate the "magical" disappearance of inmate/patient/criminal Rachel, only Daniels has his own ulterior motives revealed throughout the film on accepting/requesting this particular assignment.The movie plays out as a film noir mystery, set in the 1950s. Many of the sets, locales and moods are very 1950s in both setting and film-making. It's almost as if Scorsese acted out his Tarantino-like impulses and made homage to film noir past. And, believe it, it worked.Though, again, the average moviegoer will see where there people fit into place in the "mystery," the movie didn't bog you down on the "big M. Night Shyamalan" secret. They had a serious detective story to show with believable acting, great scenery, buildings and dialogue.My only problems with the film were minute. Easily 20-30 minutes could've been cut. Sure, a lot, if not most, scenes were necessary to advance the plot, yet a good majority of them were drawn completely out to the max. Also, most of the movie did not have a score, but when it did, it was too loud and overbearing  for example: the camera follows both Daniels and Aule, amongst others, into the asylum for the first time, and the score was so incredibly deafening, it was distracting. And finally, I have not seen this many flashbacks since ALL of the Saw films (combined) or as many nightmares as the Freddy Kruger films. No doubt they were integral to the plot, but, BOY, every few seconds you had to do a double take on what reality  nightmare, memory, foreshadow  you were witnessing.That all said, I would still recommend this movie. Thankfully, Leo didn't overact (AS MUCH, that is) like he does in 90% of his movies. Most of his features, you can see him yearning to win an Oscar, much like what Denzel Washington does in the majority of his movies. He did a good job. All three other main characters, played by Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, were not only believable, but did a great job.I don't see this as a 100% repeat-viewer, but you should still see Shutter Island. At very least, take in the sights.
Stop being part of the problem. Natural Born Killers was. Now, Mike Judge is.He had one hit. One: Office Space. And admittedly, that movie was near perfection. His other outings that I've seen: Extract and this, Idiocracy have been both embarrassments and the very reason he's saying the future will be filled with idiots.This movie is so incredibly pathetic, it makes Jersey Shore look intelligent. And I'm not saying I didn't get the humor. Oh, I got it. I was five once. And even at that age, I would've turned my nose at this.The entire concept is so old  one military fool and one ugly prostitute get dumped into an experiment that inadvertently has them sleep 500 years, only to awake in a commercial-based, nation of fools  that even Futurama on its WORST day would be ashamed.Once awakened, Rita (Maya Rudolph) and Joe (Luke Wilson) are the smartest members of a degrading human race bent on killing themselves by watering plants with energy drinks vs. water.I want to stop there. Not in fear of spoiling anything further, but as I am thoroughly disgusted in even thinking of this movie any longer. I mean, I get where they were going  product placement, ads, Costco, TV, blah, blah  but this would've been best served as a 20 minute Adult Swim CARTOON, NOT a 90 minute film.You really want to know what would cause a future of morons? The continuation of series like Jersey Shore and (previously) Beavis & Butthead. Movies green lit like Natural Born Killers, the Twilight series or any Mike Judge film (outside the office.) Don't you see, people? We're our own worst enemy and thisthis atrocity has to stop. You might think it's funny, hardy har, but think of what you're actually doing to impressionable kids or the image of Americans you're further damaging to the world's perspective. Oh, and did I mention all the blatant homophobia that might have started as a running bad joke but turned into just plainhatred?Soap box aside, this was an incredibly lame attempt at humor. Not one joke hit its mark and the actors involved had to have acted even dumber to sign on than their characters on screen. SKIP AT ALL COSTS.
While it's sorta, technically a sequel, as Never Say Never Again was a James Bond movie, this movie at least took a different direction than the "original," (A) Fistful of Dollars. But, it nowhere near held my interest as Fist did. Actually the best thing about it was the Man in Black, No- Name-Clint's character's nemesis/partner. Other than that, the score was good and I do favor Clint's persona in these Westerns. Not my cup of tea, but I guess people who like Westerns, specifically Spaghetti Westerns with all that dubbing and outside scenes doubling for America's old west, might like this. (On a side note, were guns less powerful back then? They never seemed to hurt anyone's ears, nor leave any marks in either people's bodies or  laughably  clothing.)
I honestly don't think I've ever laughed less in a comedy than Extract. I mean, I seriously can not remember once that more than a smirk appeared on my face.The ads didn't help me see this in theatres, nor the Mike Judge name attached, despite he made one of my all time favorite comedies, Office Space. In addition, even though I love Jason Bateman and J.K. Simmons, they weren't a draw for me. I simply waited for video and a recommendation from a friend. On the flipside, I can't say this movie was horrible; it just wasn't at all good nor funny in the least. I almost forgave the blatant character rip-offs from Judge's other comedy, Office Space  they even had the same mannerisms and lines! But what I couldn't forgive is the wasted talent and time the main stars are throwing away.Take for example, Bateman, who had his comeback a few years back with films like Hancock and Juno, and granted with fame, comeback heroes generally will just make about anything for attention and a buck. (UhTravolta? Battlefield Earth, Michael, or just about 70% of anything past Pulp Fiction.) Next, we see the strikingly gorgeous "Meg" Kunis. She's only going to look like this for so long. Pick smarter scripts, even comedies. And definitively don't drive down MeganFox Lane. Finally, J.K.'s forgiven as he seems to be always that "number three or lower" cast member, despite the fact he's always good.A quick snip of the plot line: Phoned-In Bateman stars as Joel who built his extracting business from the root up and apparently read on people he hires. The typical worker humor scenes ensure and Joel wants to sell. A scene, I'm guessing to be funny (and even if it were hilarious, it was ruined by the trailer) has idiot coworkers causing an accident, deformation and as usual, without remorse, one of my pet peeves even when its fictional. Oh, and in addition, Joel's not getting any at home and spends more time bromancing Dean (Affleck of all people.)To confuse the plot more (stop here  seriously, slapstick comedies such as this need to keep it simple. Once you go past 3 or more subplots you lose your target audience as well as any sign of a box office. Extract's no exception.)they throw in a pool-boy-prostitute in which they don't even cover up the Desperate Housewives rip-off, a bunch of drug scenes (that Bateman did NOT take advantage of for potential comedic scenes) and a lone criminal who's trying to, well, extract as money as she can from a company run by monkeys and injured worker who mimics most primates.Will it all work out in the end? Who really cares? When it ends you'll probably spend more time shaking your head than laughing. Especially that off-wall ending. A movie this solely reminded me off, despite the stolen Office Space characters, was the 150% better Election. Watch that movie. Even after a decade, Election, with a lot of the same principals but much more smartly developed, holds up extremely well. I can imagine this one not only forgotten soon, but simply disappearing.
How's this for a movie twist? I wanted to watch We Need to Talk About Kevin, but realized I didn't have access to that movie and settled on Jeff, Who Lives at Home and the entire idea of the movie is based around talking about a "Kevin" who will lead our "hero" Jeff tosomethingmeaningful.Well, "Kevin" led me to something insightful, all right: a very nice little indie that satisfyingly served my emotions right for the night.Now, I've been a Mumblecore fan over the years. They're the little independent films mostly done by the Duplass brothers (see the Mark one on the awesome FX series: The League) and they show every bit of a "low budget." I doubt this film will fit in that category, even though it's written/directed by both Jay and Mark Duplass. Regardless, it's got their charm all around.Jeff (Jason Segel) does, in fact, live at home and smokes pot, has less than a percent of ambition and gets freaked by a landline phone call from someone looking for a "Kevin." Originally, that's incidental to his mission to head to Home Depot to buy supplies for home repair, his mother requests.Sidetracked  or was he?  stoner Jeff wanders in a quest to find the meaning of said "KEVIN" and repeatedly works with and bumps into his straight-laced brother, Pat (Ed Helms, who slightly channels his The Office character, Andy) to spy on his mid-life marriage crisis unfolding.As with a lot of indie films that don't have the budget to execute a fulfilling conclusion, I expected the worst. Sure, I would've still liked the film although I still expected the open-interpreted cop-out and low-cost finale. Mercifully, this one might have rode on the star power to get the ending we all wanted. Needed.NOI'm not attempting to spoil anything. It's just suffice to say, they don't end it like some first-time writers/directors leave the audience with the ocean-wide finale so that "people will talk" which I am finding tedious (and cliché) as of late.Now, the movie isn't perfect by any means, and like most fictional movies that were based on other fictional movies (they tell you this one's based on another movie in minute one) it's hard to live up to expectations. I'm a fan of Swordfish  which many are not  and both movies come with the opening speech concerning what movie this is based on. That's like me making my $1,000 movie and saying how much I LOVED Halloween in the opening. It's doubtful my movie will pan out as masterful.Also, while I like the message, the deliberate pacing and most of the lines, it wasn't an outright laugh-fest nor had the deepest of meanings. I think it wanted to, but failed just shy of that.Still, it's enjoyable, and I loved the third act. Yeah, even with the most obvious revelation in the middle section with momma bear, Sharon's (Susan Sarandon) character.
I only watched Raging Bull finally and for the first time a few nights ago to avoid one of the despised questions critics get asked: "You call yourself a movie critic, but you haven't seen?!" Truthfully, I didn't have much interest in ever seeing the almost-32-year-old film. I have to be dragged to sports films, like Westerns and Musicals. Although, I generally end up liking them  I loved Chicago, and had to be dragged to that one, too  it's still a chore for me to get started with them.And the nice thing about this film experience is: I knew practically nothing going in. I literally popped in the DVD and pressed play. Prior, I only knew it was directed by Martin Scorsese, starred Robert De Niro, was black & white and centered on boxing. That's it. I didn't know the length  which I love to know for what I'm getting myself into at night. I didn't know if it was a true story. I didn't know it also starred two favorites of mine: Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty. (That last one was interesting; within a period of one week, I saw two brand-new-to-me Moriarty films: this one and Neighbors. Although, it was revealed that I did see Neighbors prior, I was only seven and I only recall blurry memories and that I had seen it.)I like these movie-watching experiences, i.e. going in almost blind. It was as if I saw it for the first time opening weekend, December 19, 1980, before everyone had their opinions, praise or whatever published or spoken.At any rate, I enjoyed this piece of work. The cinematography was superb and crisp. The acting, namely De Niro and Pesci, excellent, as was the score and music. And I believe this statement must have been said countless times before: the direction (by Scorsese) was so masterful, so perfect, this film should be taught in film schools on how exactly to direct a movie.The movie follows Jake La Motta's (De Niro) boxing career from the beginning to (ha-ha) present (in 1964) and we see the absolute rise and self-destructive fall of the paranoid fighter. This time bomb and his nickname, Raging Bull is so blatant in both the ring and in his personal life.Honestly, I could've made that synopsis even shorter, but that pretty much sums it up. There really isn't much story here  it is based on true events, after all  so the movie relies and rightfully so, on the beautiful black & white, mood, acting, camera angles and suspense (for when La Motta will crack for the x time.) And none of these are bad things.Exceptwhen you get into the pacing. As mentioned, since the story is thin, there are far too many stretched out scenes that had already moved past the established "mood" in the beginning of said scene. For instance, the courtship between second-wife Vickie (Moriarty) and La Motta wasn't just enormously awkward, it seemed to stay on the screen for much too long.Also, I'm wondering if it was a budget thing, but EVERY SINGLE RING La Motta fought in, no matter the city, looked 100% the same, including the spectators, smoke and "mysterious" darkness beyond rows 5+.Eh, I know that's really incidental to the fantastic and one-of-a-kind shots taken within the ring, namely the best of all fights: the final one between La Motta and Sugar Ray. That one scene was worth the entire time of film.Although it's not a movie I will probably ever see again  as stated: this isn't my type of genre or subgenre, I would still recommend it, especially at over-30-years-strong, it holds up for both normal movie-watchers and film students.Side Note: I don't think I've ever seen Robert De Niro this young, or, hell, even this thin (for the most part of Raging Bull.) So watching him here, I could NOT help but laugh every time I saw him with his sharp and curly hair inches above his head and NOT think of John Turturro (from Rounders.) Literally, for the first half I had to remind myself: this is De Niro, not Turturro.Side Note II: Since I stated, I haven't seen De Niro younggo ahead and ask. Ask the question I hate: "You call yourself a movie critic, but you haven't seenTaxi Driver?!" Yes and yes. And yet.
I don't have an argument that Spider-Man's origin story didn't need to be remade for I've seen plenty of very decent to mediocre reboots before. But, what makes this a worthless remake was that it backtracked on all that was good before it.Heart, soul, good soundtrack, excellent score, acting, chemistry, heroism, humor and quotable dialogue were present in the original Spider-Man movies  and yeah, even #3. This movie lacked ALL of those. Heck, it even deleted one of the main characters and often hilarious: J. Johan Jameson. Shame.I was even willing to over look the obvious first hour or so that inevitably retold the same old story of pansy Parker, a love interest, the bullies, the Aunt & Uncle, the spider bite, the transformation and the first try-outs. Without anyone (and I guess me now) spoiling that, we all knew that was coming. But, what I didn't foresee was how blah it all was going to be. How boring and trite.And pleasePLEASE do not let the advertisements fool you into filling a seat for a movie you've seen before: "The Untold Story" was about as revealing as finding out about Ellen Ripley's all-but irrelevant daughter in the director's cut of Aliens.What the movie is trying to tell us is that Spider-Man is a hero, that he loves Gwen Stacy and that, despite how great the Hulk looked in The Avengers, a giant lizard man can look real on screen using 1996's technology. No apologies: I didn't buy any one of these things the script displayed. In fact, it showed so much and yet, so much felt left out. So many story lines began and either faded or we're given half-ass explanations.Don't get me wrong; I didn't full-on hate on The Amazing Spider-Man. Of the approximately 20 minutes (of 136) of screen time Spidey was on the screen, he lookeddecent, albeit the shots still looked like deleted scenes from the previous series. And even though Tobey Maguire spun webs around Andrew Garfield's Parker, he still did a good job. I will even give it to both the script and Garfield: Spider-Man's signature sarcasm was funnier this time around.Is it redundant to give the synopsis since I already reviewed the 10-year-old original? Yes, except this time around instead of a green bad guy from Oscorp being human, this one had a green bad guy from Oscorp being a laughable CGI Godzilla offspring. Oh, and as much as I love Emma Stone, her character, Gwen Stacy, first introduced in Spider-Man 3, was so lifeless, you'd have to miss Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane.I simply cannot recommend this movie. Again, of the 136 minutes, 40 were good, but that did not outweigh the bad-3-D effects or 96 other slow-paced, unoriginal and uninspiring minutes.
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (or code name: MITGOGAE  damn, even that acronym is too long) was one of those movies I wanted to like more, but still did a lot. It's an enormously interesting story with fantastic characters and it was one of those films that restored (some) of my faith in John Cusack.This movie should be noteworthy for several interesting characters, such as Cusack's John Kelso and definitely, Kevin Spacey's flamboyant Jim Williams. But, overall, the winner goes to The Lady Chablis. She was amazing. And her interactions between her and John were key to the film's success for me. Okay, not just those scenes, but certainly a huge highlight whenever I revisit this film.Another great aspect of MITGOGAE was the setting and cinematography. The John Kelso character is out of his element in this Deep South surrounding and you'd be lying if you don't get swooped up right along with him, exploring on your own the differences from your world and this one. I get just as mesmerized as he is with all that this film sets up in regards to characters, landscaping, the houses and, heck, even the town is a character.Further, the story, a film noir mystery with multiples of twists, is as exciting to us as the onion peals back as it is to John Kelso. It's a murder mystery with intrigue and intelligence. Spacey and his character Jim Williams are both flipping interesting and exciting, it's absolutely a joy to watch him from scene to scene as he's caught up in this.Basically, writer John Kelso gets a freelance 500-word assignment he thinks he was randomly assigned to, to cover the annual extravagant Jim Williams' Christmas Party. Bummed it's not that big of an article, one-time novelist John Kelso begins his reporting when a "self-defense" murder takes place. Intrigued, John expands his investigation and thinks there's more to this story and this town than meets the eye.He's right.While not perfect and has its moments of slow-down and a totally sad ending to me  see it, and you'll know why I was bummed per my words above, it's a movie that draws me back to (the location of) Savannah time and again.If you're a fan of Cusack, Spacey and colorful backdrops, this is the movie for you. Give it a chance, and you might be a fan for life."I've only been here three days and it's just a shooting, but give it time, okay. This place is fantastic. It's like Gone With the Wind on Mescalin. I know you're my agent. Listen to me, they walk imaginary pets here, Garland. On a fvcking leash. Alright? And they're all heavily armed and drunk. New York is boring!"  John Kelso.
I seriously don't know why I put off seeing The Informant! as long as I did. Soderbergh is on/near the top of my all-time best Director list (Absolutely loved the following: Erin Brockovich, Traffic, Out of Sight, Ocean's Eleven and definitely liked a lot: Ocean's Thirteen and Sex, Lies & Videotape.) Not to mention, I really like those quirky comedies and Matt Damon to boot.This movie was fantastic. Even though I have yet to see Invictus, I'm shocked Damon didn't get nominated for his role here. The feel, the look, the comedy and the suspense (believe it or not, there was a lot of suspense  mostly due to Damon) were all top notch.One of the main reasons I love Soderbergh is that he gets his vision in his head on how any project should pan out and does it no matter the cost/criticism. (Not that his movies generally get panned, but some do.) Here, he presents a movie apparently loosely "based on a true story" from the 1990s (mainly) yet the feel, lighting, sets, fonts used on the screen, makeup, costumes, facial hair and MUSIC  oh that quirky and wonderful soundtrack all seem sowell, late 60s to early 70s. I loved that aspect. So a good portion of this movie is due to Soderbergh.Another huge chunk belongs solely to Damon who's in practically every scene, mostly involving voiceovers. Not only did the voiceovers make me chuckle, they did a wonderful job of explaining them later in the feature.Mild-mannered chemist Mark Whitacre (Damon) turns, well, "Informant" to the FBI on his company when he "wants to do the right thing." Unfortunately, the agents in charge, already detected one lie (with, uh, a few more to come) from Whitacre's story, but they have enough to start a few years-long investigation into the company's price fixing.Quite frankly, I do not wish to give anything else away (as I have been accused, more than once, of.) This movie was such an incredibly original joy to watch and watch the onion skin unravel as you learn more and more about Whitacre. His company, the FBI agents, his wife all come second and are wonderfully portrayed by the actors involved, but the movie solely rests on Damon's shoulders and he pulls it off in spades.I will reveal he does lie on occasion. And I have met true life liars in my life. Good ones, bad ones, and ones having no business even trying to fib. (It helps a lot of you play poker  and not ONLINE!  and you get to see the art of deception in people.) If you watch Damon's facial expressions, his stuttering, his fidgetingthis is a perfect example of who to study if you're in FBI/CIA training. Or just interesting in playing in the WSOP.I have barely mentioned the remaining cast and surprise guests. Bakula did a great job, I liked how they included Eddie Jemison (from the Ocean's movies) but was a little puzzled, but nonetheless happy to see, Oswalt in an extremely toned down role in the FBI.As much as the movie's funny, and sad at times, Damon seriously got overlooked at the Oscars. Due to his actions/inactions, he kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. Very few performances spark this within me. So, despite the movie's marketing, I would definitely cite this as a suspense as well as comedy.Highly recommend for all audiences. If it's as true as the movie states, it's really scary on how many people might be out there like the people that work for this corporation.
If one could imagine an adult, much more serious and a helluva SLOWER version of the Jason Statham action movie, The Transporter, it'd be Drive.Critically acclaimed and further praise for one of my favorites, Ryan Gosling, were reasons for me wanting to see this. And I, too, will rave on how well made it was, shot, acted and contained some decent action sequences. Butit was so dammed slow, I could barely keep my head up to wade through 80% of the movie  the slow-paced scenes  to get to any promise of action as the plot indicated would happen.And what was with the pink opening credits?I digress. Much-too-quiet "Driver" (Gosling) aids bad guy's getaways as a night job while managing a garage-shop day job and being a part-time movie stunt driver. How is ever to find time for romance? Especially with a married mother one apartment over? Obviously, he will, but he will also get caught up in both helping them and mixing with the wrong (mob) crowd.It's a fun movie, when it's moving  hence the title, but get ready for a snail's walk to get to something exciting. Yeah, I know I shan't be critiquing the movie for what it's not. It's not a Transporter reboot. But it's also not something I ever want to see again.
Long ago when I first saw this, I kept waiting for the shark to be wearing a top hat like the old cartoon shark because, frankly, the CGI was so bad, it felt animated and less of a threat. My opinion hasn't changed and this, even for 1999, was so incredibly cliché-driven, it's kinda hard to watch, even though I love When Animals Attack films. But, stipulation: I generally like when non-genetically engineered animals attacking, with the exception of JURASSIC PARK, of course. But, I will give this movie two kudos: It contained one of the most shocking - as in surprising - death scenes that was both original and also a bit horrifyingly hilarious and LL Cool J was kinda cute during this. Cheers!
Admittedly, I fell for it. I actually had a great time during Here Comes the Boom. And all the way to the predictable sports ending.This movie screams the stereotypical "Based on/Inspired by/Is a" true sports underdog story, but I looked it up. Yes! I did research. It's not. Sorry, spoiler.But, I didn't look that up until after the movie was over. And that's too bad, because all the way through this, I was finding this very cliché, predictable and has an enormously weak premise if this happened in real life.That all said, it's still a very cliché, predictable and has an enormously weak premise and even thenI had a good time. The humor made me laugh out loud at moments, the heart was there and best of all, Kevin James ran around without a shirt on for a good sixth of the movie. Bonus!, but I understand irrelevant.Terrible teacher, Scott (James,) with a minute, though growing, amount of a heart takes on the self-imposed task of raising $48,000 to save both his peer and music teacher's job and the entire school's music department. After a series of failed money attempts, Scott meets the right folks to align him with the cash from mixed-martial art fighting. Will Scott raise enough? Will he die trying since this is MMA and he's an overweight, out-of-shape, inexperienced, late-forties dude? Will he get the girl?Seriously? I don't like spoiling major plot points, and I won't start here since you can draw your own conclusions. And yet AND YETI still had a great time. I went along for the ride and in rare form for me and my reviews, I ditched the critic side. Perhaps it was because the characters had charisma, or because the comedy did make me laugh, or the energy from the cast and their respective fictional characters had me pumped. Maybe it was the Vegas shots I wasn't expecting. I dunno. I just had fun.And that inevitable finale, with the funny homage to the movie this might be slightly imitating, had me sitting up and cheering. I even loved so much the following line by the Henry Winkler character I grew to love:"You've already done it. To hell with my job. Look up there, look at those kidsLet me tell you what you would see. You would see a bunch of our students witnessing complete resolve in the face of an unbearable obstacle. They are invested. Scott, they're inspired. That's what we're supposed to do as teachers, right? Inspire. You can quit right now and everything that we've worked will have been accomplished. You know, last night, Molie said to me on the phone that you thought I was your hero. You're mine."  Marty.I know this movie, on the surface, may appear like cheese. And it's certainly one I would normally chew up and spit outBut, on a rare occasion, they got to me and they won. I had fun and would recommend this movie.
All I knew about this film was that it was a pot smoking, 1970's-set film starring Matthew McConaughey. After finally seeing the nearly 20-year old film, I was virtually left Dazed and Confused on the only other "fact" I knew about it: this was supposed to be a comedy.This movie NEVER made me laugh. I will admit it did have me snickering a few times, namely a pregnant woman who was simultaneously smoking and being lectured on the healthy habits of calcium and another girl getting her tight jean's zipper up with pliers. Other than that, I found absolutely nothing funny about the lame story of horny and disorderly punks leaving their junior year of high school and entering summer, all in one night.Allow me to back track, I'm guessing some of this is about Juniors in High School, and some about Seniors. My suspicion was that this was SUPPOSED to be about seniors, as some of the graffiti and Junior High Abuse indicated, but the majority were being coached on their final year in High School and their football careers.So, I guess this was about all ages  Junior High to Freshmen to Juniors in High School to Seniors to Already Graduated Losers. Was that the intention of the writers?Not sure, but I am sure, I only saw this as a drama about a bunch of unruly, irresponsible adolescences who spend one night in May drinking, pot-smoking, complaining and destroying lives and property for the sole purpose ofnothing.So much so, there was a great quote two-thirds in and I love it when a character sums up the movie in the dialogue: "Fairly uneventful, huh?" Yep, that defines the movie.Heck, despite the clichés, the movie was pumping for a "raging" or "epic" party, but was shut down by one kid's mistakes, so the "graduating" kids simply drive around for the rest of the film, destroying anything or anyone in their path.Okay, fine, they do make it to one minor field party, but that was about one-one-thousandths of the "Woodstock" I'm sure it was trying to imitate.Going back to my original take on this, prior to my first (and only) viewing of Dazed and Confused, I thought Matthew McConaughey was supposed to be in this. Well, he was. Kind of. You just have to wait until half the movie was over and even then, he's such an extremely minor backdrop, he barely matters.In fact, no one really matters here. The film just follows these uninteresting teens through the course of one night of debauchery. Booooooring. If this really happened to me, and I was their age in 1976 (I had just turned two at the time), I would say the same thing then: This is boring. And apparently, I'm not alone: these characters feel the same way.Maybe, that was the point. Maybe they just wanted to show us the average night of no-nothings with no futures. Fine. If that's the point, I'll just watch You-Tube.To fans of this movie, please send me a note to explain what I am missing. I think I pretty much summed it up by saying this was about nothing. At least when Seinfeld made a career of that, he made it funny.
Bond is 1 for 5.In my "Bondathon," I am watching all the Bond films in order, leading up to the newest one. I'm on #5  You Only Live Twice, and Bond seems to be striking out all over the place.Each one, with the exception of the one great one  so far  Goldfinger, seems less memorable than the last one. It's probably because they made them in record time; some so quick, two were released in the same calendar year. And to think, more people complained when all those "Friday the 13th" films came out, practically back-to-back in the 1980s.From what I recall, and mind you, I just saw this, this cheesy film set in Japan (yes, much like the other cheesy series set in Japan. You know, the one about the giant radioactive lizard) involves Bond transforming himself into a Japanese ninja (no joke) in order to infiltrate a fake volcano and the just-now-seen-villain: #1, or Blofeld. Okay, #1: Bond looked as Japanese as I do straight. And #2, Blofeld looked as straight as I do Japanese.I digress, the movie begins with James's death and with the exception of the following 10 minutes or maybe another minute or two later, it's a quickly forgotten excuse for the title. Effeminate Blofeld, who physically tortures his white cat while petting it a thousand and one times  poor kitty!  wants to cause a war between the giants and then, I guess, profit from it. Sorry for the spoiler there. It's only a 45-year-old movie after allThe positives I came up with for this movie:  Everyone spoke English, so no subtitles!  Austin Powers will be a must to revisit once the series viewing has completed.  Bond always ends up in the water, but that doesn't mean he's washed up. Or  The Crazy 88 scene is a great inspiration to future filmmaker Quentin Tarantino.  The toy helicopter was great symbolism to prove this was, in fact, made for kids.  "Spy" Bond finally uses an alias. Way to go for finally adhering to Spying Rule #1.I won't 100% criticize this movie; it wasn't terrible, just completely forgettable. A throw-away little boy's fantasy movie  I'm guessing they made these more with little boys in mind, than any adults.I was ready to give up, but I know it has to get better in this series. And I will drudge On(to) Her Majesty's Secret Service(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the "odd one out": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)
One of the finer examples that Michael Douglas can act, and not be type-cast as the psycho-woman attractor as he did in 'Fatal Attraction' and 'Basic Instinct,' is 'Falling Down.' He did an excellent job as the person some of us actually secretly wish we could model: the indestructible anti-hero that's "Mad as hell, and not going to take it anymore!" One of the best aspects is that unlike some anti-heroes ('The Punisher') he didn't set out, nor wishes to be a vigilante. He was just a man who reached his limit awhile back and now can't hold it in anymore. He just, for lack of a better term, wants to "go home." Synopsis: Bill leaves his car in the hot sun/stopped traffic one morning and begins his journey "home" while along the way meets some interesting characters who, well, irk him and since Bill has passed his boiling point, he has nothing to lose and tells/shows them how he feels. Mostly he does it with extremely funny dialogue I loved. Meanwhile, soon-to-be retired desk-cop Prendergast is dealing with a million issues of his own (a very ill wife, a deceased daughter, retirement) and still, he's on the case of the strange white male with a white shirt, tie and baseball bat who's wrecking havoc in the LA county. It's too bad that, despite I believe strongly on the statements Bill makes (namely fast food, those awful gangsters and the grumpy old golfers) I can't really side with his methods. And besides, unfortunately, whether or not this movie was real, nothing will change. We would still always be neighbors to these jerks. This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Douglas was brilliant and for him alone and the extreme depth Douglas showed, the movie needs to be seen.
While not the worst direct-to-video, superhero cartoon I've seen, 'Superman/Batman: Public Enemies' was entertaining and fun to watch. Inventive? Original? Exciting? Hardly, but still worth a viewing. Apparently in a world where voters can elect George W. Bush 2x, I guess is the same place Lex Luthor can be the next President. He pushed for it, while, coincidentally (or not, hmmm) a giant Kryptonite meteor, the size of Rochester, NY, is headed towards Earth. He all but outlaws superheroes and when, surprisingly, Superman and Batman do not comply, Lex sets his evil plan in motion and sets Superman up as a, gasp, murderer. Thankfully, it's only 75 minutes, but there is barely any depth to any of the characters or any really interesting plot lines. It seems like an excuse to get a whole bunch of the DC heroes together, a la 'Destroy All Monsters.' Minus Wonder Woman or Flash; I sure did miss them. The action was good, the bond/banter between Supe and the Bat was nice to watch, as I always seem to see them fight like children and the animation was decent  finally Superman with muscles. But, it all seemed rushed and with very little story or depth to the actions. Still worth a watch, especially for fans.
FINALLY. What seems like 30 movies I've seen with Keanu, he's impressed me.John Wick is anything but original and yetit's thoroughly entertaining and just my type of bad guy/revenge flick. Not since 1999's Payback have I been this pleased. It's one of those movies I just finished and want to see all over again.Through and through, 90% of this has been done before, but since Keanu finally stood up and acted and since it takes no prisoners with its brutality and shameless acts of gun violence, it's one for the books. John Wick's the stereotypical badass retiree who's pulled back in on a whim and hell, everyone better watch their back. Reminding me a lot of both Payback and Eastern Promises, not to mention every single "One- last-job-before-or-after-retirement" plot, John Wick seems to separate itself with a Keanu you finally root for.Literally, there's not much to say but to enjoy the enormously action packed ride of John, his past, his presence and how many bullets it takes to provide vengeance. It's a pity this didn't make more at the box-office. I could see this on repeat and not get bored.* * *Final thoughts: Make your life complete with a double-punch/double- feature of this and Payback. (NOT the director's sh|t take of Payback. Just the original theatrical release.) Both are similar and will be having you root for the bad guy.
Damn. Damn damn. 'Christmas with the Kranks' is absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever, EVER seen. The book's title is 'Skipping Christmas' and I can see why they changed it: so no one had the bright idea of skipping this movie. In fact, the best line was one of the last ones spoken: "Skipping Christmaswhat a stupid idea." Yes. Yes, it was. The movie started bad, got progressively worse, and I stayed watching to see how much further down into hell they'd venture. I will say this that separates this from the rest: it has the absolute worst concept for a film. Mr. & Mrs. Krank want to skip Christmas to save money even though they claim it's not about money. They spend half the film denying the annoying neighbors the pleasure of butting into their business of why they won't spend 5 minutes putting up a Christmas light and the other half selling out in order to lie to their daughter. This movie is an absolute mess, has horrible morals, utterly unfunny and a train wreck with brilliant comedic stars that should know better. SKIP SKIPPING Christmas!!!
Boy, I'm going to get bashed for this one  I hope, at least; keep your comments coming!  but 2010's Predators was actually better than the original.That's said with reservations. Schwarzenegger was what made the original stand out, well, that and the origin of a great movie-character, the Predator. No one here really stood out, aside from Adrien Brody, whom I normally despise. Also, it was rather long, predictable  you really did know who was going to die and in what order, horribly paced and in need of some true editing. And the finale's revolution of a "bad guy" was both laughable and utterly unnecessary.That all said, I'm not a true fan of the original. I liked it enough for a throw-back to the old 1980's action genre, especially starring Schwarzenegger, but it wasn't near the top of any of my lists. So, it's not much for me to say I liked this slightly-above-average actioner was better.As mentioned, Adrien Brody did stand up and made me finally care about him or his character. The rest of the cast were the typical cardboard cut-outs aside from Topher Grace. I would admit he was funny at times, but he was just his typical character and couldn't have possibly known a few things as the "doctor" he claimed he was since he was dealing with alien life-forms. Namely plants.Several humans are literally dropped into a live-action Avatar jungle/planet and ban together as if they've just finished watching TV's Lost or woke up in a Saw (II) nightmare. After the confusion of their roles and why they're there, they discover they're being hunted by both demon dogs and, huh, the Predators. It's survival of the fittest without so much of a real explanation of their being there other than for someone's amusement.Along the way, they meet CSI's Laurence Fishburne who gives a little more details, but for the most part, it's just a journey to get off the planet where apparently many others have failed.They say this is Predator 1.5, asking you to (rightfully) forget part 2 or any of the Alien Vs. Predator movies, much like Halloween: H20 wanted you to nix Halloween III-VI, or Superman Returns was to replace Superman III-IV. I didn't catch that here. Sure, they mention the events in 1987 (or Predator #1) but part 2 or the Alien crossovers could've very well happened.At any rate, take their advice. The only ones that should, in fact, exist are: Predator and Predators.The movie's certainly not great, but for them to take the simplicity of part one, and expand on many ideas and backgrounds, it's worth a viewing.
Let's put aside the fact that the found-footage genre is rapidly becoming a poor excuse for real filmmaking and a sad gimmick. Let's erase the fact that NONE of this would ever happen. EVER. And let's ignore the obscene extension of a clichéd 5-minute You-Tube video stretched for 88-over-long minutes that literally felt like twice that long.The single worst aspect of Project X was how incredibly irresponsible it was. Sure enough, younglings will flock to see this, adore it and glamorize it to the point of attempting to recreate the horrible actions of the horrible individuals in this film. Since this movie or the creators have no soul or accountability to children, I can miserably see the next found footage "documentary" would be on how to make a bomb to bring to High School when no guns are accessible.Speaking of indignity: shame on you Harkins Theatres! My 4:40 Sunday afternoon, half-packed showing was overrun guardian'less groups of preteens and obviously-under-17 crowds. Sadly, they seemed to really love, LOVE this movie, cheering and laughing at all the most inappropriate times, i.e. when these senseless, inconsiderate, thoughtless, brainless and evil characters destroyed property, hurt the innocent and worst of all, felt zero remorse about their actions/crimes. Eh, who am I fooling? Harkins employs the same mindset teens to run the front of the movie house, so of course, they'll let young punks into this Project X.Speaking of my unfortunate movie-going experience, these two adolescent girls behind me laughed and laughed throughout, but oddly, not in the finale. That's when I cracked up. Yes, I did laugh once. You see, the main nerd, Thomas (whom I heard was "Sooo cute" by the preteens behind merepeatedly) wants to be accepted by his high school peers, or at least the devil on his shoulder (Oliver) tells him that's what he wants. In the climax, he's being high-fived and cheered on by his "new" buddies when he walks down the school hall. I laughed in utter disbelief because of how incredibly sad I was that all of these losers actually lived through the party and how, if this were true, I will end up having to pay for their inevitable many trips to prison later in life.I digress. The movie's opening is a set-up to a birthday party for a 17-year-old (Thomas) whose parents strictly warn him not to have a big party when they're out of town for the weekend. Well, flip-flopping Thomas is controlled by the most evil of all the children, his "buddy" Oliver, a boy whose self-esteem should be questioned each time he makes homophobic comments (Oh, did you know if you don't drink alcohol, you're considered a "faggot"?), racist remarks and insults against their third musketeer, the heavier-set JB.During that small, yet, drawn-out opening of "Hey, Party at Thomas!" we have yet another unbelievable series of explanations in yet another incoherent found-footage movie to why one rarely seen psychopath carries a camera one-quarter his body size. Apparently, no one notices this camera in the classroom, in the boy's restroom or even worse, in the boy's locker room. That last one had me really puzzled to why no one seemed to mind being filmed while they changed or came back from the showers. If you didn't see this massive camera on one guy's shoulders while the other males are changing, you're either flipping blind, an exhibitionist or, as usual, the filmmakers can't always explain the flawed found-footage dilemma during 80% of the film.I digress, again. All but the final 3 minutes takes place at the most incomprehensible and out of reach party of any generation. You will see the obligatory midget stuffed into an oven that literally could kill him. You'll see animal abuse that makes the tying of the dog in National Lampoon's Vacation seem tame. You'll see "High School Girls," whose ages range between 25-30, that could model the bathing suits off Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Issue's females. You'll see freshmen banned from the "festivities" while two 9-year-old Damien's work as security guards. You'll see policemen that get outwitted by a punk whose only legal expertise is from Judge Judy. You'll see two hot fight impractically over a guy who makes Jay Baruchel look gorgeous. You'll see five hundred perfectly placed and always water-proofed camera angles from the delinquents as if they're hands were always free to film with their phone cameras instead of holding onto the alcoholic beverages they shouldn't be having anyways for another few years. You'll see how both the movie's audience and the characters think it's funny to burn down a house with a baby in it. (Literally, my theatre's group of asses thought it would be funny to burn down a house with a baby in it. SIGH. If this is Earth's future, bring it, Mayans!) And you'll see how easy it is, when splicing the "found-footage" together, to obtain police and news videos.What you won't see is any realism, or any resemblance to the real world; even MTV's The Real World is more genuine. You won't see more than one neighbor call the police  instead, they're busy calling the nerd's Dad and "over-exaggerating" on the party's extend. You won't see any adult with a double-digit IQ, but not in the fun/funny John Hughes way. You won't see a plot. You won't find an original idea or thought. You won't see a single female that would even come close to what a High School girl really looks like. You won't find anything intentionally funny. And you certainly won't find a single character with an ounce of morality.And while this movie makes Jersey Shore ethical, Twilight's Bella a good role-model and Charlie Sheen appear sane, the only thing honest in this movie was the fake apology given by Warner Bros in the opening. Don't see this movie. Don't pay them into a PX2.
Strange. I'm not a Navy, or Naval, fan boy. Yet, a few movies I've seen, including Crimson Tide, U-571 and, of course this one, The Hunt For Red October, happen to be extremely entertaining movies that I find I must watch at least once again every few years. In the case for what I thought was the granddaddy of all Submarine movies, The Hunt For Red October, it's been many years. Like 15.I saw The Hunt For Red October when it first came out, and a couple of years following. To this day, Baldwin remains my favorite of all the "Jack Ryan"s. And I loved Sean Connery and the grandness of the movie. But for some reason, this viewing, many years later in 2009, just didn't hold up to memory.Sure, it's a great film. Connery and Baldwin, and the rest of the cast are at their best. The dialogue, cinematography and the intrigue is still wonderful. But it's the mission that drives me batty.We have CIA analyst Ryan (Baldwin) who's absolutely convinced, and just on a hunch, that submarine Captain Extraordinaire, Ramius is attempting to defect via the "Red October" he "stole." The whole Russian naval fleet is after him and the Americans are getting involved. Ryan will stop at nothing to prove he's right, not for ego, but to save Ramius and more lives.There. I pretty much summed up the entire movie in 62 words. Honestly, it's more complex than that, and I would highly, make that strongly, recommend this movie to all. If there is just one Clancy/Jack Ryan movie you see, you must absolutely see this one. Though Clear & Present Danger is also very good, this is the top notch one.Some of the best qualities: the acting, score, dialogue, cinematography, suspense, realism, Connery's always one step ahead of the game and Baldwin shows true range. On a personal note, instead of pesky subtitles, they simply transfer from Russian to English in a quick zoom-in. I loved that.Some of the bad: the graphics were not top notch, and even on Bluray; it's funny looking to watch some of the torpedoes. You're supposed to side with Ramius, however (no spoiler since it happens in the first 15, of many, minutes) he down-right murders (in cold blood) a man who "might" and I stress "MIGHT" disagree with him. Since that happens right away, it's hard to really warm up to this lost soul who you're supposed to root for. Also, Ramius's secret agenda seems really elaborate until the end. So, yeah, they redeemed themselves in the closing, but it was like someone wanting to prove a roller coaster was defective so you get twenty people aboard and hope for the best. There are better ways to "defect" or prove as point.That all said, again, I would recommend it. Director McTiernan is known for more "action" movies, I.E. Die Hard and Predator. This one is hardly any action at all  you'd see more battles in a Lifetime movie. But, for good intrigue, great performances and some real good cinematography, you should see this movie.
I guess the secret(s) are out. When IMDb reports major film spoilers just in the credits, it's safe to say: few surprises are left with Star Trek Into Darkness.But, that doesn't mean I have to (or will) spoil anything. The fun for me was finding out the few surprises along the way, enjoying some new twists and reminiscing about the Star Trek film franchise's past. Sort of past, that is.The movie looked gorgeous and mercifully, Abrams scaled back tenfold on the lens flares. I'll pause for a minute. I never actually noticed them until I heard a few (dozen) complaints about the overuse of them in the 2009 film. Recently, while getting hyped for this, I revisited that film and I can see now with open eyes. Or sore eyes; there had to be 300 of them! Here, in 2013, he's learned his lesson. For the most part, anyways.Aside from the great cinematography and special effects that went hand-in-hand, the score was rich, though not as great as the 2009 tracks. But, in contrast, the actors really became their roles and were much more fleshed out, with the exception of Uhura, than the previous installment.Unfortunately, the problems I had, though few, were big enough for me not to escape. The plot staggered and never felt completed. The movie seemed to be all over the place at points and left enough black hole sized wrongs that I could not ignore. To state them would be the spoiler I advised I would not share. Also, the pacing was far off at points and the movie certainly went on much longer than it should have. And finally, the villain was just incrediblyblah. I will simply not compare this villain to the one everyone whose seen this knows who I'm referring to, but that other villain was ten times the character that Benedict Cumberbatch played here.Despite the step downs from the "original" 2009 near-masterpiece, the movie is a lot of fun and absolutely funny, thanks to Bones and Scotty. The movie also has a huge amount of heart at points, especially one scene towards the (overly long) finale that I couldn't help but choke up at.Jim Kirk has since settled in his role as the Enterprise captain and is trying his best to make sure everyone knows he doesn't follow the rules  any rule, that is, when a new threat emerges in the form of one strong male. Apparently, this one villain can take on the entire Star Fleet without any assistance. But, luckily, we have plenty of disposable and expendable officers to attempt to match this one bad guy.Along the way, we get more depth of the bromance between Kirk and Spock and that's a lot of fun. We get some absolute laugh-out-loud moments, terrific battles, a whole lot of people running all over the place and an unwelcomed/overused cameo.So, as you can tell, from every couple of positives I find, more equally puzzling and negative opinions. That said, it did range above the 5-star dead even average to 6 stars out of 10.I think it's going to be a must-see on BluRay. And repeatedly, until the (hopefully more fleshed out) Part III hits theatres.
Dead Snow appears on the surface as a zombie movie. Actually, when watched, it appears as a whole lot of ideas rolled into an hour and a half. It's a whole lot of: Scary Movie, Cabin Fever, Night of the Living Dead, Pirates of the Caribbean, Donkey Punch and Evil Dead. But zombie movie? Well, sort of.Sure the movie involves vacationing college kids in a remote cabin  sooo original  when all of a sudden a creepy old man tells the tale of evil Nazi baddies who died previously on this very hill and seek revenge for gold, etc. (That's one of the many subplots explored and then dismissed.) They come from under the ground and are eventually sliced and diced and killed in the very fashion most movie-zombies are slaughtered. And yet they get hurt and/or return to kill some more in multiple sadistic ways, unlike most movie-zombies are portrayed.For fans of the previously mentioned genre and films, you might enjoy this little, independent film. If you're immune to the gore, and believe me  there's a lot of it, and like a little (and I mean, a little) movie reference humor, then this movie might be set for you. It's a tad bit choppy, poorly edited  scenes kind of begin and end with no rhyme or reason and it's not so much fun following the subtitles along with the action. Furthermore, you never attach onto any of the characters  cardboard galore. And finally, it just wants to be too many movies rolled into one forgetting to make its own mark.See it just for fun. Watch the movies it mimics for true entertainment.
1. At least we don't have to worry about any of the Congressmen following the 12-hours of The Purge.2. I wonder if The Purge was all prompted by all the Stand Your Ground acquittals to come? 3. So, security is super tight, but not electricity? 4. Be wary of your neighbors: they might be jealous of the fortune that they willingly gave you.5. And after realizing who your neighbors really are, good luck selling that zillion-dollar, built for a family of four, 36,000 square-foot palace in this market.6. America is the only country that does this, and yet no one thinks to leave the country for the days, or hell, hours, surrounding The Purge?7. A security system that's "not built for worst-case scenarios" probably shouldn't state that in the brochure.8. For 12-hours, people have the right to kill, maim, dismember, steal, destroy, slaughter, rape and yetthey gleefully adhere to a curfew? 9. Kids are so innocent. They feel bad for procrastinators who, for 364 days, didn't think of a place to hide for a mere 12 hours.10. Today: People buy flowers to honor the dead. Tomorrow: People buy flowers to promote death.11. Worried that your peaceful speech won't go as planned to the father of your underaged love interest? Why not get his immediate attention by shooting at him to break the ice? 12. "Due to the success of the first film, a sequel is in development by Universal and Blumhouse" says the IMDb Trivia. Well, if Twilight did it, why not, America? 13. Pervert children with mechanical half-eaten baby doll cams know the best places to hide. Well, duh.14. Crime does pay in the future: it gets unemployment down to 1%.15. Miraculously, though somehow not implausibly, in less than ten years everyone agrees politically, despite having "their own opinions" and votes in ONE governing power. Thanks, Fox News.16. Of course, a Plan B never occurs to the top security salesman who doesn't even fully believe in his own product.17. Mercifully, this movie's family has a brilliant son who knows when someone is speaking into a muted camera when that person's mouthmoves.18. During The Purge, you can, literally, get away with murder and, yet, some people still like to wear masks. Oh, and play on tree swings. All for dramatic effect, I suppose.19. Never thank a family that saved your life. Simply stand, be quiet and at the most opportune time, hide by use of a half-melted, red-eyed devil baby on wheels.20. The greatest advancement of technology in the next decade isn't cars, tablets, security or weapons. It's glowing sunglasses.21. Also, speaking of the future, "equipment" to break into people's secured houses is so highly developed, they have a name for it that we already use today: a truck.22. And I don't think Burning Down the House by the Talking Heads is ever played in the future because, well, why not give your victims some of your precious, few hours bypassing the easiest way in and waiting for said truck? 23. When barely anything has happened yet, multiple facial close-ups with people who look like they're sucking on golf balls has to be a universal sign of fright, apparently.24. Does homeowner's insurance apply to The Purge hours? 25. I'm not sure wasting 12 of the 8,760 yearly hours, doing whatever the hell you want to do, on one house and for one victim, is the best use of your time.26. "Hide in the basement!" says Dad to his son. Waitthere's a place to hide? 27. A huge arsenal of weapons should be clearly ignored  for the rest of the movie  when multiples of people are bent on killing your family and it's much easier to carry just a handgun. You know, just as a "precaution." 28. While it's grand that Hollywood broke from yet another tired "Ghost-Story-Paranormal-House-Found-Footage-Supposedly-True-Film" clichéd movie, I would've been happier if they had actually hired a writer with an original thought. And speaking of which 29. Why don't these people have a PANIC ROOM available for when THE STRANGERS who attempt to play FUNNY (and HUNGER) GAMES while COLLECTing the victims after entering their beautiful TOY STORY home with CLOCKWORK ORANGE appeal and show that they're THE DEVIL'S REJECTS?
No offense to Seth Rogen, Johan Hill, Paul Rudd, Will Farrell, et al, but what a refreshing sight it was to see a buddy/bromance movie without them starring in it. The guys, especially Galifianakis, in The Hangover all could hold their own and crack me up. Each had their own depth, each was interesting, though somewhat clichéd, and each I rooted for, despite their downfalls. What could've been the same ole, same ole bachelor party in Vegas movie turned out surprisingly original, funny, and at times, a suspenseful mystery. Three guy friends (and a future brother-in-law) head off to Vegas for the said bachelor romp two days prior to the groom, Doug's wedding. After a night they did forget, and loosing Doug, they must put the pieces together to find him and return him to LA and his bride. Along the way, they, of course, encounter the kooky characters you would expect from this type of comedy, as well as, a rooster, a tiger and Tyson, oh my. Being over-hyped prior to its release had me worried, as did the Tyson cameo, but both the movie and the former boxer delivered, tenfold. Even the movie, itself, was well shot. Vegas is shown as it really is: consistent construction  though they were as updated as they could be, still some unfinished projects in the film, such as Westgate at Planet Hollywood, have already been completed. Still, it was the most realistic footage of Vegas I've seen. Sure, it had some stock shots, but mostly it was real. All the men were hilarious, and it was nice they were given depth. But the bearded third wheel, Alan, really stood out with trueness and sympathy. Instantly one of my all-time favorite Vegas movies and I could see this becoming a future cult classic.
OK, I haven't seen the original 'Pelham' first, something I make a goal to do prior to seeing a remake, however in this case, it gives me a complete open mind to view the 2009 update. Although I have nothing incredibly bad to say about 'The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3,' I really don't have too much positive either. It's about dead-even on positives/negatives. At times, there was some pretty good tension and somewhat good interactions over the radio between the two leads. Probably the best positive, was Washington's down-acting. At least for once, I didn't think he was trying for another Oscar as I have seen in 90% of his movies (see: 'American Gangster,') so that was pleasant to see him actually act human. Travolta, on the other hand, was only so-so  I've seen so much better from him and from hostage takers in movies. Also, watching the movie, at times, was like watching a speeding subway, though the title car barely moves. Sure, it's director Scott's fashion to SPEED up, SLOW down, up, down, all over the place. If you like that, strap in and enjoy this ride, but for me, it's gets tedious after awhile. Finally, the ending is kinda anticlimactic; though it appears they tried their best to excite us. I felt it was extremely convenient and when Travolta's motives are made clear, they seem like at the last possible minute completely irrelevant. Demoted dispatcher Garber happens upon the call from hostage taker Ryder and the games begin for the next hour. Will the passengers on said title survive? Will anyone care? (FYI, these extras on the car are basically flies on the wall, we get virtually no information other and 4 of the 19.) Final note: Ironically, the title mirrors the plot's direction.
Had the 2004's unrightfully Best Picture stealer Crash been anywhere near as great as 2013's Disconnect, I might have had a harder time hating on any movie taking down the deserved Best Picture, Brokeback Mountain.After all, they're very similar films; both involve multiples of intersecting story lines, characters and an overwhelming amount of sadness  even in so-called "happiness."In Disconnect, we have a few families and humans that are inadvertently interconnected, mostly following a pair of high school buds that are purely evil in their boredom and teasing of a loner in their school.Whelp, obvious tragedy occurs with that poor boy that was seduced, deceived and bullied by his peers. Will there finally be a film in recent times about remorse, redemption or repercussions? 2012's Project X certainly wasn't one of those movies  it glorified hurting others and getting away with it.Yes, this is the movie I've been waiting for. When stupid, punk kids do incredibly bad things and actually open their eyes to what they've done.I saw this movie a while back and I'm still thinking of it today, September 2, 2013. While it was hard to see kids that bully and hurt one another, it was extremely refreshing to see consequences and real-life scenarios to said actions. Again, this is why I hated so much on Project X. That taught kids anything is possible and no repercussions could ever come of such bad actions. This one is real life.I hope more see this than the abysmal Project X. Or, if you prefer that movie over this one, please let me know where to be when I can get a front row seat to see you fall and CRASH hard. I might even applaud in your demise.Ha-ha. Might?
And to think: as lackluster, boring and trite the year 2010 for movies has turned out, I was really looking forward to Tron: Legacy. Even without seeing the original. Ever.Maybe it was because one of my all-time favorite arcade games was, and still is, Tron. Perhaps it was the wonderful trailers? Or the fact, I love Jeff Bridges and give "The Dude" kudos for making a well-made decision on making a movie/sequel.So, naturally, I have to see the first one first before venturing into the winter of 2010's only promising release. After growing up on the game, the theme music and the anticipation of the (almost) 20 year-follow-up I must say: what a letdown.I don't want to take away from what the original writers/director created here. Surely, they had something going for them in 1982: an original idea, a complex action film with futuristic graphics  for its time. Does it hold up? Apparently not, in my opinion, since I had the privilege of watching for the first time in 2010.I'm not knocking the graphics. I simply can't  that was the technology back then. And they even showed things (like the touch screens) that had years left to be developed. So good for them. But, my problem was that there was just too much. They wanted to be too many movies wrapped into one without focusing on the center of the plot. Or any heart. You wanted to care for some of the characters, but they were so thrust onto the screen with little to no background and then yanked away to make room for more "plot developments." And speaking of which, there were so many plots and subplots, it was hard to keep up where this movie was going.Recently, I watched Disney's other big live-action "blockbuster" relatively in the same era, The Black Hole and as much as I rated only 3/5 stars, at least that had a central idea and went with it. Tron is all over the place and requires several viewings to get it all straight.Let's see, it's been about a week since I've seen Tron and I'm going to try to remember all that it was about, or all the subplots: Oust developer Kevin Flynn (Bridges) is recruited to thwart a supercomputer (i.e. Hal from 2001) master program who is gaining a bunch of power from mini-programs to be the ultimate dominator. Years later, this would be portrayed in The Lawnmower Man, Terminator: Salvation or The Matrix.Meanwhile, there's the corporate bigwig who wants the same thing, a rouge ex-girlfriend bent on stopping the madness and Flynn who's inadvertently thrown into the "game" or "program" to prove himself against the computer's main competitive baddie.This is how forgettable this movie is, aside from those who first viewed it in 1982. It has only been a week and I've already forgotten the dozen or so subplots and reasons for the movie. I guess suffice to say, it's a "heart-whelming" story of the dangers of technology and despite the limitations of 1982 graphics, it will be really fleshed out in decades to follow with much better products. A good idea at the time, but just have patience, audience and you'll have a much better movie to watch. And to follow.Will I still see the sequel? Of course. I'm still looking forward to it and hopefully will watch the progression and ironing out the problems with the original. Also, I give a plus to Disney for not following the recent trend of "rebooting" and sticking with the time-honored tradition of simply releasing a SEQUEL.
Kung Fu Panda 2 is an "awesome" delight.They managed, somehow, to match the quality, action, humor, cinematography, heart and story of the original. And they kept it short, sweet and to the pointquite a feat.And I actually waited to video to see this thinking it would be just okay or overkill like most cartoon sequels. I was wrong.I loved this movie and if there is no Part III, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the series to this point.It's a must see, if you haven't already. 4½/5 stars.(Luckily, there will be a III, but sadly, not for another few years.)
A friend of mine at work had to actually entice me to see Red. And I'm sorry I needed such persuasion to see it, finally.I mean, I love Bruce Willis in an smart action role (SEE: Die Hard or Live Free or Die Hard,) I love Morgan Freeman in anything, even bad films and most of all, I love Helen Mirrenespecially when she holds a gun a third of her weight without a blink.So why did it take me this long? No excuse. I just had so many other movies to see. Now, you shouldn't have an excuse, because Red was just simple "leave your brain at the door" fun.You can't take a movie like this seriously. It's close to the aspect of 2010's The A-Team, whereas you'll try and rekindle the past while knowing: nothing you see is possible. And that's part of the fun.Ex-CIA agent Frank (Bruce Willis) is wooing a call-center gal, Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) when he's targeted for assassinationbut wait! This is the Bruce Willis you know and love! (If you don't: press stop now. In fact, why the hell did you rent this anyways, if you're not a "die hard" Willis fan?) He won't let anyone take him down, not even his love (lust) interest, Sarah.So, he rescues her while hired assassin, William (Karl Urban) begins his quest for annihilation of Frank and his soon-to-be crew of retirees: Marvin (a wonderful John Malkovich,) Joe (Morgan Freeman) and Victoria (Helen Mirren.) Not to mention the -gasp- Russian spy Ivan (Brian Cox.)Pretty much the rest of the movie pans out as they're trying to survive  with little help, oh! I love super-human characters in fictional stories  while solving the puzzle of who's trying to kill them and not allowing them to stay retired. And alive.Here's the deal. Yeah, it's unrealistic, I get that. It's a movie produced by the DC Comics crowd, for goodness sakes. But, the weak spot is Mary-Louise Parker's Sarah and her barely unflinching willingness to go along for the ride. She all but almost dismantled the crew or my desire to further watch.Skip over her. I beg you. This is an extremely fun, no-brainer film with actual shocks, twists and even a sadness when one character dies. I highly recommend it, but make sure you leave that deep-thought cap off when you press play. Again, that is, once you realize you are, in fact, a closeted Willis fan.
Georgie Lucas stated, and I am doing this from memory, that he does things his way and ignores criticisms or outside influences. I doubt this is true, because he must've learned at least one lesson from the backlash after Episode I during the making of his Star Wars: Episode II  Attack of the Clones: 98% less Jar Jar Binks.Sadly, Jar Jar does make an appearance and even has a line or two, but he's extremely more tolerable this time around, as was the movie.Now, we haven't gotten to the quality and heart of the original Star Wars trilogy in this Episode (#2,) but we have improved from the last (or first) installment.Basically, little Annie Skywalker has grown a bit in both his Jedi abilities and under the belt for his "angel," Padmé, but beyond their horribly written and acted "love" story, comes the building of two sides of war.If you know the story  and you should by now, it's past the time for spoilers here, it's actually a crafty story of one man controlling both sides of the war. I absolutely admired that, plus the villain who controls both as puppeteer.Sadly, there is so much that gets in the way of this being a great or even mediocre film. The purposely terrible acting and laughable dialogue by our leads does remind us that this is Georgie's world. Every time I wanted to love this or take more interest in, Georgie does all he can to bring it back to his under-toddler mind.It also didn't help that this is not only a bridge story, but all three prequels could've easily fit into one movie. Unfortunately, as the title suggests, there's got to be an I, II and III.I actually didn't hate this movie or the experience as much as I did with The Phantom Menace. There is enough good in here to praise, such as C-3PO's endless amount of comic relief, some decent special effects, fun action sequences and best of all: Yoda in action. That scene ALONE is worth the entire movie viewing.While I made a silent vow not to see this again, I would recommend for first time viewers to begin with I and drudge through until you get to the goods, or in this case: IV-VI.* * * Final thoughts: Growing up, my two favorite Star Wars characters were C-3PO and Yoda. I might take back my promise and re-watch this sometime in the future if I have another Star Wars marathon in mind. Again, despite the constant interferences of potential greatness by Georgie, there's enough to see here for a ton of fun.
2014's Neighbors, a comedy not to be confused with the dark comedy from 1981 with the same name and similar looking male leads, was, indeed, part-Project X, but 80x better. Unfortunately, with the crapfest Project X was, that usually isn't saying much.But, since I'm only comparing the two films due to the raving frat house party, I'll drop Project Xas should the studio have done before that movie was made.Neighbors was one of those movies that wasn't just absolutely hilarious, but deserves, no  needs, at least two to three viewings to get it all in. While I got most of what I needed, there were more parts I would've surely paused during a home viewing to let it sink in. Also, I was laughing too loud to get all I needed from the comedy, writing and dozens of cameos.Currently, I am rating movie 3½/5 stars, but I do believe it may increase in stars and liking with at least the second or third viewing. My two biggest problems involved the script and editing. The script that seemed to need at least another run-through and I'm not referring to the jokes. 85%-90% of those worked. But, the slight base of the story was shoddy at times. As was the editing where scenes seemed to abruptly end and without rhyme, reason or even a second, they began a completely different direction as if a ton was cut out that would've explained a bunch.Basically, it's a simple, but enjoyable story of a fraternity house that moves in next to an "old couple's" house and with their newborn, they like things quiet. At the same time, they miss their youth  both of the "old couple."Nevertheless, they do all they can to sabotage the title characters right out of the neighborhood.Funny. I should relate to this movie more that the target audience it was aimed at. I am about the same age of that "old couple" and the reason I keep using quotes should be obvious. I don't find them old, per se, but that's the idea of the movie. We have "old" (30s-40s) verses the "young" (teens to early 20s.)I can relate because the bulk of my work peers/friends, the ones I see the most during the week, are all in their mid-twenties and though I am not seen as an outcast  at least, I don't think I am  I'm still more than a decade older than all of them. Hell, I'm even eight years and 1 month older than Seth Rogen  the target "old" guy in this movie.There is a point here: should people attempt to live their lives in the present or regret and try to hold onto the past? Our heroes, or the "old folks," have to make that realization here.Besides the somewhat message, the movie is an absolute riot and I would think is geared more towards young male's humor (Seth, you still got it) I believe women would love it to. If not just for the strong and fun character of Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne,) Seth's wife in the film, I'm sure they'd also love the endless shots of shirtless and buff Zac Efron.Personally, and shamelessly, I went to this movie to see the endless (and somewhat more) shots of a shirtless Seth Rogen. I'm glad, at least, they gave everyone what they were looking for: shirtless hunks, shirtless bears and potty humor for those who like neither of the above.Enjoy and cheers!* * *Final thoughts: I cannot spoil a lot of the cameos or references from this movie  they were all fantastic, but I will say my favorites were from the 1970s beer pong party as I love their TV show. That's all I'm saying about that.As for the references, my favorite was from the TV show I am currently finishing off today. Over the past two-weeks, I've first-time, binge- watched the entire series and it was extremely topical, for me at least, to reference this TV show at the very tale end of this movie. Again, no spoilers, but when you see it, know that I only had four episodes left  which, again, I will finish off today and I thought that was hilarious and cute.
Strange. Two CIA/Military films nominated for the 2012 Best Picture Oscars are from the past. Albeit, Zero Dark Thirty's past is a tad bit  20-30 years  sooner, both that and Argo recount U.S.A.'s "barely achievable" Middle-Eastern's undercover missions of glory.Here, in Argo, after a series of unforgivable and bad decisions, a sextet of Americans are hiding out in the Canadian Embassy's home in 1980 Iran while their peers are captured and tortured. Argo shows a man's plight to bring them  JUST THE SIX, mind you  home via a fake movie.The scheme, CIA operative Tony Mendez, constructs seems so implausible, so expensive and so elaborate, that it couldn't possibly work and without surprise, of course it would. Or they wouldn't have made this movie.Mendez convinces his government peers to fund a lie of a Sci-Fi movie  that strongly reminded me of the awful film, Gentlemen Broncos, to get himself into war-torn Iran to rescue those mostly defiant six U.S. Embassy over-stayed Canadian "houseguests" and morons. Given what I saw recently in Zero Dark Thirty, too bad the technology wasn't with us back then to avoid just a grand concoction just to free these completely uninteresting, selfish and endlessly whining folkand never mind the other countless hostages not living under a great roof, not being well-fed and well stacked with cigarettes.Now, this all said, I didn't dislike the film that much. I did care for the extreme details Director Affleck paid attention to. And when you already know how this is going to play out, even without knowing the background  like I didn't, it was rather suspenseful towards the end. It was definitely "On-the-edge-of-your-seat" finale.One thing though: I lived through 1980, and of course, since I'm writing this today, the rest of the 1980s. I hated the style back then. Yuck. Even as realistic as they make these 1980s period piece films, it's so hard for me to like them. Even when I experienced these years, I couldn't wait to get out of that decade.Neither here, nor there. The movie is a good watch, although it didn't deserve the Best Golden Globe Picture award. But, hopefully will be enjoyed by some while not being praised as "the Best Picture" of the year.
What an achievement 'Cloverfield' was. From no-name actors, to no-name title, to one of the most influential advertising campaigns to the movie it mimicked: 'Blair Witch Project.' It also ranks as one of the shortest movies I've ever seen (actual screen time: 73 minutes) yet it seems 3x that. And this includes a 19 minute introduction that seems like 4x that. So, in total, you get a real 54 minutes of movie you wanted: Monster attacking NYC. Unfortunately, it's short on depth for characters, even with that lovey-dovey 19 minute prelude with yuppies we are supposed to care about, but don't. If anything, we care more about the fabulous view from their apartment(s) than their shallow lives. After the initial 19 shaky-camera minutes trying to find out who's who and why, you get an almost identical remake of the remake of 'Godzilla' (1998.) You're treated to a giant whatchamacalit who spawns off little creatures to get in those "hard-to-reach" areas the beast can't fit in. Okay, I liked the movie. It's fun, it's completely realistic; where there is complete chaos and without the news at your fingertips, you really don't know what's going on. You have to give it to the film makers to making possibly the most plausible monster B-Movie of all time. Unfortunately, even with (as mentioned) just 54 minutes of true footage, you get the feeling they stretched this out as thin as it would go. In addition, you get incredibly, and I mean down-right unbelievably stupid people to follow during this crisis. Half the movie is a senseless rescue mission. My friend and I made a pack following the film: if I were caught, leave me be, save yourself! Honestly, I would love to see a sequel, to learn more, but please drop the camera.
There were more jumps in Cloud Atlas than in a March Madness season, more cuts per minute than inside a Great Clips hair salon  on a busy day and more story lines than in the Bible. What a feat!Too bad, it far-too-closely resembled the terrible movie-within-the-movie in Gentlemen Broncos. Actually, I would rather watch the fictional film within Gentlemen Broncos than Cloud Atlas again.It's obvious this is a LOVE-it or HATE-it kind of film, and if only judged by the Oscar snub and America's Box Office receipts for this, I'm not alone in the HATE-it category. But, to be honest and fair, neither when the Academy completely misses a film or when a movie receives low Box Office numbers, it does not equate bad quality for I've seen plenty of fantastic films that basically made nothing and were rejected on award night. So, without using those to measure quality, I'll let this movie speak for itself on how bad it was.The movie truly had terrible, uninspired and unoriginal dialogue and narrative. Further, the costumes and makeup seemed like they were from a first-year film student that didn't drop out but was kicked out. (I must've laughed out loud a few times with Tom Hanks' multiple of characters and horrendous outfits and makeup.) And while I would normally admire its ambitious drive to cram what could have been a six-part series of films in just shy of three hours, the choppiness of too-many story lines made it feel like the book it's based on had roughly 1,500 chapters, all of which began and ended in under three sentences.Since I won't be seeing this again, I would just have to guess on how many abrupt transitions there were in between the story lines and timeframes. Probably, the same as my estimate number of chapters of the original manuscript. Again, I would normally rate a film higher that went outside the box and leapt all over the place with the different plots, all in a strobe light rapid pace. But, that feeling of admiration pretty much left me 30 minutes in when it all started to give me a headache. Sadly, as the movie speedily progressed, so did the number of sudden edits and transitions.I guess the positive part of all the cramming they did in this, is that it gives me more hope for a Kiefer Sutherland 24 movie. It appears it's possible to condense 24 hours of footage down to about three hours.As for the synopsis, that would be a tough one. And I just watched this film. Well, let's see, there's about 6-7 story lines, many, but not all, star the same actors in different gear and in many different time periods. Supposedly, all are supposed to connect and show a trend/bloodline from the 1800s to the, I don't know, 2500s. And that might be an accurate conclusion to the plot(s), but I either lost interest or was too bored. Even despite the rapid fluctuations of story lines, I found myself thinking of other things I could rather be doing during these three treacherous hours.I got what I needed to out of it. I understood where each was headed  oh, and that's another thing, none of these 6-7 stories had any remote amount of surprise or originality  so, it was easy to let my mind wander.When I did pay close attention, and when I thought: "Hey, I might actually like this, finally," they shifted gears once again to more ridiculous and embarrassing characters, flat and completely humorless "comedy" and the CGI was so bad, the landscaping so insipid, it made 2008's Speed Racer seem more, well, normal. I'm aware who directed/wrote this so it shouldn't be a surprise that Agent Smith pops up quite a bit or that one, sorta main character (meaning, no one really is a "main character" when there's just about as many characters are there were extras in Braveheart) completely and unintentionally hilariously mimics Neo: Jim Sturgess's Hae-Joo Chang.All in all, I might have to rethink my low rating I gave to The Tree of Life. While that was just as trite as this mess, at least the movie moved beautifully through some good cinematography and score. It was just as long and boring, but at least I had pretty scenery to move me.SKIT IT. Duh.
Honestly, I had to revisit this small (minded) town once I saw the 2011 Footloose remake trailer.The biggest question I have is: how the hell could they make this relevant in today's time? Though it was a 100% iconic 80s movie, it was probably barely relevant then  27 years ago.I'm referring to the basic premise of a kid, Ren (Ha  it's so hard to think of the all-around guy, Kevin Bacon, as a "kid") moving with his single mother to a small, religious town where it's  GASP  illegal to dance. Heck, it was probably frowned upon the mom being a single mother, but that's not explored.Well, Ren can't sit still, let alone fit in, until he makes friends (and a few enemies) and he shakes things up, namely with the great and powerful Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow) and his stunning (for 1984, that is) daughter, Ariel (Lori Singer.)So, they cross many barriers, including county lines to put on a senior danceWait, you don't know the premise of Footloose by now? If not, let me also fill you in who Luke Skywalker's father isUnfortunately, the first half of the movie does NOT hold up wellfor those who have never seen this. I did grow up with this, so none of the (ENORMOUSLY, EXCEEDINGLY) dated scenes really bothered me that much, nor the music  it's one of my all-time favorite soundtracks, after all.Kids these daysno I mean it: Kids, these days, try and get past the "ancient" feel of the movie and at least, dive into the second half, that surprisingly replaces main character Ren and his "growth" and shifts to the Reverend Moore's development, with help from his wife, Vi (the always lovely Dianne Wiest.) In a sense, Moore becomes the new main character and it's absolutely believable and touching. You literally stop rooting for Ren, as his character never changes (not that he needed to) and cheer for Moore to succeed.The movie's a lot deeper than it appears on the surface, or synopsis. Again, it has a fantastic soundtrack and believable small town ignorance. I will say, boy they could get away with murder back then. And, yeah, I noticed this as a kid, as well: in addition to "guys giving the birdie," language and themes, there's a shower/locker room scene with several male backsides exposed. Gees, and it was PG. Today it would be R. Maybe the good, ole Reverend has put his mark on the MPAA in today's timesAnd speaking of today's timesI must see the latest remake in Hollywood, of this classic. I want to see how they explain how "dancing" is so bad when it's so clearly "okay" according to Ren who quotes from the same Bible the Reverend uses to speak out against it (in a great town hall scene in this movie.)Beyond people who grew up with this movie, it's highly recommended to today's kids who want to see what (God, I feel old for saying this) kind of lives and troubles their parents had to endure in their own childhood.
(This is Part III of my "I Love the 90s!" special review series. From review #490-499, this being 492, I revisit what I feel are classics from the 90s. Unfortunately, one (Hellraiser: Bloodline) didn't fit the "classics" genre I'm referring to, but the rest, including this MASTERPIECE, I loved.)I want to get three things I didn't favor in what is a MASTERPIECE, a CLASSIC and one of the best movies of ALL TIME, out of the way. Thankfully, these three are NOT the movie's fault; blame it on marketing and the idiocy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, or the Oscar buffoons.#1 Kim Basinger does NOT belong on the cover, let alone half the cover. Not only did she play a small part, not only did she only play in just one of dozens of story lines, but the other actors outshined her throughout.#2 What's the deal (still on Basinger) with Kimmy winning the only acting award at the Oscars? Heck, she was the only one nominated! Sure, 1997 was tough competition for stars  eventual winner-Jack Nicholson was excellent in As Good As it Gets  but the three leads: Pearce, Crowe and Spacey, not to mention Cromwell and DeVito, were all on TOP of their game. Perhaps the Oscars said "Boy, we can't pick between all of these excellent performances, so why even nominate any of them." Of course, that didn't stop them from nominating both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis in Thelma & Louise a few years back. Furthermore, she was, in fact, good, looked gorgeous and believable in her role, but she was the weakest link in a long line of excellent performances.#3 I did like Titanic. Sure. But in the 1997's best picture line up (remember, back then, they only did the top 5) consisting of As Good As it Gets, Good Will Hunting, The Full Monty, Titanic and L.A. Confidential, L.A. Confidential took the cake far and above the rest. In fact, As Good As it Gets was better than Titanic. But, they do like their grand epicsI do want to thank them, fast forwarding 13 years to this year (2010) they dissed Avatar. At least they got that right.Whewnow I can praise one of my all time favorite movies. Crowe gave his best performance in spades and layers. He'll even tell you he's not smart enough to solve his dilemmas, but still shows the depth what others say about him. Then there's the all-around master, Spacey, who added much needed humor and elegance to the film. Pearce, wowtwo words: Clark Kent. And it was refreshing from both his excellent portrayal, but also to see Clark Kent in an alternative role.In addition to those fantastic performances, Cromwell and DeVito also were near perfect. Also, you have a great score, mood is fantastic, cinematography was suburb  watch it in Bluray if you can, it's gorgeous and it contains one of the most complex and wonderful scripts I have even seen on screen. I've been told they even toned it down from even more multistory-lines from its source material, its novel. Honestly, there's so much in this movie, I don't know if I could even take any more inter-webbed , overlapping subplots.In fact, it would be hard to even give a synopsis as I normally do, but I'll try.Picture it, 1950s L.A.  a place people want to come to: escape or be noticed, get rich or die trying or to sleep with real movie stars or fake ones. The story begins with the semi-narrator, gossip-columnist, Sid Hudgens (DeVito) who pays for his storieswait, I let's start over.(This paragraph might contain some heavy spoilers, skip over if you haven't seen the movie.) There are at least 8 main leads, all intersecting one way or another, leading this way, that way, and let me make one thing clear: I challenge anyone who has never seen this, read any of the spoilers or the book to predict where any of the multilayered stories are headed. There are the cops: Suave Jack (Spacey,) Meathead Bud (Crowe,) Clark Kent Ed (Pearce,) Do-No-Right Dudley (Cromwell) and D.A., or dick-n-ass, Ellis (Rifkin.) Then there's Loose Lynn (Basinger,) Vicious(-tongued) Sid (DeVito) and Pimpin' Pierce (Strathairn.) There's actually more, but these are the eight leads. Eight!As much as I loved the (remake) Ocean's Eleven, where they also had a magnitude of characters, all with their individual backgrounds and depth, this movie handled it better. Ocean's had more than 10 characters, duh, but in reality, they focused on the main three actors: Clooney, Pitt and Damon. Here, everyone gets their own screen time, each have incredible depth and range thanks to the actors involved and each have their back stories along with actual growth.To really make the movie basic or dumbed down for one central synopsis, it boils down to go-getter Ed who's made responsible for solving a multi-slaying homicide, but he doesn't think that the outcome is true justice. Honestly, I think that's the one line that's constant as there are at least 5-6 more supposedly irrelevant plots hanging around.When you begin to watch L.A. Confidential for the first time (or in my case, the fifth or so) it just seems a little complicated at times. Even I have a little hard time following each thread, even when I rewatch it again. And that's one of the beauties of this movie: each experience is brand new. And even if you "get" the movie as a whole, the next time you watch it, you can sit back and focus on the crisp scenery, the richness of 1950s Los Angeles or the delicious performances. If you don't really feel you're there, quite honestly, I don't know what other movie or any film noir that will. Obviously: SEE IT!
I love how (soon following) Doug Bradley was billed as "The Lead Cenobite." It makes sense from what I've been told about the background on Hellraiser, or the short story it's based on: The Hellbound Heart. This movie, unlike the other slashers surround it (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just to name a few) wasn't supposed to be the Artist Soon to be Known as Pinhead.My guess is Barker wanted to go beyond Freddy, Jason, Michael, and Leatherface and make an intelligent horror story without relying on a wise-cracking, machete-wielding or babysit watcher to slice/dice the idiot cardboard teens. Fans later apparently missed the message and Pinhead came out of the shadows. (I'm just as guilty; I love the character of Pinhead. But, at least I still liked this origin movie the best of the Hellraiser series.)I concur with true Barker fans, especially after watching Red Dragon. It's not about Hannibal Lecter at all, though they splashed Anthony Hopkins all over it. Why? Well, fans wanted him, they wanted to increase box office and it would be his last stint as Hannibal the Cannibal. But, to me it ruined the movie as that's not what the source material intended. Heck, Hannibal was in, like, 4 pages out of 464!Alas, sticking with the film at hand: Bravo. Aside from some cheesy lightening effects amongst some buck fifty door creatures  all probably due to the low budget, it was a highly effective up'd ante from the typical irony-laced/Twilight Zone fare with loads of plot twists, character development, background, suspense and a surprisingly large number of characters  all important  for such a small film.After Frank (Chapman) summons demons with a puzzle box (loved the box) and disappears, supposedly for good, his brother, Larry (Robinson) and sister-in-law, Julia (Higgins) move into his house. Immediately we're treated to Julia's extramarital affair with Frank in very spicy flashbacks.Meanwhile, Larry's trying to connect with his daughter, Kirsty (Laurence) who's (not very) oddly unfavorable of Julia. Meanwhile, after a deep cut, Larry splashes blood on the very floor of the very room his brother "disappeared" in and it gets sucked up and becomes an insect version of Frank. Meanwhile, Julia sees her chance of getting her ex-lover back and is willing to go the extra mile, for lack of a better term, to bring back Frank. Meanwhile, Kirsty investigates and inadvertently summons the very demons, or Cenobites, who are just as confused as she is on why they were called  generally they're called for pleasure through pain.There's more "meanwhiles" but I've probably spoiled enough. Suffice to say, it's a gory good time at psychological warfare between the innocent, the guilty and the deserving.And it's brutally gruesome. Not by today's standards, 23 years later, but I'm sure it was near the top of the list from 1987 backwards. One positive about the gore: they didn't just rely on that, as most slashers/torture porn does since. This had one, uh, hell of a story here.That said, it wasn't perfect; there were a lot of plot holes including a quick wrap up in the last third that made Kirsty the thrown in heroine who could unconvincingly solve the puzzle in a few heartbeats and bargain these big baddies, lead by Pinhead. This is when all others, who actually know about them, actually call upon them, can't outmaneuver a flying hook. Also, they did a good job of introducing the Cenobites, but spent so little on them, it begged for a sequel, or more, to explore their storyline.Furthermore, it almost seemed like the creator, Barker, was anti-Christ as there were plenty to mock Jesus, even going as far as reference him in a quote from the Bible at the most inopportune time. But, in their defense, I think they did a good job of showing true evil, whether be it from the walking sadomasochistic demons or worse, man. It's hard to watch, but so was The Passion of the Christ. Both films show the true evil of men; they didn't sugar-coat/Sunday School what lies beneath our skins.It's definitely 1980s. It's a good start on the Pinhead legend. It's for gore fans or for people reminiscing about the 1980s horror franchises. And it's a recommended for a more thoughtful look at pure evil.
I think I've gotten too soft lately. After liking/appreciating The Expendables 2, The Last Stand and Bullet to the Head, I enjoyed Olympus Has Fallen. It's a popcorn movie with huge plot holes and still managed to entertain me.Being a fan of both the Die Hard films (ONLY 1, 3, 4 and partially 2) and Jack Bauer from the television series: 24, helped tremendously. For, this absolutely should've been A Good Day to Die Hard. It had every element of that series, from the action, acting, plot twists, characters and snappy dialogue. Perhaps they didn't re-write this to include John McClane because he was never secret service (or didn't want to be) or the fact they just did #4 in D.C. But, nevertheless, this was a movie to be enjoyed by Die Hard fans.In addition, I saw a lot of 24's Jack Bauer in Gerard Butler's "Mike." So, to me, despite the clichéd and predictable Olympus Has Fallen, I had a great time.After attempting to save the President, but inadvertently losing the First Lady, Mike Banning (Butler) gets banned from the Secret Service. 18 months later, he fights his way, literally, back into the White House when rogue North Koreans are bent on world control. Hell breaks loose and only Mike on the inside can save the day.Okay, there's many problems here, some harder to get past. Such a Korean plane crossing thousands of miles only to be detected in the states and then, only intercepted by two US military jets. Then, after 18 months of absence, Mike is able to access all coded secrets in the White House that apparently haven't been re-coded. And then, there are safety protocols in place, but can be easily accessed in one single room with all the right people.The movie isn't to be taken seriously at all. You do need to leave your brain at the door. But, if you channel both Jack Bauer and John McClane within yourself, you, too, can have a good time.May the Fallen rise again until the remake, White House Down, comes out later in the same year.
(Originally, I watched this one other time: October 6, 2009. This review is a recap, and second viewing on October 1, 2013. Cheers)Wow. What a mistake I made when I originally saw this. Initially, I gave this 3½ out of 5 stars. Upon watching this BluRay purchase, just barely less than 4 years time (5 days shy of 4 years) and only my second viewing, I am thoroughlyglad I bought this on BluRay. My rating quickly increased to 4½/5 Stars with this screening.This movie was fantastic, elegantly and originally written and played a nice curve ball to the standard horror anthology films. It also had great acting, hilarious lines and though a big chunk of the movie relied on humor, it didn't forget  ever  it was a horror movie. In fact, the "final" segment, the fight between Sam and Mr. Kreeg was so eerie, so terrifying, I know I'd have nightmares for years to come had I seen that as a child. It would have stuck with me like another horror anthology's Zuni Doll segment did from Trilogy of Terror that I had seen as a kid. That short story has never left my memory, or the fright I first experienced. Love it. As would I have, with this attack on Mr. Kreeg.But, that's not saying the rest of the movie either didn't have horror or memorable scenes. They all did. And the way it was so well craftedagain, I am shocked I was so hard on it in the first place, four years ago. Can't make that mistake again. This movie won't be watched now, once every four years. I own it on BluRay and it'll be an October staple for me.* * *Final thoughts: Here were my original thoughts on October 6, 2009:(Original Headline, or "Summary"): What a Treat it is to Trick the audience once moreHighly effective in spots, 'Trick 'R' Treat' is highly recommended for those who want to reminisce of the 1980-90s horror films, especially 'Creepshow.' Now, this one does take it a step further by continuously overlapping and backtracking on four stories of horror. Now, it wasn't perfect, as I felt no story really was complete, and when you begin to get involved into a story it bounces around before you can get fully vested. In addition, they keep trying to shock you with twists and turns  I admit, I was dumbfounded when you learn who the Brian Cox character really is, boy, I'm ashamed I should've seen that coming. And finally, I've read some information why this was shelved (Sorry, 'Superman Returns' was not a disappointment - $391m worldwide? That's another story) and I can't see why. This was a great homage to those older horror stories/movies. Creepy, scary, original and funny in spots. I see where they're trying a little too hard in irony, but a lot worked. The acting was completely believable, the pace was adequate and the gore was there for those seeking it. The movie's synopsis states there were four interweaving "horror/campfire" stories one Halloween night. I didn't really count, but it felt like a lot more, some more predictable than others. The already stated Brian Cox one I was thrown (and I'm still embarrassed) yet the School Bus massacre was seen a mile away. As for the Principal story, I couldn't believe how far they took it, or did they? That was another aspect I liked: every time they threw in comedy, they reminded you this isn't a 'Goosebumps' video. Just like when you side with 'Hannibal Lector' they remind you he's really a monster. I'd highly recommend this for die-hard 1980-90s horror and 'Sookie/Vampire' fans.
(I might be out of compliance myself as this review might contain some minor spoilers. You've been warned.)Compliance was truly one of the hardest films for me to watch. And no, it was not because of the following:1. Extreme Gore. 2. Gratuitous Violence and Language. 3. Child Abuse. 4. A Guest Appearance by Snooki.It was because of stupidity. Unbelievable and downright contemptuous ignorance. Sure, we (or at least my reader and I) live in a country that mostly stands behind the likes of The Jersey Shore, The Kardashians and most recently, some trailer trash honey bunch kid that I've only heard word of mouth about.Butthe "inspired by a true story" morons shown here in Compliance actually make me believe there are real-life people getting duped over the phone by scam artists. I honestly thought: if they did exist, it would have to be .00009% of the population. I was sooo wrong.What started off in stereotypical, but welcoming, independent film style, Compliance showed us a busy Friday night at a chicken fast food joint. I've worked in that industry many moons ago and what they showed was fairly accurate, so it was kinda nice trip down memory lane. UntilUntil, the single-digit I.Q. supervisor (oh, and that's spot on for most fast food superiors I've worked for) receives a phone call from a police detective claiming the blonde throw-away cashier stole money from a customer. This is about less than a fifth of the way in, and from there on, my mind went numb.You see, the detective has the grade-school dropout supervisor perform certain "tasks" to prove the young female's innocence. At very first, the objectives are small and innocent. In a heartbeat, however, they snowball into the extreme and highly questionable; such as strip searching the employeeand that's the least of the duties requested.What I just provided are the "minor spoilers" I previously warned of. There's so much more that happens, as part of the investigation, to this employee of which I refuse to refer to as a "victim."The reason my mind went numb was because by the second or third order by the officer over the phone I would have requested, no demanded, he come down to restaurant and wonder why he hadn't already. My "inspired by a true story" movie would've been over in 20 minutes because I would've called this guy out. Recently, I've heard people online say: "I don't know what I would've done in this situation" and "Let the conversations begin!" Well, it's painfully obvious what I would've done, so my "discussion," or conversation, would've been short and simple. And it was extremely frustrating watching these imbeciles  including the strip-searched young female suspect  not do a single thing right.I like to write down my thoughts first before I read other people's opinions/reviews. So, currently, I am ignorant to why people gave this movie such praise. I will say the acting was very believable  I have known my share of idiots and it was well shot  so there are no complaints from me there. What I simply couldn't get past was the ridiculous reactions from these so-called human beings. How many people would you know would readily agree to begin slicing up their arm with a butcher knife if some stranger called them on the phone and informed them: "To get the bugs out, you must start cutting up your arm! Do it! Find a knife now! There's no time; those bugs can get deeper into your system!"That may sound far-fetched, but there you go. That's this movie. If you would like to watch painful and hard-to-watch "true stories" of some dense people, save some minutes by simply watching an episode of either Jersey Shore, Kardashians or that honey dish of embarrassment everyone's talking about.
Where Knight and Day actually did have intentional laughs, Salt produced more laughs that I didn't anticipate. Namely in the finale. Pretty much that was the only unpredictable factor in a movie with a climax that will go down in history as one of the most foreshadowed "twists" from minute one in the film.Aside from the literal laugh-out-loud final 20 minutes, I don't think there was a scene in Salt that was crafted to invoke any laughter. This movie is as straight-laced without an ounce of humor, or humility, as one can make it.Furthermore, aside from the unpredictable comedy and the predictable outcome, let's get one thing straight: if someone compares this to ANY of the Bourne movies, ask them this one simple question: What else have you lied to me about? This is as much Bourne as Ramona & Beezus is about lesbian lovers.The title belongs on the popcorn you are eating as this is the main definition of a "popcorn movie" or Leave-Your-Brain-HOME film. Sure Angelina looked great and the action appeared to be CGI-lite  a favorite of mine, but it's hard to get past how incredibly mediocre both the script and action scenes were.Perhaps they were trying to be realistic. They failed there with Salt's (Jolie) truck hopping, or lack of motion sickness after getting out of the 15th vehicle she caused to drop 1+ stories. Perhaps they were trying so hard on "making you think" with the is she/isn't she a single or double agent. Again, they let us down due to all the blatant clues they LITERALLY told us. I wouldn't be able to get through an entire season of the excellent 24 if they gave away 1/100 of the plot points in hour one as this did by minute five.US-CIA Agent Salt was rescued by her husband Mike (Diehl) while tortured by the enemy and after that nearly, but not completely, pointless plot point, they fast forward two years to their happy home in D.C. This is all fun and games until a defective Russian confesses she's a Russian spy and her own kind turns on her.Hold it there. I'll admit, I don't work for the CIA. I've not been known for my espionage tactics. But, it did sound a little fishy that one unknown would unravel an established agent in seconds and no one believes her. I couldn't buy that, but I'll just chalk that up as one of the many weak plot points to move the story to what it's really about: The Chase.This is where people might compare this to Bourne as she's being chase by the same branch and she's out to solve her dilemma on her own. Well, that's been done dozens of times before. Jack Bauer, James Bond, Dr. Richard Kimble, to name a few. What the movie Salt needed to do, was separate itself, I don't know, with some original and exciting action sequences and less on trying to trap us in who's the mole.To sum it all up, a Russian spy is, in fact, out to kill both the Russian and US Presidents and since Salt is their only suspect, they void any search of any other assassin. Could the culprit be pulling a Skynet? Sorry, I forgot to say SPOILER ALERT, but if you didn't see that coming or who's really responsible, then congratulations on your first movie you've seen since E.T.Again, I'll admit Angelina looked wonderful, but this wasn't her day in the acting part. She was so up and down with real/fake emotions, she either made the director look bad or she took lessons from Megan Fox.Every once in a while a movie will change my mind on an actor, much like my distaste for Nicolas Cage was thwarted a bit in Kick Ass or my annoyance with Adrien Brody was lifted in Predators. Didn't happen here with the actorI'veneverliked: Liev Schreiber. He didn't do anything, quite literally, in this movie. He was flat-lining out of the gate and did nothing to add to his character or movie. He was like Keanu Reeves who can tell you he's an FBI agent or he's a vampire hunter, but we never believe him due to his poor acting.Who am I fooling? This movie's premise is just that, to fool you. It's not about acting, depth, originality or setting the bar higher. It's like an M. Night Shyamalan blunder whereas they were so concerned with the BIG surprise, they forgot to make a movie.I'd barely recommend it for action alone and Angelia who did look good in her Matrix moves and clothes, but it's more of a rental. A cheap $1 rental. Or even on network TV in a year with dozens of commercials and scenes edited out.
Imagine for once, you're a high school kid: shy, secluded, wimpy, gets beaten down and then BAM!, you, your cousin and friend get these fantastic powers! You can get back at the bullies, fly to Tibet on a whim and fight back that bad, bad father.Now, imagine that same kid is bland, boring, brainless and brings little to the table  his super-friends, too  and the "special powers" are all-but a backdrop to whatever's (not) happening on the screen. Sounds like a fun time?It's hard not to put yourself in the shoes of these Teen Titans of 'Chronicle' (1½/5 Stars) and when you do you should be thoroughly disappointed in these shallow kids' discovery.Literally, or BARELY, nothing changes in these kids' lives following an alien encounter that leaves the three with the ability of telekinesis. And that's not a good thing: these boys didn't have that much depth or anything going for them prior and following, they have even less. Oh, there's some "training" and a girly, girl-podcaster side story that's about as interesting as watching Bella and Edward's courtship, but other than that, these fools do not act like normal kids who would find themselves much stronger than the day before. (One example, after a good friend dies, the first instinct, at least in this reality, is to film the funeral in some art-house fashion and then, its business as usual following. The supposedly far-lesser realistic kids of Elm Street showed more emotion towards their lost friends at each film's obligatory funeral.)I was a teenage boy once; I read comics, watched superhero movies and daydreamed a lot. Like what would happen if I had the ability of flight, invulnerability and the power to move objects with my mind through my hand. This, mercifully, short film was NOTHING like I imagined. These punks might as well been given a used iPad vs. abnormal abilities.There were enough misfires in this film that I left the theatre and said to myself: "Thanks for the preview. Now, I can't wait to see the real movie!"But, beyond  or beneath  these squandered opportunities, I got the sense I was watching a film-school student movie that used the tired and old hand-held/lost-footage genre as the "twist." Let me tell you: when this is the 50th rip off since 'The Blair Witch Project,' it's no longer fresh. Hell, I've seen two new ones in the theatre this year in just five weeks. And aside from the genre being played out since 'Cloverfield' in 2008, I believe they're getting worse and worse with less and less happening until they all are equal to the over-long YouTube videos they really are.Okay, forgetting all that, what's left is some bad acting juxtaposed with bad dialogue, mediocre special effects  some of which were down-right pitiful (the stock-footage, cloudy sky green-screen shots and transposed geeks almost made me spit out my soda) and far-fetched camera angles or uses of the camera POVs. The whole finale was questionable, unless we're led to believe that some secret government agency went around collecting everyone's phones and cameras or both to splice together what happened. But, worse than that, was the brief, off-camera policeman saying they had to leave the cameras (yeah, two for whatever logical reason) on in a hospital room while someone was SLEEPING, possibly in a coma. Reason? It's part of the investigation. That was too obvious of a set up, bloody amateurish on the filmmaker's part and all-out jaw-dropping laughable. (No joke: I said "WHAT?" when I was in the theatre and then laughed after the words "part of the investigation" sank in and reminded me of an old MST3k film.)Even though they NEEDLESSLY had to remind us every few minutes (or less) that they're holding a camera for their self-explained "no-explanation," I admit this odd-super-hero film was just slightly better than 'Hancock' but nowhere near as exciting or interesting as the other odd-titled-lost-footage movie: 'Cloverfield.' Since it wasn't even well paced, it's not worth the time, even at under an hour and a half.(On a cheery side note, I thought I would like it more when 2 of the 3 main characters were named Steve and Andrew  my first and middle names. Although, it might have been a tad bit creepy if the third were strangely named "Reeves")
I usually don't base any of my reviews or thoughts on box office receipts and in the case of 'Mars Needs Moms' (1/10 Stars), just out of curiosity, I checked them after I finished watching it.By the power of Grayskull, I am THRILLED the $150-million-dollar budgeted film made only $21m in the US and only $39m total worldwide. Finally, justice. Finally, I can say Americans, er, Earthlings in general, showed their disapproval for not just a poorly made film, but for thee worst animated film in history.There are so many things wrong with this movie, I seriously don't know if I could list all of them. For starters, the animation was awful, inept and lazy. It played out like the worst video game or like a cheaply produced 22-minute Disney teach young kids what shapes are what and how to love flowers.Worse, (jumping ahead) in the last part of the credits, they showed us in very small boxes (yes, they were so proud of their failure, they needed to show us not once, but FOUR times) how they made the animation "come to life."This is one of those movie experiences that my jaw was locked open for pretty much the entire film. I was so in shock in how bad it was, I couldn't close my snapper. I even tried my best to get past the art-student-drop-out animation to see if the story was enough to go beyond that.Obviously, not. What we have is a Mars abduction of a mother and her stow-away son in an extremely dangerous and sometimes brutal adventure where I was disappointed it was only slapped with a PG. (I'm guessing the mostly wrong MPAA saw all the cutesy toddler secondary characters and said, "Ahhhh, well, they meant well for little kids.")The dialogue was atrocious, the references were outdated and the "moral" was misconstrued. See? Get past the laugh-out-loud terrible graphics and you're left with much less. Heck, the only thing I think they got right was another offensive aspect: Dan Fogler's character had 3 very noticeable and disgusting chins.This movie was pathetic, disturbing, heartless, soulless, an abomination and pretty much an insult to real-creative artists who want to actually make art vs. allowing a computer do the "thinking." (Oh, and by the way, even the computer got the movements, angles and camera panning wrong.)Lest you ignore my warnings up to this point, and you make it to the end of the filmget ready for one of the most unbearable, uncomfortable and gross-out climaxes in cinema history. Remember that demonic dancing baby internet "sensation" of a decade ago? Remember how it would creep out even the most evil psychopaths? Well, now multiply that by more than 2 dozen.And after all these rants, my greatest regret in seeing this was that I already made my Bottom Ten of 2011 list a month ago. I saw this one month too late to label it as #1 worst of 2011 because it clearly was. Hell, it'll go down as one of the decade's worst and possibly beyond.
This is going to date me, but when I was a kid, my sister loved the soap opera 'Santa Barbara,' and because of Robin Wright, she wanted to see 'The Princess Bride.' It became one of her favorites, getting me to watch it. After watching and only being a kid, I just "liked" it. Since then, I must have seen this 20+ times. It is truly a timeless classic, made with pure heart, adventure, comedy, excitement, romance, etc  in other words, all of the needed elements of a masterpiece. (I do use the word "timeless" if you forgive the He-Man guys behind the all-but two-year-old Fred Savage and the high-tech "video game" he is playing. Other than that, it can be viewed in any decade.) We have Grandfather that reads the said-title to his ill grandson and so the story unfolds, beautifully. Westley and Buttercup are the central characters in this fairy-tale land, but all of the actors/characters have such depth and realism, it's almost never-ending in excitement when one appears, leaves and/or returns. You will see hilarious comedy, exciting sword-fighting or mind-games and true love. This movie is also perfect for the whole family. You might see people die, but it's as graphic as people simply falling off screen. Little blood, no nudity, no language, no sexI love the fact when they set out to make this, they didn't need to add any of that in and now have an all-time-classic. I'd hate to ruin any of the surprises, or the people the characters meet along the way or the near-death experiences they take with strides, so I would just highly recommend this all ages, to all audiences. If you've already experienced one of the best movies of all time, enjoy it again; see how movies should be made.
Men hiding in the bushes. Check. Much younger girl captured and tied. Check. Girl afraid for her life. Check.Okay, fine, it's not that kind of Predator movie. Not even close, but I doubt this would be the title if released today. (Yep, Predators opens 7/9/10, but that's only after the established 1987 name was given.) Is this not one of the epitome of a Guy's Movie? Shallow plot, explosions, girl in distress, gun/knife battles, rippling muscles, aliens and Schwarzenegger. No wonder most call this a classic, though I would add: it's a DUDE's classic.The reason I don't call it a "real" classic, is because, I simply can't get past the incredibly paper-thin storyline. That's not to say it has an interesting concept about an out-of-this-world hunter, hunter-turned-prey, prey-turned-hero, etc. It did have some good graphics, and I admit when they wanted to put huge guys to be the best of the best in a jungle warfare setting fighting 3 enemies  man, themselves and, of course, an alien, they succeeded in spades.If you're looking for a deeper Schwarzenegger classic, with just as much action, but with storyline and originality, you could do much better: The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Total Recall and True Lies, to name a few.Wow, let's now tackle the incredibly deep plot: The elite group of soldiers are dropped behind enemy lines in the jungle on a search-and-rescue mission. Right off the bat, they realize they're in over their head when the targets are hanging, skinless and bloody, literally over their heads.Blaming nearby guerillas gives the film crew an excuse to have an extensive action scene and for Schwarzenegger say some "funny" but out of place one-liners. Wait, it might not be the newly slaughtered men. Could it be the entity that landed in a space ship shown in shot one? Duh, but we're not there yet. First they have to have the fight-amongst-themselves scenes, a hostage and the realizations as they're picked off one-by-one.Once all that's through, I believe, is where the movie gets better. Schwarzenegger calms his signature only-in-the-movies lines, and does battle with both brawn and brains, though the "setting the traps" does go on a little too long.Then again, despite the spin-offs and sequels, who better to really take on the Predator than Schwarzenegger? When the movie opened, and during the credits, I saw the name Alan Silvestri attached to the score and remembered that name. Without a second thought, or time, I was immediately reminded who he is and if you're as familiar or a fan of the Back to the Future trilogy as I am, you'll recognize his technique/style throughout the entire movie. From beginning to end. Every second.Unfortunately, that was tough getting through. Just like Danny Elfman is enormously recognizable with his music, so was Silvestri here. I like originality when it comes to composers, such as John Williams who envisions the project at hand and brings them to life with perfection and never duplicating.That didn't lower my overall rating, but it didn't help. (Much like Titanic's composer, James Horner, who barely lifted a muscle to change his Titanic score when "creating" the Avatar music.) I would recommend it, but it's definitely a leave-your-brain-at-the-door film. It won't change the world, but it did introduce a great character, The Predator, (with rules  I did like that) to see more in films in the future (of 1987, that is.)
I'm really gonna make this a quick review, because for the life of me, James Bond Part II, or From Russia with Love was so forgettable, so boring, that I practically cannot remember over 20% of what I just finished watching.What did men  yeah, I'm assuming this really didn't appeal to many women  expect out of a spy "adventure" movie in the 1960s? Leaving out today's high octane standards, it doesn't even hold up to other action-packed, character-driven or even "fun" movies I've seen prior to the year 1963.So, they were good with settling with a smirking Sean Connery who barely, and absolutely unrealistically, lifts a finger to knock over bad guys? When he finds them, that is, because the wait is on once the movie begins.And speaking of the start of the movie, it's enormously unfair of a die-hard Austin Powers fan to have seen Mike Myers's movies many times and then watch the opening to From Russia with Love. One cannot help when they see the #3 character opposite the partially seen #1 character and not laugh when envisioning Frau Farbissina and Dr. Evil.'Course, that's not the movie's fault. Hell, Mike Myers wasn't even one before From Russia with Love hit American cinemas.From what I can recall, the eeeevil SPECTRE (well, so-called, because very little evidence proves they're anything but entrepreneurs) sets up both the Russians and the English to retrieve a very special box. As seen with the first two James Bond movies, Bond stumbles into the truth  yeah, he might as well be the pre-Austin and a few minor fights for the good guys prevail.To each 1960's guy their own, but this movie was flat, unmemorable, over killed the Bond-theme even when completely unnecessary and crawled at a snail's pace without the slightest of intrigue. Fine, I wasn't born in this era so "how would I know?" Well, I don't.And thank God for that.(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the "odd one out": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)
Granted, if the How Did This Get Made? podcast wasn't around, I would've never seen Cobra.I understand this made a lot of money back in the 1980s. Let me tell you, from a first-time viewer, it belongs in the 1980s. It was many of the 1980s action/comedies all slapped together, only without any humor. Intentionally, that is.I'm being harsh. This movie isn't terrible, per se. It has its problems  many of them, but it's the classic "Leave your brain at the door" meshed with "Forget all the other countless movies it rips off." So, if you can manage those feats, have fun viewing.Apparently, "Cobra" runs by his own rules while being a cop  even though we barely ever see him do anything completely unreasonable (SEE: Jack Bauer in any season of 24)  and he's faced with saving one nothing witness from a gang who, I guess, wants to change the face of the world by means of clanking metal together.Okay, I tease, but seriously, I am not too far off. There's also an inside (person) and plenty of failed chances to knock off our heroes for them to always live long enough to deliver a message against bad eating.Fine, this movie is fairly funny if you watch it for how serious it wants to be. And at 87 minutes and deathly 1980s filmmaking, it's worth a Rifftrax kind of night.* * * Final thoughts: I had this assignment (well, um, that I set for myself) to watch all the movies the How Did This Get Made? podcast made fun of. This was on the list and that's my excuse. But, I still recommend this as long as you do listen to their take. It's fairly interesting and enormously hilarious.
If it weren't for all the graphic violence, albeit mostly off screen and grand number of deaths, I would certainly recommend Jack the Giant Slayer to 9-10 year olds. I think that's the target audience, at least.It would make my job a lot easier just to list all the faults, such as terrible editing, plot holes big enough for the giants to crawl through, cheap 3-D, so-so acting, bland dialogue and most of all: atrocious and sometimes laugh-out-loud special effects. But, in reality, it wasn't all-around as bad as it could've been.This is thanks to the efforts of the secondary roles, such as Ewan McGregor's standout performance as Elmont and Ian McShane's King Brahmwell. Even though that last one wasn't great, at least he did decent. Also, every once in a while, the cinematography was good. Not often enough, but enjoyable for what few minutes they showed.Pretty bland and mostly boring, farmer Jack (Nicolas Hoult) likes adventure, because he tells us and also, naturally, likes Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson.) She, too, favors adventure, or so she tells us. Well, they get their wish when they inadvertently become taken up, up and away a magical beanstalk to, what looks like, just more Earth, only higher. Except, of course, giants reside up there, and they ain't nice.Enter in basic story-telling  again, great for younger-than-preteens, and get ready for a "giant" battle. Not really, but I thought I would throw that pun in there.As mentioned, the editing and script left a lot to be finished had they released this later in the year. For example, when the "brave" knights scale the beanstalk and see the house the princess might be still in, the scene abruptly changes to the men actually stating she wasn't in there. I guess we're to assume they checked it, which actually might have been a cool scene to see. Much like the beanstalk that should've been in most of the background shots, but despite everyone always being near it, it's rarely shown. Forgotten, almost.Oh, and I haven't even got to the bad, bad CGI used for the giants and their juvenile behaviors that might please an even younger crowd than the one intended. Anyone above six most likely rolled their eyes, even unintentionally. In addition to rolling my own eyes, I did shake my head more than a few times, while laughing at the movie in other scenes.Going back to my original point: I really thought this would be great for young kids, but damn, some people die some horrible ways. Again, mostly off-screen, but they told us exactly how they were slaughtered. Pity. Now, I can't recommend this to any age audience.Please no sequel. That's my final thought.
As much as I really like Gordon Love Hewitt Joseph, or whatever his name is, he's really giving me a bad name with all his "healthy" roles such as in 50/50 and here in Premium Rush. I'm really out of shape, I find, whenever I see his movies!Here, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (I looked it up) plays a riding cowboy on wheels in New York City who delivers packages that seemingly cannot be sent via UPS, USPS, DHL or Download. Unfortunately for him, he takes one on that the worst villain since Mr. Freeze terrorized the other Gotham, wants kept undeliverable.Really, that's the entire synopsis. The movie's mostly about the (admittedly VERY FUN scenes of) GPS-travels of said messenger in between cars. Try and forget the absolutely awful performance of Michael Shannon or the paper thin subplots. We're just supposed to watch a 1990s-made movie for today's time.I didn't hate or even really dislike this mindless little adventure, but I am getting fairly disappointed that Mr. Gordon-Levitt isn't using his wonderful talents more wisely. He's been in, gasp!, four major films of 2012 and only his decent movie is his down-the-credit-list role in Lincoln. He's absolutely better than this and here's to a better 2013 for him.
Honestly, for one of the first times I'm dumbstruck or have writer's block. Where to begin? Oh, where the stars of the film talks about "good and suspenseful films." You have to be careful about that. These characters talk about "twists" and introducing characters. The problem I most had with A Perfect Getaway was the fact the ENTIRE movie was based on SECRETS and CLUES. They (or director and writer Twohy) were so concerned with "throwing off the audience and building up to a BIG secret" they never bothered to make a real movie. One with depth and originality.And that, my peers, was the biggest flaw: they specifically asked you to solve the whodunit and since they stressed so hard (basically by showing multiple above & beyond/waaay obvious suspects) it was so incredibly clear who was the murderer(s.) Freshly newlyweds Cliff (Zahn) and Cydney (Jovovich) take their honeymoon in one of the Hawaii island's self-directed hikes, and continue their journey even after they discover murder(s) on the loose on the most popular island. Along the way, they meet some interesting characters (or the movie screams: THE USUAL SUSPECTS) including Nick (the ALWAYS impressive Olyphant) and Gina (Sanchez.) I admit some of the movie was ruined from the numerous sources (critics and normal humans/peers/friends) that told me: "Wow! I never saw that coming! And I never suspected the killers to be" Due to that (way unfortunate) information, I immediately guessed who the murder(s) were/wasprior to the movie starting.And that's unfortunate. With a movie based on a gorgeous Hawaiian island and with such talent at hand (Olyphant and Zahn,) it shouldn't based on a single typical "M. Night Shyamalan" plot-twist, and that's all 80% of the movie is built on  a whodunit. Then, they have the video-gamed, twisted, slo-mo and gory final 20% as if they overstayed their welcome. And so they did.Word of advice from this amateur who never made a movie: don't base a lot of your dialogue on "well written screenplays" when your own is incredibly mediocre.I'm not going to give away who is the threat in this movie  honestly, it's not worth a dime to reveal the secret. But, I, like my friends previous, have already set the scene by revealing there's a huge revelation. Unfortunately for the movie-going audience, that's all there is. Zero plot combined with wonderful cinematography and a movie SOLELY based on a secret. No wonder this movie made practically nothing at the box office; once you learn the secret, you simultaneously learn there's no other (well needed) substance to maintain repeat viewings. SKIP!
I admit: experimental shorts aren't my forté, but I checked out Dym (Smoke, for us Americans) and I liked it. Weird, yes. Different, definitively. Aimless? Well, blow away the smoke and see for yourself.Typically, in Reevesreviews fashion, I would write up a synopsis, but there really isn't much of a plot here. You have a young (attractive) male in a flat, but then, suddenly, he's a chauffeur to a heavier-set male to an adult club. There's a woman in red appearing in & out of the picture. And there's a tape recorder to witness it all.That's pretty much it. No dialogue. No character names, other than those mentioned on IMDb. All style, little direction.And yet, it's an interesting and well-shot short film. I was just told about this short recently, but apparently, it's been around since 2007. I would be highly interested in seeing a feature (or full) length film by director/editor/writer Grzegorz Cisiecki.Hey (Americanized): Greg! Pick up the camera again and film more. This short took talent and an excellent eye. Please do more, and I'll be in line on opening night.
Number one flaw  the previous Batman flick should've been called Batman & Robin and this one Forever as a nice send off until the definite Batman movies came to be thanks to Christopher Nolen. That's such a small flaw compared to every other horrid thing wrong with this Batman 60's TV show revamp. If I heard Arnold screech "Everyone chill" or other dozen lines he repeats throughout more than more a dozen times, I would purposely move to California to vote against him (side note: seeing how they're faring with his leadership and economy, I don't have to move a muscle; people will certainly vote him out next time.) Nothing worked in this film if you're over five, maybe six years old. The only thing this camp could've improved on, was allowing 109-year-old Alfred finally kick the bucket, but alas, he survives right alongside Batman who showed his "human" side throughout since he couldn't solve any problem without consulting first with Batgirl and Robin. Stay far away from the worst in the series and only concentrate on Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns and then jump to Batman Begins & the best of all six: The Dark Knight.
If not for Justin Long's Robin segment: "Super Hero Speed Dating," the Chris Pratt butt shot, the one line: "We don't have many Jewish people in Europe, anymore, because of the 'trouble,'" or the fact "JJ" (Adam Cagley) was cute, this Movie 43 would be the biggest waste of an enormously casted, adolescence and pot-induced "humor" film of all time.How this got green-lit, how this attracted absolute talent, including some of my all-time favorites, how this was said: "Oscar winners, we have a wiener for you, ha ha" and they cameis so beyond me, I can't even comprehend.Okay, maybe I can. A little.Perhaps these big stars, this talent, purposely set out to make one incredibly bad film with less than preteen humor. Maybe this is all a joke? Possibly they intended to act stupid to "get back at critics"? I don't know.What I do know is: One soul was sold to the Devil to get all these greats into this so-called anthology of "comedy." Yeah, I'm using quotes a lot here. It's only because a lot of the humor, sets, contracts and sober-less writing is as incredibly fake as the ideas for Junior Junior High School internet ideas.While most anthologies are of the horror genre, and this does have a minute amount of suspense/sci-fi/stupidity, this one is basically visual slapstick comedy. The weak wraparound story involves two potheads attempting to get back at one of the kid's brothers by making up their need to find "Movie 43."Along the internet search way, many, too many, stories fit in literally an hour and 10 minutes that have zero relevance to the overall plot. Many are pre-preteen sight gags sketches, only one (mentioned above  "Super Hero Speed Dating") is worthy of a viewing. In fact, if that can be found on YouTube, you'll give me a $1,000 for saving you a mere hour and five minutes.Mercifully, there aren't 43 shorts, but it sure felt that way. Skip it!Side Note: Currently, the rating on Movie 43 is 4.4 on IMDb. Hopefully, this review will knock it down .1 to finally make sense of the title.
I really miss Michelle Pfeiffer. I'll always love Jack Nicholson and even James Spader and Christopher Plummer, but where's Pfeiffer been, lately?Wolf showed classic Pfeiffer. In fact, as much as I've loved her in many projects, her turn as Laura Alden in Wolf and as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in Batman Returns are her best and most delicious roles. Sure, she was great in The Fabulous Baker Boys, The Age of Innocence, Dangerous Liaisons and even Frankie and Johnny, but these two roles are my personal favorites.The reason I bring her up first is the simple fact she stole every scene she was in, even in a movie that's extremely top notch to begin with. Nicholson was great, as always  and I thoroughly appreciated him toning himself down roughly twelve marks to play the meek Will Randall, but Pfeiffer's multilayered and selfish, though smart, gal Laura was the best.Wolf tells the classic tale in a classic way of the "good" man who's bitten by a werewolf and becomes the like. Classic is right: this movie has every bit the 1930s-1940s feel of the "Monster Movies" I grew up on. (Okay, meaning on TV or VCR; I'm not that old.)To prove this point, they get right to the point in the opening where Will's driving down a snowy and treacherous mountain road at night and inadvertently hits a wolf  something apparently not common in Vermont. As all characters in these types of films, he investigates a little too close and gets bitten. And so the story goesWill immediately notices changes and his soon-to-be demotion as editor in chief of a publishing house or his melancholy wife, Charlotte (Nelligan,) isn't helping. He does, in fact, get demoted or fired, whichever way any character takes it, at the house (ha, 17,000 acre palace) of the owner of the company, Raymond Alden (Plummer.) It's there that several significant plot points occur: horses fear Will and Will meets Alden's daughter, Laura.If I wasn't already wrapped up so much in the story so far  namely the acting, character development, great cinematography, mood and score  I would say this is where the movie really begins: with the introduction of Pfeiffer's Laura. She was stunning and breathtaking with her looks and character intensity  but she only enhanced the already brilliant movie.Single-minded Laura feels Will would be attracted to her, but here Will shows his true "good-guy" antics by stating he couldn't possibly be: he's married. She's enormously impressed, as anyone would be these days.But, nevertheless, Will's wife is caught both without clothes and with the new and upcoming, job-stealing Swinton (Spader) due to power, youth, whatever and this leaves the door for the romance and cat'n'mousing to begin between Will and Laura.This is all incidental to what the movie's all about: Will's wolf-man transformation. Notice how I didn't say werewolf here, because even though that's basically what it is, they never  brilliantly, I might add  mention that.Probably because he really is turning into a wolf. And for anyone that really knows me, that's not my favorite type of werewolf movie, where a man becomes, basically, a dog. This is sole man-turns-into-a-dog movie that I like and it happens to be my second favorite werewolf movie, behind The Howling. Why?Well, for one, it contains plenty of exciting and low-graphic "wolf-man" scenes when Will runs amok. I say low-graphic (or toned down FX) as if it was Director Nichols's intention to focus more on story than fur, and I thought that was a splendid idea. (Also, I think I remember Nicholson saying way back during promotion of this film: why add more hair to someone who already has a lot of it  or something like that.)Another reason Wolf ranks so high is the intrigue, the acting, the story, the feel/mood, the everything was so powerful and you get so wrapped up in the surroundings, you don't really need to see a man walking around with more hair than Zach Galifianakis.And finally, you'll get your fill with a (spoiler) wolf-on-wolf UFC grand finale. That, in combination with the night stalking bits, was enough to satisfy me in regards to the man-beast I grew up with.Barely a flaw was in Wolf. Spader might have been a little over-the-top and clichéd, but thanks to him (and a little bit from Nelligan,) Nicholson shined in spades. He was so amazing in his scenes, especially when barely a word was spoken. And even when they were (Tequila!), he was equally as enthralling, entertaining and humorous.If you like the old classics, here's a gem of homage. SEE IT!
I have a disclaimer: I've never read the source material  the "True Grit" book, I'm not into westerns and I have never seen the original True Grit, or any John Wayne westerns to boot.Okay, that's actually three disclaimers. Or four? At least, I can safely say, I came into 2010's True Grit with an open mind.My observations: great acting from the little girl  isn't that always the case? (SEE: Let the Right One In, Kick-Ass) And despite me hardly understanding half of what Jeff Bridges says in the movie (possibly my bad, but still) he did a good job as well.The movie on a whole: it was interesting. Opened some doors, but seriouslyit's nothing new. Remember, I haven't even seen the original and know this wasn't hardly original in its own right. Revenge? Check. Revenge in a western? Check. Causalities/pain and learning along the way? Check again.This is an opinion piece, so I have every right to state what I viewed. I understand what they did for realism: the (probably tobacco-filled) voice of Bridges as Rooster was distracting. The endless night/TOO-DARK shots where we couldn't see anything was annoying. And the overall slow scenes where we knew they were headed was tedious.Sure, this is gathering some good buzz, probably on the girl's (Hailee Steinfeld) performance and the fact it's another Coen Brother's film. Personally, I watched it for three reasons: Coens, Bridges and the buzz. But, honestly, I felt it was one of the weakest Coens efforts, it was a ho-hum Bridges and doesn't deserve the buzz it got.Mattie Ross (Steinfeld) is a little lawyer-threatening girl who lost her father to Chaney (Brolin) and wants to hire the best to track him, in this case, drunk & washed up marshal Rooster Cogburn (Bridges.) After several attempts and many scenes, he agrees and off they go and eventually meet up with rival bounty hunter/Texan Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who wants to bring justice when all Ross wants is blood.Overall, the movie kept my interestto a minimum. It's obvious how it's supposed to play out  SCENE BY SCENE, so I was hoping to get more insight into the characters along the way. Bridges did a fine job of his character development, even though it was seen from a mile away.AGAINI'm not into westerns, but the few I've seen, I've actually really loved: Unforgiven, Open Range, Wyatt Earp, Brokeback Mountain and the number one: Dances with Wolves. Those five I've mentioned aren't the only westerns I've seen, but they are the best I've seen and they left such an impact on me, I had to pause after each movie was over to digest the powerful films and experiences I just had. True Grit literally did nothing for me. That's not to say it was a bad film, it just added absolutely nothing to my life.
Ouch.Though it doesn't prove to be Wes Craven's worst film (14 years strong, 'The People under the Stairs' still holds that title), it's pretty damn close. I would have stuck with the original working title, "Cursed: Teen Wolf Three."Granted, they did show the beast (something they barely did in the highly superior 'Ginger Snaps') however the 'Van Helsing's wolf-man/teddy bear was far more unique and frightening.Since I apparently can't count past 59, I stopped counting the flaws about half-way through. But then couldn't help myself in the latter part, including the chick that apparently turned into the wolf at the party, shredding her clothes, and then turned back, got new clothes, and then shred those too.Also, when she died (which according to this movie's legend, she couldn't have been killed that way -- but let's skip over that obvious flaw) she was facing upward as the dead werewolf, but in fetal position when they found her nude human form.Don't even get me started on the werewolf giving them the birdie. Ouch. Or the entire motivation for the killer werewolf just bent on getting Joshua Jackson all to herself. On the flip-side.. I really can't blame her; I probably would have done something similar. He was a perk for the movie, but only for eye-candy. At first, of course I was offended by the homophobic lines these assholes were saying, but after the 2nd or 3rd scene, I was waiting for the wrestling captain to come out.Watching this movie, made me want to recommend Ginger Snaps (1, 2 or 3), Wolf, or my personal favorite The Howling, to all my friends.And if they ask me about Cursed, I'll recommend Ginger Snaps (1, 2 or 3), Wolf, or my personal favorite The Howling.
Whether you call this a 'Goosebumps' episode or Stephen King-lite, 'Silver Bullet' seems to be a kiddies' version of the classic werewolf tale. What I liked most about this is: the "stand-up" werewolf vs. the man who actually turns into a four-legged wolf and the transformation vs. today's CGI laugh-out-loud werewolves. As much as I love the classic horror icon, too many in the past decade have made me roar with laughter vs. actually being scared. For example, 'Van Helsing' and the 'Underworld' films made me snicker. Sure, 'Bullet's effects left a lot to be desired with the minute budget they had, but I'd take a real transformation than a 100 mph blur of a computer "effect." Unfortunately, that's the only positives about this bargain basement "horror" feature. In a town where apparently a full-moon appears for four straight nights, kids come up with the theory of a werewolf without first any physical evidence and a town lynch-mobs the woods in that typical fog because they're scared only to completely forget about it the next day and it's business as usual. But wait! Speed-racer wheelchair-bound Haim who can scale trees and walls in seconds is onto the beast and knows when the beast will be onto him. Unfortunately, like the laughable four straight full moon nights, the whole movie seemed rushed and even with the knowledge that the source material ('Cycle of the Werewolf') is just a novelette, I still think there would be tons of more substance. Hopefully, at least, for the third act as this one was approximately five minutes and almost completely unsatisfying. Though basically harmless and made for a 1985 audience, aside from some language and a tiny bit gore, this might as well be PG or worse: a made-for-TV SyFy channel sweeps event movie.
I think the harshest thing I could say about the latest Pixar adventure, or Toy Story movie, for that matter, is even attempting to determine with Toy Story film is the best.How Pixar does it blows my mind. Time and again. Sure, they start with what I consider the number one quality of any movie: story. Character depth and development ranks second for me. Despite all my male-counterparts that simply love action, things blowing up, beautiful women (or people,) etc., fall behind  far behind  the front two. Toy Story 3 has all qualities needed to make a fantastic, adventurous and successful movie for tons of people of all creeds. But it puts both of my favorite staples first: excellent story with (yes, even animated) deep characters. And it's a lot of fun to boot.Starting off with a literal bang, Toy Story 3 sets the scene early that these "Toys of Owner Andy" love to be played with. It's what they were made for, what they yearn for and it gives them hope and a soul. Unfortunately for them, like the expiration on food, (yes, even Twinkies, thanks Zombieland) kids grow up and out of toys.Will Andy be faithful, keeping his prized Buzz Lightyear (Allen,) Woody (Hanks) or (most of) the rest of his toys, ones adults like me grew up with in Toy Story and Toy Story 2? Kinda.As in usual Toy Story fashion, there are mishaps and the adventure begins! Follow the toy crusaders from this point on from Andy's house to the curb, from the day care of hell to new child's house and so on.I would hate to even divulge in more of the secrets, twists, turns, comedy (and I mean roll on floor laughing humor), suspense or ideas presented. I can't imagine even some movie-goers on the fence that actually "have to decide" to see it.As equally tough as it would be to rank all Pixar movies  though, I plan to  and rank these Toy Story movies in order, it would be equally hard to pinpoint the best parts of Toy Story 3, aside from to aforementioned great script and characters. But, I'll try.I loved the monkey! Though brief, I laughed so hard every second he was on screen. Furthermore, I loved the other new characters, especially Mr. Pricklepants (Dalton.) I loved the intro. I loved the plan of escape. I loved the Ken "secret" references. I loved the español. I loved the comity (as found in the other Toy Story movies, but I would say it's most evident in this feature) between the leads, as well as newcomers. I loved the extreme attention to detail, the crispness of the film and the cinematography while never forgetting this is a cartoon. (And to add to that, by far, the graphics and technology has tripled this time around, even though the previous groundbreaking entries were still way above par.) I loved the overall comedy, including the tongue-in-cheek jokes. (I actually found myself laughing hard and out loud at some of the under-the-radar jokes that apparently no one else either caught or cared for. It was a tough and somewhat quiet crowd around me  aside from the annoying and crying kids and their equally inattentive guardians who don't know how to muffle their kids.) I love that as well created and designed it is, this could very well be a stand-alone feature, though it helps to see the first two and it does play homage to fans of the other Toy Story movies. So much so, it's hard NOT to get choked up in the finale, if you can make it that far without getting somewhat emotional.That's just a short list. There's so much wonder and awe and it's jaw dropping that Pixar, or the returning voice talent/actors could pull this offagain. But they did. It's highly recommended, and I would say to see it on IMAX 3-D for the quality and grand scale  like I did, but Disney STILL has yet to shock me with their "version" of 3-D. I was blown away during the 3-D in Monsters Vs. Aliens, but here, like in Up, it was so-so. Thankfully, Pixar does know how NOT to rely on 3-D as a gimmick. They spend their money on the talent to create everlasting stories, fun and adventures.Side Note: The preceding animated short, one I always look forward to prior to any Pixar film, Day & Night, was pretty good, and inventive, but not great. At least it featured Vegas.
In a shorten work week's timeframe, a friend recommended The Big Chill two times. In both incidents, the reason he stated it was good was because it was the best role he's seen from Kevin Costner.Spoiler alert, Kevin Costner's Alex is dead prior to the movie's opening and pretty much all we see of Costner is his surgically sewn up wrists obviously showing the cause of death. Damn, my friend must really hate Costner.But, that's not the whole reason he liked it, and I can see why.The "takes-place-over-a-weekend" movie reunites long-distant friends of the past after said Alex takes his life. During this talkative and exploring one's feelings weekend, there's a bunch of drug usage, alcohol consumption, sexual exploring, hot topics (of the 1983 era, that is) and some of the most wittiest dialogue and revolutions I've heard.That's pretty much the basic premise but listening to them isn't so basic. The script still seems fresh today, almost 30-years later and this is the first time I've experienced it. It helps most of the fantastic humor comes from Jeff Goldblum, whom I've always adored and found hilarious. But, that's not to take away from the other all-stars, a pre-2001's-Ocean's Eleven collage of actors, if you will.Both Kevin Kline and William Hurt  another couple of actors I admire, did great, Meg Tilly was fantastic in her character's shoes and an all-time favorite of mine, Glenn Close, who appeared to have the most depth of all the characters combined, did excellent. An honorable mention goes to an actor whom I never got into, but did a surprisingly good job: Tom Berenger. Again, this is not to say the remaining cast wasn't great and they did their jobs accordingly.So, we have these old friends together again, following a very bad incident and let's watch them learn, explore, communicate, attempt to work things out and learn from this. It's a deliberately paced film and felt real. These actors and this script felt genuine. And damn what a kickass soundtrack! (I can't forget that positive.)It's a high recommendation, especially to those who've lost someone close to such a tragedy.** - Yeah, I'm not going into my own feelings of suicide, because, mercifully, I haven't lost someone close to this kind of end. I don't feel its right to judge someone's decision on it and I will honestly conclude my feelings with the aforementioned word used: tragedy. It is one, above all else, regardless if I was or was not within reach of someone taking their own life.
The Visitor is to Richard Jenkins as Lost in Translation is to Bill Murray, even though Murray's more famous. Still, this was Jenkins's best work to date in his long distinguished, mostly unknown career. And both play relatively a character in the same league: past middle age, lonely, lost and in need of a wakeup call before it's too late.Jenkins stars as college professor Walter Vale who's just there. Literally, just going through the motions. He's working on his fourth novel, teaching one class, lives alone and like it or not (we'll say not) he'd remain alone. It's obvious there's a lot more to his background and some of it's revealed throughout. I don't think that was the point.The plot reveals itself when he's summed from his home & job in Connecticut to speak on a paper he may/may not have written in New York City. There he has an long-since vacant apartment he owns and inside he's ambushed by, I guess squatters. Only, they were duped into thinking they were legally subletting the place.The enormously quiet and standoffish Walter changes course and is slightly awaken by the strangers in his home: two Muslims and partners, Tarek (Sleinman) & Zainab (Gurira.) Though Tarek is humbled by being there unannounced, his girlfriend, Zainab is very weary and standoffish herself.Something is sparked within Walter from their meeting, though you can barely notice it in Jenkins's superb acting. He invites them to continue their stay there, and though Walter is still mildly quiet, his mannerisms, gestures and few words show both an interest in them and their wellbeing. In fact, Tarek, plays the African drums and Walter wants to learn.Tarek and Walter hit it off and the two become close, despite Zainab's suspicions. The twist/turn comes when Tarek gets arrested for, what I suspect is either stealing a subway ride, being racially profiled or both. Again, with the excellent performance from Jenkins, you can tell that spark that has now grown to the size of a baseball inside starts to flicker and he's deeply saddened by the withdrawal of his only friend for years, if not decades.The rest of the story involves his attempts to get Tarek out  he's being held as an illegal immigrant, Tarek's very concerned mother coming to help and Walter's dealing with sinking backwards or using his short time with Tarek to make that spark a flame.There's more, but I've already revealed a lot. The movie is wonderful, but isn't for everyone; The Visitor is the epitome of slow movies, and its equally realistic  you shouldn't expect every next scene to be "the BIG shocking and DRAMATIC turn." The movie's real and thoroughly enjoyable, if not for Walter, for his relationships with the rest of the crew.I would say I would recommend it, though, to be honest, it didn't grab me or twist me emotional at the end, where I thought it should've. Perhaps because I haven't dealt with the immigration issue firsthand. Nevertheless, I did like it enough to continue through to the end, probably because I'm a sucker for stories about quiet, soulless characters who walk around as shells of the people they were and someone or thing pulls them back from the Abyss.
Breaking news: Bill Maher is still with us! In 2008, he voiced his opinion(s) about the multiple defects in religions in a documentary/mockumentary/comedy called Religulous. And yet, he's still with us.Local film critic/blogger Steve Reeves has this to say: "Oh, thank God!"With the increased tensions in the battle of lands, territories, political parties, books, words and drunken debates, it seemed unlikely that someone, some comedic commentator would not be assassinated baffles experts."Well, anyone with an opinion, like myself  I am a critic, after all  is subject to revolt or being called an infidel," said Reeves in an exclusive interview. "And Billy flat out insulted these so-called 'Top Ranking Officials' during his interviews."Maher, who was unable to be reached for this story and apparently never goes by the name "Billy," did manage to get a number of clips for his search for the truth in Religulous. According to sources, or Reeves, Maher got all angles for the right, left, up, down peoples of faith to prove that no one really has the answers."It's only based on their particular faith," Reeves said in between bites of pizza. "I'm a Christian myselfand I would like you to print that. You will, won't you? I want that on record. Oh, you're taping this? Good. Well, I can honestly say: 'I was not offended.' For, I grew up questioning everything and anything. My dad used to get mad at me, even spank me, for the simple two-word question: 'What if?' Meaning, what if I didn't do as you asked, etcetera. Even though I still believed in Christ, I still questioned a lot of my own religion to make sure I understood it and could stand for it."Reeves, following his now-cold pizza after that long-winded explanation, went further to say (and we'll sum it up for lack of space here) that Maher clearly and utterly pointed out the inconsistencies within each religion and the surprisingly similarities between the "troops.""The movie was hilarious," commented Reeves who moved onto beer, we're guessing for desert. "I laughed from the moment the movie started to the end. His dry and under-the-radar humor had me rolling. I mean, he flat out mocked these subjects and simultaneously proved they weren't sure in their own convictions."Whether Maher was right or not, he wasn't given enough facts or evidence to follow any of the different religions portrayed here. In recent nonscientific polls, it was revealed that 50% believed in God, 50% in the possibility of God and another 50% in the Book of (fill in the blank.) In all, it's proved here, that we're our own worst enemy and not getting along with each other will lead to more death, destruction and the downfall of the only "intelligent" species on this Blue/Green (pick an environmental group to decide which) Planet.Maher may have not solved the problem and most agree it won't be until Star Trek actually happens. (Source: Scientologists.) But, he did bring to light that being blind isn't fashionable and in the most comical way. So says the only interviewee we could get for this story."If your faith is strong, your conviction in your God is unbreakable, then this will not detour you," says Reeves who now is liking water so he can stay awake until the end of his interview. "I was rolling from minute one to the end. It's sad how we're so against each other, when we can never, ever agree to disagree. God doesn't care about religions or denominations. And I highly doubt He is still speaking to people about killing each other. That's pre-Christ days. Anything people tell you, such as "God told me to kill my kids in my Geo Metro in the local pond!" was surely misled by the evil one. I'm sure Billy will agree: The Golden Rule should be the number one process we follow. I believe even Rodney King would agree."Reeves went on for another half hour and was cut short when he proclaimed he was in the (movie) industry and we could not verify that. What was confirmed was that this movie was absolutely amusing, even though, sadly, not much will be resolved despite. "They say" that it's up to us to get along, so says Rodney King, but it's unlikely with further bigotry passed down from parent to child."Are we still on?

I watched The Next Three Days many moons ago, probably a couple of years and it was one of those movies I instantly gave 5/5 stars. And I loved it so much I bought it after only that one viewing several years back on BluRay once on sale a couple of months ago.With only my second viewing, now on BluRay, of course, I still love it tremendously, though it just barely inched  and I mean minutely  down to 4½/5 stars. That's not to say there was a lot wrong with it; it's still a fantastic film that I believe many have never heard of. Too bad.I guess one thing that irked me when watching, and this might very well be my player settings, is the dialogue's sound is very low. I constantly had to turn up the volume to hear the lines and immediately reduce volume for an exciting scene that follows. (This was so not to disturb the other member of the household.) Again, that might not be the film's fault, perhaps my BluRay settings, but still it was annoying, especially when the dialogue here is so rich. Namely from Russell Crowe's John Brennan character.Both "John" and Russell make up a big chunk of why I loved this film. The premise is great, the score, cinematography, secondary characters, acting and, as stated, the dialogue are all so very nice too, but the acting and character from Russell was so splendid, I can't wait to see this again for a third time.John's wife Lara is accused of murdering her boss and arrested. John loves Lara more than his own life oranything. Period. (Words don't need to state this; Crowe absolutely shows this with every second he's on screen.) He does not believe she committed murder and fights tooth and nail to appeal and appeal all the way up to right before the Supreme Court. There, he hits a road block and finds no other way to set her free than to break her out.While I loved the movie up to this point tremendously anyways, this is where the movie elevates even more. We need to put ourselves into John's shoes. Given most of us are not gifted with prison break or law-breaking qualities, we journey right alongside complete amateur John and how he has ups and downs with his quest to learn how to not only break someone out of prison, but even how to shoot a gun. Oh, and "ups and downs" is putting it very mildly.John learns. John raises money, plots and asks the right questions. But he fails, and fails hard at spots.This movie couldn't be more realistic in what would happen if some layperson so biased and narrow-sighted would try and break someone out of jail. Granted, and I think this fits slightly in my drop from 5 to 4½ star rating, there were a few coincidences and way-out there moments that I barely bought. Nevertheless, the movie is suspenseful from the beginning to the end and you're right there with John the whole time.This movie is so incredibly rich and enjoyable, it never once crosses your mind that breaking someone out of prison is wrong.If you have not seen this, you should absolutely get your hands on it. Crowe's performance (and, again, character) should be enough to make you love this. I rarely suggest buying a movie, on any format, without seeing it. This is one of those.And then, trust me: you'll want to see it many more times over The Next Three Days.
You know, a lot of my friends and work peers think I'm too hard on the movies. Too negative. That I don't just sit back, leave my brain at the door and enjoy the movie, because, you must realize, they've never hated a movie or had a bad experience at the cinema, ever. If they ran their own review site, they'd rate every single movie as 5/5 stars and you know what? They would be the studio's best friend and probably appear on more than a dozen movie posters with their stinking thumbs up. Despite all that, perhaps I might agree with them a little; perhaps it's time to lighten up a bit.So, I watched The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard and I have to say: why start disappointing my fans now? This movie sucked. It had such talent at hand, so many (enormously missed) opportunities for humor and the number one (Jeremy "Ari Gold" Piven) person to pull off the ultimate sale, not just for the poor car-customers in the movie, but to the audience that this movie is worth its ticket price. Not only could he sell an ice cube to a South Park character in hell, he couldn't even get into the top 5 for its opening box office weekend.We have somewhat smooth talking Don (Piven) leading a sales team from town-to-town to reenergize failing car dealerships, and since you know he never thinks about settling down, you then know exactly where this movie is headed.He lands in a no-nothing town in California, falls for an already spoken for daughter and works the closeted father into selling all cars on the lot in order to save the family-run business. Yes, that's right; they actually used a 1970s sitcom idea (mostly used in The Brady Bunch) for the entire movie.In this economy, say for the past 4 years, this should've been the ideal escapism. Again, they had tremendous opportunities for laughs, and went for either the obvious, juvenile humor or just let the moment pass with my mouth agape at the wasted scene. In addition, the fully booked cast, most of the regulars from movies like The Hangover mostly stood around and looked like they were improvising everything since they basically had no script to go by.I will admit, there were a few small laughs  mostly with Ferrell's cameo, but with what could've been PIven's huge break-through into starring roles  this role was made for him!!  even he looked bored. Or anxious to leave the lot and go back to HBO.Skip it. I'd almost rather have the used-car dealer lie to me than attempt to make me laugh.
Perhaps, it was me, but damn, The Dark Half, one of the very few Stephen King film adaptations I hadn't seen until now, was so hard to get into. The story about a boy who had another boy living in his head  literally, began to make less and less sense as the movie progressed. Worse, the movie was sooo long.Now, I do own this book and, though I hadn't read that yet, it'll probably piece together some of the holes I couldn't follow. But, this movie did not encourage me to pick up Stephen King's novel any time soon.The movie was delayed in my viewing because, well, I am not a Timothy Hutton fan. Knowing he's playing a duel role, didn't add to the excitement I should've had for this. But, since it's October, I figured I'd finally see what this was all about 20 years after its release.From what I can recall, and forgive  it's been a couple of days, a boy's writing leads to headaches and mystical sounds of birds. Upon further examination, there was a twin lodged in his brain. We are to believe the second child, the "dark half" twin had been extracted and disposed of. Fast forward many years, and that boy, Thad (Hutton,) has grown up, married, had twins of his own and is a writer. Of course, in King fashion and true life, Thad has an alternative and secret name he writes under, darker stuff. Stuff that sells.But, when the idea to "kill" off this other penned name to avoid a blackmail subplot, all hell breaks loose. This "George Stark/Dark Half" writer doesn't want to "die," so he kills people and (inadvertently or not) pins the murders on Thad.Where I had a problem was: was this George a split personality? Or a ghost, or made up/made real being? Or, a grown up version of that twin in the brain that was supposed to be disposed of? That last one is the farthest stretch, and yeah, even more than a ghost. For, the twin in the brain was just an eyeball and cavity-infested teeth. Take that out, and in the 1960s, I doubt they could've reconstructed, somehow, the whole male.As I began this review, I stated this is perhaps this is my fault. Perhaps, my mind was elsewhere and it was hard to concentrate. It was over two hours and not well paced, after all. But, if this movie was interesting enough, I'm sure it would've engaged me away from real life. Sadly, it was not.* * * Final thoughts: Not recommended. Maybe read the book. I'm sure that's a ton better and there's no Hutton there.
(Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointCheers.)I'm one of the few that liked Another Earth. Oh, Heaven knows, it wasn't perfect and had a unique storyline that barely went anywhere  I'm referring to the girl/guy plot. The other "main idea" of the alternative universe was such a backdrop, it was almost as if they had such an incredibly limited budget  which is probably true  that they couldn't focus too much on that. It's a slow moving fare of lost/found heartbreak and believe it, it's worth watching. But, following, you should see the somewhat similar, and HIGHLY SUPERIOR: Melancholia.
Okaymaybe it was the BluRay of Dr. No that made this almost 60-year old look gorgeous. I mean, the cinematography, landscapes, scenery and sets looked crisp and grand. And luckily, we had that to look at during the incredibly long and uninteresting pauses between action, dialogue and plot advancement.Even though this is my first time ever seeing the original theatrical released James Bond feature, Dr. No, it's probably unfair to review it now, even though I'm prepping for the 23rd Bond film later this year. I mean, the way movies were made back then, the tolerance of the audience for spy/action movies and element of surprise was probably wholeheartedly different than 2012, but dang was I bored for the most part.And what's with all the numerous expendable bad guys being either wimps or incredibly stupid? Again, it's probably just the timeframe this was made. So, I give this a little bit of slack.What I won't discount is the pacing. I've seen plenty of movies prior to the 1960s that were well paced and quick and to-the-point. This one seemed to drag on while James Bond, the anti-secret-identity super-spy, basically put the pieces of the puzzle together at ease.The plot involves some spies being killed and Bond, James Bond (the Smirking Sean Connery) is called in to investigate at a snail's pace. Along the way, he meets Americans on his side, Boat Captains who call him Captain and Girls on beaches with funny names. Eventually he meets the (non-Asian) Asian title character, Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) who is, surprisingly, a more interesting character than Bond himself.Honestly, the original Bond movies  and I'm referring to anything before Timothy Dalton, aren't my bag, baby. They're enormously dated and not of my generation of "I Want it NOW." I didn't hate on this  again, I loved the cinematography and it wasn't a bad movie, per se, but I couldn't tolerate the unedited scenes of drawn-out blankness.Sorry, chaps, this "original" spy movie is ONLY good for those who grew up in this era and have already seen this during that time. For anyone born, say, in the 1970s on up, this isn't for them. Or me.(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the "odd one out": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)
(Update  6/15/13, Second Viewing: Superman soars from 4/5 stars to 5/5. Gone were any of the flaws I listed below. A lot more is explained with the second viewing. Everything clearer. The heroism portrayed was refreshing because people who did heroic acts in this movie did them because they needed to be done  not because they wanted to be a hero or heroic. The movie isn't perfect, but it's damn close and I am glad for this second viewing to prove this movie is much better than I originally saw it. Solid 5/5 Stars. Now, here's my original review below, unedited)From the relatively quick Krypton opening, Man of Steel quickly gets to the goods and, like 1989's Batman, it saves us from the rehash of the Smallville chronicles and just provides the necessary flashbacks that made Clark who he will become. I mean, really. Smallville was on for 10 TV seasons. If you wanted to see that, spent that much time in front of the TV. This is a Superman movie!Butit's not the Superman you or I grew up and loved. This is new, fresh, exciting and more real than ever before. There was so much good that was added, altered and enhanced that I embraced every change including one MAJOR modification that I will not ethically spoil.Now, this is not all to say we need to forget the silliness  okay, OVER-comical previous films. If you want to see that, simply watch them. This is a brand new vision of my all-time favorite superhero and after watching the previous entries countless times, it was absolutely breathtaking to see such a new twist and explore a new avenue never been done before.In 2006, Superman Returns simply continued the storyline from Superman II (yeah, it told you to forget III and IV ever existed, and for the most part, most people had, even without Returns.) Returns used the same characters, the same campiness, the same music, the same Kryptonite and even a guy who looked and acted exactly like the late and great Christopher Reeve.And that's all well and good. It's also good that was the end of that saga. Much like what happened to The Dark Knight Trilogy's mythology. Hopefully.I didn't know what to expect here. More of the same, i.e. reboot but with all the same themes and the same Superman and his morals? No. This couldn't have been further from the old series.I loved Henry Cavill as Superman/Kal-El/Clark. (Oops, sorry, spoiler there. Duh.) I loved his depth, his convictions and his imperfections. I love that he is NOT the Christopher Reeve version of the last son of Krypton. And just to clarify, I love both versions of Superman. Nicely, now I can choose which I would like to watch once this hits home video and I need my Supe-fix.You may think you know the story of Kal-El, but all that remains is that Krypton does fall, General Zod & Friends are banished and imprisoned and baby Kal does end up with the Kents in Kansas. From thereIt's a whole new world.Clark's trying to find himself, his way, his future and his past. Along his journey, he does meet up with Lois and she's as equally altered as is this version of the Man of Steel. Simultaneously, that nasty Zod gang does make their way to Earth and has some things up their sleeves.Will "Superman"  or so they call him  rise to the occasion and prove himself as a world-class hero? You think you know the answer?The movie had incredible graphics, wonderful flying sequences, great sound, decent score and the acting is believable from all fronts. Butnow that all my praise is out there, the movie isn't perfect by any means. Number one, the writing is offquite a bit at times. So much so, it will be probably my inevitable second viewing before I can piece together all that was wrong with it. They do throw quite a bunch at you to distract you from any script problems. Also, it didn't help that my 3D-glasses were a bit scratched. Luckily, I didn't find the 3-D all that great, so my next viewings will be cheaper as I hang those glasses up.In addition to the sometimes poor writing, is the sketchy editing and perhaps too many flashbacks to the point it's hard to decipher past and present. I mean, I don't believe Martha Kent aged a bit in 30 years! (If she was real, she might consider that a compliment, untilshe realizes I meant she looked ancient back then and still does in present day.)There is far more to love in this movie than those points of criticism. Personally, I was so wrapped up in the newness and fresh aspect  even though I grew up knowing Superman one (completely different) way  that even when I knew there were script issues, I didn't care. I loved the new Superman, the new direction and can't wait to see where this is headed.The incredible action also helped in my fun time. After the comedy Iron Man 3, it's nice to put the action back into the original Action Comic.
I'd be lying if I said anything other than putting of watching The Invention of Lying wasn't anything but laziness. And I am so, so sorry I didn't see it sooner.This movie was fantastic, and the first viewing of Ricky for me. I think maybe that's not true  I think he did one Simpsons episode, but that's it. Never seen (yet) his other movies, The Office UK or anything else. I'm hooked. He made me laugh and think at the same.No, not think about joining the atheist club. If he truly believes that in real life, like I think I read somewhere, so be it. This movie wouldn't change my mind even if I was on the fence. It did make me want to go out rent or to the theater for anything else he does.In the same year as Yes Man, this one had somewhat of a similar (okay, long shot, but in same field) premise: No one can lie. So much so, they never speak the word "truth" or "lie" because they don't know anything different. (By the way, I loved that aspect of the movie  the fact they NEVER say those words.) And ironically, the movie begins and continues in brutal honesty. It grabbed me from the opening, and kept me going where I literally had to pause and think and then laugh hard. It's been a long time since I wanted to re-watch a movie almost immediately after the first viewing.Ricky plays Mark a loser, or as everyone would agree due to his family history and his own appearance. He is infatuated with Anna (Garner) but she truthfully tells him he doesn't have a shot because she's worried about the future of little Rickies running around. Depressed about his life, job and girl-lost, he actually comes up with the world's first untruth. I had no idea how that scene (at the bank) would play out and when finished I was laughing out loud and then throughout the rest of the movie. In fact, unlike my normal movie-watching experiences, I didn't want it to end.Unfortunately, for him, at least, there's always consequences, much like Bruce Almighty (one of many movies this film resembles) and he has to decide when to cut loose with a fib or plow through. He actually learns (for the first human in this movie's realm) when it's right or wrong to tell something that not is.Depression sets in, naturally when you are doing something wrong and he desperately wants to correct wrongs and win the girl. She, on the other hand, has to do the same  but it's the reality that has been taught to her since birth.What I like most about movies begins with the script. It has to surprise me, warm me and remind me, though there's "nothing new under the sun," there's always a new twist on life, or reality. I spark on originality and though a movie could turn out how you think it will, as long as it does in a clever way, I am impressed and will rate higher. This movie blew me away. It showed me a lot of things (another aspect of movies I crave) including that you don't have to be 100% honest or deceitful.Much like another favorite comedy of mine, Liar, Liar, you don't necessarily have to tell the whole truth, but you don't have to be lying about it either. There is a middle ground without committing a sin against "the Man in the Sky." Instead of blatantly telling someone they're unattractive to a third party, you can truthfully say that you're not attracted to them, or they're not you're type.The other aspect I cherished from this is judgments. Of which, there are many comments made on the exterior of people. Whether or not Gervais was trying to jam his views down the audience's throat, he's right were people make decisions on the class of people. It's true and sad.Personally, I am glad to live in a time where the majority if not 99% of the people I encounter make few judgments against skin color, bank role or sexuality. I know racism, judgments and homophobia exists  I'm not blind, but I am glad that more and more people are becoming more open-minded, in addition to allowing people (who don't harm another) to live their lives.Back to the movie and off my pedestal. It's fantastic. I can't wait to see it again. I can understand if someone doesn't want to see this as it may be perceived as "anti-God." Only one statement in the movie states that God (or the "Man in the Sky") doesn't exist, and that comes from Ricky. Characters in the movie (the fictional/alternate-reality movie, I should say) have been known to be wrong and it's proved that people, despite their single ability to tell the truth, can be wrong.I solely recommend this movie. Listen to all the lines, namely from Ricky and Jennifer, even Tina Fey and Rob Lowe (who's character reminded me a lot of his Wayne's World days.) In the name of the man in the sky, you should see this movie.
Batman's a murderer. There's no getting around that. He literally killed someone. And Batmanjustdoesnotdothat.I'm revisiting some of my favorite 90s movies for a special series, and to be honest, I was thoroughly looking forward to this (unknown number)th viewing of Batman Returns. It's a real "summer" release, it contains Selina Kyle  an awesome Catwoman and the original and still best Batman  Michael Keaton along with the wonderful Tim Burton. So why would I only rate it 5/10 stars?Well, the story sucks. Really it does. Where the cinematography is awesome  PURE Burton  as is PURE Pfeiffer as Catwoman, the movie sags with the broken story. And it was the start of the original Batman franchise: More is more. Let's add more characters! That'll spruce it up. (Not really, but they thought so, all the way to Batman & Robin) Let's offer a suggestion: Pitch the Penguin (DeVito.) Keep but tone down Shreck (Walken.) And re-write the finale.Of the original four Batman movies, two directed by Tim Burton, two by Schumacher, this one is the one that's a direct sequel, whereas they flat-out mention events/characters from the previous installment. It's some time since the events where Joker (Nicholson) died in #1, and Batman's been waiting and now respected by (the now elusive) Commissioner Gordon (Hingle.) A new gang's in town, led by the Penguin who has an agenda.The Penguin's kinda, sorta controlled by Millionaire Max Screck who both wants to promote Penguin to Mayor and has a somewhat dead, but devious nonetheless, secretary Selina Kyle who becomes Catwoman when she falls to the felines around her and then she falls further for Batman and/or Bruce Wayne, who's struggling dual identities, still sinceMy head is spinning, and that's thanks to screenplay writer Daniel Waters. There's more and that's just too much. And that's, well, too much in a movie that could've been a contender. It's a beautifully shot film, despite being a cross between typical Burton and Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses oddly enough.The movie starts off promising. It has that summer movie feel, regardless of the "Christmas" theme, in addition to a bloody fun Comic-Book movie feel, but surely sinks into over-plot'ness with too many angles. So many, that no wonder both Burton and Keaton refused part III. And it ends on such an outrageous finale, things that Batman would not surely do, that you wonder if they had an inkling of how to end the movie.And does everyone bypass the fact that Batman actually killed someone? Intentionally?! Spoiler alert or not, Batman attaches a bomb to a bad clown figure and pushes him down a shaft where he explodes. Not a thought goes into this scene, nor repercussions. Surely, Christopher Nolan would've explore Batman being hunted for murder.This all said, I still do rank it upwards to five out of 10 stars for the fantastic score  possibly the best score of all (so far) six movies, the best song  Face to Face by Siouxsie and the Banshees, the best baddie: Pfeiffer's Catwoman was simply delicious and one of her all-time best roles and the overall look of the sets and cinematography was superb.Despite all that's wrong with the picture, it's worth a shot for some good lines, Pfeiffer and Burton's vision. Get past the spotty story and the fact Batman would NEVER kill someone, and you have the only worthwhile sequel to the classic and original Batman.
If the original Cube had its flaws, Cube 2: Hypercube had them in spades. That's not to say it was a bad movie, per se, but it's definitely a step in the wrong direction.Going back to part one, if you were to truly believe that some entity, or government, could produce as many people working together, but never knowing what the left or right hand is doing all the while having enough cash to make such an incredible structure  get this, for experiments, at least one could buy the fact, though all but preposterous, it still could happen. Here, I'm guessing the writer in Part 2 felt it necessary to take the movie to the next step, the next level. Unfortunately, all realism or reality is thrown out and the new cast of nobody victims might as well have been dropped in Toontown.Just as before, victims wake in square rooms, now all the same color and with brightly lit walls and they meet each other one by one. Each one must rely on each other to escape the imprisonment of being an unwilling participant in some huge experiment involving isolation, working together and I'm guessing stamina. Only difference this time, is they're in some fourth dimension where people can transport, time-travel, whatever, in the different rooms.One of the aspects I liked in part 1 was the fact it was scary because it could really happen. Even if one were to believe in 4-D, these are all just theories, nothing based in fact.I will say, they up'd the ante on acting and dialogue. But pretty much everything else was the same, aside from the 4-D weirdness. I did like the lead actress (Matchett.) I thought she had great stance, presence and someone to root for. The movie did go further into the reasoning behind the whole set up, kidnapping and experiment  this differs from Part 1 that left us in the dark. Even though that made it more suspenseful in the first chapter, I understand something had to be explained here in the second go-around.I would barely make a recommendation for Cube 2: Hypercube, and really only for fans of both Cube 1 and the Saw series. (This precedes that enormously grotesque series, however since I am writing this following the birth of Saw, it's a good reference.) It takes a giant leap backwards as you now have to add belief in the fourth dimensions to the fact someone could pull off such a secret "experiment."
Not only is Raiders of the Lost Ark my favorite adventure of all time  almost 20 years later, nothing has come remotely close, it is a masterpiece in film-making. That is NOT a word I use regularly, and for those who know me, know how critical I am with films. Suffice to say, I mean it when I say MASTERPIECE.Everything worked in this movie. Sound, score, acting, believability  for its subject matter, humor, suspense, cinematography, twists. Simply stated: this is a must see for all ages, all creeds, all humans.Did they even know what they had when they made the first Indiana Jones adventure? Did audiences know what once in a lifetime experience they were watching back in 1981 or take this for granted? I know I probably would have  if I had seen it in theatres at that time. (Side Note: I can't say for certain that I did or did not see this in first run theatres, I was only seven and my family barely went to one or two movies a year  if we were lucky.) The movie starts off with a bang  Dr. Indiana Jones is attempting to obtain an ancient artifact for a museum, but must first pass a series of tests, including who to trust, in 1936 South America. It's a famous opening segment accompany the famous Indy Vs. the Boulder scene and it sets the tone quickly on the adventure you're about to partake on.Only thing is, unlike many, many imitations to follow in the next couple of decades, Writer George Lucas and Director Steven Spielberg decided action and the set-pieces weren't enough. In addition to the great action/adventure and thrill rides that will take you through the climax, they focused mainly on character depth and story. Both flourished. Namely with, of course, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford.) Though Ford didn't start his career in 1977's Star Wars, he certainly began stretching his legs and made himself into an icon. An movie star people cared about. Then came 1980's The Empire Strikes Back where he flourished and added the much needed depth to his Han Solo character in the sequel. There's no question: Indiana Jones is Harrison Ford. Or is it vice versa? Ford didn't just make the cardboard adventurer based on the old movie serials one note, he breathed life into the role, beyond just having the audience care for him. They wanted to be him. I would want to be him. And as super-human as he is, Ford made sure he was still just plain human, flaws and all. Of course, he always has to come out on top, despite the odds.Beyond him, no one else, from Allen's love interest Marion to the monkey, was just one note. Sure they didn't steal the spotlight as Indy/Ford dominated, but each was just as believable and needed in their roles.After the great opening that is sure to hook even the skeptical viewer, the mystery begins involving the race to find the "lost ark," the ark that supposedly contains the original Ten Commandments that Moses stored, before those pesky Nazis get their hands on it. Classic good vs. evil.Along the way you'll be in store with romance, comedy, more adventure and action sequences and one of the greatest scores orchestrated by the great John Williams. Just as he previously breathed life into Superman in Superman: The Movie with his fantastic music, he gives the well-written Indiana Jones a soul.I understand I'm not giving this movie the proper justice with all that I could say about it, but suffice to say, this absolute classic is worth a viewing for all, including those who've already seen it. It was refreshing to see "real" movie making again for my, I don't know, 24th time, with NO CGI. Aside from the (today's) comical face melting in the finale, everything else not only works, but makes you apart of the rideof a lifetime. See it!
Previously, when initially released in 1995 and in years following, I was a huge fan of Nick of Time. I had loved Johnny Depp's straight man performance, even though in 1995, he hadn't gone all crazy-role just yet.It's been probably well over a decade since I've last seen this movie and back in the 1990s, I had seen it multiple times. Today, it somewhat holds up.I still like Johnny in a non-looney role  ironically, I think he's trying too over-the-top for his past decade roles in order to be original, and yet, it might actually be original for him to return to this kind of character. I also appreciate Christopher Walken in pretty much anything, including this and always have liked Roma Maffia. I dig that chick.The movie cannot be taken seriously and you might enjoy it a little more. I don't think they were trying for anything too heavy and as a short and tight thriller with actual decent performances (not mentioned above, but still good, was shoe-shinning Charles S. Dutton,) it's entertaining.Pre-24 days, everyday man, Gene (Depp,) travels via train with his daughter when they're approached and coerced into assassinating the Governor at a nearby hotel and rally. Basically, and the plot is basic, two parties, Walken's Mr. Smith and Maffia's Mrs. Smith are watching Gene and his daughter, respectively and separately. Gene can't go to the police because bad man Mr. Smith's got eyes everywhere and his daughter is unaware she's in danger.Oh, and he's got 90 minutes to get close to and kill the Governor, or his daughter dies. Probably him, too.On the surface  or from a distance, the premise seems exciting and thrilling. And for the most part, the ingeniousness of Gene to handle something, including a gun, that he's never had to before, was pretty entertaining. But, once watched, it does show a little bit of B-movie qualities that reminds us again: don't take this seriously.Sure, I recommend it, but if I watched it for the first time today, I probably wouldn't have seen it the many times I did back in the 1990s.
Admittedly, it's been (almost) decades since I've seen 1995's Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stallone as the title character and I've forgotten everything about it but my middling taste for it and Stallone's mangled "I am da law!" line. I have forgotten pretty much everything else about it as I only saw it once, in the theatre in first run theatres and I believe I gave it 2/5 stars.Fast forward 17 years, and the remake/reboot that never took off  sadly, is simply Dredd. Simply, as in, they cut the "Judge" out of the title. And, though I dredded to see this, I was thoroughly impressed and had a blast.Nicely cut at 95 minutes, you get all you need and no more out of a simple story of  yet, once again  the bleak future and two upstanding cops against the odds in a slum of a building.Dredd takes rookie and psychic, Anderson, out for a spin only to be trapped by Ma-Ma, who kinda, though un-hilariously, reminded me of "Mom" from Futurama by character alone, in her lair of scum and drug labs. Only, the bad guys trapped the absolute worst  to Ma-Ma, that is  "judges"/cops from the "Hall of Justice." (That probably wasn't supposed to be a funny name for their headquarters, but that, too kept my focus on another cartoon: Superfriends' own Hall of Justice.)While the story's nothing new, Lena Headey, whom I will fondly remember as Sarah Connor on TV, did fairly well as Ma-Ma, Karl Urban's Judge Dredd gave me hope for the new Robocop reboot and Olivia Thirlby's rookie Anderson was decent. Also, for such a low budget, the graphics and sets were pretty good.Oh, and lest I forget, DAMN this is one of the goriest, bloodiest, most gruesome and hardest-R movies I've seen in a long time, action or horror or any genre. Kudos to them for not making it PG-13 to draw in the crowds and swaying from their vision of the dark future, though I cannot believe it wasn't NC-17. I've seen Saw sequels that had less carnage.Now, that all said, don't expect much  it's an almost leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature and the slow-motion scenes, though nicely explained, got kind of annoying after awhile. Overall, recommended for a nice Saturday night action film.
Ah, my favorite guilty pleasure of all time and the movie I've probably seen 40 times. I loved Basic Instinct for many reasons, but number one: Catherine Tramell (Stone.) Tramell is the prime suspect in the murder of a mayor-loving, retired rock 'n' roll star Boz after its realized she's not only his lover, but she wrote a book years back on exactly how he would die. Curran (Douglas) is not only suspicious of her, but deeply falls for her, even though Tramell tells him he's her new character to be bumped off in her forthcoming novel.The movie proceeds with the investigation that goes deep into Tramell's past as well as everyone else around her and Curran. Curran also runs deep into his involvement with his suspect. People are used, victimized and played as all part of Tramell's deadly game of whodunit and who-will-do-it.It's common knowledge this movie was "controversial" for its use of a lesbian killer and a (potential) murderer bisexual by the gay community. Please. Please stop. Really? This movie is worth protesting? Would it be alright if both mentioned characters were straight and then everything's alright and everyone picketing would go home? Isn't that like a thief in a movie that happens to be played by a black male, so the NAACP goes out in full force until that character's played by anyone other than black? I think this shows all humans  gay, straight, bi, black, Asian, white, whatever  are flawed. I pity and disavow any protest these homosexuals showed.As for Tramell, I loved everything about her and Stone's portrayal. Not a second did Stone get out of character, not a second passed where she wasn't in complete and utter control of herself, her surroundings or people near or far. She was rich, incredibly smart and bored with a simple life. Also, Tramell did have a degree in psychology, but I think it was her perfect instincts to read and manipulate people (guys and gals) to exactly how she wants the situation to unfold. In conclusion, I'm raving about a super-human and omnipotent character, or girl that just wants to have fun. (She would probably win the majority of poker games if she ever would be involved in what she would probably consider too slow of a game.) Other than Tramell that ranks high (if not #1) on my favorite movie-character list of all time, I'm always a fan of Douglas. Though not his best performance, he really moved the story along and had excellent chemistry between himself and Stone.In addition, I loved the mystery, the never-ending whodunit storyline  it's been told the real killer was revealed, but I don't care, I don't want to know. It's probably the fact that I don't want Tramell to be the killer since, in my mind, that would make her even smarter as she was able to organize this gigantic ruse without even picking up an ice pick. (Okay, she did at one time, but only aimed it at actual ice.) Also, Tripplehorn (in her fabulous theatrical debut) and Dzundza were perfect in their roles. And Sarelle pegged the psychotic, jealous and angry lesbian to the tee.I could go on and on further about the different aspects of Basic Instinct I loved the most. Okay, I will. I absolutely loved the fact that aside from some minor details  such as the computer, the movie is practically timeless which is always a product of good film-making. It's now 18 years later and it's as if the movie could've been released now. Also, the score (one of my all time favorites; I've probably listened to it 600+ times) is excellent as well as the soundtrack. I loved the music played, namely in the fantastic club scene  a scene I would be completely involved in immediately following the year's release.I can't forget the gorgeous scenery and cinematography. Never a moment passed where I didn't feel I was in San Francisco or the surround areas. And those views! Those houses! And the views from the houses! Positively breathtaking. I'm sure it's no coincidence that the movie is very Hitchcockian, and it's based in San Francisco where Hitchcock loved to film.And finally, I absolutely loved the script and dialogue from everyone, but one character (obviously) stands out in my mind. Not only do I love the dialogue from Tramell, but I can practically quote her every line."I'm a writer; I use people for what I write. Let the world beware." SEE THIS MOVIE.
I really wanted to see The Company You Keep. Specifically for the vast number of Hollywood stars I adored and that I love tight-drama-thrillers. Be careful for what you wish for.This entire mess of a film isn't worth the time it takes to reach its just-past 2-hour mark. It relies heavily on aging stars (again, my favorites, but still) and young actors who rely on outdated technology and formats. Not to mention, a plot that's so out there, so convoluted, so bizarre and so much work to follow, it loses viewers half-way through, if not sooner.Basically, a *newspaper* reporter/kid follows a man after a woman obviously gives herself up to authorities. There's a long, detailed and not very interesting story behind why this woman would be held in custody, and you'll be reminded of thisrepeatedly. Oh, and if you wish to see this woman again in this feature  played by the great Susan Sarandon, watch another of her more memorable movies.The reasons of this man, an attorney (played by Robert Redford, who should know better,) being followed by the amateur reporter, will be revealed bit by bit. And sometimes he appears smart, at other times he slows down to tell the audience what's going on in the unnecessarily complex plot.The movie is so far over the place, and yet, seems like it was made by professionals. It certainly had a professional cast to guide the director.In the end, it was nicely shot, well acted, had some random but nice quotes and had promise, but sadly, fell so short with the mixed up and too tangled plot that it ruined everything else for the film it could've been. Maybe with another re-write or three, it could've been a great thriller.Skip it. Don't even bother trying to understand or follow it.
After the 2-minute excellent opening recapping the 1974 classic original, Texas Chainsaw immediately began its long list of many plot holes, problems, inconsistencies and struggles within its own story.Sad. After a fantastic remake, a very entertaining and brutal prequel, we fall back to the terrible threes: Texas Chainsaw Massacres chapters 2-4. Oh, well, Halloween also did that following the great Halloween: H20 with the Busta Rhymed-out Resurrection.It's also sad that I didn't take adequate notes during this to warn the public about the multiples of problems, namely with the timeline and the laugh-out-loud replenished family of new members when the movie attempted to show what happened following the 1974 attack.Did the writers (or the sleeping director) even try? Hell, I'd even give it to them if the movie was brutal like, say EVERY SINGLE ONE of the previous installments. That would've been a great excuse: "Well, we know we had script problems from the beginning, but look at all this imaginative gore!" Nope, that would be a lie for a movie that should've been barely PG-13 by today's standards.OK, so the plot revolves around an early 20s  that really should be in her late 30s  girl, who was raised (surprisingly) wonderfully by bad, backwards parents and she abruptly finds out she's adopted. So, off to Texas she goes with thee most bland group of friends  so blah, that they're not even the fun kinds from the Friday the 13th series where you cannot wait until they're picked off. There, in another hilariously bad plot hole, (try not to laugh when a police officer drops off an confidential box labeled as "Evidence" in front of a victim and then leaves the room) she learns she's had a better life with her adopted, backwoods parents than she would've in Texas.Someone told me about a carnival scene in which the film's killer kousin, Leatherface, runs amok. I thought, well, that's original, for this series, at least. When that scene came up, I thought: "Fantastic, the climax, finally." Um. No. Just as badly the scene was constructed and lazily thought out, we still had roughly 40 more miserable minutes left.It's not entirely obvious that this is a leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature. Nowadays, remakes, reboots, resomethings, can be bad, but sometimes, shockingly decent. So, there's always that chance they're going to do it right. I wish I could've just left my brain at the theatre's entrance, but there was absolutely nothing to hold onto. No inventive kills, no character not cut out of moldy cardboard, no one to root for, no meaningful or comprehensive plot and no real scares  aside from one tiny jump from me, but even that was seen coming from ten minutes earlier. Hell, they even put in the obligatory homophobic remark that might have fit the "townsfolk" lingo, but still puts hateful thoughts into viewer's minds.This mess of a movie is not necessarily dampening my view of 2013, but it certainly didn't make my New Year's intro film a positive one. Skip it!
Picture it: Tempe, Arizona, 2002. I first got my glimpse into the play version of Les Misérables with my partner at ASU, the only time I've ever been (and since) on that campus. Honestly, I liked the experience of going to such an acclaimed production, but aside from one song/scene, I really didn't like it.Nothing's changed, more than a decade later: I still love that one song and I disliked the rest of the film.Let's get that positive out of the way. On My Own was an incredible song even when it was sung by one of the third-tier and almost irrelevant characters who shows up abruptly and leaves just as suddenly. To this day, this song breaks my heart and yeah, there's a big reason why  not to be revealed here. Regardless, it's absolutely not worth putting yourself through the rest of the incredibly bad soundtrack Les Misérables presents.There. I said it. Les Misérables is a terrible musical and contains the worst music I've heard in any musical, with the exception, of course, of On My Own. And if you like this type of "music," great, because for far too long screen time, they just sing words, mostly overlapping with no rhythm.Oh, and while the story is moving, for a few moments of the 157 minutes, it just rambles on and jumps too many times to really get the feel of the characters. How many times can you say 8 years later without ever having anything interesting happening in between or these characters continue to live?Slave, or so they say because he's really a prisoner, nobody Jean Valjean is "released," sort of, for stealing bread, but when he breaks parole, he's is incredibly and unbelievably hunted by one policemanfor decades. (Sure, it was a different time, and yeah, in all eras people get obsessed, but c'mon now.)So, get past that, and join the time-spanning journey of a man who says he's just, but then steals from the only one who wants to help, but then turns good. While sort of saving one female, he makes it his mission to care for her youth when she passes, abruptly.Meanwhile, while Jack McGee is hunting this hulk'ing singer, a revolution happens and a boy out of nowhere is now Jean's son, sorta. And then when one character is shown true mercy  oh, I don't know for the fifteenth time, and finally gets it and learns to reciprocate, he decides it's best to take this life lessonimmediately to the grave. Huh?Yeah, I know the story, and yeah, I'm mocking it by not giving the true movie synopsis  I did see the movie (and play) after all, but as the days pass since I watched this story again, I've had a bad taste in my mouth since. Sure, the production values, sets and cinematography were well done, but the songs, story and pacing alldon't shoot...sucked!Okay, I'm in the minority on this one, but damn, people. Don't just follow the large posters because they show a little girl with messed up hair who only appears in the movie for an all-but split second. It's over-hyped and over-long. Skip it!
This movie was, indeed, fantastic. It's no wonder that BOTH Geena Davis (Thelma) and Susan Sarandon (Louise) got nominated for the Best Actress Oscar. Though it's unfortunate that both lose, in this special case, that's completely acceptable for two solid reasons: Jodie Foster, who won her second Oscar for The Silence of the Lambs rightfully won for the role of her life and that it would enormously hard to decide between the two ladies of Thelma & Louise  they were both EXCELLENT.I want to make something clear from before: this is NOT a chick-flick. And this is NOT Bonnie & Clyde. This is a movie of two going nowhere ladies who finally put their hair down for a weekend away  but run into an enormous series of unfortunate events. It's a story of justice, injustice, survival, redemption, saviors, trust, love, bonding and non-sexual life partners. In reference to the "Bonnie & Clyde" remarks I've heard attached to this movie, I have two words: Phooey! B&C planned things out..our T&L heroes reacted to their environment to survive, rarely (until the final quarter) were their "bad deeds" intentional or maliciously.Oh, and I've heard that this movie is a man-hating film filled with vengeful, dare I?, bitches. For that, I have four words: Go to hell. These girls were mistreated, viciously at times, by males, yes, but they did not seek out revenge on them  they wanted to be free of them. Free of pain, solitude, abandonment, rudeness and abuse  mentally, physically and sexually. They had NOTHING against all men, but if you put such redneck, back wooded, narrow/simple minded fellas in front of thembe somewhere else.Louise is neat and straight-laced. She's a waitress, which might seem dead-end, but she's thoroughly content. Thelma is high-strung, a child in a woman's body and trapped (settled) herself in a loveless and abusive marriage. Louise's plan is to get away for the weekend and take her BFF to a cabin to have some wild nights. Thelma, of course wants to go, but is worried about controlling husband Darryl (McDonald) saying no. Taking a chance  one that will change everyone's life, soon  she agrees and slips away while he's at work.Justifiably antsy  she practically forces prudish (with reason; sit back to watch the layers unravel and discover why) Louise to stop at a honky tonk. Unable to contain herself, even for seconds, Thelma overindulges in alcohol and becomes victim to a regular's, Harlan (Carhart), unwanted advances. In comes Louise to the rescue while stripping one layer on her current way of life.And that's all I'm revealing and that all takes place in the first, say 20 minutes with another 110 to go. Discover the magic all on your own. See the incredible depth of both Sarandon and Davis. I couldn't even begin to describe how well they preformed. Though I loved (for once  meaning, I have liked her a lot in the past, but here it was genuine love) Davis's performance, it was Sarandon that shot to the top of my favorite actresses at the time. If you could not feel her angst, if you could not see Louise was alive and aware and weary of the future and her mental breakdown of the walls she put up  youareblind.Each time I watch this movie, I pick up on something new. Perhaps, I did see it before  but it's always fun to experience such greatness for the first time, more than once  but in this viewing, there's a beautiful and dramatic scene of Louise standing alone in the dark desert surrounded by complete silence. The sun is rising. I have a feeling she wanted to see the sun rise for the final time as she felt she was tired, so tired. Not just of running, but maintaining the wall she built. Maybe she wanted to experience God's gift, but I'm going with my first theory.Did I mention beyond the wonderful depth of the characters  ones that will be etched in my mind with warm memories until I die  there was an excellent soundtrack (one I have listened to literally hundreds of times, and I really don't favor country at all) and a beautifully mournful score, suburb cinematography  even though I hate the desert, they made it magical, and it had a PERFECT blend of comedic tones mixed with serious moments. These types of moments, I've experienced myself. I've been through some extreme times in my life, and instead of blankly crying about it, which was hard to hold back, I had to make some loud joke and laugh until I did finally cry. There's a beautiful scene, where you think its set up for Thelma to joke/crack up and she laughs her ass off and mimics the gun sound (BANG!) that came from the weapon Louise used to kill a man, not so long prior. Louise doesn't find this funny one bit, in which Thelma agrees. It isn't. But what are you going to do? How are you going to handle it? These are scenes, some small and subtle, some larger, that are real life. Director Scott and the leads captured this with nothing less than perfection.Despite its minor and I mean very, very few, flaws, such as how quick the Keitel character both tracked them but kept up with them (believable in 2010, but I don't think so in 1991) and some over-the-top clichéd characters floating around  making it easy for our heroes to hate and disseminate, the greatness in this movie pushes it straight to the top of my rating board and directly into my top ten of all time films.Watch it. Experience it. Love it. Learn something about how films should be shot, how acting should be taught and perhaps, about yourself.
Despite the length, I really enjoyed the Grindhouse double feature, but I loved the first of two films, Planet Terror more. And best of all, were the faux-pas commercials; Thanksgiving and Don't were my favorite.Sure, the Machete preview was entertaining, and I was thinking back in 2007 that I wouldn't mind seeing a feature length version with one of my all-time favorite character-actors, Danny Trejo, but again, low-budget horror like Thanksgiving  a holiday they eerily haven't made a horror movie about, would've scared the blank out of me.But, I digress, they started (and unfortunately, probably finished) with Machete which is, as a whole, as entertaining as Robert Rodriguez's other Grindhouse feature, Planet Terror. So, if you liked those kinds of features, definitely see this one. Otherwise, you'll probably be completely turned off to the enormously, but funny, fake blood, bad albeit hilarious, dialogue, implausible actions, improbable sexual encounters and predictable outcomes. And you know what? That's all part of the charm and fun.Machete, (Trejo) the best of the best assassins, is courted to kill a Congressman (De Niro) but is, gasp!, betrayed and wanders around until he can solve the crime and possibly clear his name in the process, although that doesn't interest him. He's superhuman. He don't care about nobody!Superhuman is right. I lost count on how many times he dies in this movie. But when his brother the Padre (Marin) gets hung up, literally  close your eyes, Catholics, he's OUT FOR REVENGE.Let's throw in some lovely ladies to aid in his quest, Jessica Alba as Sartana and Michelle Rodriguez as Luz, some questionable ones, such as a fully nude Lindsey Lohan  at least she had a good reason for missing her court hearings. Also Don Johnson, as the eeeevil Sheriff and an out-of-character, for Steven Seagal, "BAD" guy Torrez all for good measure.On a side note, I live in Arizona, and publicity hound Sheriff Joe Arpaio, was questioned by the media  we have the absolute worst here, if the eeeevil Sheriff portrayed in the movie that actually shoots dead a pregnant illegal immigrant resembles himself in real life. After seeing it, it's truly apples/oranges, at least in my opinion. Personally, I can't stand the big-ego, big-talk Arpaio, but I can't see him, or just about anyone doing that. If they truly meant that his character mimicked Joey, then it was definitely done maliciously and there are far better ways to get your point across.At any rate, like I said, the movie on the whole is wildly entertaining and a lot of fun, especially on how fake everything looks, including how it was shot. The biggest problem, yes, aside from Lohan, is the movie tends to fall completely and utterly apart in the last third. The plot starts going in so many different directions, it's almost as if a completely separate movie started up when you were already used to Machete's tale.This might have been done intentionally, as a friend of mine pointed out, but I didn't feel that way. Planet Terror certainly did not  it stayed right on track to the exciting finale. Luckily, Machete did contain the same type of thrilling climax, not to say it got back on track; it just showed what audiences came for. More Camp, More Blood, More Boobs.Though it is sad how the movie crumbled just when it was getting good, as if they simply just ran out of ideas  it was based on a fake 2-minute preview, after all  but on a whole, it's wholeheartedly recommended. And nowonto Don't and Thanksgiving! Bring it!
I was definitely skeptical at first upon hearing the departure of Brosnan (and how they got rid of him), yet another reboot, a relatively unknown who didn't look like Bond and even at the title song that didn't match the movie's name (Yes, this isn't new, but the most recent entries, the ones I'm most familiar with had it.) Yet, that all changed when I saw 'Casino Royale' which is my absolute favorite Bond film.I did end up loving the title song (it's also my favorite Bond theme song), the score is one of my favorites  of any movie and Craig did an excellent job at portraying human, (emotional and unemotional,) spy and action hero.It also doesn't hurt that I love poker and even those scenes were exciting, though unrealistic. For example, it maybe one thing to work your opponent all-in with your trip Aces to his three Kings, but the final hand  can't give that away, but the odds of four great hands  all on the final hand dealt  was laughable to me. And ironically enough, most poker movies, aside from 'Rounders,' are a complete bore, so at least this one made it exciting.The only other flaw I could think of was the length; oh, how they could have cut 30 minutes out of this. (SEE: the train and rehabilitation scenes.) Nevertheless, to me, it had everything in, ah hem, spades: espionage, tons of action, beautiful cinematography (including extremely realistic CGI/green-screen, you didn't really think they were up on those cranes, did you?), dialogue, beautiful women, comedy, twists, cons and wonderful worldwide locales. I even loved the immediate and stylish B&W opening which shows some action, followed by the opening song/credits and boom: a thrilling chase scene  my favorite of the many great ones in the film.The movie starts with a bang, and quickly gets Bond his double-0 status. He's quickly establishes himself as worthy of the job and is on the trail of a terrorist banker.Though some might complain by comparing it to previous Bond films, I didn't at all. This is a REBOOT - i.e. a new start. If they just threw in the absent Q and his gadgets, a suped-up vehicle, Bond that flies to the moon or a villain with one golden shoe, it would be a sequel. I know why the rebooted it - the threat of how well made and how profitable the Bourne movies were. I don't necessarily compare them to this film as this is pure fantasy espionage, while Bourne was more grounded in reality.Final note: I'll say it again: this is my favorite Bond movie. And I thought Craig did an excellent job. I didn't grow up on Connery, Moore or even Lazenby. In fact, my first Bond was 'License to Kill' with Dalton, which I really liked at the time. It's hard for me to watch the other Bond movies now, because of two reasons: #1 They're so incredibly dated and #2 I saw all three 'Austin Powers' pictures before I saw my first Connery Bond movie. So, I couldn't help but laugh when I finally saw what Dr. Evil represented. My partner at the time was none too pleased with my laughing at the so-called serious Dr. Evil, er, Donald Pleasence's Blofeld.
I love it when filmmakers experiment. Christopher Nolan's been known to do that, and even though his biggest films have been the two recent Batman films  both are experiments of their own, his greatest achievements involve the wildly original Memento. Sliding Doors delved into uncharted territory for 1998 and beyond; not since then has a movie tackled such an interesting concept. Kudos to the writer/director Peter Howitt for creating such a refreshing and unique take on the romantic comedy.You have to ask yourself...what would've happen ifor what could've become ofwith a concept like this.Helen (Paltrow) leaves her aimless, writer boyfriend in the A.M. and heads to her P.R. job only to get "shacked." When she tries to enter the subway back home, one of two significant things happen that a little girl prevents: She gets on and finds both a new male, James (Hannah) and her old beau in bed with Basic Instinct's Jeanne Tripplehorn who plays the mistress, LydiaORshe misses the train and after a nasty spell, carries on with her life with her mischievous and user boyfriend.Brilliantly the movie takes us in two overlapping directions with two "Helen"s both of whom, thanks to the wonderful acting of Paltrow, you root for.Here's one aspect I actually didn't like, but didn't hinder my overall view of the film: the Helen that knows of the affair, cuts her hair short and blonde  a la another 1990s icon: Jane Mancini (Josie Bissett of Melrose Place), so that it's dumbed down enough for the audience to determine between that Helen and the original brown and long-haired Helen's story. It's as if they didn't have enough confidence in the audience that they would know where one story's going and the other's headed. I got it already. One Helen's melancholy, though pushing forward with the new James and the other's working multiple jobs due to losing her P.R. employment.Nevertheless and again, you'll watch each storyline unfold with overlapping scenes that were filmed exquisitely with ease, tension, suspense, romance and harboring a fantastic and absolute 1990s soundtrack. Wow, I used to love Aqua! Back to the story You'll follow Helen 1 and 2 on their parallel quests to meet up with fate. Will Helen 2 learn of her dead-beat boyfriend's infidelity? Will Helen 1 learn James is her soul mate? Will any of this make sense and what will we gain from it? I loved this movie. I loved the originality of it. I loved the acting  both Hannah and Paltrow were excellent. I loved the cinematography and the overlapping scenes.The movie's not 100% perfect  it starts to run out of steam with its own ideas, but the director was well enough aware to know when to cut his losses and finish off the movie. But, I challenge anyone to come up with another 5 movies that are as original as this or another favorite of mine, Memento. But a movie can't survive on a premise or gimmick alone; the movie must have the right writing and talent in front of the screen to pull it off. And this enormously romantic comedy hits all the angles.
Fine. I didn't hate 'Just Go With It' (3/10 Stars), I just didn't laugh. That much. I'll admit there's a few lines, as in 3, in TWO (too long) hours that I chuckled at. But sadly, this plot which was old enough to make the Bible look fresh, was so painfully obvious from the first 5 minutes, they didn't even hide the "spoiler" from the poster itself. They had THAT much faith in their project that they said, "Okay, we know you're not all that stupid, despite the fact you chose an Adam Sandler film for entertainment, so why don't we just get it all over with the poster." The movie was painful at times  Sandler playing his typical RICH Doofus only he went beyond slapstickish as being the worst doctor in movie history  but it was just a ruse to get the two real loves together. Obviously. Look, I would've appreciated it tenfold if the unpredicted wedding took place in the finale instead of what we all know what's coming. Oh, and lest we forget, despite Dr. Sandler having unfunny pokes with his assistant at patients, he's also an ass who uses, abuses and LIES to women for 20 years. Why, again, are we supposed to root for this guy? Even Jennifer Aniston knows this about him oh, wait, she's had experience in that field
(WARNINGThis is the Adult Disney Review Series. I have 51 Original Disney Cartoons to tackle, plus multiple  and forgettable  direct-to-Disney-Video misses. My goal in 2012 is to brave the task of watching all, many for the first time and commenting on eachall with an adult POV. Now, as soon as I can find an adult to do just thatDumbo had me at the start. For one, it followed the enormously long and BORING Fantasia and it stayed a quaint 64 minutes. Thanks, Disney! Also, it was cute, funny, enduring and simple. That last one is, in fact, appreciative, when it comes to what I conceive as the perfect Feature-Length Disney Animated film.You see, if you haven't seen it, the baby elephant Dumbo comes from the stork. Make that, all animals come from the stork  look, they only had about an hour of screen time and not enough to give sex-ed to the kiddies. Dumbo's Dropped in on his single mother and the circus train full of animals carries onto the next town. Only, there's a twist! Dumbo (originally named Jumbo Jr.) has big ears  large enough for the bitching bitches, i.e. fellow female elephants, to gossip & taunt the little fella.But, there's hope! Jiminy Cricket, er, I mean, Timothy Q. Mouse, befriends him, gives him confidence and showmanship! Soon, Dumbo will be the star.Oh, and I forgot, there's a sad and ruthless separation of mom-&-son. Thankfully, fame will buy that conclusion  oops, sorry, Spoiler Alert!The movie was cute, had some decent songs and heartfelt. In particular were the very touching scenes between mom and Dumbo. And that all said, it did have one bad scene that tore it down a full star: the drunk number.Out of left-field and pot-induced, which seems to be a trend of Disney's cartoons, the baby elephant and pal inadvertently get drunk and apparently hallucinate pink elephants and other weird scenes. It was so out-of-place and irrelevant, I was rather put off by it. And it went on and on. It was almost as if the writers didn't have enough faith in their work to write an entire  gulp  60 minute script. (Just an FYI: Alcohol, whether served to an adult or an infant, is NOT a hallucinogen.)Also, I understand the gossipin' gals in the group furthered the story along, but BOY, do I hate those bitches. In cartoons or in real life. They disgust me to the point of me turning away.Even thoughthey were part of my favorite scene in the movie: the Pyramid of Elephants and the eventual collapse. It was silly, fun, funny and actually kind of joyful to watch that.Best quote: "Dumbo, you're a climax!" Man, I wish I could be called that.Nowonto Bambi
Okay, maybe I was too harsh on Part 2 of the Leatherface films. I called it vile. Vile. A word I rarely describe a movie.Sure Part 2 was bad. Terrible, even. But Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre IIIisactually worse. Thankfully, they toned down the gore  yeah, not much, but more so  and yet, still just made a complete mess of a film. A lesson on how NOT to make a movie.There were enough plot holes in part two to fit six chainsaws through simultaneously; this has room for four more. Again, I made myself to finish through the end so I can report on this and hopefully make sure no one else has to endure such pain. (And on a side note, the characters in the film that do have such torture inflicted on themselves don't know half of the pain the audience has to endure.) In this "exciting" chapter we have multiple characters being haunted by the killer who was seriously killed in part 2. (Sure, no consistency, but neither is the whole movie.) Apparently with no rhyme or reason, he's with a new family of sadists who take hostage the female lead and put her at the head of the table at dinner like the other movies in this degrading sequel.Okay, number one: Thank GOD, Viggo Mortensen became a more established actor; he can ignore such a poor choice in performances. Number two: no one else has the excuse of actually acting their way out of a wet paper bag.This movie brings nothing new to the table. It contains awful acting, unoriginal dialogue and ideas, bland ideas and a title that suggests it contains more depth to a psychopath yet delivers no such character development. It's awful. It's just plain stupid. And as bad as Part 2 is, it makes that segment look like a Disney film comparatively speaking. Skip this movie. There is absolutely no reason to watch it.
You know, two of the best aspects of Disney's version of Beauty & the Beast, seemed small and insignificant to most, but have stuck with me since I saw this in 1991. #1 They freely admit that this is a "tale as old as time"  they're not hiding that fact and #2 they're also completely up front with stating "she's the one" to break the curse, i.e. they don't make us wait until the end (LIKE MOVIES DO ALL THE TIME) to reveal what we've known from minute one. I respect that.Those are just two things of, I dunno, 50 great things about this near-masterpiece of filmmaking. A beautiful score, fantastic and timeless songs, gorgeous cinematography, hilarious dialogue and "sidekicks" and secondary characters, a story very moving, strong leads, adventure, suspense, love, funthis movie is all of those plus so much more.Watching it (for the 20th+ time but) now in the usual-Disney "We Want Even More of Your Dollars" way, the re-release, of course in 3D, it still held up for me. My friend and I in the theatre were rocking back and forth with the wonderful musical segments while mouthing the words  trying desperately, albeit probably failing, not to disturb other movie-goers.I will say this, despite my 10/10 Star ratingthe movie did look 21 years old, unfortunately. Some of the background characters did not move while the foreground was in motion. This was, sadly, unintentionally humorous. That said, I am a huge supporter of hand-drawn animation, or, movies people put their heart, soul, sweat & tears in VS clicking the mouse. This was old-school animation and I am fine with that. I just think this was better served, in 2012, at home to appreciate.Sure, I love re-watching classics or even movies I just like a lot, on the silver screen, but this wasn't one of those. Anyone that knows me knows I do like 3D, but I have NOT seen a single Disney 3D movie that impressed me. Especially converted ones. The ONLY good 3D imagery here was the rain & snow, and I said the same thing about The Nightmare Before Christmas's re-release in 3D. Sad, there were a lot more 3D to choose from, but I ONLY liked the rain & snow which, to me, was the only 3D that had depth.So I will NOT recommend this to be seen in theatres. I will NOT go see another Disney Classic on the big screen converted to 3D and I am no longer upset I missed The Lion King's same 3D re-issue last year. I will, however see Finding Nemo's 3D re-release later this year for several reasons: I DO NOT consider that Disney, it's my favorite Pixar film  though I haven't seen it since the original release in 2003 and the less than 2 minute preview before Beauty & the Beast looked far better in 3D than ALL of Beauty & the Beast. (On a side note, it's absolutely easier to convert that  it was 100% digital and computerized.)Stick with this classic on BluRay. I just hope they put that fantastically hilarious Tangled Ever After short (shown before this movie in the theatre.) It was a lot of fun and had us cracking up.For the movie itself: 10/10 Stars. For the 3D conversion: 2/10 Stars.
My headline is a little misleading, The Secret of Numb, for I actually enjoyed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. For, it's a tremendous improvement over the kiddie movie the original was and on its own, it was adventurous and a tad bit more for the YOUNG adult set.And what a difference a year makes: the sets were more elaborate, the special effects thoroughly improved  namely the flying segments during the Quidditch match and they even toned down the five endings from the original to three. Albeit, they were rather long conclusions  I even checked the time when the first of three ended and realized there was still 25 minutes left. I sighed.So, we're still heading into pacing problems and an editor who never read his own job description. And yes, I know we're dealing with writers who want to appease the book club fans and jam every last plot twist, every single character of thousands into more than two and a half hours. Trust me, it's unnecessary.If you want everything from a book, there's an easy solution. READ IT. After reading the fantastic The Stand by Stephen King, I can understand a theatrical release of about two hours simply couldn't put it all in and I'm okay with that. A screenplay writer must read the source material and determine the most important areas to keep and dismiss, regardless of what the audience wants.I digress Even though this movie was, unfortunately, even longer than it's predecessor, it was a lot more fun. And contained a jaw-dropping scary and wonderful spider-attack scene. I'm a sucker for When Animals Attack films and the ones that scare me the most are the ones involving my real-life fears: spiders.But, for the target audience, or at least what the first one seemed to be aiming at, this had to go over their heads a bit. I'd love to count the plot twists and points and the multitude of unusual names and characters because they had to hit close to a hundred. Now, that said, the end all but had our heroes turn 4-D and explain everything in simple English to the viewers.After yet another long stretch of getting Harry back to wizard school following summer vacation, he mercifully uncovers the film's mystery fairly soon after (unlike the original's almost two hours to get to the point.) Even though it's been almost a decade since original release, I won't spoil it, but suffice to say, Harry & the Gang use their individual detective skills along with some sorcery to find out why the Hogwart's residents are being terrorized and/or frozen.When I saw this, again, almost a decade ago  the only time I've seen it, my first impression was of disgust. "It's a shot-by-shot remake!" I exclaimed to my partner at the time and I vowed never to see another Harry Potter film again. (I will, however, be breaking this rule later today with #3 in my venture down HP Lane)Today, I say: Eh, it did have a lot of the same elements and almost the same ending(s), but it certainly evolved as I hear the rest of the series does as well. If someone were to ask me where to start with Harry Potter and they've never seen any of them, I would  right now  say this one. There's zero reason to begin with #1 when this gives you all you need to know about the cast and settings rather abruptly and efficiently.It's not perfect and it's not a movie I will rush to any time soon, but thinking of it as a stand-alone young adult ticket, it's recommended.(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)
Damn. Damn shame. Steven Soderbergh USED to be my favorite director. But, after a string of mediocre films, leading up to this one,Haywire, I'm jumping ship.Actually, I did that with Contagion, but this was the nail in his coffin.I'm a fan of the Ocean's films  YES, even #12, though that ranks #3 of 3  but this one screamed too much Ocean's, minus the good dialogue, suspense, acting, chemistry, originality and fun. How it mirrored it was with a (now) annoying and overbearing score and fifty camera angles, color or not, of the same shot. It was a good gimmick at one time  fun, fresh and kept us going. Here, it was just plain irritating.But even Soderbergh was wishy-washy with if he wanted the whole movie like that  thank GOD he didn't, or just certain scenes.At any rate, for a minute number of scenes, the movie worked. And I'm only talking about the fairly decent and choreographed fight scenes involving our "heroine" Mallory (Carano.) She was fantastic and all the way through  her action scenes or, even, just posing, she made me think of her becoming a more serious Lara Croft in a reboot or in a (finally) Wonder Woman movie. It made me really smile when one character does, in fact, call her "Wonder Woman." I guess I'm not alone.Although I might as well have been since this mess of a movie made practically nothing. The movie was predictable as all hell, the conversations stunk, the acting subpar, the suspense:meh and worse of all  and I'm talking a deal-breaker for me ever seeing this again: it contained the most unbelievable and outrageously appalling scene between our super-spy Mallory and a civilian she car jacks and spills her adventures/secrets to.Think sixteen degrees below Jason Bourne and his civilian, Marie. EVEN with memory loss, at least Bourne truly acted like an agent of doom and Marie truly acted like a human in a unique and scary situation. On the flipside, we have this poor and useless of a character, Scott (Angarano), who somewhat acts scared when he's in the middle of death-duel between Mallory and a guy, Aaron (the ever cute-yet-stupid Channing Tatum) and then Scott gets car jacked. For about 1.5 seconds, these events concern him and then he joyfully cares for the stranger, listens to her and repeats back her story of her misadventures.The movie's so obvious, it needs not a synopsis, but suffice to say, super-spy Mallory is double crossed  oh, my! that's new!  and she spends the obligatory rest of the movie on the lam and hunting whodunit.Like I said, I DID enjoy the brief action sequences  Carano really did kick butt and looked great (for the most part) doing it. But it's that other 80% of the film that was just taxing and felt like a film student's attempt at an indie Bourne. SKIP IT.
Wow, what a spoiler the title of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was. I'm not into westerns, but strangely, when I do watch one, I generally like them. This one I didalbeit it was rather slow, VERY long and already gave away the ending in the title. Yeah, I'm assuming they assumed everyone and their great-great-great-grandparents knew the story, but it's untrue  the fact we all knew what happened. I didn't. In either case, it was entertaining, but not something I ever want to sit through again. Most notable was the performance of Casey Affleck even though Brad was still good, and the score and cinematography. Not my favorite western, not even in the top 5this, coming from someone who's seen maybe a dozen westerns in my life, so it's somewhere in the bottom 10 (of 12)but it's still worth a (as in one) viewing.
Though the nightmares continue (SEE: 2003's Freddy Vs. Jason, 2010's A Nightmare on Elm Street), Wes Craven's New Nightmare was the perfect conclusion to the older series, much like Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.Wildly original  before this movie was released, I had never seen such an original idea as this, especially in a horror series seven deep. In fact, though #4 remains my favorite of the series, this is certainly the most original since #1. You have to give Craven some kudos here; he's hit & miss, though mostly hit. And for him to return to his groundbreaking and innovative horror series for a part SEVEN, it takes balls.How's this for an idea for a movie: Let's acknowledge that there is, in fact, a horror movie called A Nightmare on Elm Street starring Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund and John Saxon, and that script idea was based on the director/creator Wes Craven's own real nightmares. Let's put these people in a film about that film and have them play themselves. Then, let's fast forward through 5 sequels and when the series is pretty much dead (no pun on the title of #6: Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare as it wasn't just the title that did it in, it was the extremely poor quality) until...Craven begins to have nightmares once again.Apparently he needs Heather's help in finishing off the story, once again. Heather Langenkamp's comfortable in her life: she loves her husband, son and hates violence. She's shy when it comes to the fame caused by Nightmare's #1 and #3 (which is the exact opposite for actor Robert Englund, apparently.) But, things have been a little shaky lately, beyond the obvious reasons: recent earthquakes.She's been having nightmares and her child, too. Make that everyone involved in the films have. But, things are coming true, like in the films she was in. And she's getting crank Freddy calls, annoying letters and her TV will not shut off, even with the power cord unplugged. In short, she's practically falling apart. It doesn't help that her boy likes to scream his head off every 4-5 shots of the film. (Actually, that can make any viewer, like me, crazy.) Heather must attempt to solve this mystery, and quickly as not only does the body count stack up, but people start to think she's crazy for thinking Freddy is really behind all the killings.Though the movie has its flaws (already mentioned one  that kid WAS ANNOYING and there were some implausible and inconsistencies in the plot) and it wasn't perfect by any means, but I really, really liked and admired this film, even beyond being a self-described Freddy Fan.I love the people playing themselves, especially Langenkamp, Englund, Saxon, Craven and Shaye. Heather Langenkamp finally acts  as much as I liked her in #1 and #3, her acting was kind of, well, weak. Here, despite her playing herself, she's natural on screen, believable, credible and someone to root for. As was Robert Englund  it was nice seeing how friendly he is, and a real person beyond the makeup. I've always been a fan of John Saxon, and again, it's great seeing him normal and keeping up a friendship with his on-screen daughter played by Langenkamp. And though Craven and Shaye are barely in it, I still liked their performances as well. (Honorable mentions, and as a said-Freddy Fan, including looking through the funeral crowd to find some of my favorite former stars of the series, including Tuesday Knight. Yes, I'm aware Depp wasn't there, but he did want to be, so that counts.) Also, keeping up with the New Nightmare plot line, Freddy (or the entity now known as "Freddy"  watch the movie to find out why) finally gets evil. (I'm sure the 2010 remake/reboot will contain the ultimate evil Freddy, but, to date, we haven't gotten that far.) He looks darker, acts more wicked and is more restrained in his comments  and you can tell, when he does say something, it's for his own amusement, not for the audience's for once. This is good writing here. Actually, I felt the entire movie was great writing and contained great homage to Craven's original  SEE: her hair and the gory scene between the babysitter and Heather's son.I don't judge a movie based on box office receipts, but I was saddened to see this one fail so miserably. Perhaps people just gave up on Freddy after #6 was so horrible. (#5 didn't do well either at the box office, so I guess it was inevitable.) But this movie sincerely made up for #5-6, much like what Halloween: H20 (part 7) did for the terrible string of sequels leading up to the worst Halloween sequel, #6.And finally, (spoiler, as if a lot of this hasn't been so far) since it's not really Freddy, I love the fact New Line kept to their word  Freddy Krueger really did die in #6: Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (hence the title) and Paramount did the same thing (Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter was the final as part 5 of the Jason Voorhees series was a different killer.) Of course, that argument's out the window with both Freddy Vs. Jason and Friday the 13th part VI: Jason Lives. Granted, in reality, I am only talking about Wes Craven's New Nightmare in 1994. It would be years until Freddy returned for Freddy Vs. Jason. (Wow, that was a mouthful, but hopefully I got my point across.) 1984's A Nightmare on Elm Street had a great premise and an original story. Wes Craven's New Nightmare took that five steps ahead. And that's a rarity in any genre. Highly recommended.
No, no, no, no, no, no, NO! The Room is not a black comedy as arrogant writer, star, distributor, producer and obviously blind director, Tommy Wiseau would want you to believe. Heck, it doesn't even have a single black person, much less anything but unintentional humor.Could The Room be absolutely the worst movie ever made in a World that gave us: Manos: The Hands of Fate? Eegah? Troll 2? Sharp Teeth? Shark Attack in the Mediterranean? Another Gay Sequel: Gays Gone Wild? A Sound of Thunder? Furry Vengeance? Boat Trip? Basic Instinct 2? Good Luck Chuck? Piranha Part Two: The Spawning? Glitter? Remember Me? Stan Helsing? Leonard: Part 6? Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation? All About Steve? Deathbed: The Bed That Eats? Pieces? Paranormal Activity? The Raspberry Reich? Curtains? Axe? Superman IV: The Quest for Peace? Batman & Robin? The Twilight series? Vampires Suck? Any Howling Sequel? Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines? Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan? Jennifer's Body? Plan 9 From Outer Space? 88 Minutes? Beyond a Reasonable Doubt? Lucky You? Jaws: The Revenge? 2012? Empire of the Ants? The Food of the Gods? Jurassic Park III? Halloween III: Season of the Witch? Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers? Halloween: Resurrection? Grown Ups? Year One? The Toxic Avenger? Either I Spit On Your Grave(s)? Blood Beach? The Last Airbender? The Happening? Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare? TV's Viva Laughlin? Saddam Hussein? Paris Hilton? Keanu Reeves?(Okay, those last four weren't movies, but damn you, World, for those.)Well, I had to ask myself: Is this really a movie? Is this a joke and I got the wrong "film" that people are talking about?Believe it or not, I had to consult with a professional critic and he actually confirmed that this is, in fact, a movie. And that he's seen it. And then I heard a gunshot and a loud thud. His poor, poor children.While he didn't actually die, you'll want to roughly 10 seconds into The Room. Die laughing, perhaps, at its amazing lack of direction and incredibly, there are two men fighting over the director credit: Wiseau (huh. WISEau?) and Sandy Schklair. Hmmm. Would you have fought with Pilate when he claimed to be the murderer of Jesus?In a "movie" (from here on out, that word will be very loosely associated with The Room) that even the dialogue sounds like it was dubbed à la Rumble in the Bronx, even though everyone's speaking English  if you can call it that, you'll quickly learn what NOT to do. Such as the ever so comical "shots" of San Francisco and the unfortunate Golden Gate Bridge which probably would've asked for a cut if this made more than a tenth of a penny.Recently I re-watched and reviewed the brilliant The Big Lebowski, and I stated towards the end that it should be actually studied in film school, if not already. I'll say the same here, but obviously at the other end of the spectrum.You almost feel sorry for the labeled "director" Wiseau, if not for his arrogance  SEE: poster for proof. Ironically, his follow-up was Homeless in America, and if America did have anything to do with it, he would be. But can you really be mad at the guy for this atrocity? Well, if he stayed in the background, and not in more than 75% of screen-time, you might feel some pity.And his writing? It's as if he was a stone-cold foreigner who watched a lot of American Sitcoms of the 1950s and used an English Translating Dictionary to produce the words spoken on screen. Sure, it's hilarious to hear him, or any of them speak, but it's also sad when someone who apparently isn't familiar with the language, culture or modest enough to hire someone to even take a 30-second peek at the screenplay. Personally, I wouldn't jump over to Paris and write a movie on the life and times of the natives using both a French for Dummies guide and my memory of French class in High School nearly two decades back. Is Paris is Burning already taken? Oh.The "movie" follows a confused blonde (duh) named Lisa (Danielle) who unsure of her pending nuptials to Johnny (Wiseau.) Who would be when you're about to marry the love child of Gérard Depardieu and Bob Dylan? Soshe sleeps around and shows the camera she's not ashamed of her (probably bought) breasts.That's pretty much the plot. Throw in some laugh-out-loud 15-second subplot of a boy, Denny (Haldiman) who both likes to watch and do daaaangerous narcotics and a mother who looks as confused as George W. Bush without a speech to read.The actors, unbelievably, took this seriously. I would show more compassion for them, but even with a $1,000,000 scholarship to the New York Film Academy, they'd still fail later on.I've been told this is a great midnight movie experience, i.e. the astonishingly superior The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Perhaps. But, even at 99 minutes, it drags and my laughter nearly died, from pure exhaustion, towards the end. Fortunately, the SURPRISE! ending brought me back up to laughing hard.That all said, wellthis entire review, I'd still recommend this "movie." How could you miss an opportunity like this? I seriously thought Troll 2 could never ever happen again. Improbably, lightning struck twice. First with a movie that's called Troll 2 that doesn't even involve trolls and now with The Room that's not even about one.
I see what they're doing here. B-movies are cheap and sometimes hit a Twitter feed to get them popular enough to make a profit. Sure worked better several months later for Sharknado than Big Ass Spider!And that's too bad. Obviously, Sharknado would be terrible. It was born that way. A movie about a giant spider attacking (the same city of LA as did the sharks in the tornado) would also be laughably bad had not the talent and comedic timing of former "HERO" Greg Grunberg.Granted, I am biased on Grunberg. Absolutely, I think he's hot, but I also recognize he's talented and cracks me up constantly. He didn't disappoint here.While not a roll-on-the-floor laughfest, Grunberg held the film together with his signature charisma and chemistry with a loyal security guard at his side. Despite the blatant racial stereotypes, the duo were absolutely hilarious together.Beyond them, and the always charming Ray Wise and Lin Shaye, the movie and it's "special effects" were pretty standard for the B-movie crowd or even the Syfy movie of the week.Should I even give a synopsis with this one? Small immigrant spider grows and grows and only Grunberg's exterminator and pal are LA's hope for survival.Big Ass Spider! mercifully delivered on the goods  Bmovie effects, giant monster and cheesy everything, but it is mostly recommended due to Grunberg and his one liners. Watch it for him with the backdropboth will make you laugh.* * * Final thoughts: Yeah, I have arachnophobia. But, like the fact that "ghost stories/movies" don't scare me, neither do horribly put together CGI spiders. I have to truly believe it could happen for me to be frightened. I guess this is a good thing here, because otherwise I would've been terrorized with this giant spider. Instead, I could just rely on Grunberg for entertainment value.
